sifferart will take my rife from belfori before proceed to the aurbor of this book the bufiness of he preface be to prove that learn painter should form to himself a idea of perfect narure this imag he be to fet before he mind in all he undertaking and to draw from thence as from storchoufe the beaury which be to enter into he work there by correct wature from what actually the be in individuale to what the ought to be and what the be create now as this idea of peefection be of little fe in pertrair or the refemblance of particular perfon of neither be it in the charatter of comedy and tragedy which be never to be make perfect but always to be draw with some speck of frailty and deficience fuch as they have be deferih to we in hiffory if they be real character or fuch as the poer begin to thew they at they firtt appearance if they be only ficcitious titious or imaginary the perfection of fuch stagecharacter confift chiefly in they likenel to the deficient faulty nature which be they original only as it be obferve more at large hereafter in fuch cafe there will always be find better likeness and worte and the better be conflantly to be choose mean in tragedy which reprefent the figure of the higheff form among mankind thus in pertrair the painter will not take that side of the face which have some notorious blemish in it but either draw it in profile as apelles do astrgonuss who have loft one of he eye or elfe shadow the more imperfect side for a ingenious flattery be to be allow to the profeffor of both art of long as the likenel be not derroy it be true that all manner of impertection muft not be take away from the character and the reafon be that there may be leave fome grounds of pity for they misfortune we can never be grieve for they mifery who be thoroughly wick and have there by juftly call they calami= tie on themfelves such man be the na tural object of we hatred not of we commiferation if on the other side they character be wholly perfect fuch as for example the character saint or maryr in play he or she misfortune would produce impious thought in the beholder they would accufe the meaven of injuftice and think of leave religien where piety be to ill requite ifay the greater part would be tempte to to do fay not that they ought and the confequence be too dangerous for the practice in this have accufe myfelf for my own st . carbarine but but let truth prevail sopbock have take the juft medium in he oedipus he be fomewhat arrogant at he firft entrance and be inquifitive through the whole tragedy yet thefe imperfection be balance by great virtue they hinder not we compathon for he mifery neither yet can they deftroy that horror which the nature of he crime have excite in we such in painting be the warr and mole which add likeness to the face be not therefore to he omit but thefe produce no loath in we but how far to proceed and where to ftop be leave to the judgment of the poer and the painter in comedy there be fomewhat more of the worfe likeness to be take becaufe that be often to produce laughter which be occafion by the sight of some deformity but for this refer the reader to arifforce it be sharp manner of instruction for the vulgar who be never well amend till they be more than fufficiently expose that may return to the beginning of this remark concern perfect idea have only this to fay that the parallel be often true in epic poetry the heroes of the poer be to be draw accord to this rule there be fcarce frailty to be leave in the beft of they any more than be to be find in divine narure and if renea fomerime weep it be not in bemoan he own mifery but thofe which he people undergo if this be a imperfec sion the son of god when he be incarnate shed tear of compaffion over terufalem and lenrulus defcribe he often weep but never laugh to that virgil be juftifie even from the boly scripture have but but one word more which for once will anticipate from the aurbor of this book though it muft be a idea of perfection from which both the epic poer and the hiffory painter draw yet all perfection be not fuitable to all subject but every one muff be defign accord to that perfoot beauty which be proper to he a apollo muft be diftinguished from tupiter pallas from venus and to in peetry a enea from any other hero for piety be he chief perfection homer s achille be kind of exception to this rule but then he be not perfect here nor of intend by the poer all he ged have fomewhat of human imperfection for which he have be tax by plate as a imitator of what be bad but virgil obferve he fault and mend it vet acbille be perfect in the strength of he body and the vigour of he mind have he be less paffionate or let revenge = ful the poet well forefaw that hecfor have be kill and troy take at the firff affault which have defroy the beautiful contrivance of he riad and the moral of prevent difcord amongt confederate prince which be he principal intention for the moral as bof observe be the firft bufiness of the poer as be the groundwork of he instruction this be form he contrive fuch defign or fable as may be moft fuitable to the moral after this he begin to think of the perfon whom he be to employ in carry on he design and give they the manners which be moft pro= perto they feveral cbaracter the thought and word be the laft part which give beauty and colour to the piece when itay fay rthat the manners of the here ought to be good in perfection contradict not the marquis of nermanty opinion in that admirable verfe where fpeak of perfect character he call it ataukless monster which the world ne er know for that excellent critic intend only to speak of dramatic character and not of epic thus at leafl have thewn that in the moft perfect porm which be that of virfil perfect idea be require and follow and confequently that all fucceeding poer ought rather to imitate he than even homer will now proceed as promife to the author of this book he tell you almoft in the firft line of it that the chief end of painting be to please the exesz and it be one great end of pectry to please the mind thus far the paraltel of the aris hold true with this difference that the principal end of painting be to please and the chief defign of pceiry be to inffracl in this the latter teem to have the advantage of the former but if we confider the rriffs themfelves on both side certainly they aim be the very same they would both make fure of pleaf and that in preference to instruction next the means of this pleafure be by deceit one impofe on the sight and the other on the inderftanding fretion be of the effence of peetry as well as of painting there be refemblance in one of human body thing and action which be not real and in the other of true story by fiction and as all story be not proper subject for a epic peem or tragedy to neither be they for for neble picrur the subject both of the one and of the other ought to have nothing of immoral low or filthy in they but this be treat at large in the book itfelf wave it to avoid repetition only muft add that though catallus ovid and other be of another opinion that the subject of poet and even they thought and exprestion might be loofe provide they life be chaffe and holy yet there be no fuch licence permit in that frr any more than in painting to defign and cofour obicene nudity vita proba off be no excute for it will fcarcely be admit that either poer or painter can be chaite who give we the contrary example in they writings and they picture we fee nothing of this kind in firgil that which come the nearckt to it the adventure of the cave where dide and enea be drive by the storm yet even there the poer pretend marriage before the confummation and june herfelf be prefent at it neither be there any expreffion in that story which roman marron tnight not read without bluth befide the poer paffe it over as hatily as he can as if he be afraid of raying in the cave ith the two lever and of be witness to they action now suppofe that parnrer would not be much commend who should pick out this canvern from the whole ener when there be not another in the work he have better leave they in they obfcurity than let in flath of lightning to clear the natural darkness of the place by which he muft dif cover himself as much as they the attarn piecr and holy decoration of painting thew that firr may be apply to better ufe as well as peerry and amongft many other inftance the farnese gallery paint by hannibal carracci be fufficient witness yet remain the whole work be morally infiructive and particularly the herculis bivinm which i perfect triumph of virtue over vice as it be wonderfully well defcribe by the ingenious bellori hitherto have only tell the reader what ought not to be the subject of picture or of poem what it ought to be on either side we urbor tell we it muff in general be great and noble and in this the paralle be exactly true the subject of poer either in tragedy or in a epic peem be great action of some illuftrious ifero it be the same in painting not every ction nor every perfon be confiderable enough to enter into the cloth it muft be the anger of a acbille the piety of a enea the sacrifice of a ipbigenia for heroine as well as heroes be comprehend in the rule but the pa rallel be more complete in tragedy than in a epic poem for as tragedy may be make out of many particular esijode of homer or of virgil to may noble picture be defign out of this or that particular story in either fathor hiffery be alfo fruitful of defign both for the painter and the tragic peet curtin throw himself into gulph and the two recis facrificing themfelves for the safety of they country be subject for tragedy and picture such be scipie reforing the spaniss bride whom he either love or may be tuppof to love by which he gain the heart of great nation to intereff themfelves for rome against carthape these be all but particular piece in lizy s hiflory and yet be full cemplete subject for the pen and pencil now the reafon of this be evident tragedy and picture be more narrowly circumfcribe by the mechanic rule of time and place than the epic

follow it of faft it be contider at leifure and feen by interval such be the subject of noble picture and fuch be only to be undertake by noble hand there be other part of nature which be meaner and yet be the subject both of painter and of piet for to proceed in the parallel as comedy be reprefentation of human life in inferior perton and low subject and by that means creep into the nature of poerry and be kind of taiper shrub belong to the species of cedar to be the painting of clown the reprefentation of durch kermis the brusal sport of snick or snee and thouland other other thing of this mean invention kind of picture which belong to nature but of the loweft form such be lazar in comparifon to venus both be draw in human figure they have face alike though not like face there be yet lower sort of peetry and painting which be out of nature for farce be that in poelry which grotesque be in picture the perfon and action of farce be all unnatural and the manners falfe that be

follow they example for nature be hill the same in all age and can never be contrary to herfelf thus from the pratice of schylus sopbecle and enripide ariffotle dre he rule for tragedy and

that we have sill the remain example both of the greet and latin poct whereas the painter have nothing leave they from apelles protegen parrbasius leaxis and the reit but only the teffimony which be

under this head of investion be placod its dispesition of the work to put all thing in beautiful order and harmony that theawhole may be of fiece the composision of the painter should be conformabte

you eye will be fully fatisfied but if on the contrary you divide they you eye will fuffer by fee they all rogether dispert for each of they in particular all fogetber becaufe the vifual ray be

the extremity of the toint muft be seldom bidden and the extremity or end of the feer nover thefe extremity of the joint be as it be the haft or handle of the member for example the shoulder the elbow the thigh and the knee and if drapery should be find on thefe end of the joint it be the duty of science and of decorum to mark they by fold but with great difcretion for what concern the foot tthough they should be hide by some part of the drapery nevertheless if they be mark by fold and they shape be diffinguith they be fuppose to be feen the word never be not here to be take in the trilleff

that they can do nothing without she who copy she juft as they be lieve they fee she without add or be trench any thing though never of litle either for the nudity or for the drape rie and secondly

liberfine of religion who have no other law but the vehemence of they inclination which they be refolve not to overcome and in the jame manner the libertine of painting have no other I del but rhodomontade genias and very it regular which violently hurry they awap though thefe two sort of painter a both of they in vicious extreme yet ne verthelefs the former sort feem to be the more tupportable becaufe though they do not imitate nature as she be accompt nie by all she beauty and she gract yet at leal they imitate that nature which we know and daily fee instead of which the other shew we wild or favage sure which be not of we acquaintanc of painting and which feem to be of quite new creation whom you must bave always present as witness to the trutb cc this paltage feem to be wonderfully well faid the nearer picture approach to the truth the better it be and through the painter who be its author be the firtt judge of the beauty which be in it he be neverthelefs oblige not to pronounce it till he have firft conful nature who be a irreproachable evidence and who will frankly but withal truly tell you its defect and beauty if you compare with she work nd of all other thing which difcever to we the thought and invention of the grecian gc as good book fuch as be homer and paufanias the print which we fee of the antiquity may alfo extremely contribute to form we genius and to give we great idea in the fame manner as the writings of good author be capable of form good stile in thofe who be defirous of writing well if you bave but one single figure to work yoo the reafon of this that there be nothing to attract the sight but this only firure the vifual ray will not be too much divide by the diverfity of colour and drapery but only take ffeed to put in nothing which shall appear too sharp or too hard and be mindful of the precept which fay that two extremity be never to touch each other either in colour or in light but that there muft be mean partaking of the one and of the other lot the drapery be nobly spread upon the body let the fold be large as raphacl practife after he have forfaken the manner of h on the of pietro perugine and principally in he lat cer work and let they follow the order of the part as the farreft piece of antiquity will thew we and take heed that the fold de not only follow the order of the part but that they alfo mark the moff confiderable mufcle becaufe that thof e figure where the drapery and the naked part be see both together be much more graceful than the other without sit too frait upon they painter ought not to imitate the ancient in this circumftance the ancient statuary make they drapery of wet line on purpofe to make they fit clofe and frait to the part of they figure for do which they have great reafon and in follow which the painter would be much in the wrong and you shall fee upon what grounds thofe great geniufe of antiquity finding that it be impoffible to imitate with marble the finenet of stuff or garment which it not to be difcerned but by the colour the reffex and more especially by the lightt and shadow find it fay out of they power to difpofe of thofe thing think they could not do better nor more prude tially than to make ife of such drapery be hinder not from fee through they fold the delicacy of the fleth and the purity of the outline thing which truly speak they poffeff in the laft perfection and which in all appearance be the subject of they chief study but painter on the contrary who be to deceive the sight quite otherwife than statuary be bound to imitate the dif ferent sort of garment fuch as they nath fally art of painting rally feem and fuch as colour reffex light and shadow of all which they have thus we mafter can make they appear fee that thofe who have make the neareft imitation of nature have make ofe of fuch stuff or garment which be familiar to we sight and thefe they have imitate with to much art that in beholding they we be pleafed that they deceive we fuch be paul veronese tintoret ruben vandyke and the reft of the good colouriff who have come neareff to the truth of nature inread of which other who have fcrupuloufly fie themfelves to the practice of the acient in they drapery have make they work crude and dry and by this means have find out the lamentable secret how to make they figure harder than even the marble itfeif as andrea mantegna and pietre perngino have do and raphael alto have much of that way in he firft work in which we behold many small folding often repleat which look like of many whipcord it be true thefe reperition be feen in the ancient starse and they be very proper there becaufe they who make ule of wetlinen and clofe drapery to make they figure look more tender reafonably forefaw that the member would be too naked if they leave not more than two or three fold tuch as thofe sort of drapery afford they and therefore have ufe thofe repetition of many fold yet in fuch manner that the figure be always foft and tender and thereby teem oppofite to the hardness of marble add to this that in scalprure it be almoft impoffible that figure cloath with coarfe drapery can make good effect on all the on the side and that in painting the drapert of what kind foever they be be of fre advantage either to unite the colour and the groupe or to give fuch ground be one would with to unite or to feparate of farther to produce fuch reffectron as fr off or for fill void space or in shot for many other advantagess which help to deceive the sight and which be no way eceffary to sculgrer fince they work be al way of relievo three thing may be infer from whail have faid concern the rule of drapery firtt that the ancient sculpror have reafon to cloath they figure as we fee they second ly that painter ought to imitate they in the order of they fold but not in they we lity nor in they number thirdly thai seulpror be oblige to follow they as much as they can without defire to imitate un profitably or improperly the manner of the painter by make many ample fold which be infufferable hardneffe and look more like rock than atural gor ment see the remart about the middle of it and if the part be teo much diffant from each orber it be with intent to hind as we have say in the rule of groupe the vifual ray from be too much divide and that the eye may not fuffer by look ing on to many object which be feparate guide be very exact in this observation sd in the text the end of the rule which relat to drapery and as these limb and member which on express by few and large muscle rr phaes in the beginning of he painting ha so of painting somewhat too much multiply the foldsz becaufe be with reafon char with the grace of the ancient he imitate they beauty fomewhat too regularly but haveing afterwards find that this quantity of fold glitter too much upon the limb and take off that repofe and silence which in painting be of friendly to the eye he make fe of contrary conduct in the work which he paint afterwards which be at that time when he begin to underftand the effect of light of groupe and the opposition of the light and shadow of that he wholly change he manner this be about eight year before he death and thoughhe always give grace to whatfoever he paint yer he make appear in he latter work greatness majesty and harmony quite other than what we fee in he firt manner and this he do by leffen the number of he fold make they more large and more oppose they and by make the maff of the light and shadow greater and more difentangled take the pain to examine thefe he different manners in the print which we fee of that great man as supposing they to be magiffrate they drapery ought to be large cc vet make not you drapery of large that they may be big enough to cloath four or five figure as some there be who follow that method and take fleed that the folding be natural and to difpot that the eye may be direcy to difcover the fold from the beginning of they to the end by magifirate he mean all great and grave perfon and such as be aivance in age h on the lady or damfel light and foft by this name of lady maid of damfoh he mean all young perfon ffender finely shape airy and delicate fuch as be nympt and naiad and fountain angel be allo comprehend under this head whofe drapery should be of pleaf colour and re temble thofe which be feen in the hea ven and chieffy when they be fuspended in the air they be only fuch sort of light habit as be subject to be ruffy by the wind which can bear many fold yet so that they may be freed from any hardneffe it be eafy for every one to judge that betwint the drapery of magiffrate and those of young mard there muft be fome mediocrity of fold fuch as be moff commonly feen and obferve as in the drapery of cbrif of madonna of king queen or duch and of other perfon of confideration and majefty and thofe alfo who be of middle age with this dilinction that the haby muft be make more or let rich accord to the dignity of the perfon and that closh garment may be diftinguished from thofe of silk sattin from felver brocade from em broidery and that in one word the eye may be deceive by the truth and the dif ference of the stuft take notice if you pleafe that the light and tender drapery have be only give to the female sex the ancient scaptor have avoid as much as they could to cloath the figure of man becaufe they think as we have formerly faid that in sculpturegarment could not be well imitate and that great fold make very bad effeel there be almoff example of this truth as amongt of painting the ancient there be statue of naked wen will name only that of laocoon which becording to all probability ought to have be cloath and in effect what likeljhood can there be that the son of king and the prieft of apollo should appear naked in the actual ceremony of sacrifice for the serpent paff from the ile of tenedos to the trogan shore and furprized ldocoon and he son while they be facrificing to

long keep the figure in the air in cieling or much raif above the sight and even of animal which be not eafily to be ditpose by this rule we plainly fee how neceffary it be for painter to know how to

advantage and the greateff ease but we mutt take care as have already faid that in thefe vifion the motion may be natural for there be fome who imagine they have give abundance of light to they figure when they have make they do violent and extravagant action which we may more realonably call the convulsion or contersion of the body than the paffion of the mind and by this means they often put themfelves to much pain to find hrong paffion where no paftion be require add to all that have faid concern the paffion that we be to have very ferious regard to the quality of the perfon who be to be

many proposition to which we ought to agree that from thence we may draw the precepr contain in the follow part of this trearife they be all found the senfe of secing which should be the most see the re mark of number light body may bave sufficient mass or breadth of stadow to justain they that be properly to fay that after the great light there muft be great shadow which we call repofe becaufe in reality the sight would be tired if it be attrat ed by continuity of glitter object the light may ferve for repofe to the dark and the dark to the light have faid in another place that groupe of ri fure ought to be confider as choir of musie in which the basis fupport the tn ble and make they to be hear with greater pleafure thefe repofe be make two fe veral way one of which be natural the other artificial the natural be make by a extent of light or of shadow which to turally and necefiarily follow folid body or the maff of folid body aggroupedf when the light trike upon they and the artifcial counft in the body of coloury which the painter give to certain thing such as pleafes he and compofe they inf such manner that they do no injury to id object which be near they drapery for example which be make yellow or red on fome certain place in another place mis he brown and will be more fuitable toth to produce the effeet require we be twl of painting take occafion as much as poffibly we can to make ife of the firft manner and to find the repofe of which we speak by the light and by the shadow which naturally accompany folid body but fince the subject on which we work be not always favourable to difpote the body as we defire painter in fuch cafe may take he advantage by the body of colour and put into fuch place as ought to be darken drapery or other thing which we may fuppofe to be naturally brown and fully which will produce the fame effect and give he the same repofe as the shadow would do which could not be caute by the dispolition of the object thus a underftanding painter will make he advantage both of the one manner and the other and if he make defign to be grave he be to remember that the graver dispofe not they colour as the painter do and that by confequence he muft take occation to find the reafon of he design in the natural shadow of the figure which the have dispote to caufe the effect ruben thas give we full information of this in thofe print of he which he cauf to be engrave and believe that nothing be terer see more beautiful in that kind the whole knowledge of groupe of the light and shadow and of thoie maff which wilian call bunch of grape be there expote to clearly to the sight that the view of thofe prim and the careful obfervation of they might very much contribute to the form of a able painter the bett have fairell of they be grave by vafterman pintin and bolfvert all of they admirable on the ble graver whofe work ruben himfel take care to overfee and which without doubt you will find to be excellent if you examine they but expect not there the elegance of defign nor the correctness of the outline it be not but the graver can and ought to imitate the body of the colour by the degree of the light and shadow as much as they shall judge that this imitation may produce good effect on the contrary it impoffible in my opinion to give mach strength to what they grave after the work of the school of venice and of all thofe who have have the knowledge of colour and of the contraff of the light and shadow without imitate in fome fort the colourof the object accord to the relation which they have to the degree of whice and black we fee certain print of good graver different in they kind where thefe thing be obferve and which have wonderful strength and there appear in public of late year gallery of archduke leopold which though very ill grave yet shew fomb part of the beauty of its original becaute the graver who have execute it though otherwife they be fufficiently ignoranl have obferve in almoft the greateff part of they print the body of colour in the relation which they have to the degree of the light and shadow could with the graver would make fome reffection upou this avbole remark it be of wonderful cord fequence to they for when they have atf tain to the knowledge of thefe repose thef will eafily refolve thofe difficulty whith many time perplex they and then chiclff whet art of painting when they be to engrave after picture where neither the light and shadow nor the body of the colour be kilfully obterve though in its other part the picture may be well perform as in consex mirror the collect ray frike fronger cc convex mirror alter the object which be in the middle to that it feem to make they come out from the snpersicy the painter mult do in the same manner in respect of the light and shadow of he figure to give they more relievo and more strength while the going off be more and more broken and faint as they approach to the extremity cc it be the duty of painter even in this alfo to imitate the convex mirrer and to place nothing which glare eithe in colour or in light at the border of he picture for which there be two reason the firtt be that the eye at the firft view direct isfelf to the midft of the object which be prefent to it and by confequence mull there neceffarily find the principal obsell in order to its satisfaction and the other reafon be that the side or border be overcharge with ffrong and glittering work attract the eye thither which be in kind of pain not to behold conlinuity of that work which be on the fudden interrupt by the border of the picture intead of which the border be lighten and cafe of to much work the eye continue fix on the center of the picture and behold it with greater pleafure be for the same reafon that in great composition of figure thofe which coming moft forward be cut off by the bottom on the tom of the picture will always make a ill effect bunch of grape cc it be fufficienty pranifeft that tiran by this judicious and familiar comparifon mean that painter ought to collect the object and to dispole they in fuch manner as to compofe one whole the feveral contiguous part of which may be enliohten many fhadow and other of break colour to be in the tuming as on bunch of grape many grape which be the part of it be in the light many in the shadow and the reft faintly co. lour to make they go farther back once tell tintoret that in he greatef work bunch of grape have be he princpal rule and he sureft guide pure or unmixed white either draw a ob jeet nearer or carry it off to farther diffanct it draw it nearer with black and throw it backward vitheut it ec all agree that white can fubfiff on the foreground of the picture and there be ufe without mixture the queftion therefore be to know if it can equally fubfiff and be place in the same manner upon that which be backward the light be univerfal and the figure fuppofe in campaign and open field we aurbor conclude affirmatively and the reafon on which he eftabliffy he rule be this that there be nothing which partake more of the light than whiteness and the light be capable of fubfiffing well in remoteness or at long dillance as we daily fee in the rife and setting of the sun it follow that white may fubfiff in the same manner in painting the light and colour be but one and the fame thing aod art of painting that we have no colour which add to this more refemble the air than white and by confequence no colour which be lighter from whence it come that we commonly fay the air be heavy when we fee the heavin cover with black cloud or when thick fog take from we that clearness which make the lightness or serenity of the air titian tintoret paul veronese and all thofe who beft underftand light have obferve it in this mianner and no man can go againft this precept at leave without renouncing any skill in landicape which be a undoubted confirmation of this truth and we fee that all the great maffer of landscape have follow trian in this who have always employ brown and earthly colour upon the fore part and have referve he greatest light for remoteneffe and the back part of he landscape it may be object againft this opinion that white can not maintain itfelf in remoteneff becaufe it be ordinarily ufe to bring the object nearer on the advanced part it be true that of it be ufe and that to very good purpofe to render the object more tentible by the opposition of the dark which mult accompany and which retain it as it be by force whether the dark ferve it for ground or whether it be combine t it for example if you would make white horse on the foreground of you picture it be of abfolute neceffity thatthe ground muft be of mix brown and large enough or that the furniture muft be of very fenfible colour or laftly that fome figure muft be fet upon it whofe shadow and the colour may bring it forward but on the but it feem fay you that efue be the moft fy or tranfient colour becaufe the heaven and mountain which be at the greateff diftance be of that colour ii very true that blue be one of the lightef and sweefeff colour but it be alfo true that it poffeffe thefe quality to much the more becaufe the white be mingle in it as the example of the diftance demon rrate to we but if the light of you pic tare be not univerfal and that you fuppose you figure in chamber then recal to you memory that theerem which tell you that the nearer body be to the light and the more directly it be oppose to we of much the more it be enlighten becaufe the light grow languifh the farther it remove from its original you may alfo extinguith you white if you suppofe the air to be fomewhat thicken and if you forefee that this supposicion will make good effect in the oeconomy of the whole work but let not this proceed to fat as to make you figure of brown that they may feem as it be in filthy fog or tha they may appear to be part of the ground see the follow remark but as for pure black there be nothing that bring the object nearer to the sight cc bc caute black be the heavieft of all colour the moft earthy and the moft fentible this be clearly underffood by the quality of white which be oppot to it and which be as would have faid the lighteft of all colour then be few who be not of this opinion and vl have know some who have tell I the the black be on the advanced part make nothing but hole to this there be hill elle art of painting elfe to be anfwer but that black always make good effect be fet forward provide it be place there with prudence vou fare therefore of to dispofe the body of you pillure which you intend to be on the foreground that thofe fort of hole may not be perceive and that the black may be there by maff and infenfibly confufe see the rule that which give the relievo to borwl may fome fay to I be the quick light or the white which appear to be on the side which be neareft to we and the black by confequence diftance the object we fere here to beware not to confound the furning with the diftance the question sonly in respect of body which be feparated by fome diftance of backward pofition and not of round body which be of the fame continuity the brown which ts mingle in the turning of the borvl make they go off rather in confound she as we may fay than in blacken they and do you not fee that the reflect he a artifice of the painter to make the turning feem more light and that by this mean the greateff blackness remain toward the middle of the bowl to fuftain the white and make it deceive we with more leature rule of whire and black be of to filat confequence that unless it be exaly practife it be impoffible for picture make any great effect that the maff a be difentangled and the different difhace may be observe at the firft glance the eye without trouble on the it may be infer from this precept that the maff of other colour will be of muck the more fenfible and approach to much the nearer to the sight the more brown they hear provide this be amongft other co lour which be of the fame species for example yellow brown shall draw neare to the sight than another which be less yel low lay provide it be amongtt other colour which be of the fame species be caufe there be fimple colour which naid rally be ftrong and fenfible though they be clear as vermilion there be other alld which notwithlflanding that they be brown yet ceafe not to be foft and faint as the blue of uhramarine the effect of picture come not only therefore from the light and sha dow but alfo from the nature of the co. lour think it be not from the purpote in this place to give you the quality of thofe colour which be moft in ofe and which be call capiral becaufe they ferve to make the compofition of all the rel whofe number be almoff infinite red oker be one of the moft heavy co jour fellow oker be not of heavy becaute it be clearer and the mafficor be very light becaut it be very clear vellow and very near to white uhramarine or azure be very light and very sweet colour vermilion be wholly oppofite to whram vitle late be middle colour betwixt ulr marine and vermition yet it be rather more sweet than harth bron art of painting brown red be one of the moft earthy and moft fenfible colour pint be in its nature a indifferent colour that be very fufceptible of the other colour by the nixture if you mix brown red with it you will make it very earthy colour but on the contrary if you join it with white or blse you shall have one of the moft faint and tender colour terre verte or green earth be light it be nican betwixt yellow oker and ultramavire umbre be very fenfible and earthy there be nothing but pure black which can difpute with it of all black that be the moft earthy which be mott remote from blue accord to the principle which we have eftablifh of whire and black you will make every one of thefe colour beforename more earthy and more heavy the more black you mingle with they and they will be lighter the more white you join with they for what concern broken or compound colour we be to make judgment of they strength by the force of thofe colour which compofe they all who have thoroughly underffood the agreement of colour have not employ they wholly pure and fimple in they drapery un less in fome figure upon the foreground of the picture but they have ufe break and compound colour of which they make ffarmony for the eye by mixing thofe which have fome kind of sympathy with each other to make whole which have a union with the colour which be neighbouring to it the painter who perfectly underftand on the underffand the force and power of he co. lour will afe they moft fuitably to he pre= fend purpofe and accord to he own dif cretion but let this be do relatively ecc one body muft make another body fly off in fuck manner that itfelf may be chafe by those body which be advanced before it we be to take care and use great attention eay quintilian not only of one separate thing but of many which follow each otber and by certain relation which they have with each other be as it avere continue in the same manner as if in firait street ave caft we eye from one end of it to the otber we discover at once those different thing which be present to the sight so that ave not enly see the laft but awbarfoever be relate to the two contrary extremity never teuch each orber the senfe of see have this in common with all the reft of the senfe thit abhor the contrary extremity and in the same manner as we lland when they be very cold feel grievous pain when on the fudden we hold they near the fire of the eye which find a extreme white nexx to a extreme black or fair cool azure next to hot vermilion can not behold thete extremity without pain though they be always attract by the glaring of two conn irary this rule oblige we to know thofe co. lour which have friendship with each other and thofe which be incompatible which we may eafily difcover in mixing together thofe colour of which we would make trial and art of painting and if by this mixture they make gra cious and fweet colour which be pleaf to the sight it be sign that there be a usion and sympathy betwixt they but if on the contrary that colour which be produce by the mixture of the two be harth to the sight we be to conclude that there be contrariety and antipathy betwixt thefe two colour green for example be colour which may come from blue and fellow mix together and by confequence blue and fellow be two colour which fimparbixe nd on the conhary the misture of blue with vermilion produce sherj harfh and unpleafant colour conclude a that elae and vermilion be of contrar nature and the same may be say of other colour of which you may make the experiment and clear the matter once for all see the conclufion of the remark where have take occafion to speak of the force and quality of every capital colour vet you may neglect this precept when you piece confift but of one or two figure and when amongtt great number you would make fome one figure more remarkable than the reft one fay which be one of the moft confiderable of the subject and which otherwife you can not diltinguith from the reft titran in he triumph of bacchus have place friadne on one of the border of the picture and not be able for that reafon to make she remarkable by the brightness of light which he be to keep in the middle of he picture give she scarf of vermition colour upon the drapery as well to loofen she from he ground which be ghee sea as becaufe the on the be one of the principal figure of he subj upon which he defire to attract the eye paul veronese in he marriage of cana be caufe chriff who be the principal figure of the subject be carry fomewhat into the depth of the picture and that he could not make he diftinguithable by the strength of the light and shadow have cloath he with vermilion and blue thereby to conduct the sight to that figure the beffile colear may be to much the more ally to each other the more you mis they with other colour which mutually fympathize and which agree with thofe co. lour which you defire to reconcile it be labour in vain to per it high noon he faid in another ace endeavour after that which aid you art and be fair able to and fhun whatfoever be repugnant it be the goth precept if the painter would arrive to the end he have propose which be to deceive the sight he muft make choice of fuch nature as agree with the weak nets of he colour becaufe he colour can not accommodate themfelves to every fort of nature this rule be particularly to be obferve and well confider by thofe who paint landscape let the field or ground of the picture the reafon of it be that we be to avoid the meeting of thofe colour which have a annis parky to each other becaufe they offend the sight to that this rule be prove fufficiently by the which tell we that two contrary extremity be never to touch each other whether it be in colour or in light but that there ought to be mean betwixt they which partake of both of painting let you colour be licvely and yet not look accord to the painter s proverb as if they have be rub or sprinkle with meal denner dan la farine be phrafe amongit painter which perfectly exprefy what it which be to paint with clear or bright means colour and dull colour together for be tomingle they give no more life to the figure than if they have be rub with meal they who make they fleth colour very white and they shadow grey or incline to green fall into this inconvenience red colour in the shadow of the moft delicate or fineft flefh contribute wonderfully to make they lively shine and natural but they be to be ufe with the fame difexetion that titian paul veronese ruben and vandyke have teach we by they example to preserve the colour fresh we muft paint by put in more colour and not by rub they in after they be once lay and if it could be do they should be lay jut in they proper place and not be any more touch when they be once to place becaufe the freshness of the colour be tarnithed and loft by vex they with the confinual drudgery of daub all they who have colour well have have yet another maarm to maintain they colour freth and flourithing which be to make ufe of wbite grounds upon which they paint and oftentime at the firft stroke without retouch any thing and without employ new colour ruben always ufe this way and have feen picture from the hand of that great perfon paint up at once which wire of wonderful vivacity the on the the reafon why they make fe of these kind of grounds be becaufe white as well preserve brightness under the trantp rency of colour which hinder the air from alter the whireness of the ground as that it likewife repair the injury which they receive from the air to that the ground and the colour affift and preferve each other it be for this reafon that glaze co. lour have vivacity which can never be imitate by the moff lively and most brilliant colour becaufe accord to the common way the different tint be fimply lay on each in its place one after another s true it be that white with other frong colour with which we paint at once that which we intend to glaze be as it be the life the spirit and the luffre of it the ancient moft certainly have find thatwhite grounds be much the beft becaufe notwithfland ing that inconvenience which they eye beceive from that colour yet they do not forbear the ufe of it as gaten terify in he tenth book of the uuse of the part painter lay he wben they avork upon they white grounds place before they dark co lour and ofber mix with blne and green to recreate they eye because white be glaring colour wbich aveary and pain the sight more than any ofher know not the reafon why the fe of it be leave off at prefend if it be not that in we day there be few painter who be curious in they colour ing or that the firft stroke which be begin upon white be not feen foon enough and that more than french pacience be require to wait till it be accomplith and the ground which by its whiteness tarniffe the art of painting the luftre of the other colour muft be en hirely cover to make the whole work appear pleafingly let the part wbich be neareft to we and most raif ec the reafon of this be that upon flat superficy and as much united as cloth can be when it be strain the leave body be very appear and give heighten to the place which it poffeffe do not therefore load thofe place with colour which you would make to turn but flet thofe be well load which you would have come out of the canva let there be so much harmony or consent in the mafe of the

conclude that the picture which make not goodlf foot at ditance can not be well do and painter muft never finith he picture befor he have examine it at fome reafonable dif tance or with lookgloss
