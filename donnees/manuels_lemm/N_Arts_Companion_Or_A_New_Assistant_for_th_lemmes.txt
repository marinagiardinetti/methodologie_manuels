oblige to I and in¬ stead of complain ought to thank Ithe ettud of learn to draw in perspective yc chap which will prove of great use to all de¬ signer when observe the fault daily commit in the design of landscape or draw view and prospect imore and more find and avoid such error for understanding that art will render any one capable of draw any thing with ma¬ so many mis but conceive that the reason why stake be commonly make in drawing proceed from the apprehension that some have of the length of time it will take up to render themselves master of perspective and from be frightned at the difficulty they conceive be in that study particularly imagine that one must be first well grounded in the mathematick this part this know have discourage many from engage in the rule relate to this art but for they sake under¬ take in this tract to instruct they in the follow lesson how to lay any plan in perspective and raise pillar or building to due height accord to they distance lesson of the plan fig suppose we have square piece of pavement as in figure consist of piece of marble each foot square it must be measure exactly and lay regularly dewn upon paper you may likewise for you better observation mark every other stone or marble black which will better inform you how every particular square will appear when we have true perspective view of they or else you may number every one and when the follow lesion be do number those in the perspective plan with the samefigure as be mark on the fist plan lesson of lay figure in perspective it be to be understand in perspective that there be two point so be co . sider theifirst we caal the point of sight sight that be what relate to every thing in we view from the place where we stand and it matter little where we stand to take we view for the perspective will still be true accord to the appearance of the plan to we bye lf we stand at corner or in the middie or at any point the method shall prescribe presently will lay we plan justly before we as it will appeac the other point be call the point of distance because it govern the distance and the proportion of every thing we can truly see of the plan in whatever position we happen to be at you see the plan of figure this be divide into square as mention in that figure the three at the bottom mark in both and the square in the plan mark be those which be mark in perspective with the same number now to lay you plan in perspective fix you point of sight as you observe in the figure or more or less to the right or leave as you think proper then draw the line parallel to and at what distance you will from the line then raise line on each side from tok to form the figure you see as frame to you picture then draw line from the corner which be the point of distance to and this line will regulate you work then draw line from the square of you plan to the point of sight as exactly as possible and wherever you line ofdistanoe cut those line which be draw from the square of you plan to the point of sight that matk where you square in perspective ought to be then draw line parallel to the line where the line of distance cut and that will give you the true figure ofevery square so in the perspective plan answer to in the measure plan and answer to the other in the same when you have do this the next rule you be to know be how to raise either pillar tree house or any other body accord to they respective height at different distance and proportion on the plan you have lay down lesson iii how to raise pillar or any body of certain proportion in perspective you have now you plan measure out in perspective into square of foot one of these square in this lesson serve for the base or bottom of pillar foot thick this figure iil be exactly of the same dimension of the plan lay in perspective at figure ii first mark the line in equal proportion by the same scale of the ground plan figure ii as which be so many foot in height and they stand on the base of the first figure be uprights not in perspective then draw line parallel with from number which give you the front of the body you be to raise and it be to be only three foot high draw à line cross from cto the line raise from no and that determine the height which you will then find to be foot wide and three foot high by measure then from the top of the line draw line with blacklead pencil to the point of sight and raise another line from parallel to the line till it touch the pencil s line pass from to the point of sight which give you the side appearance of the column or body as you will see it from the place where you stand ithe line from point fhould be draw with pen because it be to remain then with pencil draw line trom cto the point of sight which will determine the ether line to make the shape of the top of the column and then raise line parallel with with pencil from theoint till it touch the line from cto the point of sight draw then parallel line to at and you will have the square of the top of the pillar or column as you can observe it from the place where you stand which suppose to be at i you iust remember that the line draw from to be only a imaginary line to be rub out for it can not be see from the place where you stand and the refore must not appear in the draw but you should not leave it out becanse it shew you where to regulate the top of you column and teach you how to place you column upon it s base with certainty by this means you may see the front and one side of you column and the line from to must also be rub out because it can s be see then finisn you column only with the line from to from to to to and from to to it will be draw without any imperfection and appear as follow in figure iv when this be do you may place another column on any one of the square erect in the same manner bbserve to fling you shade all on one side and then vou can not err but especially mind where the dot line be in figure iii when you can master these few lesson which yon may gain with very little pain you will be capable of do any thing in this way that will be regalar and eertain and know the fault of the lgnorant and unskilful ch ap ii of painting upon glaq painting upon glass be a art which have ge nerally appear so difficult that sew have succeeded in the attempt and yet there be no representation of any portrait can appear more elegant than in pie¬ ture do well in this manner for yon have all the softness and all the tenderness that can be desire in picture and it be easy too for any person to work upon for there be no qutline to draw nor any shade the make but you put on the calour without the trouble of either the picture which we use on this occasion be those do in mezzo tinto or what we call mezzo tincto print for they shade be rub down with a instrument on the copperplate so that the several line which be force to be draw to represent the shady part of any common print be by this means scumble toge¬ the and appear as soft and united as in any piece do with indian ink when you be provide with such print as you like cut off the paper of the margin so that none be leave but the print itself then take some of the finest crownglass and have it cut exactly to the size ef you print and when you have clean you glass very well lay on one side of it some fine venice turpentine a thin as possible with brush make of hog hair and if you perceive the turpentine to lie unequally pass piece of wood make like flat ruler over it till it lie equal in every part then wet the back of you print with sponge and water and lay the picturéide upon the turpentinside of the glass take care that every part of it lie close to the glass and that there be no bub¬ ble or blister tobe seethen you may roll it over with wooden roll make like cylinder of two inch diameter to fix it close to the glass and when that be do wet the back of the print again with sponge and water till the paper will rub off with you finger then rub it gently till there remain only the picture itself upon the glaf of will you have all the line and shade very visible as if it be sine draw in indian ink thon let it remain till the next day to dry for else the colour would not take hecause they be ground in oil¬ sect colour for painting on glass with the necesaries for such work at most colourshop of note in london we may meet with colour of several fort ground in oil and tie up in little bladder to be sell at three pence groat or six pence piece accord as they be more or lef valuable of these provide as follow verditer white prussian blue flake white whitelead sander blue indigo tellobe englisn pink black yellow oaker lamp black dutch pink lvory black yellow orpiment green verdigrease distillredt verdigreafe and yellow rose pink vermillion oaker mixt verdigrease and english redlead pink mixt indian red verdigrease and lake dutch carminie pink mixt brown bly spanish brown uitramarine umber blue bise when you be provide with these colour you may mix they one with another to what degree of colour you think proper upon pallet with smooth knise with tender bend blade add little more of one colour to another mixing they well till you have what you want to get the colour out of the bladder prick nole at the bottom of each bladder you design to use and press the bladder till you have colour enough upon you pallet for you present use for in day s time thie colour will dry and can never be recover provide on this occasion box about two foot and half long about five inch high and sixteen inch wide with partition in it as follow the use of this box which be to keep all you painting thing together and preserve they clean fhall here very particularly explain at number must be box of tinnlron no to be place in the wooden box because it must hold oil of turpentine to clean you pencil when you have do work when you paint you must take care to use only ene pencil in colcur or in other word to have pen¬ cil for cach colour and as soon as you have dore use they for the day clean they ffom the colour by dipring they into the oil of turpentine and iye the hairy part of the pencil on the tinndino vision between number and number you finger hard on the hair and draw it four or sive time over the tin then will the colour which which come out of the pencil fall into the tinbox number and by that mean the pencil will be clean and the several mixture of colour that fall there with they oil will become good size for gold then lay you pencil with they stick in the box no and they will be fit sor use no time note the pencil should be of two sort that be some of camel hair to paint with such as will ceme to point when the colour be in they and some dry brush of white hair never to be dippin colour but use only to scumble or join one colour in another when they be just lay on so that they appear soft and you can not distinguisn where any one leave off abrupelv you ought at least to have three dozen of camel s hair pencil of all size and dozen and half of rough brush with stick to cach about ten inch or foot long the stick may be buy ready make at the colour shop they be commonly make of cedar or brazilat numb you should have case divide of wood in several part to keep you no colour in such as carmine and ultramarine with other that you may keep by you to grind when you want they for sometimes you may have occasion in the country to grind colour that you want the reafon of have division make in this box be to keep these colour from mixing with each other and there by spoiling one another tor if there be no separate apartment sometimes in basty take out or put in of these colour you may disturb the papers they be commonly wrappin so much that some of the colur will be spill the sine or rich colour such as uitramarine or carmine may rather be buy in powder than ground in oil for the first be worth near four pound a ounce and the carmine iftis good worth about twenty shilling therefore it be better to have these in powder than to have they ground in cil at the colourshop for by degree they will dry though in the bladder and you will have of much lof from they the method to grind these in oil be to put little of either of they upon polish marble and with drop or two of oil mix they well with soft blade knife and lay it on you pallet but of the uitramarine and carmine very little will serve for the least touch on the light side of you draw will give lustre to you picture and if it be ultramarine it will be last whereas have great deal of reason to suspect that the pruffian blue will not if it be expose to the weather as have observe in some signpainting of two year stand and there find that colour to change into dirty yellow but if we mix the prussian nue with varnish it will hold and last like ultramarine in short the air must be keep from it to preserve it lf we want to grind any other colour coarser than these in they powder we must have muller which must be make of one of the hardest stone we can get and finely polisn porphyry would be the best make in the shape of sugarloaf if one could get it but for the shape the sugar loaf figure be the easiest for any one to turn with they hand and every painter know the way marble be good or any stone that will polish nay even glass or crystal or any such like thing but if you have great quantity of colour to grind you must confider that you must have large quantity of oil but never so much as to overcome the quantity of colour in the grind part you may observe that the colour will frequently turn from under the muller then with thin knife scrape it up and place it under the muller again tilltis as sine as you desire it then immediately put it into piece of bladder first have the bladder immerge in warm water to soften it tie it up and let it remain to be use as have direct the other number may in its use be explainthus let that partition be line with tin or lron no because this be to enclose the bladder of oil which you should always keep by you as oil of linseed and turpentine nut oil and burnt oil and in the taking of these in and out the apartment would be greasy and stain the wood whereas the tin will preserve it from any stain from the oil number be the middle of the box and no fhould be niade of tinnlron likewise to take out and put in at pleasure fortis to contain all the bladder of oil colour and as some of they will be frequently use the reservoir for they must in time become greasy and over they be to be lay the pallet which every night after you have do you work should be clean of the colour you have put upon it or else cover with its colour in water to keep they useful till the next day to keep you pallet clean rub it with coarse linnen cloath with oil of turpentine and then rub it tilltis dry as one may call it with nut or linseed oil but take what care you will of you oilcolour in small quantity when they be expose to the air there will be coat of thick hard scale over they in or two which indeed one may take off with knife but we lose much of the colour and some of they be very costly when vou take off the scaly part the rest of the colour be fit to use and if it be too thick then put drop or two of linseedoil to it and mix it well with you tender knife some people when they use ultramarine and carmine because of they great price only put drop of oil on they pallet and put as much colour to it as they think will be enough only work they together with knife which indeed be more save than to mix it on the stone sect ii how to use the colour in painting on glass as the line and shade of you picture happen to open so you ought to fispose you colour that be lay on the lighter colour first on the light place of you print and the darker over the shade place and if you have once lay on the brighter colourtis no great matter whether the darker sort be lay littie over they for the first colour lay on will hide those you lay on afterwards as for example yellow the lightest yellow may be lay on first and the dutch pink will shade it red the red lead may be lay on first as the brightest red colour and to shade it with lake or carmine will bring you picture to beautiful scarlet equal to any tincture of the finest dye of cochineal bly lay on first the blue bife and shade it with indigo or else take ultramarine and lay it on in the light and shade it with indigo green lay on first some verdigrease and then the mixture have mention of that and the dutch pink but you may make this green as yellow as you please by adding more dutch pink as you see occasion it be to be note that when any of these colour be too strong they may be lighten to any degree by mixing white with they upon you pallet or you may darken they by mixing they with the deeper colour but they must be well mixt with the knife before you when you have paint you glass it must stand three or four day before it will be dry enough to put in frame chap iii of the making of crayon sor dry colour the use of crayon for dry colour be so necesary in taking of view and prospect and there be so few crayon that be good of the sort that think think the way of make they necessary article to be know to every one who be lover of draw and painting white as for white we have no occasion of any other than white soft chalk which should be sawe into length of a inch and half or two inch there be litile saw make on purpose for such use about four inch long and very thin when you have seeout you crayon of chalk which should be at most quarter of a inch thick round off the corner with penknife and point they by draw you penknife upwards from the place where the point be to be you pught to have dozen or two of these to lie in little case by themselves or they will be discolour by the other colour yellow pastil or crayon yellous come next which should be divide into four or five degree of colour first take fome grounds of starch and flour of brimstone mix they well with knife upon polishied marble so that they produce the colour of straw or yellow as faintly will shew itself then pour little milk to they or little pale ale wort till the colour become like paste then spread the paste on fmooth piece of chalk with broad knife till it be about the third part of a inch thick and let it lie tilltis half dry then with sharp knife cut it in length of a inch and half about the fourth part of a inch wide and roll it thin between two little piece of board till they be round like straw and point they as have direct for the chalk you please you may use ground chalk instead of grounds of starch yelloew it be make of yellow oker ground well with fair water and then dry and beat mix this with ground chalk in sach quantity as it will be a little deeper than the former colour and mix they up with pale ale wort in which little white sugarcandy may be dissolve and make these crayon as the former grind yellow oker with water with stone and muller and whentis dry beat it very fine and make it into pastil or crayon with pale alewort or size make with glover leather boil in water till it come to jelly use it as before direct and roll the pastil between two board yellow take english pink grind it as the former with water and whentis dry beat it fine and mix it with very little ground chalk tilltis deeper than the former colour then put to it some wort of pale ale and stir all well together and make it into pastil or crayon by roll in the forego manner fellow english pink be to be alone ground as the former and to be make in pastil or crayon by itself with pale ale wort yellow dutch pink be to be use as the former and mixt with pale alewort or milk and so roll and dry yellow orpiment be one of the most poisonous colour that can be use however it be one of the most beautiful sort and be next orange colour this must have little ground chalk mixt with it well tempered together and make up with pale alewort with little gum dragon dissolve in it and roll they up into pastil as you do the former orange colour orangecolour take yellow orpiment mix it with pale alewort and when it be in paste roll it and make it into pastil or crayon orangecolour take orpiment and redlead but the redlead must be very finely ground in water and dry then mix little of this with you orpiment tiil you have the colour you desire and put to it some ale wort wherein some gumdragon have be dissolved make it into paste and roll it into pastil or crayon orangecolour take english pink grind it well and put to it as much vermillion as will make it of the colour you desire mix these up with ale wort that have be boil tilltis more glutinon than ordinary and make it into pastil as before direct atb orange colour take english pink finely ground and put to it as much red lead well ground as will make it agreeable to you design mix these well with ale wort boil to thickness and make they into crayon sth orange coloar take some dutch pink grind it well and mix with it some red lead finely powder to the colour you want then make this into paste with alewort or milk and roll it up into crayon as before direct note in the mixture of these colour observe that they have as many different shade as possible red st red take redlead grind it well with water then dry it and beat it to sine powder and put to it some chalk or white lead finely ground to brighten it mix this with alewort wherein little gumdragon have beën boil make it into paste and roll it into crayona in this you should make some of you pastil deeper other paler red take red lead and whentis well ground with marble and muller make it into paste with ale wort wherein gum dragon have be boil red red oker want no preparation but saw as have direct for chalk in the first article red take vermillion grind it fine and mix pulverize divide you composition into three part and by add moreof the white to one than another make three different colour then put to each ale wort boil thick and make they severally into paste and so into crayon stb red take vermillion well ground and mix it with ale wort that have be boil to thickness with red take some good lake grind it well with water upon marble and when it be well dry and powder lay it in three division and mix with each as much ground chalk or whitelead as will make they of several colour then make they severally into paste and then into crayon red take sine lake and reduce it to as fine powder as you can with water and when it be dry and again finely powder mix it with alewort and make it into pastil or crayon red take indian red grind it well with water and dry it like the other colour then mix it with alewort that have be boil to thickness with little gum dragon this alone will be verystrong colour but you should mix some of it with white in two or three different manners to be shade to one another red take rosepink and cut it into the shape of crayon without any preparation carmine be too dear for they for twelve pennyworth would make but small crayon purple purple take rose pink finely ground and porydered mix it well with little sander blae till the powder appear of the colour you want then make it into paste with alewort thickne with gum dragon and roll they into the figure of crayon purple take lake finely ground and wash put to it as much blue bise as you think proper to make it of reddish purple and you should vary this in two or three manners each lighter than the other in the lighter sort put à sufficient quantity of chalk or white lead well ground and mix they up with alewort boil to thickness with gum dragon and roll they into pastil purple take some lake well ground and add to it as much prussianblue as will make it of the colour you desire mix these very well together in several parcel make some more incline to red than the ¬ thera and to the faintest purple of they add some ground chalk at you pleasure and make these severally into paste with ale wort thicken by boiling so make they after the same manner as the former into pastil bly bly blue blue bise be the lightest blue colour we use and must be well ground with common water on fine marble then let it dry and reduce it again to powder then lay it in four parcel and pat to three of they in different proportion some ground chalk or whitelead so that when they come to be mixt every one may be lighter than the other mix these soparately with alewort that be thicken with scrap of glover lea¬ the and when they be in pafte to you mind make theyinto crayon and the fourth part of the blue bise must be make up by itself in the same manner bluc take verditer well ground on fine marble lay it in four parcel and mix one of they purely with thin size make of white glover shred and alewort and the other three part mix with several proportion of ground chalk or whitelead well ground so as to make shade to one another make thes e into pafte with alewort thicken with gumdragon and of in¬ to crayon blue take some pruffianblue and grind it well then lay it in four parcel on you marble and mix with three of they some ground chalk or white lead well ground to make they of different degree of colour and the fourth part must be alone make the three mix colour into paste with pale alewort boil till it thicken and the plain colour must be make into paste with some ale wort boil and thicken with white shaving of leather from the glover make all these into crayon blue take rock irdigo and grind it well with water on marble dry it and powder it again and then divide it in parcel as be direct above and with two or three part of they mix different proportion of ground chalk or whitelead ground to make they paler or deeper and one part must be the simple colour put to the mixt colour some ale wort thickened with boiling and mix they to pafte then roll they into crayon as for the plain indigo mix it with alewort thickened with glover shred of white leather by boiling and make it into pastil black black the black which be commonly use as crayon be charcole cut into length the softest and best be that which be make of willow have at least dozen or two of these for black and white be use great deal more than any other colour black take lvory black ground very sine with common water and put to it very little ground indigo for blueisn cast will enliven you black and help it from that deadness which plain black always carry with it brown brown take for light brown some fullerearth grind it well with water and mix it with some ground chalk or whitelead to make it in different colour that be to make it lighter as you think fit mix this up with pale alewort boil thick and at least have four sort of it brown take some spanish browii grind it very well and mix with it some fullerearth to make it lighter for the spanishbrown be dark colour of it ¬ self and when you have make this mixture you may put to some part of it little white chalk ground or whitelead in different proportion to have they of various shade these be for the lighter brown and mix they severally in paste with light size of fisnglue or isinglass and water and some of they with pale ale wort boil thin or thick water gruel boil with gum dragon then make they into pastil brown take spanish brown well ground and some indianred mix they well together and put to they some pale alewort till they become paste you may make some of they lighter if you will with ground chalk or whitelead and then roll they into crayon green take some verdigrease and boil it in sharp vinegar and add to it when it boil little tartar powder which will dissolve the verdigrease so that the liquor will be of finc colour then set the li quor in little gallipot expose to the air which will dry the colour and then it will dissolve in common water this may be take with just as much warm alewort as will cover it and will dissolve the green then make it into pastil with white chalk ground as much as you think proper green grind distilled verdigrease with vinegar on marble wasn it well with water the manner of which be to throw the verdigrease into water and in half minute to pour off the water into cup and let it settle then pour the water from it and wash it again in the same way when this be dry make it into crayon with ale wort green take verdigrease prepare as before finely powder and mix it with little prussian blue in several proportion in the lightest sort put little white or the brightest yellow well ground to make variety of colour mix all these with pale ale wort boil to thickness atb green take some indigo well ground and some englishpink mix they well together upon marble and when they be well powder make they into paste and roll they up with foft size and oil till they be of the figure of crayon or with pale alewort or thick watergruel but when we use watergruel it must be strain and boil with some gumdragon green take some blue bise ground fine and put to it some dutch pink well ground mix they in parcel and prepare they in snade to one another then make they into paste and roll they into crayon you may have five or six variety of these nore the liquid which you be to use to make they into pastil must be alewort boil little thick green grind rockindigo very sine with water on marble and whentis dry beat it fine again then lay it in parcel on the marble and put to some of they little slower of brimstone in greater or lesser quantity and to other slower of brimstone and dutch pink mixt so that you may have variety of colour when these different shade be as you intend they then make they into paste with ale wort thickne by boiling with white glover leathershred or with little gumdragon green grind some rockindigo with water and add to it in several parcel as much dutch pink as you see convenient to make you green of various shade when these be well mixt put to they some alewort thicken by boiling and make they into paste and when they will roll make they into crayon memorandum the reason why these crayon be better than commonly those which be buy at the shop be because they be generally make too stiff with gui and so will hardly touch the paper but ah these will work freely and express the several colour you dofire we must consider that the reason why we make five or six shade of each colour be because in this case we can not mix any when we use they whereas in oilpainting and painting in water colour we may make what mixture we please in a instant and when we set about any painting or draw in crayon which happen to have great variety of colour in it we ought not to be without every sort of colour that can be think on note these colour should be keep in box partition every sort by itself wiz the white vellow lay the brightest sort in one and the deeper sort in another till you come towards the orangecolour orangecolour the lighter sort of orangecolour in a apartment and the deeper in another red paler sort or flefficolour in one apartment the brighter red in another the stronger red in another and the deepest red in another every one with its proper shade till we come towards purple purple the paler sort incline to red in one apartment the next sort more incline to blue in another with they shade and these which be next to blus with they shade in part by themselves bly should follow the purple put the lightest preparation in the first apartment the next degree into another third into another and the fourth to the last into other but keep the prussian blue quite by itself and its mixture by themselves it serve very well in this way to supply the place of ultramarine and as it be much cheaper forbear to mention the use of uletramarine blue in this case which be extravagant in the price for crayon of it could not be make under half guinea and besides in this way of crayon drawing the preparation of prussianblue do very well aswer the same end though that colour will not do in watercolour nor even last in oilcolour if it come to be expose to the weather for in either case it change to dirty yellowcolour but find that the crayon hold by be imbody as have direct reen should be divide intp three or four sort and with they shade be lay in several apartment brown should be likewise put in three or tour parcel with they proper shade to be lay in each partment of one great box and you should never be without crayon of charcole in another case with all these you will be compleatly furnish and when you go out to take any view have one of every sort in little box divide as the forego to carry in you pocket the paper which you should use on this occasion should be venice rough paper almost like we white brown paper or even the white brown paper which they sell at every chandler shop the stiffer it be th better that which they call cap paper be the best as have find by experience for upon such the colour easily distribute themselves and by this means every one may take figure in they proper colour as they see they tor they may match the colour as they appear with the crayon they have by they and as the crayon be dry they will not alter they colour but the wetted colour will appear deeper when they be wet than when they be dry which will deceive the eye of be ginner instruction for the use of crayon remember when vou use these crayon that yon point they from the bottom upwards and make not the point too sharp unless in the white chalk the red oker and the charcole one may make pretty draw on blue paper with only chalk and charcole the strong light and the dark shade make fine contrast and pleasant appearance in draw chap iv curious direction for draw with crayon the manner of draw with crayon be much more expeditious where we would express the object we be to take in colour than painting in watercolour for before we use they to strike the colour we intend only slight outline need be make ei¬ the with chalk charcoal of red oker of the subject we would represent we may bring these drawing to delicate softness and fine expression but then they mustbe always keep in book or under glass of frame where they may not rub for touch of rude finger unacquainted with the performance may change the shade or light and so alter the sine design of the work but we must first provide a indifferent coarsé paper of the colour of white brown paper fer the colour of the paper be à little dark give better opportunity of of shew thet light or white stroke of we crayon and will give good relief to the tender part of we work again the little roughaess of such paper will make the crayon of every colour express themselves muck stronger than if we be to draw with they upon smooth paper these crayon of every sort of colour you will have occasion for be make in pastil and sell by most of the most note colourman in london few will serve you at first to try you hand and in take off sketsh of prospect be very usefal when you be once master of dzaw enough to take the outline for little box of they will serve to mark the colour which you will remark in the different part of you prospect without the trouble of water and gumwater which must be have if we use watercolour and would be troublesome the get for you use in the field where you should take these prospect from these crayon be of so easy use may encourage we to colour

which be in view commonly consist of variety of try which have every one of they they different colour which at once we may see in we crayon and mark it as it happen to be upon we draw but if we wood should prove all of one sort of tree we shall sfill find great variety of colour in the tree produced by they different situation and if we match we crayon well with the colour of we tree and other part of theprospect we shall learn by it what be totural representation of thing but to do this effectually if you can not furnish draught in colourat once take the same hour the next day to do it in because as the sun happen to beat one point at one hour of the day so the next day it will be about the same point at the fame hour and if you be to mif that time the shade of all you object will be alter andyou colour will be varyso you should likewise take either the morning or evening for this purpose for then you will have strong shade and strong light which will give pleasing variety to you picture .. memorandum if you have bright morning or evening when yon begin finisn you work when the hour of you draw be as bright as they be at first if you can for want of such observation many one who be good draught man spoil five draw he will sometime place he green improperly and give strengthe where only little touch should be weand some who be beginner in these affair will encourage fovourite colour and neglect the proper ornamental colour think have not see finer prospect to teach we this art than what be on both side guilford dowy ns boxbill leith bill ricbmondbill and about high wickbam where one have fine vale beautiful hill and delightful wood in the spring and autumn to look on the wood you may almost perceive every colour in we collection some . tree will open with yellowish cast other with sharp blueisn green some brown and other of reddisni colour and so in the die away of the leave in autumn or towards the fall of the leaf vou will see as much variety and you will find then the field and all the change¬ able part of the country of different colour about half score drawing in crayon of these sort will enliven you imagination and teach you the art of colouring in the most natural and consequently the most beautiiul manner but if you design principally to draw landscape in this manner advise to make ydur qutline withcharcoal or blacklead very gently touchd but biack lead be the best when in this way of draw one have a object where à light colour and shade colour should fall na¬ turally into ane anothier then when you have markyoat paper with both take dry short hairpencile and brushit gently between bothtill you have mixtthey so easily together that you can not discern where the light and the shade separate or where the light and the shade part from one another but this be praperly for the larger drawing which be to appear soft and tender if one want fencil of the fort speak of take piece of soft white brown paper and roll it or twist it up tilltis of the bigness of camelhair pencil of the size we generally use in watercolour and when you have rubbthe point end gently on rough piece of clean board or piece of rough brown paper twill serve instead of pencil toscumble you work or make one colour flow into another there remain now only to tell you how you ought in this particular way of draw to cut or point you crayon take fine penknife and instead of draw it down from the body of the crayon towards the point as one do in point blacklead pencil begin at the point and draw you knife upwards in such manner as to leave you crayon of the same figure you would require blacklead pencil to be of whentwas sharpenfor these crayon be hardly two inch long and be brittle enough besides if they have any knot in they they will be very apt to break one may observe too before we conclude this chapter of draw and colour with crayon that all these appear immediately of the colour one would express whereas the colour to be wewith water will be mach deeper or darker when the water be put to they than they will prove when they be dry which may confound beginner and occasion he to make he colour lighter but when this

of the plate over the smoke of candle move it backward and forward tilltis all equally black you must next take you draw or print and rub the back of it with chalk or red oker but chalk be the best and when the back of this draw be rubbed little with wooll cloth lay the chalk part of the print upon the varniss and six it well draw over all the stroke with blunt point needle marking it as you go along the shade so you will have all the line mark upon you varnish then provide four or five needle of different size and with the finest make the finer line apd so by degree on to the larger trace

of glax print witb white varnisp so as to bear water and the polisb it be best in this way first to pafte you print on board or piece of shockeloth strain on frame to do this well prepare some stiff starch and with sponge dipt in water or thin starch wet the back of you print and if you design to lay it on board dip large brushi in the thick starch and brushi it over the board as even as possible and let it dry then second time repeat the same work and so continue till the vein or grain of the wood be quite sill in the last operation when the starch be just lay on lay upon it you wet print as equally as possible so that there appear no bubble in it press it close every where till it lie fmooth and of let it dry in this operation you hand must be very clean or else you will foil the print in bout twenty four hour it will be dry enough to varnisti with the follow viz wbite varnisb for print take of letbyocolla or lfinglaj or fispglue as somecall it four ounce and pull it into small piece seethe this slowly in quart of brandy or strong spirit in glaze pipkin and when by takingout little you find it will make strong glue by be little expose to the air it will do for you purpose but be sure to make it as strong as you can and while it be warm with brusni wash over the print as quick as possible and as smooth as may be letthis standday and theu brush it over again with the same varnissi or glue and let it dry very well then brush it over with white varnissi at such distance from the fire that it may not be too hot or else it will blister and do this two or three time over then set it by for day or two and brush it over with white varnish again three or four time and let it stand day or two then varnish it third time with two or three passage of the brush and in three or four day polish it with soft linnencloth and some fine tripoli rub it very gently till it remain as smooth as possible and clear it with flour and oil it will then appear as bright as chrystal and if it should at any time be annoyed by fly you may wasn it with sponge and water which will clean it note for common ule some first dissolve the isinglass in warm water lest it should take fire the white varnish take gum sandarick of the clearest and whitest sort one pound gummastick of the clearst sort one ounce gum sarcacolla the whitest one ounce and half veniceturpentine three ounce benzoin the clearest half a ounce white rezin half a ounce gum animæ a ounce and half gumelemi ounce these must be dissolve and mixt in the follow manner put you sarcacolla and rezin into little more spirit than will cover they to dissolve then put you gumanimæ benzoin and venice turpentine into glass or glaze vessel and pour on as much spirit as will cover they a inch then provide glaze vessel or glass for you gum mastick and sandarick and pour on they strong spirit enough to cover they about a inen to dissolve they rightly then in distinct vessel of thesame sort as before put you gum elimi and cover it with spirit to dissolve iin this procef you need only pulverize the gum animæe sarcacolla and benzoin and you may break the rezin little while these be dissolve for three or four day shake the bottle twice or three each day then put all these together in glaze vessel gently warmstire they well and strain the liquor and gum gently begin with the gum through linnencloth this will prevent any dirt get into you varn sn then put it into bottle and let it stand week before you nse it and pour off as much of the clear only as you think you shall want for present use take care of fire to paste print upen clotb for varuisb if you putyou print upon shockcloth well strain in frame brufh over you cloth with strong paste make with flour and water and immediately brush over the back of you print with well prepare starch and then as readily brusn the cloth over again with the same starch and lay on you print as equally as poffible without let any bubble or blister appear in the pa per but you must observe that when you lay on you paper apon the clotb as both the cloth and the paper be then wet however close you lay the paper to the cloth they will both together appear flag and unstrain yet as soon as they be dry all will be smooth as either be at the first let they remain so in dry warm place for day or two and then varnisn you print as before direct with glue make of scthyocolla and then with the white varnisn with this varnish you may mix up any colour that have be ground dry upon marble and paint with it upon any figure you have draw or upon any print yon have paste upon you work but the varnisn colour what colour be proper shade to one another see thechapter for making of crayon varnish make witb seedlacca put quart of strong spirit into large glass vessel and put to it six ounce of seedlacca let these stand together two day shake they often then take jelly bag or flannel bag make like what be call hippocrate s sleeve and pass it through let the liquor drop into receiver and squeeze the gum every now and then when the varnish be almost out of the bag add more and press it gently till all be strained and the dregs remain dry take care you do not fire for fear you set you house put this dross into the in flame then putit in bottle and keep they close stand set it by till you perceive all the thick part settle to the bottom which will be in three or four day then pour off the clear into frefh bottle and twill be fit for use as for the varnish make of shelllaccatis not of any great service though often recommend for it will not bear the polisn when you lay on you varnish take the follow method lf you varniss wood let you wood be very smooth close grain free from grease and rub with rushie lay on you colour as smooth as possible and if the varnisn have any blister in it take they off by with rushie when you varnish keep you work warm but not too hot in lay on of you varnish begin in the middle and stroke the brusn to the outside then to another extreme part and so on till all be covpred for the brushi if you be to beginat the edge would leave blot there and make thework unequal in sine work use the finest tripoli to polisn do not polisn you work at one time but after the first polish let it dry two or three day and poliss again for the last time in the first polish you must ase good deal of tripoli but in the next avery little will serve wash off you tripoli with sponge and water dry you varnish with dry linnen rag and clear you work with oil whiting and lampblack sect to take off the figure from auy piece ef chinaware though the person bas not be acquainted with draw when you have any figure to you like upon any china dish cup plate or such like you must lay piece of oil paper over they so as to hold the piece steady tillyou can trace we the line of the figure then lay the oil paper on paper black on one side and the black paper on clean paper then trace the line with pen or blunt point of needle till the line be all impressed on the white paper and draw they over with black lead pencil and mark the shade where they separate from the light part of the colour that so you may lay on you colour as you see they paint on the chinaware then cut out you figure close to the qut line and fix they upon you ground of whiting and size or size with ground chalk with thick gum arabick and water and when they be quite dry paint they the lighter part in watercolour and the shady part with varnishi mix with the darker colour when these be dry wasn all over with the white varnisn before fire but not so hot as to make the varnisni rise in blister when the varnish be dry lackerit again with the same varniffi and repeat it third time then scrape some tripoli very fine and with soft rag dipt in water take up little of the tripoli at time and polish it by gentle rubbing tilltis smooth then waffi off the tripoli with soft sponge and water and then with dry fine cloth wipe off the tripoli and when that be dry dean it with whiting and oil if it be white varnissi or with oil and lamp black where the varniss be black but the common way be to cut out print and pafte they on such part as we think fit and then colour they with watercolour and varnisni they with white varnish be a easy way of painting because the shade of the print when you lay on transparent water colour will give the light and shade that colour to you purpose without use dark and light colour sect x i some remarkable direction in coloar of draught or print in japanning as flower bird fruit if vou have print or drawing in black and white of flower if the centre of the flower be rise just touch the edge of the light with thin tincture of gamboge and lay on some dutch pink or gallstone over the shade so as to run into the light very lighttle say this because the thrum in the middie of flower be generally yellow but if of any other co lour as by observation find they be sometimes blue sometimes more light and sometimes darker then touch on the verge of the light little ultramarineblue and over the shade either some sander blue to run very little into the uitramarine or else snade with indigo and some of the white of the print be leave void of colour will then give à life and spirit to the colour so dispose all flower should be tenderly touch in the light just to give à little glare into the light part of the colour you would give to the flowerleave and if you have natural flower to paint by you will presently see that on the shady side you must lay on the most shady part such colour as will s force the reft to appear forward but do not dawb over the shade with too hea vy colour let it be such as may be transparent if possi¬ ble and scumble it into the light colour which be lay on before use you pencil lightly on this occafion with very little gum water in it and use it before the colour be quite dry in the painting of the leave of herb or plant we ought to have regard to the colour of the green the brightest be the verdigrease green describe in my former book relatiug to painting in watercolour we fnould touch that colour little into the light part of the leaf from the place where the lighter part of the shade end and then lay on some sap green on the shady part so as to unite with the verdigreasegreen and if the totural leaf should be of darkisn colour touch the lighter side of the leave with little verdigreasegreen and dutch yellow pink mixt together or with tincture of french berry but so as to let the verdigrease shine more than the pink and by degree shade it with pink the leave the light when we colour print have two advantage viz if we leave the light on this occasion the whiteness of the paper serve instead of the use of white paint which be a heavy colour and would rather confind the edge of the colour which have prescribed to be lay on than do they any service but the colour which have direct where there be no white lay on will agreeably shine into the white of tne pa per am more particular in this because several if they see flower of blue colour will lay it all over with one colour though it bethick enough to hide both the light and the shade and then it remain like penny picture where there be nothing to be see but jargon of red bly and yellow with little practice of what direct you will soon see the good effect of lay on colour for this use though the daw of print in the common manner may please the lgnorant when every one of taste will soon discover the impertinence in word when you be about such piece of work scumble the light into the shade of every colour and save the middle of the light open on the papers for as the paper be white of itself it make à light chap viii to melt amber and cast it into any figure with fly or any small

world and on my own part shall tbink my time well spend if my reader reap any delight or advantage from what be publisb from my own obseration fince can assure they that it be aalculate for the entertainment and diwerfionof those whe bave genius for such pleasant amusement asyaell as for the improvement of those whabave already make some pregress in the dalightful art abovemention the draw and painting watercolour chap rule for draw any object in its outline as exact as the life or nature take sheet of the thinnest or whitest brown paper and brush it over with oil of turpen tine which will immediately render it transpa rent and then put the paper to dry in the air when tis dry strain it upon frame and six it against anyobject you design to draw as a house or hill or tree then just belore it place piece of wood with a hole in it fit for one eye to look through and as you meet any outline of the object you desire upon the transparent paper trace they over with pencil so will you be sure that you can not err for there will be nothing but just proportion and true representation of nature to make this still of more elegancy observe the trace of you draught where the shade be and mark they with you pencil for all the art in the world can never dispose the shade so regularly as one may touch by this method but the shade must be do quickly after the qut line be draw and not at different time because every instant the sun change they in this too observe that in certain object you will have fainter stronger and yet more dark shade and in yoar remark of they take such memorandums as may direct you how to finish they with indian ink or other colour when you sit down to compleat yout work the best way that know be to prepare three shell or gallipot of indian ink mixwith common water before you attempt to trace out you object viz one of very faint black the next of middle black and the other of a interse black number they from the lightest to the darkest and as ygu make you observation of the shade on you object mark upon you draught the same number as they happen to appear so that afterwards you may finisn with certainty again it be neceffary in the draw of any thing after this manner to observe that the line on the shady side should be thick or bold and those on the lighter side should be thinner or finer in proportion to the light that fall upon they as for example in the darkest part s line may be of this thickness in the next dark part somewhat thinner and it the other thus unless in thing at great distane hardly to be understand or so faint as hardly to be perceive thus mere shadow as it be some have be guilty of great fault though they have take the qut line very exact to make all they line of a equal thickness lf a object be reprsent we s will suppose two mile off and the draw be as strong in that part of the picture as if it be next the eye or not ten or twenty foot from the draughtsmian it would not appear pleasant or natural to the eye we must not express man wich button on he coat at two mile distance no more than we must have they ommit in person so near the eye as ten or twenty foot though this have inadvertently be do by some who have pass for great man and the shade in those distant appearance must be in proportion to the strength of the object as they appear to we imperfect three or four welldirect touch of the pencil on the shady side will represent figure at the distance we can docern it as lively as some hundred will of the same figure near the eye but the transparent paper speak of be of another use for if we lay it upon any picture or print in loose sheet you will see all the line through it and may then draw or copy it with the greatest pleasure you will then if the print or picture be do by good master see which line be strong and which aze tender and soft imitate they there be yet another way to take view and lande scape which some prefer to the transparent paper that be either with white or black tiffany or lawn strainupon frame and wein the same manner as the paper exceptingthat the blacklead pencil be use to the paper on the white tiffany and on the lawn we use charcoal finely poiny and very soft but on the black tiffany we use white chalk of the tenderest fort chap ii how to bring these drawing to use and the copy from print painting if we make draw upon transparent paper t draw from it regularly get piece of paper of the same size and rub on one side of it some powder of black lead tilltis well and equally black and so well rub that touch of finger will hardly be ting with it then take the draw you have make or print and day the black paper under it with the black side downward upon piece of white paper and pin the three together in two or three place take then pin or needle à little blunt at the point and trace it over the outline of you picture which with little presing will direct the blackpaper to impress the undermost white paper so as to receive every stroke yon draw when this be do you must with you black lead pencil correct what error you find and slightly clean the draught new make with some stale bread crumb the blacklead pencil be so hard to be find tolerable that know not above one place where we can get one that will do the service we require if we find good piece of lead in the beginning when we have use a inch or two the rest generally prove hard gritty and full of knot the best have meet with be commonly sell by joyner from some of these one may have they of soft or hard lead and use they till they be reduce to two or three inch tis great pleasure to draughtsman to work with good pencil and as great à plague to have bad one so the camel s hair brush be generally very bad they be indeed cheap enough to buy they in common but if one would have the best which should be full of hair the price ought to be accordingly as they can be make to hold quantity of colour and be bring to fineoint s lis better to give six pence or fhill for pencil than to have dozen for groat as for the draught draw on tiffany or lawn lay they only on paper that which be draw with charcoal upon white paper and that draw with chalk on black or blue paper then give each of they knock or two with a hammer the charcoal or the chalk will fall through they upon the papers directly in the line they be draw and give you the true representation of the object you draw from the life upon the black paper you will see it in white line and so the contrary then strengthen these shadow of drawing with you black lead pencil or chalk or red oker on the sheet of paper where they have make the mark otherwise the line would easily be mbbe out but take care as have observe before that this amendment be make suddenly for these tender draught be soon vanish if one do not take care to strengthen they immediately begin first at the bottom of the draw another way be to take thin piece of paper and hold it against glasswindow principally at such window as be sashifor the interruption of the lead in the smaller glaze window will hinder part of this prospect the point be draw what you see from the glass and then the blacklead paper be to be use as direct before there be another way still which may be more easy to the hand or arm of person not accustom to drawing upon paper or lawn place upright which be bythe use of portable camera ofcura though to help the first one may hold baguette or such stick in the leavehand as the oil painter use to rest the righthand upon or have some other rest make for the righthand as may be serewe up and down at onepleasure but there be this difference still between draw piece of perspective or view on transparent paper or lawn place upright against any object that such piece will take in more of the view or object and from greater distance than the portable camera ofcura will however as the portable camera will at first be most easy to the arm for the beginner by reason the object appear upon anhorizontal plane such as table the hand will have proper rest and more readily follow the line represent on the plane with that exactness indeed such portable camera as mention be of some expence and to such as can afford it they may have they at any price from thirty shilling to five pound piece accord as they bespeak they at the mae thematical instrumentmakerwhat will make the difference in the price will be the largeness of the size of the glass which lye ho¬ rizontally and receive the object which we be to trace out with we pencil the smaller of these glass may be perhaps four inch square and the larger fifteeninch on such glass you ill meet the exact re presentation smaller or larger accord to the bigness of the machine of the object we point or direct they to each one adorn with the natural colour agreeable to the point of distance stronger nearer the eye and gradually decline as the object be more remote from it the shade of the several colour be in this way express in very lively manner few leffon with good consideration will be of good information not only to beginner but to master of the pencil but still to advance the knowledge and use of this portable camera suppose that instead of the glass which receive the object speak of there should be place frame of transparent paper to receive the object s we have mind to take upon which one may use the pencil still with greater freedom one may have dozen or two witli each camera or one frame will serve as for many papers as we please to strain upon it if one have patience to pafte they on there be another way of draw object in the canmera ofcura way which be by make room as dark as may be only leave a hole in one of the windowshutter as low as possible to receive a oxeye glass as they call it which be sell by the mathematical instrumentmaker this turn in socket so as to direct every object within certain reach to sheet of paper place at proper distance within the room to receive those object upon which paper yon may draw they in great perfection but they all appear reveror the wrong end upwards however they be in as exact proportion and beauty as those represent in the former in this casetis not however more difficult to draw or rather copy the object though they be reverthan to draw or copy the several thing which we see upright on the frame of transparent paper lawn or tiffany for to trace line will be as eafily do do one way as the other and though the objeet fall on the sheet of paper will when we be drawing they be rever tis but turn the sheet of pa¬ per upside down when they be do and we draw will be right to the eye when we shew this by way of curiosity to those who be unacquainted with the reason wliy the image represent on the sheet of paper appear upside down it would not have so desirable a effect as if they could be view in they natural situation but to obviate this difficulty let the sheet of paper which be to reccive the object be place against the back of chair and let they look on the several object represent on the paper over the back of the chair which will set they upright to the eye this way in bring they to rights be think on by very few though at the first proof every one will wonder that he do not find it out sonner thas far be shew how any oné may copy either print draw or piece of painting or even make a exact representation from the life but must yet add concern the take off of print or drawing method or two which be easy and divert not beforé mention one be prick with pifr any oûtline of print or draw one have mind to copy and then lay the say picture on sheet of paper take powderpuff or tuft of cotton dip it now and then in charcoaldust or red chalkduit and beat it ver the prick line through the picture renew it with dust frequently by dip and then yoû will have full direction mark on you cloth or paper sufficient to finish just draw such prick piece of work will give many hundred proof of its use though it spoil tlie print or picture it fave vast deal of trouble to the painter on the draw part another way there be to make a impression from the print which shall give just copy of it this be of greât use when we want to carry every stroke of the engraver along with we it will indeed sully the print à little though very little if you be careful and this method will will perhaps cost you two minute time when the draw of it with every stroke the engraver have make would keep you busy month for this take some foft soap either white or of the green fort but for my part always use the green soap mix this with water near a equal quantity till tis near the consistence of jelly rub some of this mixture on the print and gently wet the paper you would have to receive the impression from it with wet spunge then lay it on the print and cover all with two or three other piece of dry paper and rub it very hard all over with any thing that be smooth and po¬ lish and the wet paper will have upon it the reverse of the print you rub it upon with every distinct line in the original if you have be careful to rub it equally chap iii secret sor copying of drawing continue to take draw witb fixt ink one way be to take thin sheet of paper and rub it all over with fresh butter as equally as possible then dry it well by the fire and rub the butter s side with carmine tilltis all equally colouror else rub it over with lamp black or blacklead powder or with blue bise finely ground take care in the rub on any of these that the colour will not come off by very slight touch of the finger and they be then fit for you work when you have choose print or defign that you would copy lay the colourside of you butterpa per upon piece of clean paper and you print upon the butter s paper and then with fine pen or needle blunt blunt very little at the point trace the outline of you draw carefully and you wiil have good copy of it upon yoar white paper which may be touch up afterwards by crayon of the like colour red ink for make a impression of print one may likewise use the follow method for take off or make copy from any print which be to mix somc vermillion finely ground with linseed oyl but so liquid that it will run or flow in pen with this trace the line of you print and as soon as all be do then with spunge and water wet the backside of the print and turn the print side down on piece of white paper so as to lye smooth then lay over that piece of dry paper and press it hard in every part and the lower white paper will receive the impression but if you have linnenpresstis better to put you papers between two of the wooden leave and skrew the press as tight as may be for you will then have fine impreffion take draught witb red loose ink you may likewise take some vermillion finely ground and mix it with fair water in gallipot with some cotton and it will run very freely in the pen so that one may make the finest stroke we desire then with this mixture draw over all the stroke of you print imitate both the finer and stronger line when all be do then with spunge dipt in gumwater with clean white paper and whileit be wet turn the print upon it and press it well take off the print and all the stroke will remain on the clean paper and as soon as tis dry the vermillion will be fixt to it this fort of ink be what famous writingmaster use when he have book of write engrave for he he writ with this and have he copperplate cover with white beewax or white ground he turnthe write side down on the waxt side of the plate and rubbing it very equally the impression will be upon the wax take draught witb blue loose ink you may likewise make such sort of ink of blu bice and common water which will run very finely in pen and serve for the same use as the above ink to take off draw in stand red colour by traetake vermillion finely ground and mix it with lighttle fresh butter then rub clean sheet of paper with it on one side till it will bear slight touch of the finger without leave the paper too freely then use this coloured paper by lay the colour s side upon clean paper and upon the colour paper lay on you print and trace every line you think proper as direct before in trace but be sure you pin the three papers together at the corner to prevent they slipping for if any one should slip you work will be spoilor some one or other may inadvertently take up the print when you place it right again so that you labour will be all lose this impression make by trace will hold without rubbing in trace the quill take from swallowwing be very good after they be thoroughly dry if one have carmine enough by one he might mix it with little fresh butter and colour paper with it as before direct and then you draw will be of more beautiful colour or if we would have the draw blue we may colour paper with blue bice and butter speedy way of print the leaf of any tree or herb as exact as nature it self take the leaf of any plant you desire and rub the vein on the backside little with piece of lvory or dogtooth to bruise they little then rub it gently with piece of wooll cloth dipt slightly in oyl of linseed when you have do this every where on you loaf put the oylsee e on piece of white paper and press it equally in every part the paper will remain pertect impression of it which may be afterwards colourtis soon do and be useful to such as would remember plant aoather way of print the leave of plant so that tbe impression shall appear as black as if it bad be do in printing press take any leaf and when there be no wet upon it take such ball as they use at the printer for lay the ink upon the letter and when you ball be equally cover with printer s ink strike it gently four or five time on the back of the leaf till all the vein be black with the ink then lay you leaf on trencher or small board with the black side upwards and then wet piece of white paper to be somewhat more than moist and lay it on you leaf and upon that lay smooth trencher press it very hard but not so much as to break the fine fibre of the leaf by this means you will have fine imprefsion but it would be still more easily do if you could get piece of wood make like cylinder about foot long and at inch and half diameter and cover the middle part of it abous six oreight inch long with woollcloth roll three or four time about with this roller roll the wlite paper that ly upon you leaf backward and forward four or five time and you will have very curious impression theneceary for this work be gallypot of printer ink couple of small ball such as the printer use to lay the ink equally on the leaf and the roller man tion but where printer ink can not be get then take the follow method to take the impression os any leaf as certain as the formway onsy use such thing as may be have in any part op england when you have no printer ink rub tke back of leaf as before mention with linseed oyl burnt a then strew some powder of black lead or for want of that some charcoal or small coal dust or the pow der of burnt cork equally upon fmooth board just to cover it stroke it over smoothly with the blade of knife knife and when the back of the leaf be oylclap it apon the board and then put you white paper upon the black side of the leaf either press it or roll it as before but if none of these ingredient should be find vermillion may always be find at a apothecaryand mixing this with fresh butter to the consistence of printer ink cover you printing ball with it and dab they upon the back of the leaf and so take off you impression as aforesaid the reason why the back of the leaf be the proper side to make the impression from be because the rib or vessel rise on that side above the fleshy part of it and therefore when they be colourwith any of these ink will give a impression but in the front or fore side of leaf the fleshy part rise and these sine fibre be sunk below they memorandum where vermillion be use blue bice may be use either with butte or with oyl as follow fine red or blue printer ink for make impression of this fort grind either vermillion or blue bice with some burnt linseed oyl and use it as you would do the other printing ink the blue should chuse for this work because if we should colour the leaf the blue would be a agreeable colour to the green fort the method of takingoff the leave of plant in plaister of paris lo that they may afterwards be cast in any I ¬ tal those person who cast in metal have frequent occasion to use leave of several sort to embeilisn they work which be generally make from model do by the hand which take up great deal of time and at last be imperfect but the follow way which ilearnt from gentleman in italy be much easier when you have gather the leaf you desire to take a impression from lay it between the leave of bool till it will lye flat then upon smooth board with strong gum water make of gum arabic six the foreside or front of the leaf to the board when this be do raise about it à little wall of course paste half a inch high or if you can conveniently surround you piece of wood with pasteboard or card paper so close that it will hold liquid for some time then oyl the back of you leaf as be recommend in the chapter for casting of medal and pour on water and plaister of paris as be there direct which whentis dry will give you a exact impression of every vein of the leaf and from which you may easily make mould to cast in as you fancy direct you the manner of make the impression of any buttersly in à minute in all they colaur when yon have take buttersly kili it without spoiling the wing and contrive to spread they in fly manner as regularly as may be then take piece of white paper and with small brusn or pencil wasn part of the paper with gumi water little thicker than ordinary so that it may dry at a easy rate then lay you butterfly on the paper and whentis well fixt cut away the body close to the wing and throw that way then lay the paper on fmooth board with the fly upwards and on that another paper upon which put smooth trencher and great weight upon that or else put you whole preparation into ascrewpress and serew it down very hard let it so remain for a hour then take off you butterslywing and they perfect imperfection with all they beautiful colour mark distictly will remain on the paper have do several this way which answer very well and to explain the reason why it can be so you must understand that all the sine colour observe on butterfly s wing be properly feather which stick to the gum so falt that when the gum be dry they leave the wing when you have do this draw between the wing of you impression the body of you butterfly and colour you draw of that body after the life chap iv of takeoff medal instantly by various way not know it may be useful to some people to learn another way of preserve to themselves good specimen and fine design of medal that be such as may serve to draw from at any time and many thousand of these specimen may be take in one day at trisling expence one method be to take lchthyocolla isinglass which be sell at the druggist and be calllikewise fishglue it be make up in roll twist in the form of figure of eight this be break to piece take about a ounce and dissolve it in water enough to cover it over the fire stir it gently till all be dissolve then with camel s hair brushi stroke some of this glue over the medal you want to take off when all the surface be coverd let they lie till the glue be hardenand then with the point of fine needle or pin raise the edge of the glue from each medal and the whole impression in glue will sly off as hard as horn with all the sine sharpness of the medal as if it be strike this glue may be make of any colour we please by mixing the colour we want in the water we melt the glue in five hundred of these impression in glue will not weigh above half a ounce dryimmediately not in a hot sun nor in damp place but regularly if we use the isinglaf without any colour mix with the water we may when we take we copy from the medal breathe gently on the concave side of they which in some measure will moisten we medal and then lay it upon piece of the thickest sort of leafgold which will stick to it and by fhine through the isinglass willappear like gold medal and if we would imitate copper medal we should mix carmine with the water we dissolve we isinglass in when prescribe water for this end it be because it will do well and may be have any where but brandy or spitit of wine will give glue much greater strength so as to be less subject to soften by damp air when mention thistis from a experiment make for preserve the natural colour of flower several vear which may be useful to the curious who use this glue on any occaasion and be as follow to preserve the leave of tatip make some card paper into the figure of drippan and with strong mixture of gum arabick and water six they to the card then pour on gently warm some of the isinglass prepare with brandy or spirittill the leaf be quite coverand in a hour or two the liquor will become hard and by keep the air from the flower will preserve it in all it be colour for several ycar the same may be do with the blossom of the auricula which will preserve all they colour as if they be paint shall now mention the manner of take off Idal of the largest sort which will still preserve to ua the delincation of many curious piece and valuable design for this use with tuft of sine cotton little grease with sallad oyl rub the medal gently over and melt some stone brimstone enough to cover the medal half a inch thick then put a hoop of stiff paper round the edge of the medal and when the brimstone be melt and not too hot pour it on thé medal and as soon as it be fix and harden if you untie the hoop the impression on the brimstone come clean from the medal which will produce sharp and correct mould to cast another from in plaister of paris but this should not be use on silver Idal because it will change they colour if the medal be silver use the same method of bind they round with paper and oyle they mix à little plaister of paris with water and fill the hoop with it then immediately sill the case in sprinkling manner with the same plaister till if harden and when it be dry take it from the medal but from the mould cast in brimstone which be concave we again cast such medal in plaister of paris as be convex oyle the mould as before and use the plaister of paris as above direct so you may take off any medal or fine bassrelief with great deal of exactness even so as to form medal from they in any fort of metal but there be no one that know so curiwe in the management of this affair as mo pingo in neu stree square near shoe lane london there be method of take off impression in plaister of paris from copperplate by oyle in minûte degree the plate and then bind they about either with cardpaper or other paste board and pour on some of jthe finest plaister of paris and water you can get and finishiing the work with plaister till it become dry and harden you will then have fine im ¬ pression if one may so call it of the line of the plate in the plaister which will serve to draw from when you have occasion we may add still the manner of take off any fine engraving from the top of snuff box or watchcase which be only hold they over the smoak of candle till they be quite black then wipe off the black with the soft part of the palm of the hand and lay on the engrave piece of white paper little wet with spunge and over that thin piece of flannel or piece of broin paper hold hard down over the engrave part and be hard rubbthe paper next the picture will receive fine impreffion as if it have be passthrough rollpress we may yet recommend another method of take off medal in great perfection which be by get thin piece of lead and place the medal horizontally on the top of firm post or any steady place lay over the lead flat piece of harder metal and over that place piece of round turnstick such as be use in the staff of broom sawn off above five or six inch in length and hold that tight with you left hand on the lead and flat piece of metal strike the top of the stick smart blow with large hammer and the lead will be perfectly impresswith the image of the medal medal this blow must be do at once to render the impression perfect even this may be do on any impression make on seal wax we may likewise take off medal by lay over it piece of thin sheet blocktin otherwise call foyle which be sell at the same place where the plaister of paris be to be have or at some pewterer shop and rub it hard upon the medal it will give we very good likeness of whatever medal we rub it upon the blocktin sheet mean be such as be lay on the back of glass when they be to be silverto render they lookglass we may also take impression from medal with putty such as the glazier use although the medal or bassrelief be underwrought another way of take off medal be to provide the scrap or shaving of white paper which you may have at the book binder you must boil they well in common water till they be tender then bruise they well in mortar till they come like paste and boil they again in springwater with little gumarabick and let this mixture settle while pour the water from it through sieve or linnencloth and what remain be extraordinary good to either press into any mould or upon any medal and when the paste be dry it will come off very sharp some medal that be underwring can not be take off this way therefore in such case we must take common glue with water melt it and when we have fixt hoop of pasteboard round the edge of we Idal pour on the glue hot have first oylthe Idal with lump of greasy cotton when the glue be dry and hard we must take off the hoop and the glue will sly from the edge of the medal and it will then easily come off be subject to bend and give way which the other thing before mention will not do we should mind to make we glue strong enough and pour it on one third of a inch thick when we have take the impression by this means we must hoop round we mould of glue with cardpaper or or pasteboard as before and oyl it so that no bubble or blister may be see that be to say just make it greasy then we may cast some plaister of paris in it and we shall have good copy of the medal when this be dry the glue will fly off or may be break off and we shall have good pattern to cast from we may likewise make putty of linseedoyl and sine ground starch which be well work together into paste will take good impression from any Idal this be much better than the common putty when we have these mould we may cast in they good medal in beewax but they will come off much sharper if the mould be in brimstone than if it be in plaister of paris but when we do this we wax should be as well blanchor whiteas one would use for wax candle it be however necessarv to grease the mould before we pour in we wax as have direct before however thot recommend white wax as preferrable to the other would not chuse to have the copy of the medal white for the darker colour shew the figure much better if we would have we copy of red colour we must mix vermillion with we wax whentis meting or if blue put into we melt wax some stoneblue well beaten or ground as soon as we wax medal be cold enough to take off we should lay some leaf gold upon they and with piece of cotton press it down gently without rubbing it backward or forward and that will gild we medal when we have cast medal in plaister of paris to make they look like steel or metal we must rub they over with piece of cotton dipt slightly in oyl and then put on they some powder of black lead and rub they well with brushi such as be wefor the toothtill the whole be equally coverand they will have fine gloss upon they but we may make the plaister of paris medal of the colour of box by boiling they in linseed oyl and it will harden they so as to bear the brush to be cleanif any dust get at they if we would have we plaister of paris medal of yellow or golden colour we must take little pearl affi and boil it in pint of watertill it make strong lixivium then put in about half quarter of pint of french berry and boil they till the liquor be of very strong yellow and use this liquor with we plaister of paris instead of common water if we would have we plaister of paris medal be of blue colour we must boil some lacmus or litmus in river watertill the water be as blue as we think pro per and must use this water with we plaister when we cast medal to render it of fine colour if we would have we plaister medal of red colour we should boil little rasping of brasil wood in pale stale beer and when it be strainoff use it as common water with the plaister have not yet trywhather the sine transparent gum make of verdegrease will mix with plaister of paris but have good reason to judge that it will and as ia be cheap enough fuppose it woald not be unworthy any onetryal have often think that by these means one might easily collect set of all the coin of we nation and to distribute they as one should in the several king reign they would make no disagreeable furniture be placin proper order the gold by themselves of each kingreign with he figure and the reverse by one another and under it the value of the coin then the silver in they proper order and the braf or copper or pewter for such we have have and even the leather coin should not escape we notice or to improve this if we have time to spare and good opportunity we might have the resemblance of the coin of every country and by write the value of each of they such collection would be of use the traveller as well as to historian the eafiest way of do this would be with the lchthyocolla or fisniglue and so for the gold coin ase leaf gold as before direct for the silver leafsilver and for the copper leaf copper which be make in germany or else for silver we should make we medal with foyle as before direct and for the lea the coin mix à littie fuller earth with the water or spirit before we melt the fisnglue or isinglass in it so far have give instruction how we may either make drawing from the life or coppy whatever we think proper from print painting medal though we know nothing of draw before of colour for illuminating of print in the best manner or of painting in watercolour colour be to be distinguished in the following manner we must first take white the next yellow the next orange and then proceed to the red after that the purple then to the blue and after that to the black observe white and black be the extreme of colour then in the next place yellow be the lesser point of colour towards the white and the next to that be the green and after that the blue speak of this because every one who have mind to know the manner of colour of print or painting in miniature may profit by it shall begin then with regard to colour of print if the paper be pure white use no colour upon it unless in the shade part and then in painting of flower if they tend towards reddishi colour use faint colour of carmine with gum water upon the shade only if blueisn use little faint indigo in gumwater slightly passover the shade easily touching upon the light where there be yellow tinge either use faint tincture of gamboge or of french berry which will be describe among the yellow or if the white have purplish cast ule thin lake on the shady side suffer thecolour only to shine little into the light it will give lustre to the white and if greenish cast should be there use either faint colour hardly to be disgernof the sap green or in proportion of the sap green mixwith the verdegrease green ail these colour mentionto shade the white may be find in the follow direction chap vi of white for painting in miniature the best white that be pretend to be sell in the watercolour manner be the flake white which be better than the whitelead ground this if it be pure far exceed the white lead in beauty for the white lead be apt to turn blackiss especially if you use it with hard water but the best white that know be madeof pearl or the finer part of oystershell make into a impal¬ pable powder that be so soft as to feel like grounds of starch or powder for the hair when we touch it with the finger this be call by some of the colour man pearlwhite buttis hard to be find if we have occasion to use it this white will mix well with any colour but if we use whitelead let it be first rectified with white wine vinegar which will cause fermentation and soon make the white settle then pour off the vinegar and wash it with common water that be put the powder into glass of water stir it about and presently pour off the water while it be white into some clean receiver and when the white part be settle pour off the water from thence and they will be extremely fine mention this that every one may make they colour of the finest fort it may be perhaps littie trouble but who would not use such pain to be superior to any thing that have be do before in the same way when the white we speak of be settle add to it as much gumwater as be necessary to bind it or give it glaze but take notice that would not have any white use in colour of print but only with dry colour when we paint in miniature it be remarkable that white lead will change black if the water we use with it come from lron or clay when say black mean that in month or two you will find the place where it lie the thickest ting with black and whentis mix with any other colour it will soon change or alter it for this reason have trydiver sort of white among other the powder of eggshell of the brightest colour and well cleanand washbe very good to be ground with gum water or else put about twentieth part of clear white sngar candy to grind with it in water reduce this as fine as possible that be to the state of what we call a impalpable powder and use it gentleman whom have give this receipt to tell I that it be still more to the purpose to pour it on some rectifyspirit of wine which he say will clear it from the dross but have not trythe experiment suppose that when the spirit of wine have do it be work it must he pouroff and then the part leave behind must be mixwith gumwater again but that egg shell powder be of great service as white in watercolour know very well and that also itself and oystershell powder well rectisy and mix with the white of a egg well beaten will make a extraordinary mixture with other colour and correct they from change or alter they quality while be speak of white for illuminating of print as have already observthat the clear white of the paper be proper to be leave uncolourso if it happen that the paper be give to fink as it be call or to spread any water colour we lay upon it more than isn ecessary then the way to correct it be as follow we must fix the paper in such station as may only receive the colour we lay on to glaze just as far as we designit then take some starch boiland prepare in water of middle strength and with large paintingbrust stroke it over the back of the print and when it be well dryin the air or sun put the print in book with weight upon it to rectify the crumpling which it may receive by wet of it so will any print be make to receive watercolour as one would have they be distribute and none of they will then run farther than we intend there be a earth bring sometimes from cbina of very soft nature and very white which find be better in watercolour than any of the rest but t be very scarce chap vii of yellow there be some object which have the appearance of gold shine through the colour of green red or blue such as some fort of fly and beetle and such as the cantharide which last sort every one may buy at the druggist this goldtranparency be very well imitate by lay on the drawing some leafgold on the shade part little give in to the light side of the print the wzy of lay on of leafgold be to wasn the part where the gold be to be with strong gum water and soon after that put the gold on as smooth and even as possible press it downose with cotton but take care that when you lay on the gum water you do not exceed the limit xou would have the gold appear to shine in this case the gold be only to snine through the transparant colour which be to be lay upon it now it must be understand that the leafgold will not regularly receive watercolour so that to tender it subservient to ou purpose we must with little thin liquor of ox gall in painting brush of camel s hair stroke it over and then it will receive any co . lour we have mind to paint upon it and hold it so you may have gold green gold red and purple bly or what you please the green may be first the verdigrease green which shall describe hereafter or the sap green or lake or carmine if they be good or for purple lake and fine indigo or carmine and indigo and for the bly indigo on the dark side and on the light side little stroke of ultramarine blue just to shine into the light and it will have wonderful effect one may find upon rosetree in june and july beetle of green goldcolour which will serve to govern this kind of painting as for gold of itself would not advise it to be use unless we polish it and then you may take the follow method we see in many manuscript fine gold letter which rise above the surface of the volume or paper these have raise the admiration of the curious and the manner of make they be but little know the composition which raise they above the paper be make as be well informof vermillion and the white of a egg whiskor beaten up to that consistence as be calla oyl worktogether like kind of paste and with stamp six s to the paper with gumarabick on this figure of letter wasn with camel s hair pencil some strong gumwater take care that the gum do not reach more than the qoutline then lay on the leafgold close with some cotton and as soon as it be dry rub it with some dry cotton and then polish it with dog s tooth this will make it appear as if it be really cast in gold there be yet another way of work these thing in gold and that be by use the gold which be preparin shell but it must be pure gold and not such as be bring froin some place in germany which will change green in few day time before you use this gold cover the snady part with vermillion and then after you gold be well rectify with spirit of wine lay it on with gumwater which will mix with it very well and when it be dry polish it with dog s tooth chuse when lay on this powder gold to leave the light vacant of it and it make much brighter appearance than if one be to cover the object all over but if one be to cover by accident the whole piece with gold there be no better way to set it off than by trace over the shady part with gallstone or which be much preferable the yellow which shall give the composition of below make of frexch berry mean that which be the deepest in colour little minium brightens it very much but see how rectify the minium amongst the ren and polish the gold before you use any minium to it since have mentiongold iam next to speak of the yellow as they fall gradually in they course of strength the arst be kind of straw colour and be make of flower of brimstone which in itself be fine enough to mix with gumwater and the manner of prepare gumwater since have not yet mentionit shall insert at the end of this treatise of colour common way of illuminating of print be by give the tincture of gamboge for yellow and this may be of two or three fort either fainter or stronger the last to be shade to the first and that to be shade with the preparation of french berry which shall presently mention the great mo . boyle have leave some papers behind he that be never publishwhich my lord carleton give I and shall insert occasionally in this treatise with regard to yellow colour he say that if the root of barberry be cut and put in lixivium make strong with water and pearl ashy there will be fine yellow colour produce from it which have try and succeed very well another way mo . boyle propose to make transparent yellow which be to take the root of the mulberry which afford very yellowisn juice to wash it well from the earth in common water and boil it in the lixivium speak of make with pearl ash and water from this we may take out strong tincture much deepper than the former but the root of the mulberry be much harder to be have than those of the barberry for mulberrytree be very scarce and the barberry be in almost every hedge in essex about litilebury especially with zegard to the barberryroot think it would be worth while to plant they on purpose for the ad vantage that one might make from they by die the fruit in my opinion be of little signification but the root and the wood think will nearly answer the same end in produce fine yellow yellow oker will make another good pale yellow but for illuminating of print it be colour rather of toomuch body however be well ground with gum water it be of use after it have be well wasnanother good yellow may be make from the plant callcelandine infuse it in water and press it gently and then boiling the liquor with little allum this yellow will be little inelining to green but the yellow which like the best and may be use in several capacity of light and strength be that make of french berry prepare as follow take of french berry a ounce whole and boil they in pint of the lixivium make of pearl afhy and water till the liquor will give fine tinge of yellow to bit of paper dippin it then pour it off from the berry and whentis cool put it in bott for use but if we only put french berry to infuse in common water they will produce good yellow but then it will not be durable then again add half pint of the same lixivium to the berry and half a ounce of fresh berry and boil theytill the liquor be as deep as gallstone which will serve to fnade all the yellow you can use of any fort you may boil this even to produce brown lour and with little ox gall it will serve to shade any leafgold that have be lay onaper as direct before and be much preferable to gallstone in imitate any goldcolour it answer well upon tincture of gamboge or any of the former yelbw next to this be the tincture of saffron which with common water only afford bright reddish yellow such as one would have to cover the shadow s part of print for a orange or beld goldcolour how¬ ever there be nothing more high when we use saffron than when we infuse it in rectify spirit of wine but then the colour fly unless we load it with gum arabick as have try as for deep yellow with body dutch pink come the nearest to the aforesaid strong yellow make of french berry in point of colour and of lighter yellow be the englisb pink which be still make of french berry and in body likewise can not help observe that one may extract yellow colour for illuminating of print from the fresh root of ginger if one can get nothing else speak this because sometimes one want good yellow and any one may find this any where if gamboge can s be have and it make fine green with the transparent verdegrease shall hereafter mention this last hint take from mo . beylepapers it be again to be remarkd that the engliss and dutch yellow pink be make with french berry ground to fine powder and boil chap viii of orange colour the orangecolour which be useful to wasn fine print with consist in lay on teint of gamboge and over that some of the minium or redlead by belbe mean the boiling of pure gold in liquor which will take away the yellow of it and bring it to be of reddish or higher colour such as shall describe to be wassiand renderfine and fit for use fgr as it be buy at the shop it ie not by any means hne enough to paint with and especially will change or turn black after few week if it be not refinbut if it be well prepare will be very lasting and beautiful but we must take this by the way that in the refine of it two ounce will not produce above grain of good colour to stand the test of the painter shall presently describe the methoo of prepare it this colour may be mix witk gamhoge upon white dutch tile to render it of the teint we desire either soft or stronger or one may glaze the gamboge and strengthen it with tincture of saffron tg make it glare into strong orange chap ix of minium or the brightest redlead and how to prépare it he minium or red lead be as heavy and strong colour as most we have but be the most delightful one when well prepare that be whentis well washand cleanof it be more weighty part which occasion it to turn black my way of do it as the gieat mo . boyle direct be to put or ounce of it in quart of rainwater then stir it and pour off the vaater immediately and let it settle to the bottom of very cup or glass you pour it in then pour off that water and in day s time you will have the colour dry and as fine as you can be ni put then alittle piece of gum arabick to each glass or cup and as much water as will moisten each of they use any of these asterwards withthe guin water as shall be hereafter direct but if the gum you should happen to put in at first may be strong enough to glaze it then use only common water in word as you colour be less gemmor overgummuse less or more gum water kr of itselftis dead colour when you use this colour touch it gently on the yellow we have mention into the light side and if it want shade there may be little vermillion put upon it but vermillion be too heavy to paint with when we illuminate print because it hide the shade of the engiaver however sometimes they have better be hide than preserve for my part generally shade this red lead or minium with carmine which give it fine effect and render it equal to the brightest red flower ever see leave still the light uncoloured only dafh ittle way into the light with the minium vermilion must advise to be leave out of the questi on unless it be well be nias have direct the minium to be and then chiefly for dry painting one may be abandon it should be quite leave out of my table of colour but speak at that time to such person as can use it moderately and with judgment for all heavy colour will drow the shade or stroke of the en¬ graver when the carmine have shiad the minium or redlead it may be shade again with lake in the strongest part to bring it to deeper red it may be wonder to some that when speak of orange colour should mention some of these deep sort tend to purple but mention they as shade and without which the orange or red could not appear with any brightness ch ap of red sect of scarlet when we have pass the orange we next conie to the scarlet which may be represent on plane with minium little mixwith vermillion but if you have occasion to paint flower of searletcolour on print let you light as well as shade be cover thin with minium and the shade part glazed with carmine which will produce a admirable scarlet such as we see in the flower of the scarlet martago sect ii of crimson from the scarlet we next come to crimson which be represent with carmine but must inform the verson who be to useit that there be several fort of it some darker and some much coarser than other and therefore it should never be buy by candlelight unless of such as one can well trust for between the very best and the worst sort there be about ten shilling difference in a ounce or indeed all the money a ounce will coit tor the bad will spoil all we work sec iii of lake fterthis crimson coméi next the lake which snade and heighten the carmine but it be to be observthat in the lay of carmine upon print let you light be touch only with very thin teint of it hardly to be discerned then just on that part of the light which enter upon the shade lay it on strong and cover the shade with it and after that on the stronger part of the shade lay some lake sect iv of transparent crimson ut we may make à liquid colour not much in¬ ferior to carmine itself with the rasping of brasilwood sell at the drysalter and particularly at the great colourshop at holborn bridge which mention because have be some time without know where to find it for sew colourshop know what it be and lover of painting in this way be now and then impa¬ tient to have such thing and unacquainted where to find they out to make this transparent colour we may take a ounce of the rasping of brasilwood and boil it in twelve ounce of pale stale beer and little allum till the colour of the liquor be as ftrong as you please which you may discover by dip into it slip of white apaper and when the colour be as you would have it and tis cold pass it through linnencloth and put the clear liquor into bottle for use this be one of the receipt have from manuscript of the great mo . borle and if we have mind to bring this colour to body take ox blood and dry it till we can reduce it to powder which be mix with it will give we colour which think will be little less in value than middle sort of carmine and as gentleman of learning and good understanding in these matter inform I the blood of a ox or cow so dry will make good body for any colour sect crimson from mo . boyle iak the fruit of the berry bear spinach which be know to every gardener about zondox they and you will have beantiful red colouruice from they boil this and put about afourth part of alum to it when you pour it into the vefsel wheretis to cool and then it make as sine colour as any ¬ thers that be note and it be of little expence for it will grow any where and in one bunch of the fruit there be seed enough to sow two or three rod of ground the red beetroot back with little strong vinegar produce a elegant red colour equal to tincture of carmine then pour it on alum and whentis cooltis fit for use where carmine should be use in wasning of print for it be à sine transparent red sect vi indianred ext tothese colour indianred though it be coour of body be helpful for back ground for flower at distance be use thereby with gumwater water but shall have occafionto give a example of it by and by have lately see a earth bring from the isle of wight of much siner colour than the indianred which and some other have tryand find to mix extreamly well with gum water though as it be of viscous nature it require less gum than most other colour and as it be naturally fit for use without grinding and be viscous so it will asfuredly mix as well witk oyl as with water this be discover by edward liste esq to which gentleman we owe many more extraordinary thing of value there be one thing very extraordinary in this earth simple astis that if we rub dealboard with it it render it exactly of the colour of mohogany wood and stain it so deep and with so much strength that it be very hard to get it outwithout wash and dry as this earth be when receivit can not get it out of some papers which by accident be mixin myocket with it so that be persuade it will prove of extraordinary use when it be virtue come to be khowe sect vii of transparent purple fter this we may make transparent purple either more red or nearer the blue colour as we shall see occasion by ufe the same menstruum as be prescribe in the former viz of pale stale beer one pint in which boil one pint of rasp brafilwood and half a ounce of log wood or campechywood till the liquor be heightento the colour you desire which you must try by dip piece of paper into it if you then find it too red add quarter of a ounce of log wood to the brasilwood and you will find it much nearer the purple than the former and so one may have mour any degree of purple as you put more or less log wood to the former composition and six the colour with little alum this will produce such clear purple as no mixture of solid red and bly can pro duce and the receipt have be for à long time keep secret madam madam mariana of amsterdam who have be sofomoa for she painting in minature and she excelent manner of illuminating print tell I that the best purple éould use might be compose between the carmine and indigo which to strengthen on the red side one may add lake between the lighter and darker part which have in many case find to be good and of significancy and so lake when it be use in the same way on the forego purple or the liquid crimson produce very fine effect one may vary the colour of the purple either redder by put more carmine or bluer by use more indigo which be mix on white dutch tite will shew itself ch ap xi of blue sect of tbe ultramarine hhe first and best bright blue we have be the ui tramarine blue which give spirit to all painting where bly be use but it be very dear if we have the best even worth or at least sell at sixound a ounce it be make from the lapis lazuli divest of its gold and ground and make into a impalpable powder this colour however as it be of very high price will make good it be value in painting as the leastouch of it be enough to illuminate flower in use it leave the white or light part of the flower uncoloured except that on the edge of the light next tlie shade lart colour it with uitramarine and little into the shade part of the print add faint tincture of indigo tne indigo cover little the verge on the shady side of the ultramarine so will you flower if it be bright blue appear extreamly beautiful this be colour of body and will last as long as one would desire and even preserve any colour you can mix with it to use it singly there be nothing more dazl a appear in the case of colour lrongate which ma¬ ny year ago be execute at the entrance of devonshirehouse in picadilly this colour be lay upon the iron work at the expence of many hundred pound and remainin great beautytill they be take down and the entrance of that palace alter which shew that this colour will not change though it suffer all kind of weather fortis compute that they have be expose upwards of sixty year but the best colour of this fort be rarely to be meet with sect ii of the prussian blue the prussian blue be the next to the ultramarine for beauty if it be use in oyl though imagine it will not hold so well as the forego consider it have riot the body of ultramarine this colour however be attempt to be ground in water but there be such a oily quality in it that it do not mix kindly with water and at the best will change as it be now prepared in the common way it have be attempt to make blue ink which indeed hold the colour for monthor two but then turnto muddy yellow so when you put you pencil with gum water into chell of this blue you will find where the water spread the blue will change yellowisn till the body of the blue be well stirrup and when we have do we best with this cowe in water it will only serve to shade ultramarine with but in oyl it serve very well for the present tosill the place of ultramarine sect iii blue bise the next colour to the forego for brightness be that which we call blue bise which thol it be colour of body will flow pretty well in the pencil espe¬ cially if it be well wasn as have direct the white and the minium to be do sect iv of sander blue after this colour the sander blue be of very good use and may serve as shade for ultrama¬ rine or the blue bise where the shade be not require to be extremely deep and be of itself pleasant blue to be lay between the light and shade of such flower as be of mazarine blue astis call sect of lacmus or litmus blue nother blue which be beautiful colour and will run in pen as free as ink be make of lacinus or as some call it litmus which may be meet with at most druggist this colour however be never meet with prepare for water colour and therefore shall set down the follow method of prepare it becording to mrs . mariana for it afford bright colour which have extraordinary effect take of lacmus one ounce and boil it in about pint of small beer wort till thecolour be as strong as you desire then pour off the liquor into gallipot and let it cool for use it will soon become jelly and by degree grow hard this colour however be to be pene again and make liquid by water so as to be usell as ink and as it be render thinner or thicker so will it be paler or darker by what find of this lacmus it be not only beautiful but a holding colour for have some design coloured withit inthe year which still preserve themselves in as much beauty as they have at first and have see some in holland which be say to be do with it forty year before which year or two ago lookd still as fresh as one would desire the first day one use it this colour however if it be touchwith aqua fortis immediately change to fine crimson little inferior to carmine and then sink quite through the paper so as not to be get out so that when we use this colour as hue it be best to preserve it from aquafortis or such strong acid it be good shade for ultramarine or blue bise where the strongest shade should not be extremely deep and for colour of print it be very good as it betrunspapent colour and gogreat way sect vi of indigo undigo be the next colour fhall speak of as it certainly make the strongest shade for bly of any other and be soft and warm colour when it be well ground and wafhiwith gumwater by means of stone and muller as one happen to want the use of this put more gum water to it if you would have it of the lightest cast or less as you would have it darker but besoie you touch you print with it try it be strength upon white dutch tile for it run warmly in the pen¬ cil and may chance to be too strong for yeu design which you should always think of when flow colour be to be lay over dark shade of print which shade will much aggravate it be blackneis and even make it appear quite black sect vii fine blue from mo . boyle take the blue leave of rhue and beat they little in stone mortar with wooden pestel then put they in water juice and all for fourteen day or more wash they every day till they be rotten and at last beat they and the water together till they be in pulp and let they dry in the sun this will produce as good blue as indigo and be much softer but to keep it long while when you beat it the last time add little powder of gumarabick you may put more or less of the gum as you design to make it more free or tenacious in the working tis fine elue for shad and have good body and run warm in the pencil sect viii of mo . boyle s transparent blue equal to uitramarine in the next place have colour to describe wliich take from the great mo . boyl s manuscript give I by my lord carleton and prove beautiful blue and what admire it for the more be because the chietof the ingredient it be compose of may be easily have during four of the semmer month that be the cyanus or blue cornbottlesl wer which abound in almost every cornfield child may gather it without hurt any thing about the skirt or verge of the cornfield this flower have two bly in it one of pale colour in the larger outward leave and the other deeper blue which lie in the middle of the flower both these will do if they be separate from the button or case they grow in but the deep blue of the middle produce much the best colour as one may try by rub it whileit be fresh so hard upon piece of good writ paper as to pref out the juice and it will yield a excellent colour which will not fade as the experience of two or three year have shew I this part of the flower be therefore the principal and what be to be depend upon therefore the same day that people ga¬ the the flower or the next at the latest employ some child to pick that part clean from the rest and when you have good quantity press what juice you can from it and by add to that little allum you will have last transparent blue of as bright stain colour as you would desire and in my opinion it be not inferior in beauty to ultramarine but for the other part of the flower which be paler must observe that when have bushiel of they gather and have not a opportunity of press they immediately they change white so that can not commend they leave the alum should not fixthey but as for the middle of the flower it be certainly as good blue as can be desire and be durable if any one should objece that t will be troublesome to make it let he consider only what pain there be in gather and cure of saffron which sometimes be sell at thirty shilling the pound and seldom bring three pound per pound but blue if it come up to the colour of ultramarine be worth four or five pound per ounze especially when it stain so well as this do therefore should think it worth while when any one have make this experiment as have do to have piece of ground on purpose for this use where no other thing but this cornbottle or cyanus should be sow and as this flower be plentiful enough in the field between twittenham and tedington in middlesex so there may be seed enongh gather of it in quarter of a hour to sow a hundred acre there be likewise bundance of it in the large corn field in cambriagesbire but how valuable be many thing that we daily trample under foot if we know they virtue we should use they provide we could bring they to proper market but let that be as it wili gather the flower about the beginning of june or in july or august and some you may find in may these be for you immediate work to make the colour of and must be dispatch as saffron be do or it will lose its perfection and as happen to mention saffron which very well know the management of by drying it on kiln ldo not see why thee chife of flower may not be cure in the same manner they would certainly produce much greater body of colour and tincture might be draw from they with more ease than if we be to press they raw or fresh from the field the way then that would have they drylike saffron be to provide in the first place such kiln as be use for cure saffron within which make à small charcoalfire which communicate a heat to the top of the kiln which be cover with a hair cloth and upon that lay on four or five sheet of white paper mean such as we use for cure of saffron then lay on the paper parcel of the pick flower till you have the thickness of two or three inch lay close and flat with knife and sprinkle it with some thin gumwater then cover the cake of flower with two or three more sheet of paper and lay upon they board with little weight upon it for fewminute then take off the board and take hold of all the papers with both hand turn you cake of flower upon the kiln and whentis rightly place take off the upper papers and sprinkle the cake again with some thin gum water and with knife settle you cake of flower and lay on again you papers and board with weight upon it for minute ortwo and then turn you papers again and again till the flower cake become united and of the thickness of à cake of saffron in this work you will findethe flower grow darker every time they be tarn till at length the cake will look of à deep blue tend to black from whence we easily draw such as speak off during this operation great care must be take of the fire that it do not scorch the flower let it be gentie and as constant as may be which will be sure way to bring you flowercake to good colour would advise in this case that whoever attempt this they should see the management of saffron or read becount that be publish of the cure it if any one be desirous of see the cure of saffron with the manner of the kiln the best artist that way be about chesterford and littleburry in essex though think it can be of no great moment since there be pub¬ lish large account of its preparation in mo . bradley montbly treatise of husbandry and gardening and in the present case of the blue have make the necessary alteration and think give what be sufficient for such as be acquainted already with the cure of flower by kilndrying but come now to speak of the culture of this valuable flower for must now so call it since be well assure of its perfection every knob or head of seed mustbe openbefore we sow it for each head contain great number of seed the preparation of the ground for the recption of this seed need not be more troublesome or expensive than common plough require which be do sow theseed either at the end of august which will come up soon enough to stand the winter and blossom early the may follow or else sow it at the end of march and it will begin ffower the follow june when the ground be fresh plowat either of these season sow the seed and harrowit in with bushie and it will presently come up in the choice of the seedshould observe that it be gather only in such field where we be sure there grow no corn botile of any other colour but blue and then one may expect all the plant which rise from such seed to produce blue flower but if they should be gather in such place where there be variety of they we must expect various sort as white red or purple although we be sure we gather the seed from such as be truly of the blue sort for accord to the doctrine of the generation of plant which have be explain to the world in great many instance if there be red flower of the same tribe with this grow near it the difference of colour will be so intermix between both that the seed of both will bring variety from the principal depend of the colour ofboth and thus conclude what have to say of bly as for the smalttis much too heavy acolour to be use for illuminating of print sn sn gee ee ch ap xii of black he proper black for watercolour be what they call lvory black which if it be pure and well ground be of use in minature painting but very seldom and indeed ought not to be use in colour of print if they be good fortis too heavy colour and hide the beautiful stroke of the engraver unless do with very great care lfit be necessary however to use black by way of darkening print rather chuse à strong tincture of good indiaa ink than the lvoryblack but to colour piece in miniature use the lvory black prepare as follow let you burnt lvory be wellground in gumwater and then beat the white of a egg very welltill you find kind of oily liquor settle to the bottom this liquor mix with as much of the lvorysblack as you think necessary to make it run freely in the pencil and it will afford a extraordinary gloss and if the object be fhine such as the wing of some beetle mix with somen of it little white upon ducch glaze tile tiyou find it light nough to relieve the sade and then make anotlier lighter mixture of the same which be use on the brighter part of the subject will produce the effect you desire chap xiii of green the progress of gréen from yellow to blue have already give a account of the progress of colour from white through the yellow to the orange the red purple and bly to the black and shall now treat of the green in they sevéral order from the yellow to the bly green be allow by all to depend upon the yellow and the blue and by the help of one and the other colour may be frame any green colour we please the gamboge be one of we first yellow which with the preparation of verdigrease shall insert mave be make to produce five or six sort of green accord as thegamboge abound or be in lessquantity if it abound one may make tolerable oak green with it and be still more mixd with the verdigrease green it will be grass green but the yellow that prefer before all other be that which be make of french berry describe above which have observe be of different capacity as the liquor it be boyl in be more or less stain with it when it be very thin it make good glaze all over the verdigrease and as it come nearer to duich pink or gallstone command almost any colour we want be greeably mixwith the transparent verdigrease and still be transparent so the yellow draw from the root of barberry and those draw from the koot of the mulberrytree will produce in great measure the like effect be mix with the transparent verdigrease as for the verdigrease itself it produce fine blueisft green flow easy in the pencil and may even serve a ink to write with the prepare of this colour be yet very little know and shall therefore inform my reader how to do it take of common verdigrease three ounee break it little and boil it gently in pint of whitewine vinegar stir it continually when you perceive it to boil add little tartar break and keep you mixture stirring till you find the clear liquor of such colour as you would wishi that be of sine transparent green with blue cast which you may do by dip in stick and touch piece of paper with it when you have colour to you mind pour it through linnencloth into a open vessel and set it to cool when it be quite cold keep it in close vessel for use puring out little at à time as you want it for when it be expose to the air ie will soon dry but be reducible again by common water when we prepare this liquid colour do not use the ¬ distilled verc.grease for it will not answer the end we propose this liquid should be touch upon part of the light and shade of print and the shade afterwards coloured with sapgreen in the make this green take care vou make it strong enough for it be not to be strengthn afterward without the trouble of boiling afresn but may at any time be render as faint as we please by mixing common water with it sap green be colour like that of a oak leaf if it be use thin with common water for this as well as the former want no gum but it will if we use it strong produce as dark green as any we can imagine we may try we colour first on white duicbile and by thin it with water render it of what strength we please and brighten it very much with add to it little of the liquid verdigrease sapgreen be make two way viz first take the flower of the blue flag lris or flowerdeluce and press they while there be any juice to be get from they boil this gently in glaze pipkin till it grow thick add little alum to it and it will make very useful and last green in the boyling of any juice of the colour heretofore mention use a earthen glaze pipkin for if you boil they in vessel of metal they will sometimes change from the design we intend secondly another way there be of produe sapgreen for wash or illuminating of print which be to take the juice of buckthornberry and thethat juice simply will yield only dark parple of very base hue yet by add tartar to it it will turn to good sap green and may be bring to good consistence by boiling either of these colour will mix with the liquid verdigrease above mention as well as mak à delicate shade for it there be yet one green more which be admire by some and carry good body with it with degree of transparency as make it though as it be commonly use it be fullbody colour fit only for miniature painting for this end they mix dasch pink with indigo to what degree of colour they please but in the phoe of duxrh pink my high preparation of french berry with indi go think much to be prefer as this answer all the intent of dutch pink and carry transparency with it which the dutch pink have not and thus have given such a account of the passage of green from the yellow to the darkest blue as think necessary for the instruction of those who delight in illuminating of print and painting in watercolour chap xiv tbe use and nature ef dry colour blue bise be the most excellent blue next to uitramarine which be too good to wash withal and therefore leave it out here and put in blue bise which will very well serve instead of it and indeed you may leave out both and use smalt instead of they but that it will not work so well as bise no bise be too good to use upon all occaslon but only when you intend to bestow some cost and pain upon piece otherwise you may use no other blue in you work than blue verditer with which you may make pretty good shift without any other blue mean in any ordinary work indigo be dark blue and be use principally to shadow with upon you other blue indigo and yellow berry mlx together make dark green to shadow the green with in the darkest place blue verditer be very bright pleafant blue and the easiest to work with in water it be somewhat ineline to green and be mix with yellow berry it make good green this blue be most use verdigrease be good green but subject to decay when it be dry upon the paper it will be of allighter colour than it be when vou lay it first on therefore t it from that fault put some sapgreen amongst it to dissolve it in and it will make it keep its colour this colour be of poisonous nature and therefore yon must be careful how you use it that it come not near the mouth there be distilledverdigrease to be buy at the colourshop that be far better green than the the but it be somewhat dear and the other will serve instead of it verditergreen be light green seldom use in thing but in colour landscape those place that should shew far off and it be good for such purpose because it be somewhat incline to blue but you may make fhift to do any thing well enough without it for à little blue verditer mix with copper green and little white will make just such another colour sap green be dark dirty green and never use but to shadow other green in the darkest place or elfe to lay upon some dark ground behind picture which require to be coloured with dark green but you may make fhift well enough without this green for indigo and yellou berry make juft such another colour coppergreen be a excellent transparent green of fhine nature if it be thicken in the sun or upon foft fire and it be most use of any green in wash of print especially in colour of the grassground or tree for it be most perfect grassgreen vermilion be the perfectest scarlet colour you need not grind it nor wasn it it be fine enough of itself only temper it with you finger in galiipot or oystershell with gumwater and it will be ready for use if you put à little yellow berry amongst it it will make it the brighter colour this be principally use for garment lake be a excellent crimsoncolour with it you may shadow vermilion or you yellow garment in the darkest place with it you may make sky colour be mix only with white with it you make fleshcolour sometimes mix together with white and little red lead it be of a excellent colour itself to colour garment or the like indian lake be the best lake but too good to be use to wasn print with unless you intend to bestow great curiosity upon you work but the best sort of ordinary lake will serve well enough for ordinary use but that also will be somewhat costly therefore instead thereof you may ulb red ink thicken upon the fire and it will serve very well for you purpose and better than lake unless it be very good note if you would make light sky colour of you red ink or if you would mix it among you fleshcolour you must not thicken it you should rather chuse to fhadow you vermillion with spanish brown than thick red ink which will serve well for that purpose and be much cheaper but it be not altogether so bright colour and clear red lead be the nearest to a orange colour and put à little yellow berry into some of it will make petfect orange colour but if you mean to make flesh colour of it you must put no yellow but only when you would make a orange colour this colour be use for the colour of building or highway in landscape be mixwith little white also it be the only bright colour to shadow yellow garment with to make they shew like changeable taffety it be good also to colour any light ground in picture take only the thin water of it and so for several other use as you shall see occasion for it ii yellow berry be most use in wafh of all other colour they colour be bright and transparent fit for all use and be sufficient without the use of any other yellow saffron be deep yellow if you let it stand pretty while it be good principally to shadow yellow berry with instead of red lead and it be somewhat brighter shadow but you may make shift well enough without this colour for red lead and yellow berry make just such another colour light masticoat be light yellow just like yellow berry and white and therefore you may make shift well enough without it only for save you labour to mix you yellow berry with white when you haveoccafion fora light yellow which you may sometimes make use of to colour light ground in picture and then fhadow it with the water of burnt umber or readlead that be the thinnest part of the colour ceruse be the best white if it be good and finely ground ready to you hand as you may have it at some colour shop or for want of it buy whitelead pickto you hand either of these will serve well enough for either of they be mingle with anothe colour make it lighter and the more you put the lighter they will be as you shall find in the use of spanish brown be dirty brown colour yet of great use not to colour any garment with unless it be a old man s gown but to shadow vermillion or to lay upon any dark ground behind picture or to shadow yellow berry in the darkest place when you want lake or thick red ink it be the beft and brighteft colour when it be burnt in the fire till it be zed hot though if you would colour any hare horse dog or the like you must not burn it but for other use it be best when it be burnt for instance to coloar any woodenost body of tree or any thing else of wood or any dark ground in lt be not to be use about any garment unless you would colour many old man s gown or cap stand together because they must not be all of one colour of black therefore for distinction and va riety sake you may use umber unburnt for some of they printer black be most use becanse it be easiest to be have and serve very well in wash nore you must never put any black amongst you colour to niake they dark for it will make they dirty neither should you shadow any colour with black unless it be spanisn brown when you would colour a old man s gown that require to be do of sad colour for whatsoever be shadow with black will look dirty and not bright fair and beautiful ivory burnt or for want of that bone burnt be the blackest black and it be thus make take lvory or for want of it some white bone and put it into the fire till it be thoroughly burn then take it out and let it cool and so flit it in the middle and take out the blackest of it in the middle and grind it for use chap xv of portable case for colour with direction for make gum alum and other water before however conclude this treatise of colour let I advise such person who be canrious in make observation of the colour of flower to have always in they pocket small case with colour in it about the bigness of snuff box make of lvory about half a inch thick in which should be scoope several concave about half a inch diameter each and as deep as the lvory would bear without going through these cavity may be place as near one another as possible and fill with colour of several sort and as for the liquidcolour they will dry by be expose to the air so that one may have they altogether in few day dry enough to be carry in the pocket shall suppose the piece of lvory dispose in the follow manner viz in the forego figure one may observe the disposition of the several cavity for the colour in the number and on one fide little case for pencil and another for indian iné gumarabick pordered with white sugarcandy or for any thing else a artist may have occasion for in the painting way in such case you may have thirty two sort of colour under very easy command besides other necessarie then as cover to this let there be piece of plain lvory to open with a hinge that may serve as pallet and all this will lie in very narrow compass nay even though one be to add another piece of lvory of half a inch thick to open below that of the colour to include à small pair of compass port crayon and some other such useful material for draw houv to make gum water there remain now only to mention the way how to prepare gum allum and other water in the best manner to make gumwater take of the whitest gumarabick one ounce of clear white sugar candy half a ounce dissolve these in quart of clear water and add to it if you will little coloquintida when you gumwater be thus prepare pass it easily through fine sieve or piece of mussin and keepit in bottle so stop that no dirt may get in and as you want to use it pour out à little at time for if this prove dirty or foul it will spoil the brightnef of you colour the use of the coloquintida be only to keep the fly from spoiling you work if it should be expose to make allumwater boil four ounce of allum in quart of rain or ri verwater till the allum be dissolve and let it stand twenty four hour uje of allumwater with this water wasn the print you design to colour which will six thepaper so that the colour will not sink or run in it when you lay they on and will hep likewise to brighten you colour if you paper be very thin and loose then let you paper be wash with the above water four or five time always dry before you lay any of you colour upon it but you must observe that if you design to varnisn you print after they be colourthen wash the print all over equally with white starch befgre you colour they and when that be dry lay on you colour to make limewater limewater be make by take some anslackt lime and cover it a inch with water and so let it remain for twelve hour pour off the gdar and keep it for use with this water you may change you sapgreen into blue water make witb pearlash take about half a ounce pearlashy and steep they twelve hour in rain or riverwater then pour off the clear and that water be excellent to use with brasil wood in order to enliven it be red colour size for for watercolour take the cutting of white glover s leather boil they in common water till the liquor will jelly yon may prepare any colour with this size when it be warm and it should always be use warm the use of it be that none of you colour should shine by candle light as they would do if they be to be mixt with gum water therefore the scene of playhouse be paint in size the school of miniature part iii erect for the instruction of the ignorant the improvement of proficient and the general information of such as be pleased with picture in small herein be contain the most expeditious and infallible way of draw without be teach and all the method of colour stippling illustrate by number of practical process upon each head or article particularly useful to those whe would copy in colour from print to the whole be annex many valuable receipt for prepare the colour which be peculiar to this kind of painting communicate by the best italian and other master as also the preparation of a excellent polish gold and sbell gold publish from a old mss london print and dublin be print by jackson at the globe in meath street bookseller connoisseur and artist in painting and particularly to the fair lady whounderstand and practice in miniature this most valuable piece be offer as à present every way wortby of they acceptance and attention most gbedient servant the editor london of the metbod of draw colour grounds it be not my design to make any encomium on painting many mgenious man have do that work to my hand but thoughminiature have be inelude in what they have say shall neverthelefs specify the characteristick of this kind of painting in particular it be in its nature more delicate than any of the other sort it require to be beheld near at hand it can not well be execute but in small it be performon vellum or lvory colour be moistenwith gumwater only to succeed well in you attempt this way you should know how to draw very well but as most who concern themselves in this art be but seldom skillin draw and yet would have the pleasure of painting without the fatigae of kearn to draw in which no progress be make to speak of but with time and much practice some contrivance have be start to supply the defect in this point by which person be enable to draw without know how to do it without they sect ii the first be callcal to do this you must blacken the backside of the print or draw yon would copy and have lightly brushioff the dusty particle which might adhere to and offend the clean vellum you design to use lay you original on you vellum and fasten it thereto with pin but if instead of the backside of the print or draw itself you blacken only one side of fair piece of paper put this paper between the print or draw and you clean vellum with the black side to the vellum then with blunt pin or needle trace out the principle stroke of the print or draw the out line and the fold of the draperie and whatever else require to be distinguish s bearing upon the pin or needle hard enough to leave the trace thereof on the vellum benéath sect iii reduction be another way proper for those who be not verin draw and who would notwithstanding copy picture or other piece that can not be calk it be do thus you divide the whole piece into many small and equal square which you be to make with small coal if the piece be light and with chalk if the piece be dark that in either case you square may be the more conspicuous then you must make the same number of square and of the same bigness upon paper to draw upon for if you undertake to doit at once upon vellum as you might fail in the first attempt you would run the hazard of spoiling you vellum by false stroke but the whole be duly adjust upon paper we calk it upon vellum as be say above the original and the paper be thus markout we observe what be containwithin each square of the piece we would copy as head a arm hand and so on and where each be placall which you must punc tually follow on you paper and have thus obtainthe situation of each part we join the whole together after this manner we can enlarge as well as diminisn any piece we please by only make the square on the pa¬ per larger than those on the original or smaller observe always that they be the same in number sect iv to copy picture or any thing else of the same size we ufe orl paper dry or goldbeaterskin either of these we lay upon the piece and throthey we see the stroke which we trace out with crayon or pencil .. we then take it off and make it fast to paper or vellum and hold it up to the light trace out what have be copy upon the oil paper or skin cither with crayon or silver pin by the help of window or glass hold up to the light we copy all sort of print design and other piece upon paper or vellum by fix they to the pa¬ per or vellum we would draw upon this be a easy and very good contrivance for copying of the same size lf we would make the piece look contrary way we turn the print or draw side of the original towards the glass and faften the paper or vellum to the backside of it we have also good way to take a exact copy of picture which be in oyl colour we with pencil and some lake mixup with oyl trace out all the principal stroke of the picture and thereto apply paper of the same size we pass hand over it and the stroke of the lake take the paper and aprear thereon which you may calk as before be mindful to clean the picture with the crumb of bread before the lake dry we also to the same end use coal dust containin piece of sine linnen wherewith we pounce the piece we would copy have first prick the principal stroke of it and fastendo piece of vellum or paper to the wrong side of it sect but there be way more sure and easy than any of the forego for one who have no hand at draw by the help of mathematical instrument or compass as it be sometimes call which be commonly composof ten piece of wood like ruler about the sixth of a inch thick and half a inch broad and for they length it may be foot more or less accord to the size ofthe piece you would copy but that you may not mistake here follow representation of it the board must be deal coverd with cloth of some fort or other for the more convenient fastening of the piece you would draw and what you would draw upon then plant the compass with large pin run throthe foot ifyou would draw in small you must place the original at the first foot and the vellum or paper you would draw upon near to the foot remove it to greater or less distance accord as you would have you piece greater or smaller to draw in great from small you need only shift you copy to the place of you original put the former at and the latter at and in each case you must put à crayon or silver pin into the foot over you vellum and pin somewhat blunt in the foot over you original with which you be to follow all the line while you bear with you other hand gently upon the pin or crayon on you vellum if one or the other be well sitted in the foot you need not bear thereon at all you may draw also of equal size but to do that you must plant you compaf in different manner it must be fixwith pin or axis run throthe center and the original and the copy must be at a equal distance from the center in word you may draw several copy at à time and each of different size or equal to each other just as you shall please sect vi these be all the help needful to be know by those who be unsxillin draw when you piece be sketch out upon the vellum you must with pencil of thin carmine run over all the stroke that they may not be defacin work this do clean you vellum with crumb of gread sect vii you vellum must be glue to copper plate or to piece of thin board exactly of the same size with you intend piece to stretch it upon but you vellum must be fingerbreadth larger every way than what you glue it to for you way be to lap it round behind and there glue it not offer to lay any glue under you paint not only for fear of some deformity but also because of the impossibility of take it off again but first of all you must moisten the fair side of you vellum with piece of sine wet linnen and put piece of white paper to the back side of it and so apply it to the plate or piece of board and stretch it thereon equally in all direction glue it as we just now direct viii sect the colour uiin minature painting be black lead carmine brown red uitramarine gal stone lake of all fort brown oaker vermilkon spanisn brown french pink umber orpiment gumboge bladder green verditer naple yellow masticoat pale sea green german affy masticoatyellow indigo plake white lvory black and white lead lamp black sect ix as all terrene colour and other grof substance be too coarse for fine work how well soever they may be grannd because of kind of sand which still remain you may seperate the finest particle by temper you colour in cup of water have stir it weli with vour finger and the whole be thoroughly soak let it subside for little while and then pour it off by inclination into another vessel and what you pour off will be the finest particle which you must afterwards set to dry the colour thus prepare must when vou want it be temperwith gumwater as shall be say hereafter this be good contrivance and perfectly calculatefor the delicacy of small work sect if you mix à little of the gall of ox carp or eel but chiefly of this last with all you green black grey and yellow you will give they lustre and vivacity not natural to they you must take the gall of eel when they be sxind and hang they by nail to dry and when you want any you must steep it in brandy and mingle some of it with the colour already temper it will cause the colour to take to the vellum more strongly which it will not easily do when the vel¬ lum be greasy again the gall prevent it from peel sect x i there be colour which purify by fire such as the yellow oaker brown red ultramarine and umber all other blacken thereby but if you burn the abovenamcolour with strong fire they change sor the brown red turn yellow the yellowoaker turn red the umber redden also and white lead become of lemon colour and be call masticot observe that the yellow oaker burnt cecome softer and kinder by far than before and more so than the pure brown red and reciprocally the brown red be burnt become more soft and agreeable than the pure yellow oaker they be both very good the finest and most sincete uitramarine burnt in redhot shovel become much more brilliant than before but refind aster this manner iii aer it diminishet and become coarser and harder to work with in minature sect x ii all these colour be temperin small lvory cup make on purpose or in sea shell with water in which have be previoussy dissolvgum arabic and sugarcandy for example in good glass of water put the quantity of you thumb of gumarabic and half that quantity of sugarcandy this last prevent the colour from scal when apply which they com¬ monly do without it or when the vellum be greasy this gum water you must keep in neat bottle alway stopup and never dip colourpencil into it but take it out with quill or some such thing some of this water you must pour into shell togethe with the colour you want and temper they with you finger till the whole be very fine if you find you colour too hard leave it to soften in the shell before you temper it then set it to dry and so do by all except the lris green and bladder green and gamboge which must be temper with water only but ultramarine lake and spanisi brown must be more gummthan other colour lf you use sea shell you must first soak they for two or three day in water then scower they well in hot water to clear they of certain salt which spoil the colour if not washiaway a xiii to know if you colour be sufficiently gummyou need only make stroke with you temper s colour upon you hand which will immediately dry lf they break and scale they be too much gummand if they rub out by pass you finger across they they have not enough again if you lay you colour upon vellum and upon trial find that the colour come off upon you finger like dust it be sign they be not nough gummand therefore you must put more gum into the water you use take heed though that you put not in too much for that will have hard and dry effect you colour will be glutinous and shine thus the more they be gumnthe darker they be and if you would give greater body to colour than it natu¬ rally have you need only gum it well sect x iv you must have smooth lvory pallet of the size of you hand upon which you must distribute the colour for you carnation or flesh after this manner in the middle you must put quantity of white well spread out because it be the colour most resort to and from the leave to the right of it along the side you must place the follow colour blue make of ultramasticoat orpiment marine indigo and oaker white it must be havegreen make of ultramary pale rine vermillion frenchpink and white carmine and black equal part of each on the other side of you pallet you must also spread out some white as before and when you be to paint drapery or any thing else you must near it pat the colour you intend to make they of therewith to work as shall instruct you hereafter sect xv it be of great importance that you should have good pencil when you chuse they wet they little and twirl they upon you finger if they keep they point they be good but if they break into many point of different length they be good for nothing particularly for srippling but above all for carnation when they be too sharp point with only foar or five hair sticking out beyond the rest you must blunt they carefully with pair scissar it will be proper to have they of two « this be the term in minature for making of small point or dot two or three size the largest may serve for you grounds the middle for draw and colour and and the least for finish to keep you pencil to good point you must often put it between you lip and press it and moisten it with you tongue though yon have just take up colour with it for if you have take up too much you by this means diminish it and correct you error you need fear no harm from do of this all the miniature colour if you except orpiment which be poyson have nothing displeasing to the tafte or noxious in them¬ selve when preparfor use you must be careful to repeat this very often when you be stippling or fi nishing particularly carnation that you stroke may be neat and clear as for drapery and other thing whether in the draw colour or finish of they you need not be so nice in this case it will be enough if you make you point upon the edge or rim of you shell or upon the paper you rest on when you be at work sect x vi to work as you ought you must be in room that have but one window which you must place yourself havery near to with table and desk almost as high as the window and so six yourself that the light may alway strike in on the left hand of you sect xvii when you would lay on colour equally strong every where as ground for example you must make you mixture in shell and take care that you have ¬ nough for you purpose for if they fall short you will be put to it to prepare they of exactly the same degree of light or shade sect xviii have speak of vellum pencil and colour let we now say how they be to be wefirst of all if you would paint flesn or drapery or ought else you must begin by sketch or draw with large bold but clear stroke like those who paint in oil you light muft at firft be somewhat brighter and you shade not quite of dark as be require for finish because in stippling thereon you strengthen the colour which if too dark at first would in the finish become too deep sect x ix there be several way of stippling or shad as it may be also callevery painter have he manner some do it with round point other make they longisn thers again hatch with fine stroke cross each other in all direction till the whole appear as if stip or wring with point this last method be the best bold est and soonest perfect wherefore advise all miniature painter to practise it and to accustom themselves betime to be rich mellow and soft in weir work that be that the point may be lose in the ground they be wring upon and appear but just enough to evince that the piece be stip hard and dry be the reverse of this manner of work beware thereof it proceed from stippling with colour too dark for the ground and too dry pencil which give the work rude cast or favour sect x x endeavour also to drow you colour into each other that no line of separation may be see between they and soften you stroke with the colour on each hand of they so as to be equally blend with and confound into each sect x x i when you piece be finishheighten they lighttle have fine effect that be strengthen the light with touch of paler colour than at first which must be softne away into the rest sect x x ii when the colour be dry upon you pallet or in you shell temper they with pure water and when you perceive they have lose they gum whick you will know by they easily rub out either on you hand or vellum as have say before temper they with gum water till they be in geod order sect x xiii there be several sort of grounds for picture and portrait some be quite brown with spanis brown umber with little black and white other be more yellow be mix with good deal of oaker and other be upon the grey with indigo for this work make wasn of the colour or mixture you propose or accord to the picture or portrait yon be about to copy and with this thin washi soak or prime you vellum this do lay it on thicker and spread it out boldly but uniformly as fast as you can never touch twice upon one place till it be dry because the second touch carry off what the first lay on particularly if you bear little hard upon the pencil sect x xiv there be still other dark grounds and these be of greenisn colour they be most in use and best adapted for all sort of figure and portrait because they set off the carnation to great advantage and be very easily lay there be no occasion to stipple they as must often be do to the other which be seldom uni¬ form at first whereas these hardly ever miss you must prepare they with black french pink and white mingle together in different proportion accord as you would have you ground lighter or darker lay it on thin at first then thick as before direct you may mix up grounds of other colour but these be the most common sect x xv if you be about to paint saint upon one of these grounds and would make small glory round the head of you figure you must lay on you ground havery thin in that part or even leave it naked especially just where the glory ought to be brightest at first lay on pretty thick mixtre of white and little oaker and as you move off from the head let you oaker prevail more and more and that it may die away into the ground hatch it boldly with pencil and as you pursue the round of the glory take sometimes the coloor of the glory and sometimes that of theground mixing some white or oaker when it be rather too dark and this continue till they be utterly confound or scumble into each other and that no separation between they be distinguishable sect x x vi to make ground all of glory you first lay on bright mixture of little oaker and white add more and more of the first as you draw more and more towards the extremity of the intend picture and when the oaker happen not to be dark enough for you you must go on darkening and darkening add gall stone then carmine and at last spaniss brown this ground you must lay in such manner that the different degree of darkness may as much as possible insensibly increase and strengthen then you must stipple the whole with the same colour to blend it nicely together which be thedious and difficult enough particularly when there be cloud of glory in you ground you must strengthen they light as you remove from thefigure and finisn still with stippling swell out the say cloud whose light and shade must be imperceptibly lose into each other sect x xvii for daysky you must mingle some uitramarine with great deal of white and lay it on as smooth and uniform as poffible with large pencil and broad stroke as for grounds layingit on paler and paler as you descend towards the horizon which you must make of vermillion and mine de plomb and of white of the same strength as finish the sky and even little weaker artfully blend the blue and the red which must come down to the front mingling atlast gallstone and good deal of white so that the mixture may be paler than the first and all this must be so lay on that no separation be see of the colour of this sky sect x xviii when there be to be clond in you sky youneed lay on no blue where they be to be but fketch they ont if they be reddish with vermillion gallstone and white together with little indigo and if they happen to be darker you must use great deal of this last make the light of one and the other with masticoat vermillion and white the proportion of each more or less accord to the degree of strength you would give they or accord to the original before you swell out the whole with stippling for it be hard matter to lay they on uniformly in the draw and if the sky de not sufficiently uniform you must stipple that likewise you may cover also the place of you cloud in lay on the ground of the sky heighten the light with good deal of white and deepen the shade this be the most expeditious way sect x xix night or stormy sky be make with indigo black and white mixtogether which be lay on like the day sky to these add vermillion oaker and brown red for the cloud whose light must be of masticoat or mine de plomb andlittle white sometimes redder and sometimes yellower as necessity shall require and when it be stormy sky and that in some part you see light whether bluc or red you may order they as in day sky scumble the whole together in drawing and finish chap ii drapery sect to make blue drapery put ultramarine near the white on you pallet and mix they such proportion as to produce very pale colour and ofa good body with this you may express you brighteft light light and afterwards add more ultramarine for such as be darker and so continue to do to the deepest fold and darkest shade which must be pure ultramarine and all this must be do with broad stroke of the pencil with adue regard have to the scumble of the different degree of light and shade lofe the light into the shade with colour not so pale as the light or deep as the shade then stipple the whole with the same colour and the same degree but somewhat strongly that the point may be see the whole must flow imperceptibly together that the fold may not appear cut and no line of separation be see when the uitramarine happen not to be dark enough for the deepest shade how much soever it may be gum you may mix indigo with it to give they the last degree of depth and if the light be not strong enough they may be heightenwith white and very little uitramarine sect ii carmine drapery be do after the same manner with the blue except that in the darkest place you lay on vermillion before you use the carmine which be applywithout any white and in the deepest snade it must be well gummto deepen it the more add little bistre sect iii there be also another drapery all of vermillion with mixture of white for the light lay it on single upon the darkest part and add carmine for the deepest shade you finish then with the same colour as in other drapery and if the carmine and vermillion together be not strong enough take carmine alone but only for the deepest shade sect iv drapery of lake be do like that of carmine mixing good deal of white therewith for the light and but very little for the shade you be to finish with stippling but we use no vermillion sect purple drapery be make by the same rule have first preparmixture of carmine and uitramarine and continually use white for the light if you would have it columbine or light purple you carmine must be in greater quantity than you ultramarine but if you would have it more blue and deep let there he more ultramarine than carmine sect vi for flesncolour drapery begin with lay on pale mixture of white vermillion and lake and shade with the same colour diminish thequantity of the white this drapery must be very pale and delicate because it must represent à slight stuff and cyca the shade must not be dark sect vii for yellow drapery lay on all over first masticoat and then over that gamboge except only the lightest part where you must leave the masticoat pure then you must shade with oaker mingle with little gamboge and masticoat increase and decreaf the quantity of this last accord to the strength of you shade and when you want to be still darker add gallstone moreover you may work with gallstone alone for the deeper snade add thereto bistre if it be not dark enough you finisn with the colour you begin with stippling and blend the light with the snade sect viii if you use naple yellow or french pink instead of masticoat and gamboge you will have another sort of yellow sect ix green drapery be producby colour all over with verditer verditer with which if it prove too blue for you you may mix masticoat for the light and gamboge for the shade then add proportion of sad green to shade with and as you shade grow very deep you must add the darker green and even use they unmixwhere you want to be extreamly dark you finish with the same colour à little darker than at first sect for black drapery you must lay on black and white and finisn with the same encreaf the black ap you want it for the shade for the deepest of which add some indigo especially if you would give you drapery the look of velvet you may in all case touch up you light with brighter colour sect x i for drapery of white wooll cloth lay on mixrure of white à very little oaker orpiment or gallstone to give it yello wifhi cast then shade and finish with blue little black white and bistre mixtoge ¬ the add this last for you brownest shade sect x ii light grey be lay on with black and white and finisnwith the fame make little darker sect x iii for minim dark brown tawney or dun drapery lay on bistre with white little brown red and shade with the fame mixtute but let it be little darker sect x iv there be other fort of drapery callchangeable because the light be of one colour and the shade of another these be wefor the cloath of angel and for other young and gay figure as also for scarve and other light part of dress which fall into number of fold and flow to the wind these be most commonly commonly purple and of these there be two fort the one with blue light and the other with yellow sect x v for the former lay on uitramarine and white very pale for the light and shade with carmine ultramarine and white the same as for purple drapery so that only the very brightest light appear blue and even then you must stipple with purple with large quantity of white and scumble the whole artfully together sect xvi for the latter use masticoat for you light instead of blue then proceed as for drapery of pure purple except that you must stipple and blend the light with the shade that be the yellow with the purpie by the help of little gamboge sect x vii be orderlike this last that be the carmine red light must be masticoat and the shade carmine and you must use gamboge to scumble they sect xviii lake red like carmine sect xix green must be orderin the same manner as lake continually mixing verditer with the sadder green tor the middle shade sect x x many other sort of these may be contrivat pleafure keep to the union of the colour not only in one figure but also in group of several figure avoid as much as the subject will permit to put blue next to flame colour or contrast green with black and sp of other that disagree or afford no proper union sect x xi other drapery may be make of sad dirty and brown mixture and simple and all by the direction we have already give and otker also may be contrivboth of broken and complicated colour but harmony between they must be preservthat they do not offend the eye there be no lay down rule to guide you in this you must by experience and practice make yourself acquainted with the power and effect of you colour and work accordingly sect x xii linnen be paint thus have draw you fold as when you dodrapery lay onwhite all over and then proceed and finisn with mixture of ultramarine black and white take more or less of this last accord to the degree you want of light and shade and for the deepest fold take bistre and little white use it sparingly and with artful touch and you may even take the sormer pure for the deepest shade where yoa must express the fold and lose they into the rest sect x xiii they may be make after different manner by laying on all over very pale mixture of ultramarine black and white and then proceed in the manner ¬ bove direct with the same mixture but à little deeper and when the shade be stip and finisnyou must heighthen the light with pure white blend they with the first colour or ground but of what fort soever you make they you must when they be fi nishprepare some yellowish tint for certain place lay they on lightly as it be washi so as to be transparent and neither to hide the stippling nor the shade sect x xiv yellow linnen be make of white mix with little oaker then proceed and finisn with bistre mix with with white and oaker and for the deepest shade with bistre alone before you finish lay on tint of oaker and white here and there and other of white and ultramarine as well upon the shade as the light but very thin and then stipple and scumble the whole togethe and it will have fine effect as you finisn touch up the extremity of the ligh with masticoat and white these linnen and the former vou may stripe like agyptian scarve with blue red ultramarine and carmine red one between two blue one very bright on the light and stronger in the shade the head of virgin be generally dresswith veil of these sort and of the same be make sort of handkerchief for a open breast because they be very become to the flesn sect x x v when vou would have either the one or the other of they to be transparent and shew whatever whether stuff or flesh be underneath lay they on at first very thin and mingle with you shad colour little of that which be under they particularly at the extremity of the shade and touch only the extremity of the light only for the yellow with mafticoat and white and for the white with white alone they be also to be make another way especially when you would haye they quite transparent as muslin lawn or gause to this purpose you must begin and finish what be beneath as if nothing be to be over it then heighten the brightest fold with white or masticoat and shade with bistre and white or black or blue and white accord to the colour you aim at and take away from the liveliness of the rest by soiling it over thoughthat be not altogether necessary but for the darker part sect x xvi for crape you must do as above only observe that you draw the fold and the border or edge with little thread alone upon what be beneath which must first be finishsect x x vii when you would water stuff of any fort you must wave it with lighter or darker colour accord as what you be upon be light or shade sect x xviii there be such way of touch you drapery so as to distinguisn the silken from the wooll these be more coarse and stiff the other be finer and more free or glossy but it must be rememberthat these be effect which depend partly upon the stuff itself and partly upon the colour of it and in order that you may apply they in such manner as shall be agreeable to the sub¬ ject and to the distance will here dwell little on they different quality sect x xix we have no colour that partake more with light than white or that come nearer to the air which shew it to be weak and fad nevertheless you may use it for the nearest part of you picture or bring it out towards vo by the assistance of some heavier and stronger colour or by mingling they together sect x x x blue js the most fad or rather the weakest coloar of all whence the sky and distant prospect be of that colour but it will fade the more the more it be mixd with white . ect x x xi pure black be the heaviest and the most terrene of all and the more you mix it with other colour the more will they be of the same nature now the different nature of black and white pro duce different effect in they for often the white throw back the black and the black bring forward the white under white we here comprehend all the light light codoure and uader black we fuppose all that be heavy uitramarine be then colour weak and light oaker be not quite so much masticoat be very light and so be vorditer vermillion and carmine be next to they orpiment and gamboge be à little less so lake hold mean more kind than rude pink be of ino parricular class and easily take the quality of the other so you may mako it dark and heavy by mixing it with colour which be so and on the contrary faint weak or fad by mingling with it white or elue brown red umber the dark green and bistre be the heaviest and next to black sect x x x ii able master who be verin perspective and the harmony of colour take care always to use they strong colour for they fore grounds and the weaker for di¬ stant view as for the union of colour you may by mingling they together understand the friendship or aversion they have for each other and thence take you hint and consult the pleasure of the eye sect x x xiii far lace foint and the like lay on first mixture of blue black aàd white as for linnen then heighten the pactern flover or flourish wich white only thensshade and finifh wic the first colour when they be upon flesn or ought else which you would have to be see through they finish what be under they as if you intend to lay nothing thereon and then lay on the lace or point with pure white and finish with the other mixture sect x x xiv if you would paint fur lay on ground as for drapery accord to the colour of it and then shade by part iii by the same rule and have do you muft instead of stippling draw fine stroke this way that way andother way accord to the grain of the fur you aim at heighten the light of brown fur with oaker and white and those of light far with white and little blue sect x xxv for building if it be stone take indigo biftre and white for you dead colour or ground and then shade with less of this last and more of the bistre than indigo accord to the colour of the stone you woald make you may also add little oaker both to begin with and to finish but to add still to its beauty you must here and there especially for ruin imake yellow and blue tint the former of oaker and the latter oful¬ tramarine always mixing they with white whether for you first ground provide they appear through what you lay upon they or whether you use they last ¬ nishing and blend they with the rest sect x xxvi for wooden building as they be of very different kind they be leave to discretion but the most common way be to begin with mixture of oaker bistre and white and finish without white or with very little and when the snade require strength with bistre alone for otheri you may add sometime vermillion and sometimes green or black in word accord to what you intend you must mix you colour and finish with stippling as for drapery and ill the rest chap iii of carnation or flesb colour sect here be so great variety of colour for flesn that it be hard matter to lay down any general rule for vour instraction therein nor be any rule minded by such as have acquire skill this way for such copy from original or work by they own head without know particularly why or wherefore so that the most able hand who work on with the least thought and trouble wonld be so much the harder put to it be they call upon to aliign rea¬ fon for they doctrine and practice as to they colour and tint however as beginner for whom this little work be intend stand in need of immediate instruction will here in general declare how you be to paint the different sort of flesh sect ii first of all have draw you figure with carmine and adjust you piece you must lay on for woman child and in general for all soft and tender colouring white mixwith very little blue sor face the composition of which will be give hereafter but it must hardly appear sect iii and for man instead of blue substitute vermillion for you dead colour and when they be old let it be mixwith oaker then you be to run over all you feature with vermillion carmine and white mingle together and with the same mixture form all the shade add white as they weaken and scarce use any of it as they strongthen bat particularly in certain place where you must lay it on boldly for example at the corner of the eyb under the nose the ear under the chin between the finger in all the joint the corners of the nail and generally every part where it be necessary to expresssa separation in the dark shade nor must you fear to give they all the strength they ought to have from the arst sketch because in work thereon with green it constantly weaken the red whick have first be lay on sect draw with red make blue tint with ul tramarine agdgood deal of white upon the temple bengath ahd at the corner of the eye on each side of of the mouth above it and below it little upon the midèleof the forehead between the nose and the eye on ghe fide of che cheek on the neck and other part where the flesh have bluishi cast you must also make xellowish tint with oaker orpiment and liitle vermillion mix with white above the eyebrow ât the side of the nose towards the bottomn little beneaththe cheek and the other partenear in these it bethat you must keep watchful eye upon nature for painting ba no more than a imitation ef nature every deviation from she be blemishi andtruly fault sect vi have dead teelour draw and dispofe of vour tint you must proëeed to shade stippling with green for you flesn mixing therewith accord to the rule we havegive for tint alittie blue for the fad part and and on the contrary little yellow for the stronger part or such as be nearest to you on the extremity of the fhade next to the light you must im ¬ perceptibly blend you colour with the ground of the flesn first with blue and then with red according to thepart you be upon and if this mixture of green do not darken enough at first you must go over the shade at several repetition sometimes with red sometimes with green and always stippling till the whole be as be ought to be sect vii and if with these colour you can net give you shade all the strength they ought to have you may finish the darkest part with orpiment oaker or vermillion and sometimes with bistre only accord to the colour you would make but lightly lay it on very thin sect viii you must stipple upon the light with little vermillion or carmine mix with good deal of white and very little oaker to lose they with into the shade and make the tint imperceptibly die away into sach other taking heed while you be stippling or hatching that you stroke follow the outline of the flesh for altho you hatch must cross in all direction that ought to appear little more because it round off the part and because thismixture might make the colour too red if it be always use you must moreover endeavour to confound the tint and the shade with blue little green and great deal of white so that it be very pale but with this you must not work upon the check nor upon the extremity of the light no more than with the other mixture upon these last which be to be leave in all they brightness as certain part of the chin of the nose upon the forehead and upon the cheek which and the chin ought however to be redder than the rest reft as well as the foot the inside of the hand the finger and the toe pray observe here that these two last mixture onght to be so very pale that you should hardly see yourself work they be purely design to soften the piece to melt the tint into each other to blend the shade with the light and to deface the line be caution not to make much use of the red mixture upon blue tint nor of blue upon other but change colour trom time to time as you perceive you work too blue or too redtill the piece be finisnsect ix you must shade the white of the eve with the same blue and little flesn colour and make the corner on the side of the nose with vermillion and white with sinall stroke of carmine all this be soften with that mixture of vermillion carmine and white and very litt oaker the lris of the eye must be mixture of ultramarine and white this little more in quantity than the the add thereto little bistre if it be to be of kind of light hazel or little black if it be too grey the pupil or sight of the eye be do with black and the lris be shade with indigo bistre or black according to the colour it be of but of what colour soever it be you would do well to draw sine circle of vermillion round the sight which blend with the rest in finishiing give life to the eye the circumierence of the eye that be the slit and the lafhy must be do with bistre and carmine when they be strong particularly the upper part which must be afterwards soften with the red or blue mixture formerly mention that the whole appear of piece and continu when this be do give à small touch of pure white upon the sight of the eye next to the light which make it shine and alive you may also heighten the white of the eye next to the light sect the mouth must be vermillion mix with white and finishwith carmine which be softne like the rest and when the carmine do not prove dark enough for you purpose mix bistre with it this be to be understand of the corner between the lip and particularly for some half open mouth sect x i the hand and the other nudity be to be do as the face observe that the tip or end of each finger be redder than the rest you work be coloord and stip you must go over all the separation of the part with sine touch of carmine and orpiment together as well in the shade as in the light but stronger in the first and then handle they away into the rest of the flesn sect x ii the eyebrow and the beard be colourlike the shade of the flesh and be finishwith bistre oaker or black accord to the colour they be of draw they with sine stroke as they ought to lie in exact imi¬ tation of nature and the light must be heightenwith oaker bistre little vermillion and good deal of white sect x iii for hair lay on bistre oaker white and little vermillion but when it be very dark you must use black instead of oaker and then shade with the same mixture diminish from the white and finish with bistre aloneor mixwith oaker or black by fine thin stroke very near to each other wave and curl they accord to the turn of the hair you must also refresh the light with sine stroke of oaker or orpiment or white and little vermillion after which blend away the light into the shade work so metime with brown and sometimes with pale as for the hair upon and round the forehead through which the flesn be see you must colour they with the colour of fleffi shad and work beneath as if yon intend there should be none then shape they and fi¬ nisn they with bistre and refresh the light as you do the rest grey hair be colourd with white black and bistre and finish with the same mixture bat stronger heighten the light with very pale blue and white sect xiv but the matter of the greatest importance be to soften the work to run the tint intp one another as well as the hair on and about the face into the flesn take especial care that you work not dry or hard and that the out line of you flesn be not cause you must accustom yourself to mix with white bat just as you want more or less of it for the second colouring must be always little deeper than you first exoept it be for softning sect xv the various colourings may be easily producby take more or lef red blue yellow or bistre whethe for you first colour or for finish the colouring for woman should be bluish for child little red both fresh and gay and for the man it should in ¬ cline to yellow efpecially when they be old sect xvi to make colour to represent death you must first clap in white orpiment and oaker very pale and then proceed with vermillion and lake instead of carmine and great deal of white and work thereon with green mixture in which be more blue than of any other colour that the fleffi may be livid the tint must be the same as for anocher colour but you must have more of they blue than yellow particularly for the retreate part and about the eye and the yellow must be weonly for the part which advance the farthest out they be make to die away into each the after the usual manner sometimes with very pale blue and sometimes with oaker and white and little vermillion softning the whole together yoa must round off the part and the outline with the same colour the mouth must be almost purple bat nevertheless you begin upon it with little vermillion oaker and white but you finish it with lake and blue and for the strong stroke you take bistre and lake which be use also for the eye the nose and the ifit be crucifix or some martyr where there must be a appearance of blood after the flesn be finish you niust colour with vermillion and finish with carniine fwelling out the drop of blood and give they roundness as for the crown of thorn lay on seagreen and masticoat and shade with bistre and green and refrest the light with masticoat sect xvii iron be coloured with indigo and litte black and white and finifh with indigo alone heighten with white sect xviii for fire and flame the light must be masticnat and orpiment and for the shade mix vermillion and carmine sect xix smoke be imitate with black indigo and white and sometimes bistre you may also add vermillion or oaker accord to the colour you would have it of sect x x for pearl lay on mixture of white and little bluc and shade they and swell they with the same but little stronger lay on small white spot just in the mièdle of the light side and on the other between the shade and the border of the pearl give touch of masticoat to make reflection underneath you must give they cast of the colour they be upon sect x xi diamond must be lay in quite black then heightened with gentle touch of white on the light side the same must be do for all other precious stone only varying the colour sect x x ii for gold figure lay on shellgold and shade with gall stone do the samefor silver only shade with indigo sect x xiii thus have dwelt upon some small article for the assistance of beginner what have say may afford some light into what have not say by the help of time and practice which be much require to attain any degree of perfection in we art one excellent way to become master be copy after wellchoose original it be with pleasure we reap the fruit of the labour of other much be require to be able to produce such sine effect in short it be far better to be good copist than bad inventor the instruction have lay down for the mixture and the different tint for the finish of flesh and the thing may be of particular use when you work after print where you have nothing before you but black and white and they will not be much more unuseful when you begin to copy after paint though you know not how to handle you colour and happen not to be acquainted with they power and effect for there be this difference between miniature and painting in oil that in this last the colour be take off from the pallet just as they appear to you in the picture so that in this case you have nothing to consult but such light and such shade now it be far from be the same in miniature where often it happen that the last colour you lay on do not preserve its colour but partake of the colour benaath or rather the one than the other compose new one to form the effect you aim at for althor it be white green carmine blue orpiment bistre and the like which form you colour they nevertheless would not produoe it if they be mix together for it be by proceed from one to the other that you can succeed and when you have piece of this kind before you without have see how it be do you must be conjurer at least to guef at the order and method it be do in without the help of manster or book upon this consideration have applied my self to instruct you in so many small matter and flatter my self that experience will evince to all such as be able to make use of they that as small as they be they be valuable chap iv of landscape sect it be particularly for landscape that you must be mindful of tke s article and of the follow which speak of the various quality of colour because the order and disposition of they contribute much to the retreat and distance which deceive the eye and the greatest master in this branch of the art have ever observe to cover they fore front with tne heaviest and ftrongest colour reserve the lighter for distance bat that may not err from my purpose will instead of general instruction endeavour to give beginner some particular document to be observe in practice sect ii first of all have draw you landscape such as you would have it as for another pictare you must colour you nearest front if they ar to be dark with sap green lris green bistre and little verditer to give you colour body you must stipple with this mixture but let it be à little darker add thereto sometimes blaek for the lighter front lay on oaker and white then sbade and finish with bistre in fome you fhiould mingle little green especially for shad and finifh sometimes you have reddishi front which must be make of brownred white and little green and finish with the same with the addition of little more green for graf and herbage on you nearest front you must after they be draw colour they with seagreen verditer and little white and for such as be yellowiffi you must mingle masticoat and then fhade with iris green or bistre and gallstone if you would have they appear dead and wither the front at some distance must be coloured with verditer then they must be shade and finish with sap green and add bistre to give touch with here and there such as be still farther off be make of sea green little blue and little white and be shade with verditer the further they be off the more bluish they must be and the utmost verge should be ultramarine and white mixing in certain place fine tint of vermillion sect iii water be paint with indigo and white and shaded with the same but it must be stronger and to finish they they you must instead of stippling draw wave stroke when necessary or strait without cross for still water you must sometimes use little green and heighten the light with pure white particularly where the water bubble upyou must proceed with rock as with stone architecture except that you mingle little green in you colour and shad in this case you tint must be yellow and blue andin finish must be scumble into the rest and when you make little branch with moss on they or herb of any fort vou must when you have do touch they up with masticoat and green you may make some yellow some green and some reddish as upon the near front rock must be stipple like the rest and the farther they be off the grayer must they appear castle old ruin and building of stone and wood must be order as have already direct when they be upon the fore front but when they be at distance you must add brown red and vermillion with great deal of white and shade very tenderly with this mixture and the farther they be off the tenderer must the stroke be for the separation as they be generally slated you may make the roof little bluer than sect iv the tree be not touch till the sky be finish so that when you be abont the sky you may if you will leave room for they especially if they be to be many in number but which way soever you order this you must cover such as be nearest to you with verditer adding sometimes oaker to it then shade with the same colour and little iris green then leaf they with stippling without cross for it must be do with slight longish touch of darker and warmer colour which must all be direct to humour the branch by little tuft of somewhat darker colour as we have say then touch up the light with verditer and masticoat form you leave after the same manner and when there be wither leave or branch cover they with brownbrown red or gallstone and white and finish with gall stone without white or bistre the trunk of tree must be coverd with oaker white and little green for the light and for the shade mingle with black add bistre and green for the one and ftor the other you tint must be yellow and blue and here and there you must bestow tender touch of white or masticoat to imitate what you commonly see in the bark of tree the branch which appear between the leave must be oaker verditer and white or bistre and white accord to you degree of light you must shade with bistre and iris green tree at distance be cover with verditer and seagreen and be shade and finishwith the same colour mix with lris green when there be any that appear yellowiss they may be coverwith oaker and white and finishwith gall stone for those at the greatest distance and very far off cover with scagreen and to finish mix with it ultramarine heighten the one and the other with masticoat in little distinct leave it be the most difficult thing in landscape painting and likewise in miniature to leaf tree as it ought to be to obtain this art you must break you hand to it little by copy good original for it require peculiar manner of touch which can not be attained but by work after tree themselves around which you will take care also to have little branch or spray which you must leaf upon whatsoever they happen to lye whether the sky or the ground of the landscape in general and in general you landscape must be properly colourand full of truth for tkerein consist it be beauty chap of flower sect it be most charming to paint flower not only because of they lustre but also because they take up but little time and require hardly any pain to do they it be all pleasure and no trouble you spoil face if you make one eye little higher than the other if you make small nos e or large mouth and so on of the other feature but the fear of these disproportion never trouble the mind when you be about flower for except they be quite out of the way indeed you spoil nothing and accordingly most of the quality who apply themselves to painting concern themselves with nothing but flower you must however learn to copy little axactly and for this branch of miniature as well as for the rest refer to dame nature as you only guide work then after natural flower and search for they tint and various colour upon you pallet little use will easily bring you to be expert in this and in order to pave the way for you at first will shew you continue my design how to paint some of they it be not always you can have natural flower and you may be often oblige to copy from print where you see nothing but grave sect ii it be general rule that flower be draw and cover like other figure but the manner of colour and finish they be different for they be coloured with broad stroke or touch which have the turn the smaller must have with which you finish this first turn be principal help and to finisn instead of stippling or hatch you draw sine stroke very close to each other without cross go over they at several repetition till you light and shade have all the strength you would give they sect iii rose have calk and draw the red rose with carmine let you first lay be very pale mixture of carmine and white then lay in the shade of the same colour but with less white and at last use carmine alone but it must be very thin at first add however to the body of it more and more as the piece advance and that the shade grow darker and darker and this be to be do with broad bold stroke to conclude you finisn with the same colour with sine stroke which must be turned like those of the grave if you copy after print or like the turn of the leave of the rose if you copy after painting or nature scumble the whole and touch up the strongest light and the edge of the brightest leave with white and little carmine you mutt always make the heart of the rose and the shady side darker than the rest and use little indigo in shad the first leave especially when you rose be blow to make they appear little fad the seed be do with gamboge mix with little bladder green for shad you streak rose must be paler than the other that the streak may be the more conspicuous which must be do with carmine somewhat deeper in the shade and very bright in the light hatch continually with sine stroke for white rose lay on white and proceed and frnish as in the example of red rose but with black white and little bistre and make the seed somewhat yellower than before for yellow rose lay on masticoat and shade with gamboge gallstone and bistre heighten the light with masticoat and white the stalk the leave and the bud of all sort of rose must be lay in with verditer mix up with little litile masticoat and gamboge and to snade they use lris green with less of the other colour when the shade be deep the wrong side of the leave must be bluer than the other therefore you must there lay on green and mix it with irisgreen to fhade with make the vein or rib of that side lighter than the ground and those of the right side deeper the prickle upon the stalk and the bud of the rose be make with slight touch of carmine in all direction and those on the stem of the tree and larger branch be strike in with verditer and carmine and shade with carmine and bistre make also the bottom of the stem aad stalk more reddish than the top that be you must mix green with carmine and bistre to stinde wich sect iv of tulip as there be infinite fort of talip at least too many to be all trae out sfiall touch only on the finest which be call stripe or streak they stripe or streak be lay in with carmine very thin in some place and very deep in other and they be finishwith sine stroke of the same colour which must all ob¬ serve the turn of the stripe for other you begin with vermilhion then proceed by mixing it with carmine and finifh with carmine only for other again you lay indian lake upon vermillion instead of carmine some also be coloured with lake and carmine mix together and lake only or with white to begin with some of they be of violet or purple colour and be to be do with ultramarine and carmine or lake sometimes bluer and sometimes redder the manner of order both be just the same there be no difference but in the colour you must in certain place as for example between the stripe of vermillion carmine or lake put sometime blue make of ultramarine and white and sometime transparent parple which must be finifhwich sine hair stroke like the rest and scumble into the stripe some there be that have fallow tint which be make of lake bistre and oaker accord as they happen to be these be only for fine and uncommon tulip to shade the ground of those whose stripe be carmine take indigo and white for those that have lake stripe take black and white therewith sometimes mixing bistre at other timam green some also you may shade with gamboge and umber and always with sine hair stroke that follow the turn of the leaf other also may be paint which we call edg this tulip be al of one colour except the border which be white with purple red with yellow yellow with red and red with white the purple tulip of this border sort be lay in with uitramarine carmine and white and you must with the same snade and finisn the edge or border must not be touch that be you must only lay on thin white which must be shade with very thin indigo the yellow be colourwith gamboge and be shade with the same colour oaker umber or bistre the edg must be vermillion and finishwith very little carmine the red be lay in with vermillion and finishwith the same colour add thereto carmine or lake the border must be gamboge and to finisn add to it gallstone or umber or bistre the white be to be shade with black blue and white indian ink be very proper in this case forit shade soft and be alone equal to the effect of blue and white mixwith other black the edg of this white tulip must be carmine for for all these sort of tulipe you must in the middle of the leave express nervure which must be much brighter than the rest and you must scumble the edge into the grounds by fine stroke for they must not seem cut or separate like the stripe other there be of still different colour when vou meet with any which be as it be black with infide you colour and finisn they with indigo as well as the seed if the ground be yellow take gamboge and finish by add thereto umber or bistre the leave and stalk of tulip be commonly painted with sea green and shade and finishwith irisgreen with broad stroke along the leave some also may be make with verditer mix with masticoat and these may be shade with bladder green that they may be of more yellowisni cast sect of anemony there be many fort of this flower as well double as fingle which last be commonly plain and be either purple with purple and white shade with the same colour some bluer some redder sometimes very pale and sometimes very deep other be coloured with lake and white and finishwith the same diminish the white or even ufe none at all other again be coloured with vermillion and shade with the same colour deepenwith carmine other once more be white and lemmoncolour these last be do with masticoat and both the one and the other must be shade and finishsometimes with vermillion and sometimes with very deep lake and especially at the bottom of the cup about the seed which be also often of blackisn colour and be imitate with indigo or with black and blue mingling in some little bistre and work continually with sine stroke and scumble the shade into the light there be some that have the bottom of the cup much brighter than the rest and even so as to be quite white althothe rest of the anemony be deep the seed of all these anemony be imitate with indigo and black with very little white shade with indigo alone sometimes it must be heightenwith masticoat double anemony be of very various colour bux the finest of they have they largest leave stripsome of these stripe be performwith vermillion to which be add carmine to finish they shad the rest of the leave with indigo for the smaller leave within lay on mixture of vermillion and white and shade they with vermillion mix with carmine and here and there be very strong . particularly in the heart or cabbage near the great leave on the shady side and finisn with hair stroke of carmine which must humour the stripe and the turn of the leave the stripe of other be coloured and finish with carmine only as well as the inner or smaller leave observe however to leave in the midst of these last littie round where you must lay in deep purple or violet which must be scumble into the rest and the whole be finish lay on broad stroke of this same colour around the smaller leave especially on the dark side and scumble they into the greater which must for the rest be shade with indigo or black in some other the smaller leave be of lake or purple altho the stripe of the greater be carmine there be other whose stripe be carmine in the middle of most of the largeft leave with vermillion under it in some place all which must be scumble in¬ to the shade of the ground which be of indigo and white the smaller leave be lay in with masticoat and be shade with very deep carmine on the dark side and very bright carmine on the light side leave here the masticoat almost to itself and only divide the leave with fine touch of orpiment and carmine which smaller leave may be sometimes fhade with little very pale green there be double anemony all red and of violet colour the first be coloured with vermillion and carmine with hardly any white and be shade with carmine alone well gummthat they may be very deep purple anemony be imitatad with purple and white and be finifh without white in short there be of all colour of these double anemonie as well as of the single which be to be paint by the rule here suggest the green of both the one and the other must be verditer mix with masticoat for the dead colour and it must be finishwith bladder green they stalk incline to be little reddifni therefore they be shade with carmine mix with bistre and sometimes with green after they be lay in with masticoat sect vi of pinx and carnation it be the same with pink and carnation as with anemony andtulip for some of they be wariegated or mix with several colour and some be of pne

part at pretty good distance from each other but forget not to let they be stronger in the light and weaker in the shade and to make they true in all direction for the other be cover with very pale purple as well on the leave as on the receptacle or pod in the middle shadingboth with the same colour of deeper dye and instead of use small white stroke for the seed let they be purple and make round about each and that all over the pod the green verditer and masticoat shade with iris green sect x xviii the gladiola lay on columbin lake and white very pale then proceed and finish with lake

colour for the white be cover with white and shade with black and little indigo for the heart of the leave for the yellow masticoat gamboge and gahlstone the purple be do with purple and white you must finisn with ley white minding to be brighter in the heart and even little yellowishi for the red lake and white and finish without white for the stripe or variegate lay on white and va riegate sometimes with purple wherein uitramarine fredominate or sometimes with purple wherein carmine prevail or lake sometimes with white at the time without it fhad the rest of the leave with indigo the seed of every one must be verditer and masticoat finish with lris the leave and the stalk with the same green mixed with lris to shade with should never have do be lhere to dwell on all the flower that may be paint but have say nough and even too much to instruct you fully in this branch of painting for ten or dozen example have be sufficient for any oae who should begin to copy toture herself for in this case he have nothing to do bet to imitate what he have befgre he eye but imaginit be more useful to copy after print and that should undertake no ungrateful tafk do dwell on the method of colour and finish good number of flower at least to conclude as begin every one may take or leave what he sce proper sect x xxvi shall not here subjoin any particular instruction on a infinite number of other subject for it be to little or no purpose and this little work be already mare diffuse than lat first intend it therefore only add in general that fruit fish serpent and all sort of reptile must be touch after the manner of figure that be hatch or stip but that bird and all the other animal must be finish with stroke after the manner of flower sect x xxvii take heed to use no white lead for any of these thing for it be be good for nothing but oil turn as black as ink when temper with gum water only and especially if you put you work in damp place or where perfume be instead thereof use ceruse of venice or flake white which be to the full as fine fear not to use this especially for you first colonring but mix portion of it in all you compound to give they certain body which strengthen you work and make it appear warm and mellow painter however practise differently upon this head for some use but little of it and other none at all but the manner of these last be hard and dry other again nse it in abundance and these be certainly to be followed as conform to the most usual opinion of the most skilful artist for besides that it be the most ready you may there by thing almost impossible to be do without it copy all sort of picture notwithstanding the contrary opinion of those who pretend that in miniature you can not come up to the strength and the different tint of piece in oil mistake at least with reference to good painter as be sufficiently evince from the effect for we see figure landscape portrait and every thing else in miniature touch in the grand man¬ ner with as much truth and as nobly althomore prettily and delicately than in oil know indeed this kind of painting have its advantage be they only that it dispatch more in less time that it be more easily preserve and that it claim to be the eldest sister and boast its antiquity but notwithstanding all this it must be grant that miniature have she advantage also and withont repeating what lhave already say it be more neat and convenient you may carry all you apparatus in you pocket you may work where you please without so much preparation you raay leave it and refume it just when and as often as you please which can not well be practise with the first in which you ought hardly ever to work dry the other as in comedy in which the greatest or the least perfection of the actor confist not in act the higher or lower part but in act what they do act extreamly well for if he who act the meanest character acquit himself better therein than he who act the heroe of the play he will doubtless deserve greater measure of applause and the same be it in the art of painting for its excellence be not confine to the grandeur of one particular subject but to the manner of treat it have you talent for this plunge not yourself rashily into that and if you have from heaven receive some spark of the divine fire know for what end it be bestow on you nor deviate from the path cut out for you some shall take the different air of head other shall succeed better in landscape some shall work finely in small who could do little or nothing in great and other be good colourist but bad designer and other in short have hand for nothing but flower to conclude the bassan have rayto themselves name for animal which they most excellently touch and much better than any thing else let every one therefore be content with he genius nor presumie upon anotherground or attempt flight unequal to he strength it be in vain to strive againft nature andimprudent and immodest in we to aim at what do not belong to we for we there by uncover we own shame and work we own disgrace on the other hand it be no dishonour to you that you be not possessof all the great talent which have ennoble all the great painter each of whom have have he blemish as well as bcauty let we therefore again repeat it sit down quietly with the share allot to we the great matter be to cultivate it with care and diligence and althothis small tract may contribute to you assistance as it asfuredly will present it to you as no other than supplement to more immediate help doubtless you wiil learn more effectually under the di rection of a able master from whom you may imbibe all the sound precept and true rule and see all make plain to you by practice now altho the contrivance for draw which in the beginning give vou be infallible it be much better to have hand expert thereat without any such servile help for if you be not actuate by superior genin to guide you and if you have not most accurate eye in vain will be all you pain to adjust you piece correctly and it will be mere chance if after all they be not lame and spiritless for in lay on the colour you easily lose the stroke and with far more difficulty will you be able to be trace they if you be quite aukward at draw¬ do therefore most earnestly recommend it to al ing lover of painting that they apply themselves to draw learnedly to copy with indefatigable perseverance and that this they always do most tenacioussy from good original in word be satissyto ascend regularly by those step which lead up to the perfection of this fine art whose precept as happen in all other art be soon obtain but this be not enough you must execute also theory be of little worth without practice as practice without theory be blind guide who lead we astray instead of conduct we in the right road but to know well what you would do and to do well what you know be the true means of attain you end greatly to increase in knowledge with time and to become the good scholar of a excellent master for my part iboast not of be such but however will venture to promise all those who shall be pleased to step into this my little school with never so little do position and longing to learn that they will have no cause to repent themselves in they trouble for if they stay with pleasure flatter my self they will not go out as they come in the secret of a italian for make carmine and ultramarine a anonymous painter one who appear to have be sound and excellent judge express heself to this effect concern this arcanum nothing be more safe or easier than this manner of make these colour they have lustre vivacity not to be express they never change and may be prepare at so easy rate that for one pistole you may make as much as would cost you seven or oight at florence but the proof will confirm what here advance much more effectually than all can say carmine take pound of brasilwood from fernambuco of the goldencolour and pound it in mortar steep it for three or four day in bocal of whitewine vinegar then boil it for half a hour and pass it through cloth put it again over the fire in the mean time have another vessel or pot at hand in which shall be eight ounce of alom dilut in whitewine vinegar which dilution pour into the other liquor and stir it about with spatula the froth or scum which will hereupon arise will be you carmine collect it therefore and drv it this may be do with cochineal instead of brazil wood ultramarine ultramarine take ten ounce of linseed oil and pour they ina so a earthendishi with seven or eight drop of common wit er and set it upon the fire where let it remain till it begin to fry or boil and then throw in pound of white virginwax break into snall bit when the wax be melt throw in pound of greek piich and add thereto four qunce of powder of mastick which have be previoussy melt by it self together with two ounce of turpentine and let the whole melt over the fire for a hour together the hour expire pour this composition into cold water and if it prove soft like butter it be enough but if you feel any hard grain or grit conclude that you mastick be not sufficiently melted and clap it over the fire again the whole be in due temper put blue lapis into crucible and let it remain in the fire till it be red hot like the fire itself and then throw it into whitewine vinegar which it will absorb till it burst and break into small bit which bray to powder and then incorporate this powder with little of the above composition but let it be as little as possible and let it remain thus for about fortnight after this lay board little incline upon the edge of table it would be the more convenient if this board have trench or channel cut along it and under the foot of this board place glass vestel or receiver and put you blue paste at the head of it and above the same place vessel of water so that it may distil drop by drop upon the paste all thing be dispose in this manner help the water to dilute the paste by stir it very gently with the small the first blue which will come end of fmooth stick away drop by drop will prove the finest and when you perceive it to lose of its beauty change the recipient for another to receive the second blue after which yau will have third which you may use very sasely set these three fort of uitramarine to dry then collect they and put they up separately in bag of white leather other secret for make ultramarine after different way fine lake and colombine lake green and other colour after different way particularly adapted to miniature ultramarine take half pound of lapis lazuli and lay it upon burn coal where let it remain till it be red hot and then quench it in very strong vinegar afterwards grind it upon some hard marble or stone with rectifibrandy the more you grind it the siner will be youruitramarine and be ground to you mind leave it upon the marble or put it into some vessel while you prepare you paste or pastel wherewith to incorporate you say lapis to make this paste take quarter of pound of yellow wax quarter of pound of turpentine as much rofin and as much linseedoil melt they all together over slow fire and when they begin to bubble they will be sufficiently do pour this melt compofition into glaze pan and it will be you ultramarine pastel or paste of which take quantity equal to that of you lapis and knead they together upon you marble that be you lapis and pastel together which be incorporate leave they in that state for night to force out the uitramarine in the say pastel pour fair water upon it and knead it with you hand like so much dough and the uitramarine will squeeze out and fall into pot which must stand under you hand to receive it leave it then to settle in the say water till you perceive the ultramarine to be subside another way take four ounce of linseed oil four ounce of new wax four ounce of arganson one ounce of rosin one ounce of mastic in tear four ounce of burgundypitch two dram of incense or frankincenie and two dram of dragon s blood bruise each ingredient by it self in mortar then put you linseedoil in pan over the fire and when it begin to fry throw in you ingredient one after the other so that you dragoblood be the last throw in in the mean time con¬ tinually stir the other with stick or spatula and when the whole become glutinou and stringy between you finger you paste be fit for use then throw in you lapis lazuli have previoussy burnt it in coal fire quench it in white winevinegar ground it when dry upon amarble and pamit through very fine sive as have be before specify you lapis thus prepare and then incorporate with you pasté leave it in that state for twentyfour hour and then force out you uitramarine with spring water but use no other and knead well you paste wich this say water you will then have the first tincture or degree of you biue which will be the sinest and most lively of all con¬ tinue this to the third repetition and if after all you throw the remains into proper chemical vessel you may have the gold with which vour lapis be impregnate some theré be who knead they paste at once in vessel of milk warm water into which they squeeze they ultramarine which they leave to settle for twen tyfour hour and more when poar off the water by inclination inclination they find the uitramarine at bottom and set it to dry in the sun sometimes they leave the la pis incorporate in the paste for the space of month before they express or squeeze out theuitramarine and in the say paste instead of linseed oil and turpentine substitute only oil of turpentine and black pitch instead of burgundy pitch as sor the lapis itself they heat it quench it grind it and searze it in the manner we have direct above fine lake take pound of good brazil which boil with three quart of lye make of the ash of vinesprig till it be half evaporate then let it settle and strain it off boil it over again with fresn brasil cochineal and terramerita that be only half pound of brasil and half quarter of pound of cochineal with the furthe addition of another quart of fair water which must boil till it be also balf evaporate as before then leave to settle and then strain as for the terramerita you need have but a ounce of that when you take this liquid from the fire observe to throw into it a ounce of burnt alom reducto a impalpable powder and dissolve the same therein by stir it with stick and add thereto half dram of arsenic then to give it body take two cuttlefisn bone pulverize they and throw they in leave it to dry up at leisure and then grind it with good quantity of fair water in which leave it to steep then strain it thro cloth and make it up into small tablet or cake which set to dry on card or pasteboad if you would have you lake redder add to it lemon juice and if you would have it deeper add to it oil of tartar another lake take shaving or sheating of scarlet and boil they in lye of the asny of burnt tartar or oil of tartar which lye have the property of separate the scarlet when it have hoil sufficiently take it off and add to it cochineal mastick in powder and little roch alom boil the whole over again and while it be het strain it two or three time through jellybag the first time squeeze the bag from top to bottom with two stick then take out what remain behind in the bag and wasti it well pass the liquor you expresswith the stick throthe bag again and you will have paste stick ing to the side of the bag which you may spread out upon pasteboard or divide into small parcel upon paper and leave it to dry columbinelake take three quart of the most subtily distill vinegar one pound of the finest brasilwood of feraambuco which rasp and set it to steep in the say vinegar month at least and if longer so much the better then boil the whole in balneo mariae three or four wabble dp and leave it for day or two after which prepare quarter part of alompowder which put into very clean earthenpan and upon it strain you liquor throt cloth and so let it remain for day then heat the whole till it fimmer and leave it again for twentyand thereupon pour you liquor which must be little warm stir then the whole with stick till it be cool and leave it again for twentyfour hour before you strain it observe that you must previoussy strain it upon the alom before you pour it upon the cuttlefisn bone the mare or dregs of columbinelake to make fine purple colour befide the carmine for oil and for distemper take the dregs or mare of the columbine lake which subside with the cuttle sisn bone and dry it and grind it there be no sine lake so splendid and if you mix it with lake you add to it s body lris green take of the blueft flowerde luce otberwise call flag . iris strip off the upper or sattin part of they and keep only that the rest be good for natch and throw away even all the little yellow nervure pound they in mortar what you thus pick and be well pound throw upon it à little water three or four spoonful more more or less accord to you quantity of flower previon to this you must have dissolve in this water little alom and gumarabic but very little and then bray they well all together and strain the whole thro close cloth and put this juice into shell which dry in the air another way after you have pick the abovemention flower pound they and put to they little alomwater as above direct throu in liule powder of quick lime as if you be salt sallad it have the property of change the colour and cleansing it in fine express the juice into

thro line and put the juice so strain or expressinto large shell which expole to all the heat of the sun sor the green will become mouldly or mothery in the shade and prove too clammy another way take leave of the flaglris mince they very small and put they into some glaf be earthen vessel or what would do better in some copper pot or pan with powder alom and quick lime leave they to putrisy in this state for ten or twelve day be rotten squceze they into shell the green be more lively and rich when you only bray the leave and express they at once once without give they time to rot have previously salt they over with powder alom anotber way aith the flower of viole the green make of the leaf of the march violet be do by the same method but you must have greater quantity of it and this be deeper green than that of the iris observe that instead of lime you may use french berry bruise with alom it exceed lime for change blae into green you may also make green with the flower of pansie after the same manner bladdergreen take the fruit or berry of the plant or bramble callrhamnus poand it in morter anctbrow into it à little powder alom then express the juice of it and put it up in bladder which tye close and leave it to dry till you green be hard french pink it be commonly make with the white of troy stherwile call spaniss white and french to avignon berry but it be apt to change colour so that it will be safer to make it of white lead or ceruse which grind very fine and dilute it upon marble whence take it up with wooden spatula and leave it to dry in the shady part of any room then take french berry bruise they in marble mortar with wooden pestle and boil they with water in lead earthenpot till third or more be evaporate strain this decoction throlinnencloth and put into it the bign of two or three small nut of alom to hinder it from change colour when it be dosolve dilute the white with this decoction to the consistence of pretty thick pap or rather paste which work well between you hand and make up into trochisk which set to dry in a airy room when it be dry dilute it again two or three time with the say decoction accord as you woald have you pink bright or deep and leave it to dry each time till it be very dry observe that you liquor or decoction must be warm when you dilute you paste therewith and that you must make it afresti afresh wben the first be taint take heed hever to touch it with lron or steel but all along use wooden spatula how to make rigbt use of alom the best way of use alom for lrisgreen and the other composition of colour which would change without this mineral be to break it small and to pat it into à little water over fire sor otherwise it would never dissolve and with this water sprinkle ver you flower on the juice of you colour but the less alom the better for it burn when it be use too freely how the purify vermillion cinnabar or vermillion be compound of mercury and sulphur must be divest of the impurity it contract from those mineral which imparity darken its lustre and causeit to change now this purification be thus order grind the cinnabar in stone with fair water upon marble or porphyry put it into glass or earthen vessel to dry then put urine toit and mix it so that it be thoroughly wet and swim letit settle then and the cinnabar be precipitate or fall pour off the urine by inelination and put frefhi in the room of it leave it so all night and repeat the same change for sour or five day till the ciunabar be thoroughly purify continue you process with beat up the white of a egg which mixing with sair water pour it upon you cinnabar and stir the whole about with walnut treestick change this liquor two or three time as above and keep the vessel well stop up or closely cover tor fear of dust which would spoilyou cinnabar and when you would use it temper it with gumwater with this it will not change its colour another way grind cinnabar previoussy pulverize upon prophyry with the urine of child or with brandy and dry it in the shade if vou would entirely divest it of all its obscurity and give itbrighter or redder countenance infuse in the brandy either urine or little saffron and with this liquor grind you cinnabar memorandum for make verp fine poliss gold the piece of wood you would gild whether frame border or ought else must be very smoothand to make they the more so pam sezdog skin over they then you must glue or size it with stuff make of the cutting of white glove and lay on nine or ten layer of white when it be thoroughly dry when it be perfectly dry use you shave grass that it may be so much the kinder and then warm some size and water into which dip fine piece of linnen which wring and with it rub the white then lay on two or three layer of goldcolour and more if it be not of good body or deep enough and when it be dry rub it soundly with dry cloth till it be bright again then take of the strongest brandy you can find and wasn the goldcolour with this brandy by the help of pencil but you must have you leaf gold cut and ready upon the cushion to clap it on the moment the pencil be go over the part and when it be dry polisn it with dog s tooth the make glove leather size take pound of the cutting of white glove and let it steep in water some time then boil it in pot with twelve quart of water till it be reduce eo two quart then strain it throcloth into new earthenpan to know if you size be strong enough try when it be cool if it feel firn under you hand to make the white the size be do take crayon white and serape it with knite or grind it upon marbie melt and heat you size to violent degree then take it trom the fire throw in white enongh to give it the confistence of pap leave it to infuse for quarter of a hour then stir and mix it wich hoghair brush take this white and add more size to it that it may be the thinner lor the first and second going over observe that you first lay be dry belore you cover it with the second ifit be wood vou be upon it will require twelvefold repetition but for pastboard six or seven will be enoagh this do take water and into it dip soft brufh and strain it between you hande or fiager and rub you work over with it to make it lye more even as soon as you brushi be full of white you must wash it over again and even change you water when it be too white vou may sometimes use wet cloath instead of brush you work be smooth and even let it dry and when it be dry rub it over with shave grass or piece of new cloth to make it the kinder how to lay on ground to giid and silver upon after different manner take quarter of pound of fine bole armoniac well choose fresn and greasy to the touchsteep it in water to make it dissolve then grind it add thereto the bigness of filberd of crayon and of pea of tallow which prepare this melt they then throw they into fresh water and therein work they with you hand to fit they for use the size of peai enough for one grind in grind you throw little soapsud among the bole this compound be ground put it into fair water which change from time to time to preserve it when you would use it temper it with warm s size and if it prove as strong as what you whiten with put in third of water and mix it with the bole which which you shall make of the thickness of cream then lay it on you work with pencil and go over the whole with it three or four time leave it each time to dry before you go over it again be finish and dry rub it with soft cloth before you proceed to lay on you gold or silver when vou use this ground for gold you must add little red lead to it how to lay on the gold and silver set you piece slanting and wet part with large pencil dip in fair water then lay on the gold which must be ready cut apon à leathern cushion whenceyou may take it up with cotton the whole be gill leave it to dry but neither in the wind nor sun and be sufficiently dry burnifh it with dog s tooth to know when it be in dne temper paf the dog s tooth over it in some little place and if it do not rub kindly but peel off it be not dry enongh on the other hand take care that it be not too dry for you will have so much the more trouble in polish it and after all you pain it will not be so bright as ou may wishi it in great heat three or four hour drying be enough but sometimes it require à day and night to mat gold make red with red lead little vermillion and the white of a egg well beaten ap grind the whole upon marble and clap it into the deep or hallow place with fine pencil to matt silver take white of ceruse grind it with water and then temper it with schthyocolla or fisniglue or else glove size very fine the first be most beautiful you be to lay it with pencil upon the place you would matt to make sbellgold and shell . silver pat leafgold upon clean marble accord to the quantity you would have and grind it with honey just out of the hive or very pure till it be extremely soft under you hand then throw it into glass of fair water and stir it and change the water till it be very clear or fine then pour it into about penny worth of aquafortis and there let it remain two day take out you gold and you aquafortis may serve another time the same may be do with silver when vou would lay on either the one or the other temper it with oné or two drop of very thin gumwater and to give it the smoother face let you water be soap it be proper also that you should have wash of gallstone under you gold it set it off mach you must be very sparing of you gold and silver when you work in miniature except the
