the work of the late professor camper the connexion between the science of anatomy and statuary the art of draw painting in two book contain treatise on the natural difference of feature in person of different country and period of life and on beauty as exhibit in ancient sculpture with nei method of sketch head national feature and portrait of individual with accuracy illustrate with seventeen plate explanatory of the professor s lead principle translate from the dutch by cogan london print for dilly in the poultry the transtator that a intimate connexion subsist between the different branch of the art and science by virtue of which the one elucidate or reflect lustre upon the other be truth that have never be litigate the artist whose attention be solely confine to one particular object and whose knowledge be as circumscribed as he employment may become expert in the mechanic or operative part of he occupation but we be not to expect from he any con siderable improvement or peculiar indication of taste nor will he be qualified to propose rule by which other might be teach to excel to none of the fine art be those observation more applicable than to those of painting and sculpture for none require larger compass of knowledge or deeper insight into nature if the artist mean to carry the pro ession farther than the mechanic delineation of a object that be immediately before he as the painter or statuary who have make the human figure the peculiar object of he study have doubtless give the preference to the most interesting and the most sublime de partment so it must be confess that he have choose the this branch demand most difficult and comprehensive great extent of historical knowledge a intimate acquain tance with national characteristic great attention to the diversity occasion by progressive year and peculiarity of sex observance of the effect produce by the passion upon the human frame in they various combination and different degree of force superadd to such knowledge of anatomy as shall enable he to delineate the general situation of the muscle in placid and inert state they action in varied position and they influence in describe every emotion or passion of the mind it be also the branch most expose to the severity of criticism as grosser fault in the representation of the human form be readily detect and as number presume that they have complete model in they own person or competent knowledge from they intercourse with they species affect the refine connoisseur and attempt to support the character by search for minuter blemissies the delineation of different animal do not require a equal extent and variety of knowledge and those who have make this branch they principal study have in general con fine themselves to close imitation yet the ill success of many painter in this department the few master comparatively who have acquire celebrity and the very few whose work be exempt from grof imperfection too clearly indicate that there be latent difficulty which it be not in the power of mere imitation to furmount and also that the address be quire simply by attention and practice in the delineation of one particular species have rather be a impediment than a aid in attempt to delineate animal of any other species much pain have be take to remove those various difficulty man of study and of genius have attempt to introduce certain principle and to propose invariable rule which they deem conducive to the improvement of taste in the higher branch of painting and precifion in all some of the principle advanced and method recommend have be of considerable service while other as they be build upon false dogma be more calculate to mis lead than to direct into the right path the work which be now introduce to the english reader profess to remove several remain difficulty of no small moment and to propose rule more conducive to facility grace and accuracy than any hitherto offer these profession be found upon the discovery of much more immediate and intimate connexion between the science of human and comparative anatomy and of the natural history of animal with the art of delineation than could have be suppose to exist every idea in it that be pe culiar to the author exemplify in very strike manner the truth of we remark concern the connexion that subsist between different branch of the art and science by means of which the one may be render in various respects sub servient to the other the happy union in the same person of profound knowledge in anatomy with taste for draw ing have demonstrate that the minutiae of anatomical know ledge be much more conducive to elegance character expression and precision than could possibly have be imagine by any one totally ignorant of or but superficially acquainted with the science whenever the attention of artist have be direct to anatomical instruction it have hitherto be confine to the first series of muscle or they operation in the different action or position of the body as mark through the integument but we now perceive the great importance of ofteology particularly a intimate knowledge of the bone constitute the cranium and of they relative situation in the delineation of national character and in the change make by advancing age and also its use in the production of ideal beauty or in mark the eculiarity which characterise individual neurology also which have not be consider as have the most distant relation to the subject be prove to be of high utility in the representation of the emotion of the mind a attainment confessedly the most difficult as well as the most interesting and sublime the acume with which professor camper have criticise the labour of the most distinguissied painter and delineator of animal the detection of they error and the cause of they the rule give to avoid these error and acquire greater precision in delineating animal of different species found upon comparative anatomy and the natural history of the animal indicate no less forcibly the great advantage to be derive by these two science which united promise to point out a unerring road to excellence the introductory discourse will acquaint the reader with the method by which these discovery be make it will also make he acquainted in pleasing and satisfactory manner with the progressive history of a inquisitive mind from early year up to manhood the dissatisfaction that be company increase penetration and a improve taste the imperfection with which some modern production of celebrate master be chargeable the means pursue to avoid similar imperfection and to imitate those excellency in the work of the antient which be the subject of uni versal admiration though the cause of this admiration have never be investigate the reader will further notice that the principle advanced be not the premature fruit of à warm imagination but that they be gradually form by the observation and experience of series of year until they become the basis of sound criticism and furnissied rule for accurate execution it may not be impertinent to add that the professor s remarkable proficiency in draw though it be simply the amusement of he leisure moment cor roborate all that have be advanced concern the superi ority of he method to those in common use of this pro ficiency the connoisseur may form some judgment from the pecimen before he which be faithful as well as elegant copy of engraving from original drawing the greater part of which be execute under the inspection of the pro fessor and all of they by the first artist in the seven pro vince by this application of he professional knowledge to he favourite amusement he have acquire such facility and firmness in delineation as astonissied every attendant on he public lecture and artist themselves have acknow ledge that he occasional and extemporaneous sketch ex ceed in taste and accuracy they labour production the first book of this work contain the substance of several lecture which be read at different time and distant period before the academy of draw establissied at amsterdam these be afterwards revise and digest into à regular essay and carefully prepare for publication by professor camper himself it may perhaps be think by those who admit the truth and importance of he lead principle that the distinction give in the first chapter con ern the characteristic difference of different nation be too general and not sufficiently adapt to assist the painter in describe that vast variety of national distinction ob servable in the different inhabitant of we globe but we be to recollect that those be propose simply as specimen of new study the prosecution of which would promise the greatest advantage to the national and historical painter the grand object be to shiew that national difference may be reduce to rule of which the different direction of the facial line form fundamental norma or canon that these direction and inclination be always accompany by corre pondent forin size and position of other part of the cranium the knowledge of which will prevent the artist from blend ing the feature of different nation in the same individual and enable he to give that true character to national figure introduce into composition which have always be feel as beauty and the want of it as defect though the cause have lain conceal this subject may justly be consider as new and interesting study in the natural history of man which require the joint labour of physiologist to surmount all the difsiculty attend it it be alone by form very large collection of the cranium of different people that discrimination can be make between what be general from to the diversity observable in individual from that which be national and characteristic of particular people the other article minutely treat in this book relative to new manner of draw portrait in profile accord to certain rule deduce from the conformation of the cranium and the change make by age be found upon indubitable professor blumenbach of gottinge be pursue this study with great affi duity he have already publish two decade of difference in the cranium of different people the transtator have only be able to procure the first from which he learn that the specimen in the possession of this professor lead he in some sev instance to differ from prosessor camper respect characteristie mark as each have form he opinion from the specimen in he possession thcse difference manifest the difficulty hint above and prove that further investigation alone will enable we to distinguish between accidental form and iational mark principle can not be subject to similar incertitude so that respect these every student have the means of make great improvement completely in he power the great utility of the remark concern the beauty of the antient will be self apparent the contents of we second book be the small remains of lecture upon other subject relative to draw the idea of which suggest themselves while the professor be engage in the pursuit of he first object they be col lect from imperfect manuscript and detach hint find among the profeffor s papers after he decease and publish by he son in as complete à manner as circumstance would allow of consequence they be merely to be consider as note and head of lecture the substance of which be give extempore this will sufficiently explain the reason why the scientific introduction appear so disproportionate to the explanatory part it must also be notice that at the time these lecture be deliver the audience enjoy the great advantage of see every part of the subject explain by great variety of extemporaneous fketch which be successively efface from the board to make room for other those communicate to the public be the only one to which the professor have give permanency and of these the sketch illustrative of the passion be too imperfect to be give as they be find the engraver be oblige to supply some stroke that have be omit all the other drawing be sufficiently accurate not to require addition or alteration we be inform that professor camper have range he idea with more accuracy form each lecture into distinct treatise and illustrate the position advanced by regular series of drawing but upon recess from the aca demy at franiker public affair engage he immediate at tention during the political trouble in holland until death terminate every sublunary pursuit although from the above cause the lecture on the manner of delineating the different passion and on the point of similarity between quadruped bird and fishie found upon this similarity be necessarily imperfect and have claim to the indulgence due to fragment and rough sketch yet they may be deem valuable acquisition to professor camper die at the hague in the vear painter they abound with sound criticismn and furnish hint which promise peculiar advantage to the delineator of the human passion or of object in the animal kingdom and they will greatly assist the connoisseur in judge of the accuracy and merit of performance in this department of painting in word the principle and hint advanced contain valuable germ the development of which promise a abundance of rich fruit to the intelligent artist it be the celebrity of these lecture in holland that make they attract the translator s notice and conviction of the truth and great utility of the principle advanced in they make he wish that the artist and connoisseur in great britain should enjoy the advantage to be derive from they but he have every reason to apprehend that they would remain deprive of these unless the work be under take by himself to competent acquaintance with both language the knowledge of anatomy be also necessary for the translation of treatise of this kind and through the presumption that every other person in the seven province possess thefe requisite might be engage in more impor tant employmient or be destitute of leisure he have impose sideration to submit to à labour which have not be very agreeable to translate have always appear to he like tread with slow and tedious pace over another man s ground after the eye have be satisfied with the prospect and with look at every object compose it but in this business he have to work he way through very intricate subject a involved stile for the professor pen be by no means equal to he pencil and through the still greater dif ficulty of a erroneous edition where the very numerous fault in the reference present perpetual embarrassment he claim to himself some degree of merit from this instance of self denial and urge it as plea for indulgence to any in cidental error from which it be scarcely possible for work of this kind to be totally exempt great attention have be pay to perspicuity and every idea peculiar to the author have be faithfully render but the translator have think himself at liberty to make some de viation of trivial nature in order to accommodate the work to the englishi reader of which the follow be the principal paraphrastical or explanatory description be sometimes add particularly in the reference to the five first plate of the first book the professor have uniformly confine himself to the concise algebraic mode but this conciseness and scientific appearance be frequently purchase by the loss of perspicuity and painful abstraction explanation be therefore subjoin until the reader familiarize with the subject and with the figure will no longer require they in the lecture that complimentary stile which the dutch literati still retain in all they public harangue particularly in the exordium and at the close be considerably retrench as it would be displeasing to a english ear accustom to greater simplicity the two first lecture be in the translation comprise in one since they relate to the same subject as they be deliver they be of the usual length but from the cause already mention they be render too concise in the publication to require à separation in the translation two publication give at different period be contract into one volume not much larger than either of the original volume this have be effectuate by the rejection of a essay on the principle of beauty vhich contain the substance of three lecture which have also be read before the academy and which the editor have subjoin to he second volume this essay would not have convey the same information to the englishi reader it might have do to the audience as mo camper have professedly adopt the theory of mo . burke with which we may suppose every englissiman of taste to be familiar al though it display considerable erudition yet this be mostly employ to exemplify the sentiment advanced in the chap ter on beauty the translator be therefore unwilling to destroy the uniformity of work entirely of practical nature and replete with important rule by subjoin speculation which have no immediate relation to practice and which would have appear defective to every one who have read the treatise of mo . burke or the more recent publica tion of the rev mo . alison the subject of the note will sufficiently sliew whether they be by the professor or he editor except the one in the page should the remark it contain be im pertinent the fault be not to be attribute to the professor if the principle advanced and illustrate in the follow page should appear to english artist and connoisseur as important as they do to they author and to he admirer in the dutch netherlands the translation can not be unac ceptable in country so renowned for its painter as great britain they apparently open new source of improvement and point out to younger artist new path for generous emulation it have be acknowledge by those who be quent the many exhibition of painting in the metropolis that somethiing of languor be take place from kind of uniformity that threaten to be prevalent the eye of the visitor be fatigue with view repetition of the beauty of the precede year and the most benevolent critic be weary of repeat the same accent of praise in they ap probation of excellency which be no longer novel have lose much of they power to charm will it be too sanguine a expectation if the hope be indulge that the follow publication will inspire artist with fresh vigour by point out to they unbeaten tract enable they to infuse unusual spirit dignity and character into some of they performance and by teach they to avoid in other those inaccuracy which have be perpetuate by a im plicit confidence in the rule and example of the most cele brated master may we not presume also that some con of painting will be animated to pursue the subject to greater extent and complete à study which professor camper have so happily begin and thus procure honour and emolu ment to himself by multiply the source of delight to every man of taste introduction painting and whatever be relative to the art have be my favourite amusement from my earliest year and as the characteristic difference in man and animal ap pear to I the most interesting object in nature be dispose to pay more than ordinary attention to these to draw and to model in clay be the recreation of my childisn hour as grow older be particularly strike with the figure and colour of the moor and with the dif ference in feature and complexion between the east indian black and the native of africa whenever copy after the best model of the ancient greek draw the head of pythian apollo venus de medicis hercule of farnese or place before I the beautiful figure of michael angelo quesnoi and other cele brated master of later date lobserve very great difference between the face of these and we own perceive also that they be much more pleasing than any of the figure of the flemishi school without be able to ascertain in what this preference might consist have learn to make use of oval and triangle accord ing to the principle lay down in every treatise on the art of draw and yet when copy from model in plaster from painting or from life always experience not only difficulty but a absolute impossibility of sketch head to advantage nor be satisfied with the proportion recom mend at sixteen year of age begin to paint in oil colour chiefly after the flemish master but as be already cap tivate with the superior dignity observable in the antique model the style of these master be not agreeable to I at the age of eighteen my instructor charle moor the younger to whose attention and care be indebt for any subsequent progress may have make in this art set I to paint one of the beautiful piece of van tempel in which there be the figure of moor that by no means pleased I in he colour he be black but he feature be european as could neither please myself nor gain any roper direction desisted from the undertake by cri tically examine the print take from guido reni man at seb ricci and ruben observe that they in painting the countenance of the eastern magi have like van tempel paint black man but they be not moor the celebrate engraver cornelius visscher be the only one who appear to I to have follow nature and to have properly characterize moor as advanced in year my attention and penetration in crease and imagine that by single glance of the eye be able to distinguish antique and to mark from the style the very period in which they be execute the majo rity of print take from the most beautiful engraving on representation of the roman emperor by hub golt pub lishied in the year which be otherwise fine piece and in nis græciæ ejusque insularum and asiae min numis mata although in some few of they the greek style be more or lef preserve in the work of tristan comment hist contenant en abrege les vie eloge des empereur jusque pertinax the antique be entirely lose through the unskilfulness of designer and engraver this observation be applicable to beger bonannus but the numismata in the thesaurus græc antig of gronovius and those of sicily naple of gravius and burmann be the most intolerable of all in the work of mountfaucon spon the design be make by artist of very moderate talent and be be cordingly very imperfect this could not offend the editor as they attention be totally confine to the historical branch and they could neither perceive nor relish transcendent beauty which however do not escape the notice of baron stosch notwithstanding that picart have generally spoiled it by he vicious taste count caylus though good designer have fail in this respect barbault have in few instance suc ceed incomparably well it be not before have form the plan of this treatise in the year that enjoy the opportunity of consult ing the excellent observation of winkelman on the imitation of the greek in painting and sculpture he preliminary discourse concern the art of design among the an tient and he monument of antiquity have since stu die he work with the utmost advantage although he no netrate observer term ideal be in fact found upon the of the human countenance the dissertation of tenkate upon ideal beauty have great merit but it do not instruct we in its true nature or principle follow lomazzo he have be miss by he they be both embarrass by adop the rule which constitute the harmony of music and which be not applicable to painting as the beauty of the latter do not depend upon certain immutable proportion but on other circumstance the excellent letter of my esteem friend the profound hemsterhuys teach we the influence of the beautiful upon gedanken uber die nachahmung der griekischen werke in der mahlereij und bildhauerkunst trattato preliminare dell arte dell disegno degli antichi popoli monumenti antichi inediti the mind but it do not indicate in what beauty consist or propose rule by which we may trace or produce it in the figure of object have examine the work of natter mariette and the cabinet of the duke of orlean and in all of these have remark manner and also deficiency of that taet which it be the object of these work to inspire even winkelman be destitute of it in execution so difficult be it to catch the spirit of the antient as long as the cause of they excel cy be not investigate and reduce to principle although albert durer be in reality great master and when we advert to the age in which he flourish we must allow he to have possess extraordinary merit yet he have lay the foundation of bad taste which have diffuse itself all over europe not except italy and which continue to exert its pernicious influence as be manifest from lomazzo who follow he implicitly except in the doctrine of mo ical harmony be applicable to painting it be also obvi we that lomazzo have consult pomponius gauricus de sculp tura and dolce as well as durer blind at thirty year of age this man be oblige to seek à subsistence by he ritings hence he numerous publication most of which fine the beautiful il bello per cosi dire non bello che par la sola sua bellezza the beautiful so to express myself trattato della pittura pag be merely beautiful by its own beauty how extra vagant to return must further remark that the excellent print from the work of rafael poussin titian and pietra testa pleased I much better than the finest piece of ruben or van dyck in both of which the division of albert durer and the imperfection of he oval be very conspicuous this be particularly the case in the painting of the holy vir gin and child in the celebrate gallery at dusseldorp which be in every other respect a excellent performance by frequently modelling in clay after the finest head of antiquity learn that albert durer by look at the object with both he eye have make they too broad and also learn that painter to excel must be proficient in model ling as well as in draw this will best enable he to form genuine idea of the real form of all object knowledge of optic be also requisite as have be fully prove in my inaugural dissertation in separate chapter on the constituent beauty of form shall hereafter show how much depend upon avoid defective manner of view the object which be occasion by the refraction of the ray of light in order to succeed it be also necessary to attend to the excellent rule of lyfip publish in the year it treat of the construction of the eye and the nature of vision introduction pus to make the head somewhat less the body more slender and delicate than they really be and they will be represent to greater advantage than by the most scrupulous exactitude when give lecture in the public college at amsterdam as professor of anatomy find by compare body of va rious age that be bring to I for dissection that the oval be not calculate for the delineation of the feature ith any degree of accuracy or expedition with this idea sawe several head both of man and of animal perpen dicularly through the middle and be fully convinced that the ball of the head form the cavity destine to contain the brain be in general very uniform but that the position of the upper and lower jaw be the manifest cause of the most strike difference the same observation may be ex tend from quadruped down to the finny race and it have suggest hint sufficiently numerous to form separate treatise the above examination have also enable I to discover whence those change arise which progressively take place in we feature from infancy to the most advanced age but still be unable to explain in what manner it be that the greek should have acquire at very remote period that capita minora faciendo quam antiqui corpora graciliora siccioraque per quæ procerita signorum major videretur ab illis facto quale essent homine se quale viderentur esse plin lib xxxiv cap viii sect pag and dignify expression which they give to they figure and which have never see perfectly equal erceive moreover that in the copy take from these the facial line do not differ from we own this will appear by compare the figure of plate which be the head of augustus caesar engrave by dioscoride with the first figure of the second plate have contemplate the inhabitant of various nation with greater attention conceive that strike difference be occasion not merely by the position of the inferior form of this maxilla this idea be confirm by contem plat considerable collection which afterwards make of head that acknowledge various country for they parent or of exact copy from they exclusive of several skull of my countryman and of the adjacent nation possess two of english negroe the one be young person the other ad vance in year the head of female hottentot of a inhabitant of mogul —à chinese youth of madagascar celebean and finally the cranium of calmuck that be of eight different nation when be at oxford in the year also take sketch of the lower jaw of native of otaheite that have be bring over by captain king have never be able to obtain possession of the cranium of native american nor even of a anglo american which have however some pecu liarity that be point out to I by that celebrate artist mo . west of which as he be bear in pennsylvania he be the best qualified to judge they face be long and narrow and the socket of the eye surround the ball in so close manner that no space be allow for large upper eye lid which be so graceful to the countenance of most european when in addition to the skull of negro have procure one of calmuck and have place that of a ape contiguous to they both observe that line draw along the fore nead and the upper lip indicate this difference in national physiognomy and also point out the degree of similarity between negroe and the ape by sketch some of these eature upon horizontal plane obtain the line which mark the countenance with they different angles when make these line to incline forward lobtain the face of a antique backward of negroe still more backward the line which mark a ape dog snipe .— this disco very form the basis of my edifice the large and populous city of amsterdam moreover af ford I various opportunity of collect the skull and other bone of the decease in regular progrefsion from arliest infancy up to decrepit age by compare these with ach other my thought be direct to the natural differ ence occasion by the gradual growth of the part in youth and they decay in advanced age and also to the manner by vhich this discrepancy of year might be most accurately de lineat hence arise the first stage of my edifice the se cond be form by critical investigation of the line which ancient master prefer in they best production finally while be scrutinize the utility of the oval and triangle which be propose as the furest direction for design human head the examination and comparison of the skull and maxillæ which have be sawn through discover to I new and more simple manner of portraying any form of head pleased either of man or of animal with much greater degree of precision as meet with sew connoisseur in painting and still fewer who enjoy speculation of this kind my pursuit be totally neglect until the year when be in company with my much esteem friend mo . van hemsterhuys at the house of he excellency the count of bentinck lord of rhoon we examine together number of beautiful in ately the original from the counterfeit the grecian from the ciple of my knowledge which explain with the addi tion of the lead observation have formerly make the count who be distinguishied judge and sound critic in every branch of the polite art be strike with the simplicity of my discovery and urge I with he usual politeness to arrange and more fully explain my idea as they appear of utility upon retire to my country residence in order to enjoy relaxation from my academical labour undertake this be duous task but numberless difficulty present themselves it be not only necessary to make drawing of the different bone of the face but to do this with accuracy this be finally furmount the drawing be to be reduce to the same scale and properly arrange the best antique and also the print take from they be to be examine and study ancient and modern writer on the natural history of man and on the principle of draw be to be peruse with attention digest the work swell under my hand not only become more extensive but promise to be more extensively useful flatter myself that it would prove acceptable not only to those who admire the masterly performance of ancient artist but also to those who be engage in the study of to ural history and to all young pupil in the art of draw and of sculpture employ every hour of leisure from other occupation finish the sketch of the present treatise towards the end of august in the year with my discovery as be generally the case communicate they to several admirer of the fine art they imagine that considerable service might be render to the science of painting and particularly to the academy of draw establissied at amsterdam be to deliver some public lecture upon the subject before the member of that society these deliver on the first and second day of august in the year before numerous and respectable audience the president and chief patron of the institution burgo master huygen and the other director be pleased to expref they approbation of my endeavour by present I with golden medal « not less than sixteen year elapsed before convenient opportunity of publish this treatise present itself vari we engagement prevent I from revise it with atten tion in order to enlarge or abridge as might be judge ne cessary the difficulty have to find out a intelligent and skilful engraver be another obstacle at length the cele brated mo . vinkele be prevail upon to engrave the sketch but the various occupation of this distinguished artist be the cause of further procrastination at length it appear accompany with the wishie of its author that it may meet with indulgence and give satisfaction the medal be present after the author have deliver some other lecture which complete he plan they treat of the subject contain in the second book of this work it be the usual medal of the academy on the reverse of which vas the follow inscription in the dutch language —ee present to the learn ee peter camper by the director of this academy as grateful acknowledg eement for the useful lecture deliver before the general assembly in the year ee and part the first chapter concern the characteristic difference of feature in the most distinguished people on the globe when we observe concourse of people assemble to gether in large commercial city from the different quarter of the globe we be able to distinguissi by à single glance of the eye not merely negroe from white man but among the latter we discriminate jew from christians spa niard from frenchmen or german and thefe from the english it be also possible to distinguish native of the south ern part of france from those of the more northern unless they have be blend by intermarriage the scot be also know from the english and both from the lrishi in the city of holland national physiognomy be lose but islander retain the original feature the inhabitant of hindelopen molkwerum and koudum have still the small those also of the face and long chin of they ancestor bildt be eafily distinguishable from they nearest continental neighbour by they short and compress feature each country therefore have some peculiarity which be per petuate until the accidental blend of different people render they distinguishing mark dubious or entirely oblite rate they war colonization commerce navigation and shipwreck have so completely intermix the inhabitant of the most distant country that characteristic distinction be only to be find among those of central province that be remote from the access of stranger in country that lie contiguous to each other and in island adjacent to conti nent the change be gradual and scarcely to be perceive but by compare the different extreme people be distinguissied accord to the grand division of continent into european african asiatic and americans the inhabitant of these principal part of the earth includ ing the islander of the south seas inhabitant of new hol land and new zealand have never be discriminate from each other by permanent characteristic or personal indica tion alonc some attribute peculiar to the quarter of the world or the specification of some singular ornament pecu these be inhabitant of different district in friezland on the border of the zuyder sea they be remarkable for retain the original simplicity of manners singularity of dress and reject matrimonial connection with any of they neigh bour liarity of dress or custom have always be add thus a asiatic be distinguished from a european by colour and dress the african and american be somewhat similar in colour and dress be know by the addition of crocodile a elephant cargo of tobacco incision of the skin tatow ing plume of feather it be however fact that the inhabitant of northern europe the laplander for example be of more tawny complexion than those of java nor be many of the persian or the subject of the mogul empire of darker complexion than the spanissi even the caffre although they be in habitant of africa be remarkably different from the ango lese and the nubian some of the american tribe seem to derive they origin rom the northern country of asia the similarity of they make mode of live manners religion render this con the many journy also take ecture extremely probable from russia through siberia kamtschatka st . andry to america and more particularly the celebrate voyage of the late capt cook afford additional proof of the fact the possibility of make the passage will be obvious to every one who consult the excellent chart publissied by that unfortunate circumnavigator in he last work and he will be convinced that it be not difficult for the laplander sa moied siberian kamtschatkan and the savage nation of asia to find they way to america through the same passage no man who contemplate the whole human race as it be now spread over the face of the earth without predilection gle pair that be form by the immediate hand of god long after the world itself have be create and have pass through numberless change from this pair all the habitable part of the earth be gradually propagate the difference vary while the contexture of the skin be uniformly similar in all man have demonstrate upon former occasion that it be immaterial whether the colour of we first parent be black or fair since change from white to black be equally great as the reverse have in my collection of natural curiosity several speci mens of the skin of moor italian and of the fairest dutch woman in which the membrana reticularis be to greater or less degree of dusky hue so that no essential difference exist whichever of the proposition be advanced it sometimes happen that this reticular membrane become as black in we fairest woman during they pregnancy as that of the blackest negro or angolese of this curious instance pre sent itself in the year the abdome and breast of woman naturally of fair complexion have totally change in treatise on the colour of negroe they colour the celebrate le cat have also mention se veral instance of similar kind darkness of complexion begin also to diminisn in process of time of which have preserve various specimen in the skin of moor thus it be evident that the fairest skin may become black and the darkest become fair without we be able to afcer tain the immediate cause the influence of the sun be uni versally acknowledge but the above mention change in regnant woman to which might be add instance of white negroe and of those who be render pale through various indisposition manifest that other cause operate upon this membrane as well as the sun s ray and wliy not do not the blood throw off dark coloured particle to the inward surface and to the iris of the eye while the tunica albuginea remain perfectly white many other instance might be give where different part of the body acquire such sur face that they do not reflect the ray of light that be they appear dark every tyro in philosophy know that object have no colour in themselves and that the idea of colour be excited in we accord to the manner in which the ray of light be refract since we be totally ignorant at what period after the formation of the globe man be create and the human race begin to spread over the earth we shall confine ourselves to the difference in the human species that now exist the traité de la couleur de la peau humaine edit amsterd art iv buffon have anticipate and exhaust this subject in he excellent dissertation ee on man and the variety in the « human species æ shall merely select the peculiarity that refer more immediately to we purpose and take the calmuck as specimen the calmuck compare with ourselves and more par ticularly with the most celebrate figure of antiquity be deem the ugliest of all the inhabitant of the earth they face be flat and very broad from one cheek bone to the other the nose be so flat that the sight penetrate into the nostril the eye be near to each other the lip be thick and the uppermost lip be long they resemble the inhabit ant of siam as describe by loubiere whose face be broad acrof the check while they forehead and chin terminate in point so that they form be more rhomboidal than oval compare plate fig with plate iii fig which repre send the profile and front face of calmuck accord to buffon the face of the chinese be broad and round they have small eye and large eye brow the only chinese have ever see be at london in the year the smallness of the nose do not strike I upon examine the cranium of chinese in my possession ob serve that the cavity or socket of the eye be situate near together but that they be place obliquely nor be they high in the forehead the os jugale or cheek bone be not see nat hist part iii pag but prominent the superior maxilla from the bot tom of the nose to the tooth be narrow as in the otaheite and contrary to that of the calmuck consequently they can not have broad upper lip the greatest singularity that strike I equally in cele bese chinese and a otaheite consist in the rectangular form of the inferior maxilla see plate fig have also remark the same in all the woman bear in asia of dutch or english parent this render the lower part of the face much broader than it be in other nation the whole form of the cranium of a otaheite and chinese be so very similar that might venture to conclude that the inhabitant of otaheite and the friendly isle be colony from china notwithstanding the greatness of the distance on examine the cranium of moluccan that be in my possession observe that the angle of the lower jaw be not so large but that the upper jaw project more as in the negro and the calmuck readily agree with buffon that the inhabitant of the northern part of the mogul empire and of persia the arme nian the turk georgian mingrelian circassian and the inhabitant of europe in general be not only the fairest but have however see many armenian whose countenance be not pleasing the native of the more southern part of france particularly the female still retain the semicircular form of the upper maxilla and that smoothness of countenance which be so strike in the pythian apollo and the grecian venus most of the northern french have very small head ind sharp face like the scot and many among we that be the os jugale recede and do not spread as in the cal muck compare plate ii fig with plate fig difference be not easily discerned by one that be not be custom to modelling but there be no nation so distinguishable as the jew man woman and child from they birth bear the character istic mark of they race mo . west the distinguished painter vith whom have frequently converse upon the subject confess my inability to discover in what this national nose acknowledge that this contribute much and that it give they resemblance to the lafcar of whom have see number in london and have even take the model of face in paris plaster but there be still somewhat un explain it be upon this account that the famous de wit have so ill succeed in the council chamber at the stadt house of amsterdam he have exhibit in he painting several man with beard but they be not israelite it would be impracticable to delineate all the characteris tic variety that exist in nature to avoid a expensive multitude of plate ishall consider the calmuck as the repre sentative of all asia from siberia to new zealand and also of north america as it be more than probable that this people be

concern the different shape of the human head state andrefute herodotus hippocrate suida aristotle pliny mela and many other writer of antiquity have uniformly maintain that the variety of form observable nd other natural cause but also from some original artifice which finally give birth to determine form this opinion have be adopt by some of the most eminent writer among the modern as cardan vesalius schenck and more recently haller and the count de buffon and it seenis to be confirm by the remark of numberless traveller have controvert the sentiment upon former occasion the whole of the present treatise will manifest its absurdity do not venture to oppose a opinion uniformly support by such respectable authority until about thirty year ago the fotus of female negro come into

without decide whether this proceed from art or be na tural . see observ faite pendant le voyage de mon cook paris tom viii greater wonder that it do not prove injurious to they mental faculty it be most probable that these be singular instance for captain cook speak of the inhabitant of nootka sound in he last voyage simply observe that they have the forehead rather low without make any other remark mo . hugh also who describe the inhabitant of mention of such custom and extol the vivacity of the carribee but to return to the antient hippocrate seem dispose to attribute the particular form of the head to the conduct of midwive and nurse he observe that many person consider the oblong form of the head as the most graceful press they flat during infancy and that they thus acquire naturally the particular shape which nation consider as the most pleasing vesalius support this idea and also assert that some mid wife have be bribe by mother to shape the head of they child into the form of ball he conjecture that the flatness and breadth of the occiput in the german proceed from the manner in which infant be bound in portable cradle which the mother carry on they back when they travel and that the more oblong form observable in the head of dutch child arise from they be perpetually place on the side in the cradle neither of these eminent man have vol ii chap page and de aere locis into consideration the natural form of the pelvis which in this country particularly be frequently so narrow that the head of the infant can not paf until the throe of the mother have mould it into a oblong form by which the diameter be lessen it be therefore not surprizing that the learn should have acknowledge the influence of art or that scaliger should have confidently assert that the genoese have derive the custom from they ancestor the moor should press the head of they sleeping child until art become nature and the whole race be bear with head and mind of thersite car danus expressly say that among the provincial of portus vetus in the west indy the people have no neck but head of quadrangular shape that this originate from art it have be customary to compress the head between plank but that nature finally succeed to art count de buffonj relate from raleigh that there be nation in guiana whose neck be so extremely short and shoulder so elevate that they eye seem to be place upon they shoulder and they mouth upon they breast the count properly compare these to the scythian and to the acephali of the antient it be very probable that the anti ent consider ape and the orang outang as belong to the human race and also the modern traveller see they at distance have mistaken they for man pliny when he treat of athiopia observe that the blemmyi have no head sthat they eye and mouth be place upon they breast and that some who be destitute of head have they eye place upon they shoulder he also ad vance upon the authority of eudoxus that in some part of india the man have foot a oll long while those of the woman be so small that they have the name of struthopode sparrowfeet and also that the ear of some be so long and broad that they can hide themselves behind they straboj relate upon the testimony of onesicritus that the ear of some man in india hang down to they heel so that they could snugly sleep upon they however he allow the accouut to be fabulous pomp mela assert with confidence that the otomegalo have such large ear that they could en tirely envelop themselves in they solinus say that there be man in india mean thie panote who cover themselves with they own ear in the voyage of captain cook « mention be make of the inhabitant of easter island whose ear be slit through the middle and hang down almost to they shoulder count de buffon enlarge very judicioussy upon the cause of the national difference that take place in different people he reduce these to three ist the influence of climate of food of manners and custom respect the first cause that the colour depend upon it do not admit of doubt and yet it be fact that in the coldest climate such as greenland and kamtschatka the native be nearly as black as in madagascar however the hottest climate yield man of the deepest jet unless they intermix with the inhabitant of other nation the peculiar form of the eye cheek maxillary bone and particularly of the nose may safely be attribute to the influence of climate as we be upon the subject it will not be improper to ob serve that no great dependence can be place upon the portrait of different nation give in the voyage of captain cook the painter mo webber have in most of they indi cate too much of the mannerist for example in the woman of otaheite represent in the and zyth plate however he appear to have be more exact in delineating the upper eye lid in the woman of new holland and diemen s land in plate the and the woman of oonalaska have the same physiognomy and the same small eye lid as those of kamtschatka mo . west inform I that ahis be peculiarity observable also in the english thaf be bear in north america the object of the painter seem to have be to represent the head and countenance of well proportion man and pleasing woman this be remarkably the case in the young female of otaheite particularly in the and z plate to whom he have give the feature of frenchwome on the other hand those animal which have nothing pleasing in they figure be always reprefent as monster as will appear from the plate the influence of food may be learn from we own animal the horse cow and sheep although there be no great diversity of climate in the different province of holland rich or meagre pasturage change the form the horn and the wool of animal under the article of nutrition comprehend fluid and peculiarity of atmosphere as well as food but how these operate and why the upper maxilla of negro and the cheek bone of calmuck project and why the socket of the eye be lower and more oblique in chinese and moluccan can not be fully explain to observe and point out parti climate frequently co operate but we can not suppose they productive of different race black tawny and white man be simply variety they do not constitute essential difference we skin be precisely of the same contexture with that of the negro but it be not of so deep dye it be probable that the hair become long and straight or curl or frizzed accord to the nature of the food chiefly it be remarkable that the native of drent and of the bishiopric of munster have naturally sleek hair but after they bave resided some year in amsterdam it begin to curl of this we have many instance manners and custom indubitably operate with great force upon the form and posture of the body polish educa tion render the whole figure elegant of this we have daily instance in polissied nation particular manner of sit of lie of stand and walk various corporeal defect and other circumstance of the like nature give particular cast to the whole body this be so obviously the case that the countenance of de form person will become deform that be it sink gradually by the pressure of the brain which have now lose its equipoise thus the socket of the one eye sink lower than that of the other of this have very remarkable instance in my abinet in person that be lame the whole knee turn in ward by the twist give to the femoral bone in those who be form awry or be very round shouldered the clavicle be straighter and longer shall not mention the pernicious effect of stay with which so many of we female spoil the shape of they child without be admonissied by they wn we ridicule the chinese for maim the foot of they female in so forcible manner and yet we be guilty of simi lar folly as have demonstrate upon another occasion nay in treatise concern the best form of shoe we exceed they for we not only incapacitate the female sex from walk but we disable ourselves the fillet that bind up the hair of we ordinary woman leave a impression in they head garter make deep furrow under the knee as effectually with we as with the inhabitant of brasil who consider it as a ornament education employment and suitable mode of living add beauty both to the feature and to the limb they render the whole body more elegant such be the difference between person genteelly educated and those who have be totally neglect that it be scarcely credible that manners and habit should be able to effectuate such change in the same be various endemic disease be not less influential the rachite or ricket may occasion numberless deformity of body by the way it appear from the writings of hippo rate that the inhabitant of the most salubrious climate in he universe be subject to this disease as well as those of the more northern or southern region otherwise he would not have be able to describe the disease which be derive from this source in so masterly manner in proportion as the indisposition arise from deformity be subject for commiseration ought the cruel and inhuman taste of the contemporary of longinus to be hold in contempt he tell we that they take pleasure in keep dwarf lock longinus de sublimitate xiii page in confine chest and in swath they with bandage on purpose to give they some ludicrous deformity this conduct appear to he so cruel that he inclined to doubt the fact but we learn from suetonius that such deform person be keep in all the house of the great tiberius prohibit these ludibria naturæ but alexander severus on the contrary amused the populace with they in russia they be still exhibit in the palace of the nobility physiological observation concern the difference of face in profile from ape ourang negroe and other class of people up to the antique the assemblage of cranium and profile of two ape negro and calmuck in the first plate may perhaps excite surprise the strike resemblance between the race of monky and of black particularly upon superficial view have induce some philosopher to conjecture that the race of black originate from the commerce of the white with ourang and pongo or that these monster by gradual im provement finally become man this be not the place to attempt full confutation of so extravagant notion must refer the reader to physiological dissertation concern the ourang outang publish in the year shall simply observe at present that the vhole generation of ape from the largest to the smallest re quadruped not form to walk erect and that from the very construction of the larynx they be incapable of speech further they have great similarity with the canine species particulary respect the organ of generation the diversity observable in these part seem to mark the boundary which the creator have place between the various class of animal the proximity of the eye to each other the smallness and apparent flatness of the nose and the projection of the upper lip constitute the principal point of resemblance and these be much exaggerate by we modern naturalist by they heighten description and embellish plate but they will immediately diminish in we estimation if we give attention to the whole body or minutely examine every part of the head this will evidently appear by compare together the different figure of the first plate all the figure in the first second and fourth plate be sketch in profilex in this manner the difference may basis of the feature which be immediately place upon and under they in each of these figure the greatest accuracy and preci sion have be diligently study for

it be form by the rule of art alone and when it do not rise to degree the face begin to re semble some species of monky this will be fully explain hereafter . to proceed with as much perspicuity as possible shall place the facial line mg . erect in the perpendicular line hi see plate ii fig the angle be now become degree larger and the cavity of the eye cheek bone be bring forward and nearer to nm imagine cranium of pliable consistence and that the occiput could be press forward and upwards then must ec or the distance from the aperture of the ear to the vertex inerease and again the space although the cavi tie of the eye and the eye themselves will still remain in the line the line which mark the oblique direction of the lower jaw rise also in the same proportion until it approach to until it coincide withd as in figure or rise above it as in fig of the same plate on the other hand the distance between tx that be between the facial line and the perpendicular line that pass from the vertex by the orifice of the ear gain as much as xo have lose the head become gradually narrower also in proportion as the facial line rise and incline forward into the tooth degree which be the maximum or utmost that the artificial line will permit in this case the eye place in the centre of they cavity be exactly in the middle of the head or at a equal distance from the vertex and the bottom of the chin see figure of the same plate if the project part of the forehead be make to exceed the degree the head become mishapen and assume the appearance of the hydrocephalus or watery head it be very surprising that the artist of ancient greece should have choose precisely the maximum while the best roman artist have limit themselves to the degree which be not so pleasing as the comparison of the and ath figure of this plate will evince the two extremity therefore of the facial line be from degree from the negro to the grecian antique make it under and you describe a ourang or a ape lessen it still more and you have the head of dog in crease the minimum and you form fowl fnipe for ex ample the facial line of which be nearly parallel with the horizon that be both the maxillæ will be lengthen and the lower maxilla will gradually lose its angle cv no pace be now leave for tooth which explain the reason why fowl be destitute of tooth have sometimes amused myself with make these gra dation upon smaller scale by sketch they on long it be slip of paper which exhibit singular appearance not necessary to give specimen as they can be easily make by every one skilled in draw if attention be give to the angle mg which describe the angle form by the facial line and the lower extremity of the chin see the four figure of the first plate it will be im mediately perceive that this become larger more rect angular in proportion as the facial line ascend it be therefore the largest in european as in fig plate ii gi and that it project forward with the facial line which it always follow as in fig of plate ii in this situation the angle of the lower jaw become more erect the distance from to become less and be rounder it be this which make the maxilla of the antique head rounder and more graceful as will appear in the ath fig of the second plate the eye which be place nearly in line with the upper edge of they socket gradually recede in a european and the antique that be or the distance from the eye to the ridge of the nofe gradually become greater see the and ath lower fig of plate ii this give certain elegance and dignity to the countenance of the antique which can not be otherwise acquire it be plain if the cavity of the eye remain at the same distance from the perpendicular line and the forehead be make to project forward that this depth or distance will increase accord to the degree of projection see the same plate and figure if be not deceive the size of the mouth be in propor tion to the distance of the dente canini or eye tooth in man and animal with only few exception or to speak more properly the angles terminate at the commencement of the first double tooth or grinder many animal have not the eye tooth in ape therefore in the orang and in the negro the rim or angle of the mouth must be more distend than in a european as the projection of the upper jaw enlarge the do tance for the same reason the mouth of the antique will be the smallest the central line of the ear be in all person somewhat inclined as have represent it in figure and of the sixth plate it be never parallel with the facial line in white man it be however in the negro as be apparent from the third figure of the first plate have place the central line of the ear perpendicularly in the second plate that the true distance of the eye from the ear may be more accurately ascertain chapter iv remark concern difference in the facial line and the change which necessarily arise from thence in the precede chapter have simply shew the kind of angle which the oblique line mg . make in all the figure of the first and second plate let we now pay attention to the triangle of plate fig and and it will appear that this triangle be not remarkably large in the european represent in plate ii fig in the second figure of this second plate it be totally efface in the third the angle be come minus and in the fourth the minus be increase let we now suppose that all these head be of a equal size and that the nose of each project to a equal distance from the line or surface plate fig and it be manifest that the nose of the negro and calmuck will seem to be less and as it be press inwards the nose of the european plate ii fig will appear somewhat bent and also to project farther than the upper lip in the face of the antique fig the nose will be nearly in perpendicular line with the forehead and project but little from the lip the lower jaw as well as the upper be also much for warder in the negro caffre and calmuck and therefore it be that these people approach nearer to the figure of a ape than either the european or the antique the line mg be nearly the same with the line mg compare the lower sketch with the upper in plate fig and in calmuck the upper jaw be very flat before because the cheek bone plate fig be very large nearly advance to the perpendicular line tt that be directly over the middle molaris or grinder in the chinese otaheite and other orientals the cheek bone correspond with the di vision between the third and fourth grinder hindwards in the negro be obviously shorter and the line falls behind the third grinder in the european be behind the fourth grinder and in the antique head it come yet more for ward hence it follow that the feature of antique those of apollo for example must be flatter than ours and on the other hand those of asiatic and african still flatter and those of the calmuck the flattest of all the distance from ntog from the undermost part of the nose to the union of the upper and lower tooth be greater in calmuck than in negro and in he greater than in we on the contrary ng be very short in a asiatic the lip must necessarily be longer and thicker in proportion to this distance and therefore be the upper lip the longest and thickest in calmuck and the smallest in the antique if attention be pay to what may be call the suspension of the face the distance of pf fig and plate the axis upon which the head move from the line of the lower maxilla il in negro or calmuck plate fig and or the european plate ii fig it will appear that the maxilla and the chin be deeper or lower in the two former than in the latter the condyle also or prominence on which the head turn be in the same line as the union of the tooth of the upper and lower jaw see plate fig hence it follow that the neck of calmuck be shorter than that of a european or rather that it appear to be shorter because the lower jaw or chin sink so much lower in proportion as the chin be lower the condyle of the neck shorter and the shoulder raise in consequence of the length of the cla vicle as be the case with the orang and with all deform per son will the head sink more upon the breast and the stronger will be the resemblance to the people who be denominate acephali and who be say to exist in guinea again as the foramen magnum of the occiput be not always place at a equal distance from the perpendicular line and as the condyle be place in a oblique direction before and on each side of the foramen it follow that the centre of motion of the head will vary considerably in different peo ple the line extend from the extreme point of the mouth to that of the occiput may be compare to lever of which the centre of motion be in now in proportion as the distance from ntoc be increase will the face project for ward and the neck will appear shorter the follow appear to be the different proportion in the calmuck be nc or the distance from the extremity of the tooth to the orifice of the ear compare with cd or the distance from this orifice to the extreme part of the oc ciput as to or nearly as to the negro be nc cd the european be nc cd in the antique be nc cd head of the calmuck must of consequence incline forward and sink upon the shoulder the head of negroe incline backward as the heaviest part be behind the centre of motion the head of the orang outang must be more for ward than that of the calmuck for the reason give and the head of the ape the dog horse still more than either of these the head of the european remain in a equipoise which give they something of a haughty mien in the antique the gentle inclination of the head par ticularly in the statue communicate the most state and dig nity to the countenance since begin to compose this treatise have be able to procure the entire cranium of chinese who die in the flower of he age the facial line be degree the cavity of the eye be in breadth compare with they height as to in the european they be equal it be not surprising therefore that the countenance of the chinese should have à melancholy aspect and that the chink or fissure form by the upper and lower eye lid be naturally so long they superior maxilla be narrow that be the space from to be very small so that they can not have large lip however the lower jaw be of more quadrangular form than in the european or the negro in the chinese it make a angle of degree in the european of and in the negro see svw in plate ii fig and plate fig the lower jaw of the chinese have upon this be count something of the ape and particularly of the orang in its form

front the third plate exhibit at first glance the principal difference between the negro calmuck and european as copy from nature and also the head of pythian apollo draw accord to the principle advanced and which will be more fully consider hereafter the orang outang that be represent in profile in the second figure of the first plate be now place in front that the breadth of the jugal or cheek bone mn may be more accurately compare with the breadth of the head at po and that the small space between the eye may be com pared with that in the calmuck in the orang the length of the head ih compare with ts greatest breadth at po be in the proportion of to and po compare with the breadth of the cheek bone mn as to that be equal mn compare with the breadth of the temporal bone xw be as to reader will perceive that all the correspondent part be place upon the horizontal line and that the height of each be also adapt to the scale of its profile let we now examine the negro plate iii fig this head in length compare with its breadth be as to be but mn xw the lower jaw uv be as do the whole face gradually diminish from in the direction of mv to and onu retain much of the oval form the aperture of the nose be very wide com pared with the length of the nose so that ef be to dc as to it necessarily follow that the pinnæ which be form to cover these aperture will be expand on each side and the nose will be very broad the distance of the cavity of the eye yz be as so that the eye exceed in nearness to each other the breadth of the nose and the pinnæ which be place at the side of ef will be at least as in breadth in this negro the diameter of the eye socket from the fore head downwards be very large that be kl be equal to so that the eye might have be large in other have find the cavity smaller as also in the chinese there be also great difference among european in this respect when draw line from the upper edge of the small nasal bone at over the broadest part of the nose at down to qand the four dente incisorii and the two dente canini or eye tooth be inclose between they now as the mouth always cover the eye tooth qr will necessarily limit the breadth of the mouth in proportion as the distance froin qto be great compare with the breadth of the maxilla at vur will the mouth appear ugly and dispropor tion qr be nearly as and vur a have small ear but as the mammillary process be the breadth of the cheek bone mn they stand off from the head this be observable in all negroe the calmuck be very differently form plate iii fig the proportion be as follow the height of the head ih compare with its breadth at be as to or to compare with mn the projection of the jugal bone be as to compare with the temple be as to the lower jaw be as or face have also something of lozenge or rhomboidal form it be narrow and point towards the crown become broad at op be the broadest at nm and become suddenly small at uv this have be already remark by la lou biere the aperture of the nose ef be as so that the pinnae can not be very broad but the opening in the nostril be very conspicuous as will be obvious by compare the cranium with the face in plate fig distance of the eye socket yz be very small so that the eye stand much closer together than in the negro the diameter of these cavity at compare with ih lie upon the jugal bone the fissure must be oblong at least must appear so as the pleats or wrinkle in the smaller can thus or angle seem to lengthen it in the chinese the eye socket be broader than they be high hence they have long eye the triangle cqr draw in the same manner as in the negro describe qr that be include the four dente incisorii and the half of the eye tooth the other portion be add the mouth will become and seven eighth or nearly the cheek bone be remarkably broader than the head that be mn op the ear be almost hide behind they as in ape and particularly in that de scribe in fig of this plate which have also à strike re semblance to the calmiuck in the narrow space between the eye breadth of the jaw bone and flatness of the face very different from those in the calmuck be the proportion observable in modern european particularly in we own countryman for ih po wx face therefore have the form of a oval which be shorter in proportion to its breadth than that of the negro the distance between the edge of the eye socket yz be equal to the breadth of the nasal aperture we eye be place at greater distance from each other and as the diameter of these socket kl be there be space for large eye but the pinnae of the nose be broader than the space between the eye the ear be closer to the head in consequence of op the parietal bone be so much broader than the jugal bone mn this will be clearly understand from what have be advanced concern the negro and calmuck the triangle cor be longer and the distance from the upper part of the nasal bone to the junction of the tooth at be greater thus be the mouth qr obviously smaller ef in the european be equal to ef in the negro that be the mouth qr moreover be to uv equal to compare with antique the facial line mg . be make to project see plate ii fig jthe crown become more elevate and rise from to which be equal to the degree of projection at mh hence it be that in the fifth figure of this third plate the head of the antique be make so high although it be form after the same model artist have also make mn the jugal bone equal to po the parietal bone in breadth the occiput be narrower the maxillæ smaller and the eye be place at greater distance from each other in the antique the follow proportion be observe ihpo wx vur the face be in the form of more oblong oval the antient divide po into four equal part one for each eye and one for the distance between the eye poa ayz whereas it be only in the modern head the nose also incline forward as represent in the lower sketch plate ii fig it be proportionably longer see th and the upper lip become proportionably shorter the nasal aperture remain of the same width as in we the pinnæ be equal to yz or the space between the eye and also to the size of the mouth qr through the projection of the facial line the eye be deeper seat and the middle line which run acrof the angles of the eye divide ih into two equal part at but this take place alone when mg . the facial line make a angle of to degree with which be the maximum of its inclination see plate ii fig vi diversity of feature in the countenance of different people naturally explain have already enumerate in the second chapter all the cause alledge by ancient and modern writer of the diversity of make observable in the human counte nance and we have add we opinion to that of the acute naturalist count de buffon that the climate under which we include the influence of air of food and custom be of itself sufficient to give some particular and appropriate form to the bone and consequently to the softer part when we add the different disease peculiar to some country which co operate with the above cause we shall not be surprised that similar diversity should be find in the human species do persed over different part of the globe as may be observe in plant fowl quadruped it have we hope be fully demonstrate that in the negro the upper maxilla naturally project remarkably for ward and that in consequence of that formation the line mg . incline backward make a angle of degree as represent in plate fig and hence it necessarily follow that the fore tooth must also project and that to cover these the lip particularly the upper lip must be long thick and broad and the under lip must also be conformable to the other the nose advancing farther than the line ts in similar proportion see plate fig must appear from the jut out of the upper lip to be press inwards no art be require to produce this appearance nor be it requisite for mother or midwive to squeeze in the one or stretch out the other the width of the nasal aperture in the cranium require the nose to be broad and that the pinna which be place xternally should be proportionate to the aperture in the bony part why have not philosopher and traveller who suffer themselves to be deceive by idle tale inform we that the negroe make the side of they nose spread by means of some compress they accidentally strike they against the back of they mother might perhaps flatten the carti laginous part but could not enlarge the nostril on each side with such perfect symmetry the flatness of the face depend upon the extention of the jugal bone from toq plate and ii hence it be clear to à demonstration that the face of the eastern be not render flat by artificial compression but that they be so from natural cause at least they appear flat when compare with we ovn it have also be shew that in the negro the back part of the head be heavier than the fore part that be cde be heavier than plate fig the negro therefore naturally throw he head backward particularly young person while the neck be protrude forward and the loin bend inwards in order to maintain a equilibrium it be from this cause that they have small hip and that the pelvis be generally narrow its breadth compare with its depth be in the proportion of to while in most other man who be well form it be as to as the negroe with whom we be best acquainted have be slave and be compel to hard labour from they tender year they knee become bent in a inward or outward di rection and hence it be that so many of they have crook many other cause might be add upon which shall not enlarge as it be not my plan to give minute description of the whole body what have be advanced will sufficiently demonstrate that change the colour or in crisp the hair and that to nature alone these difference must be ascribe for similar reason be the face of calmuck chinese and siamese flat the nose small the nostril open and expose they lip will be larger or smaller accord to the size of the upper maxilla let we admit for moment that the side of they head be press between plank accord to the narrative of ancient author whence be it that the jugal bone spread out so mucht they also must have be compress from vhat cause be the distance between they eye so small lf this proceed from they be press closer together the upper aw instead of be much broader than with other people must also have become flatter at the side as cq be so long see plate fig and the back part of the head cde so small compare with its opposite etgsc the head must necessarily hang over and the subject become round shouldered that be directly opposite to the form of the negro the head will also sink between the shoulder as in the orang and other species of ape the head of the calmuck be decidedly greater than ours while they body be small besides they can not walk per fectly upright and they knee be somewhat extend in the manner of we porter when they carry heavy load on they head this must render they figure disagreeable in we eye who be accustom to see tall person or time the length of they head whereas this people the inhabitant of lap land of brazil and some other country be scarcely the length of six head in they stature most of these people sit upon the ground without use chair whence they naturally stan more and not only appear shorter but accord to we idea more deform in a european the inclination of the superior maxilla be the same with that of the facial line which form a angle of degree see plate ii fig the nose become larger should we not deem it very ridiculous if travel or philosophic negro or calmuck in describe the particular form of we feature be gravely to asfert that we mid wife mother or nurse pull we by the nose during we infant day in order to give it the requisite length it be observable that the inhabitant of these dutch pro bone during infancy and childhood hence it be that we forehead be frequently high flat and broad while the lower part of the face be small and delicate both the upper and lower maxilla be with we extremely small the hip be broad in both sex which occasion waddling motion and render we countryman less agile than those who have smaller hip ancient artist follow in this respect the cha racter of they statue in the farnese hercule the breadth compare with the depth be make as to in the pythian apollo it be as to in the antinous as the proportion of alb durer be as to in we female the proportion be as to the greek have make it in the venus de medicis as to that be they have make the body smaller thicker and more rotund in word it would be absurd to acknowledge the influence of art in make the hair straight or curl the leg thick or thin the head large or small among we and surely it be equally absurd to ascribe the particular in the form of other nation to the same cause lf any doubt should remain the follow experiment will demonstrate the truth of my affertion sketch the figure of negro as in plate vi fig draw the parallel line be and bd and the vertical line .. from the extremity of the line de make the line ef form the triangle feed of degree delineate mouth at ea and it will im mediately appear that the nofe of the negro have not be press inwards but that the maxilla project too far by similar process may a european be transform into negro and the figure will fully evince that the negroe no more compress the nose of they child to make they smaller and flatter than we lengthen the nofe of ours by perpetually pull they part the second chapter concern the form of children head view in profile manner in which all the profile in the first plate be take have be already explain shall merely observe that the profile in the fourth plate be draw by means of the same instrument and with equal accuracy the great difference which exist between the head of a infant just bear and of one that be year old have determine I to make choice of the first and second figure the third figure be delineate after the cranium of well form adult it be the same that be give in the first figure of the second plate the foürth be draw from toothlef old woman that the essential difference may become more conspicuous in the head of new bear child the skull ogup see plate iv fig may be consider as a oval place hori zontally to the fore and under part of which the maxilla be affix this shape be not so uniform as to exclude all variation but these be not very great the lower part of the chin and forehead be place parallel to the per pendicular line in child one year old the forehead project beyond the line ad and the back part of the head be much enlarge dovnward the upper and lower maxilla be also enlarge qd be in the new bear infant equal to one fourth but in thisit be much more see fig diameter of the eye socket gh in the first figure be one fifth compare with ad and something more in child of one year it be also as one fifth in the head of a adult but this proceed from the enlargement of the nose and of the maxilla these cavity be in reality much larger in the adult than in the child which manifest that certain ule be observe although they be much larger in child in proportion to the difference of age as infant be bear without tooth the upper jaw qr be very narrow in the space of year it grow nearly as broad again in the adult the upper jaw be about three time as large and if we include the tooth it be four time but there be diversity in this respect accord to the natural strength of the person or national peculiarity the upper jaw also gradually project forward and the dente molare be completely form at about the age of twenty year or the length of the lower part of the face be now to as or in child it be only one fifth as in figure the first and three tenth in figure the second the lower jaw undergoe à similar change tk be not only larger but the point of the angle shoot backward so that it become nearly quadrangular with the condyle particularly in the chinese and other eastern the chin at the same time shoot forward as will best it project about one twelfth before the facial line in whereas it be about equal with the perpendicular line in the nfant see fig of plate iv the upper and lower same time be regularly oppose to each other yet in the best form head the lower tooth be place within the upper one in child the small distance from qto that be of the maxilla and the nasal bone from the jugal give they flatnef of countenance which be well observe by fla mingo the antient always make the lower maxilla of child too long and therefore they do not succeed in the pleasing when they delineate child of tender age the nose may be distinguished into two part the one which have its basis at and which form the cavity under the forehead and the nose itself from to fig . and just bear have no cavity above the nose and the eye socket see and therefore they have flat fore head that be the forehead project farther than whereas in adult person the part project farther than and in aged person still more as in figure the fourth it be for this reason that the nose of negro appear to sink so deep and also that it appear to have be much more com press in a aged than in young negro the nose itself be small in child make about one fifth of the line in adult it be one fourth and broad in proportion the head of a infant be longer than it be high compare dc with df which be equal to ad in some this dif ference be very great in figure the second dc be about one fifth longer than df but this length seem peculiar to the child of thefe province as have be notice by vesa lius we have already observe that the occiput be smaller in antique from the great projection of the facial line de wit however although he be justly celebrate for he paint ing of child have not attend to this difference of these he have also shorten the occiput and raise the vertex the real form of the head have not escape the notice of quefnoy as shall be fully exemplify when we explain the fourth figure of the fifth plate the centre of motion be not in the centre of the head but it be place more forward hence it be that the head of we child can not maintain a equipoise be prone to incline forward and yet more to fall backward as soon as the line ad be exceed the middle point be change and this inclination of the head somewhat forward give it à certain grace alb durer have make the facial line of he child to in cline forward have place it at degree the same as in the third figure of we second plate quesnoy and de wit have mostly place it at in this position the head must be raise until become equal to st . see plate fig meatus auditorius enlarge also very considerably as the infant advance as well as the mammillary procef behind the ear see fig ii while the infant be very young it be seat about the condyle at and be scarcely visible but in adult the mammillary process be very much enlarge and it descend much lower as in the third and fourth sigure of this fourth plate this be much more obviously the case in man than in female in whom none of the process be so strongly mark chap ii the form of the head in a adult person the form of the head in adult person have already be fully explain in the third chapter of the first part of this treatise we shall only observe at present that the growth of the nasal bone plate iv fig gradually commu nicate pleasing form to the nose and in some person ren der the whole countenance graceful negroe and asiatic be destitute of this grace and the greek have omit it indeed they be compel to omit it for as they make the direction of the nose nearly perpendicular they could not give he elevation without produce degree of deformity the distance from the fore part of the nose to the jugal bone hv be greater in we than in any other people the nose appear longer than it be in reality particularly in thin erson and this prevent we countenance from have very flat appearance we nostril be just visible as the bot tom of the nose hi see the lower sketch of fig and be place horizontally or parallel to the ground the projection of we tooth usually occasion projection of the lip and the chin seem to recede every other par ticular may he collect from what have be already remark and from contemplate the figure chap iii the form of the face in person far advanced in year observation induce I to believe that in this country the woman generally lose all they tooth earlier than the man but as the man lose they also the fourth figure of the fourth plate be equally applicable to both sex aged person not only lose they tooth but they gum that be the thick margin contain the alveolae or socket in which the root of the tooth be place the roof of the mouth which be arch in younger year become entirely flat the lower maxilla also have lose both tooth and gum be no longer so broad from thefe cause be the space within the mouth so remarkably diminish that sufficient place be not leave for the tongue as it can no longer be draw up and adjust to the arch roof of the mouth and not have its usual space through the failure of the tooth and gum it be apt to protrude out of the mouth upon the slightest attempt to move it forward the tongue appear therefore to be longer than it be as it be in reality from its be force out of curve line the nose have lose its support qr plate iv fig bend downwards and hang over the mouth the fall under the forehead become deeper while the project part be fuller this render the furrow or wrinkle deeper and more visible the whole of the upper maxilla become more concave and the fore part qr which in younger year roject outward now contract inwardly so that the upper lip fall within the margin of the mouth and the nose appear much larger than it do in more youthful day the lower jaw which have in its external circuit the form describe by tkd of the third figure be now by the lof of the tooth with they alveolae draw upwards through the action of the muscle until the gum nearly meet the tip of the chin now shoot beyond the line qd tox com pare figure the third with figure the fourth of this fourth late the distance of the chin from the nose be shorter by one sixth part of the length of the head the nose and chin seem almost to touch each other this circumstance be totally ne glect by ruben de wit and other celebrate painter blomaart aim at follow nature but he have not just idea of she operation lairesse testa and the immortal raphael have follow she with the greatest attention greuze the famous french artist seem to have totally do regard the peculiarity this be obvious from the plate which have in other respects very great merit when the lower jaw rise to one sixth as we have already observe the angle of the mouth be draw downwards the « see he book of drawing plate x i fig cord the wrinkle of the face always manifest themselves in direction contrary to that of the muscular fibre hence they be transverse on the forehead be radiat round the eye and mouth and run acrof the neck parallel to the course of the lower jaw x kt by compare the cranium with the face plate iv fig it will be obvious that the distin guish mark of age be place in the bony part and not in the wrinkle to be convinced of the importance of these remark let the reader delineate head accord to the first figure of the second plate form the profile together with the ear as represent in the second figure of the sixth plate let the projection form the cavity above the nose by omit the tooth the mouth de will rise to draw from the facial line along place limb of the compass at the point and describe from be the line cc till it interfect the facial line at de scribe in like manner from the point the line bb com plete the chin and let the under lip pref upon the upper at thus will the head of young man be change into the form of a aged person the ear must also be raise to it be however to be observe that as the skin of the ear in aged person become relaxed the ear itself seem longer this singularity could not be note in the experiment may also be invert and the head of young person be form out of a aged one by alternately cover the dot and complete line with the finger these different face will more conspicuously manifest they selve chapter iv form of children head in front the same head of child that be represent in profile in the fourth plate be in the fifth plate re present in front they proportion be take into con sideration in the first chapter of the second part the eye of new bear child be very large which pro cead from the size of the cavity and tliey stand at con fiderable distance from each other but this distance be not quite the measure of a eye the nose and mouth sufficiently indicate themselves the head be very flat because the back part of the head mm be extremely broad which be the usual form of most child in this country the different part of the face correspond with the general proportion remark in the head of child in child one year old see fig of this fifth plate the eye be still very large the lower part of the face be longer and the forehead be higher mm through the weak ness of the bone continue to increase in breadth that neither of these countenance be very pleasing will easily be perceive the follow proportion be observable in child one year old see fig of this plate the height of the head compare with the breadth at the external canthus of the eye kk be as to mm rr breadth mm kk po so that four time po or one less than kk supposing the eye to be make larger than po that be as that be be po the third and fourth figure have place the facial ine as in adult in the g and rooth degree of inclina tion see sz plate to find the angle of the chin have make equal to thus the head gain in the height which be equal to st accord to these limitation have also sketch the face in figure the fifth in front ab be thus equal to divide into two part dg give twice df in breadth which be the medium proportion between mm and kk of figure the second the head be therefore only four eye in breadth which be the true proportion and not five as de wit have represent the fifth figure be not perfectly accurate be too high and df rather too small predecessor have do the same and other have follow they example van dyk have also give the proportion of five eye to the figure of a infant jesus the head of quesnoy s child perfectly correspond with the above rule but the eye socket should have be within the perpendicular line fig as they project too much which be not graceful part the third chapter on beauty particularly beauty of countenance no definition be more difficult than the definition of beauty horace who have treat the subject in so masterly manner as far as it relate to poetry consider it in comparative view and not immediately and absolutely boileau and pope have also some excellent observation but these be confine to the elucidation of the style of poetry by compare it with painting or of the latter by its affinity with the former roman and more modern writer advise we to take the antient for we model but recollect none who have explain in what beauty in itself or abstractedly confist longinus have afford I the most satisfaction as he have treat the beautiful and the sublime in more syste matic manner and have illustrate d he doctrine by pertinent example crousa hutcheson and father andre have make occa sional observation concern the beautiful the remark of hutcheson manifest taste and judgment those of andre indi cate much learning formey have prefixe a excellent pre face to the work of andre each of these author have make ust distinction and sensible observation concern the beautiful but none of they have inform we what it be that constitute the beauty of painting of statue or of build ing like the precede they have merely treat the subject in cursory manner or by way of allusion in every representation not merely of historical scene landscape and sea prospect but of simple groupe even of single figure it be necessary to distinguishi between poetry or inventive phyfical or natural and mechanic or operative beauty the first species be subject to law which be appli cable to poetry in general the second respects the form of thing the beauty of which it be not easy to reduce to any particular rule just idea of operative beauty or the beauty of execution can only be acquire by practice philosopher have proceed farther they have enquire what be it that render we susceptible of the impression of beauty what be it that render beauty the decide object of we choice but although they investigation have man nifest much depth of think the result have not be com pletely fatisfactory the celebrate mo . burke have clearly demonstrate in he excellent treatise on the sublime that whatever both in nature and art excites apprehension or wonder may partake of its nature in this species no rule of proportion can be propose as the cause of beauty the starry heaven the rise of the sun or calm sea be pleasing to all every one feel pleasurable sensation at the fight of these object and he call they beautiful tempestuous ocean gloomy forest or even the darkness of the night impref we with pleasing idea of the grand and sub lime as mo . burke have demonstrate in strike manner the beautiful in work of art be not always distinguished with equal facility the more they be complicated the less be they beauty discernible by the vulgar poetic natural operative beauty must be feel by every one who lay any claim to taste and he must be able to disciiminate what be excellent in work of art from every mixture of imperfection it be alone by study by contemplate the best production of artist and by form comparison that à genuine know ledge of these three species of beauty be to be obtain in academy of painting skilful master should instruct they pupil to contemplate separately the poetic or inventive part the sketch or design and the execution and also in the manner of correct any defect that may be conspicuous this subject be much too copious to be enlarge upon in the present treatise we principal object be to contemplate the beautiful as manifest in the human figure and particu larly in the head shall confine myself to the enquiry why be person whose height be equal to eight head deem siner figure than one who be only six or less than six head in height laplander be universally consider as à less pleasing figure than persian or georgian be it because the stature of the one will measure eight head and of the other merely six it must be acknowledge that this difference can not be ascribe to any determinate proportion of the part simply and abstractedly consider for child whose height be merely qual to four or five head be think as beautiful as a adult equal to eight it be however acknowledge that the pleasing be often confound with the beautiful we be pleased with the playful vivacity the perfect simplicity the affectionate at tachment of child we also possess a instinctive fondness for child and it be possible that we blend all these cir cumstance in we idea with the beauty of person it often happen that the figure of child abstract from these con sideration have nothing pleasing in it the idea of beauty be sometimes excited by certain con formity or proportion of component part with each other for example we see with pleasure that the lower extremity measure from the pubis to the foot be precisely the half of we body in length that the head be one eighth the face one tenth and the foot one sixth the head of a apollo venus à laocoon be universally allow to be finer or more beautiful than the head of we best propoition man and woman whence do this pro ceed perhaps it be because in antique the eye be place exactly in the centre of the head which be never the case with we when the breadth of the cheek from the nose to the ear be exactly equal to the breadth of two nofe which proportion be observe by the antient it be the most pleasing to we and we prefer those model to other which make the to whatever be beautiful in itself and do not depend upon external circumstance or mere opinion and of the existence of this species of beauty there can be no doubt some re lation and proportion between different part of the subject seem absolutely requisite the proportion give by the antient to they figure be not beautiful in we eye merely from weak prepossession in favour of all that they have hand down to we but because they have correct the defect which arise from the law of vision for example when the object ab see plate ix be view so that the observer shall always be at a equal distance in eg or whereby eca gh a ab the height of its surface the angle of vision will always be larger in than in or in as object be measure accord to the angle of vifion they will appear the highest or most extend at the point here the line of vision ec form right angle with it that be when eac and ecb be equal or rectangular in this case the angle of vision aeb be the largest angle suppose the eye to be place at then be the angle agb smaller in proportion as the radius be be larger be equal to one half of right angle of as the secant become greater the angle of vision become smaller in a inverse proportion and diminish the apparent length that be eab gab compare with dab must become proportionably less until ad the line of section be infinite the angle become or be anni hilate that be until falls into ab moreover there be only one point from which a object can appear perfectly quadrangular for whether the eye ascend along the line df above or descend towards eb become smaller and therefore will the perpendicular side of the object though perfectly quadrangular appear broader than it be high hence it follow that to make the height appear equal to the breadtb the angle db or db must be make equal to aeb mean that must be extend to or acquire the length of ab or in other word that the surface which be we will say eight foot in height and equal to its breadth db must be enlarge to io foot and three fifth now as we may suppose head or complete figure to be form of quadrangle it follow that fimilar imper fection in vision will take place that must be remedy in let divide into eight equal part be make to re present stature stand upon pedestal at such a height that the eye of the beholder at shall be in line with the upper edge of the pedestal these eight equal part will appear to the eye under the follow angles of vision a the upper part of the head under a angle of the second portion from above under a angle of the third portion the fourth the fifth the sixth the seventh the eighth or lowest hence it be manifest that the head in the highest division appear to be of about half the size of that portion of the lower extremity that be contain in the lowest division this will explain the reason why the antient sometimes give more than eight head to they figure the pythean apollo have eight head and a half proportion which in itself be consonant with all we idea of beauty be the figure s always to be view stand upon the ground it be easy to perceive that the apparent short ening of the lower extremity must be remedy in corre pondent manner that the object may appear to be not more than eight foot in height although in reality it be longer but when it be place upon pedestal or in niche the visual shortenings of the upper part absolutely demand the attention of the artist that be not construct after the model of well propor tion man he also limit the proportion of the human body and its various part these proportion be adopt by durer lomazzo van mauder and other hoogstraaten seem to have allow only seven head and a half which differ whole head from the proportion observe in the figure of apollo de wit give the proportion of eight head to all the figure of he own composition to the pythean apollo to the hercule of farnese and to the venus de medicis with very small variation if be not deceive there be some thing of melancholy in all these figure which be not apparent in he own original painting or drawing the figure of female on the title page of he book of drawing be nearly nine head in length he seem in this simply to have study effect lib chap have sometimes eight but mostly seven head in the proportion of he figure which be the cause of that heaviness that be so conspicuous in most of he work testa have give the proportion of eight head and ight and a half to he figure bloemaart whose design be mostly put into the hand of we youth be so irregular that he sometimes give seven at other ten head to he figure van mauder have prove that in some of the figure of michael angelo the size be equal to nine ten nay twelve head in order to communicate more grace to stoop attitude most of the italian seem to have make they figure par ticularly those of female too short modern french master render they female more graceful by give they the length of eight head watteau begin this style probably we lady wear high heel to they shoe and high head dress to produce similar effect the proportion of eight head please we because this be twice the length of the trunk door be not pleasing unless it be twice as high as it be broad the french make the door of they house more lofty which add dignity without de stroy the effect of symmetry for à similar reason it be that we hold the corinthian column to be more graceful than the lonic consider the capital as in the place of head the whole length of corinthian pillar be eight head and a half laplander tartar hottentot and brasilian whose head be very large in proportion to they body can not please we or be deem beautiful no more than the doric column could be call beautiful upon the revival of architecture architecture with attention will learn that the column be be place and afterwards the capital be raise until the column with capital and base have acquire the pro portion of the human body but to return it be not my design to enlarge upon the subject we must restrict ourselves to the dimension and form of head and shall now enquire what be the proportion observable in the head of european and other nation chap ii proportion observable in the head of european and other nation compare with the antique in profile in order to judge with more perspicuity concern com parative beauty in the form of the head shall give table of the proportion as have find they in the best form head have divide the height of each into four part that the length may be afcertain with greater pre cifion the same letter be place by each figure that the difference may be the more obvious see the sketch of all the profile place under the bone of the cranium it appear from the above table that the antient observe medium proportion for example from the tip of the nose to the ear in calmuck be and in a european and in the antique and sth and the chin nine tenth eight eighth and two third the beauty of the face depend therefore upon the relative proportion which the part have to each other as or thus also when the face be see in profile the breadth ough not to exceed the height as in the negro and calmuck in we they be nearly equal the form which approach to the juadrangular give certain flatnef to the countenance the antient have remove this imperfection by make the head higher which proportionally diminishy the breadth when the face be contemplate in front as they be represent in the third plate considerable difference will be observable for example the greatest breadth of negro head be equal to thrbe fourth of its height and the cheek mn be as in calmuck the cheek mn be in european in the antique the breadth of the negroe s head po be a calmuck european antique hence it appear that the countenance of the antique be not only more elevate but that it be considerably less broad in proportion from the form of the eye socket it be obvious that the temple can not be broader than the bony part together with the skin now xw in the negro be as in the calmuck judge of the dimension of the eye xw must be divide into three part within the rim of the eye socket thus there remain for xpxwo only one fourth of the whole breadth po all those who have write upon proportion as alb durer de wit allow the size of five eye for the breadth of the face in child durer have give six eye but be convinced that the head in no instance can be so broad the antient have never exceed four which correspond the nearestwith the breadth observable among we in child the distance between the eye see plate fig po be equal to one third from kk or the temple although from the disease above mention the head of the child represent in the second figure be five eye in breadth n compare this with figure the fifth of the same plate it will fully appear that the addition to its bread th be no addition to its beauty painter in general seem to be much embar rass concern the breadth of the face as appear from de wit alb durer and le brun who never give lef than the measure of five eye the celebrate quesnoy have be much more careful and fortunate in give not more than four eye as the breadth of he head if mistake not testa have observe the same proportion in he child the breadth of the nose be always determine by the do tance of the lateral process of the upper maxilla see plate iii ef in proportion to the distance between and will be the width of the nofe it be because the triangle cor form so large a angle that the disproportion appear so considerable in the nose of negro in we the nose be generally broader than the distance between the eye the antient have observe the same proportion the mouth must completely cover the dente canini as have be already shew it must therefore be broader as these be place at greater distance from each other but suppose the distance to be in reality the same that be sup pose qr in figure the fourth and fifthy to be perfectly equal yet the mouth will appear smaller when the two side of the triangle rise high compare yz in each figure in antique the mouth appear smaller than with we from the greater depth of the chin the antient have make the mouth but à little wider than the distance between yz and the nose to incline downwards this position of the nose make the upper lip small thus it curis as it be up ward which give it more graceful form the upper lip of the calmuck and of the negro be directly the reverse the antient make the neck twice the length of the nose but in apollo it be as this proceed from the size of the nose which be longer the neck have still the usual length in child de wit have not give more than one third of nose for the neck quesnoy somewhat more about the or double chin to he young child which always take place and make the chin about one fourth of the nose longer chapter iii to find the proportion of the head most of the painter and draw master who treat of proportion in they publication take vitruvius among the antient and albert durer among the modern as they guide and to establish they own principle they repose upon the authority of ancient statue without pay any farther attention to the human body or measure any particular part af it with care and accuracy the portrait painter of the present day generally de scribe a oval upon they panel before the person to be paint sit to be draw make cross in the oval which they divide into the length of four nofe and the breadth of five eye and they paint the face accord to these di vision to which it must be accommodate let the proportion themselves be ever so much at variance mean not to insinuate that eye nose and mouth or the curl of wig be to be measure with precision which have see do by celebrate master and with very ill success for it be impossible to adapt this mensuration to the panel because every part have distinct surface and can not be bring upon correspondent surface on the panel it be simply my opinion that every good painter or designer should commence upon the proper basis that be should pay attention to the variety which exist in the skeleton and particularly in the bone of the head in national character and circumstance of the like nature and then let he sketch he oval or any other figure not accord to he own fancy but accord to he model perhaps it would not be improper to make use of the a cient method of draw which pliny have ascribe to the daughter of dibutade of sicyonia and which be now prac tise for amusement by person of fashion that be to trace the shade of any one intend to be paint by means of lamp if the portrait be to be in profile and then ascertain the precise situation of the principal part as eye nofe mouth and chin but in fact the nicest proportion must in general be obtain by a attention to multitude and by imitate the example of zeuxis who select from great variety of person some minuter grace which enable he to compose the proportion that be the most pleasing as the skeleton and the cranium serve my purpose the best in draw head it have be my practice first to sketch the cranium with as much attention and accuracy as possible upon which afterwards place the softer part this method have be omit in the present work as it would have render my principal object more obscure and intricate although it would have enable I to render my figure much more graceful and pleaf some of the bony part be always mark on the coun tenance they be never cover so as to be totally efface such as the rim round the cavity of the eye the jugal bone or of plate fig and and in plate fig the elevation above the nole and the deprefsion immediately under it the ridge of the nose or the termi nation of the nasal bone see plate iv .. fig lower edge of the inferior maxilla in the region of the chin and at its foremost angles manifest themselves and point out division the temple approach to the cavity of the eye which always limit the breadth of the face the orifice of the ear also give determinate point and indicate of itself the seat of the lobe which be to be place imme diately under it and of the ear itself to be place imme diately above it in word the bory of the cranium be simply cover with skin and dipose membrane and these be no impedi ment to we take the cranium as the truest basis of the intend portrait it be in this manner that obtain the profile of the modern face in the first figure of the second plate this be very similar to many other sine head that have be do sect by I in my professional character and be after ward sawn through the middle perpendicularly that might be able to obtain perfect profile have draw several of these with pen and thick ink upon plate of glaf place over they and the sketch have afterwards be take upon varnishied paper it be by those means that form no small collection which be of considerable service in the course of my lecture and of which have make use in the right line upon every spot the above method be much more file for the ray of light proceed from one point di verge in a unequal manner yet it must be allow that death s head do not accurately resemble the living and also that by be sawn through it be less perfect than when observe that the linea facialis inclined backward see plate ii fig mg . make a angle of eighty degree with nc have preserve in the second figure all the pro portion of the under jaw and place perpendicularly form the angle mnd equal to ninety degree that be right angle every part which touch the facial line in the first figure as tng touch it also in the second the cranium re tain it be depth that be td in the second be equal to td albinus make the line oo degree alb durer have make it in man in woman and in child de wit have make it in woman degree see tab x i x ii in apollo see tab x ii in man and in child tab in the first figure but the space cd be diminish in pro portion as I be increase cd be now lef than nc although it be much larger in the first figure and the height can be increase from to afterwards make mg . incline sive degree more for ward as in plate ii fig so that mnd form a angle of degree be still more diminish and can become larger that be ey be equal to hm the projection beyond the line hg the lower maxilla be smaller and become more under the ear yet hk or the distance from the tip of the nose to the ear remain the length of two nofe and the neck be more graceful finally let the line mg . fall to by which the height equal to hm be gain see plate iv fig by these means the line that crosf the eye at pass exactly over the centre and gain proportion correspondent to that of the antique that be form of head which be four nose in length every other part be in proportion it be to be remark that the external rim of the eye socket remain in the three last figure at a equal distance from the perpendicular line hg this projection constitute the maximum place the facial line more forward and become too elevate the head be more than the proportion of four nose the upper lip too small and the face deform if it be now askce what be mean by fine countenance we may answer that in which the facial line mg . make a angle of roo degree with the horizon the ancient they have gain the proportion of the different part from the principle which have advanced be not able to decide it be certain that such form be never to be meet with among modern and doubt whether the ancient greek themselves have live model of the form for neither the egyptian from whom they be probably descend nor the persian nor even the greek have ever give such form when they simply aim at delineating portrait * this antique beauty therefore be not in nature but to use the term of winckelman it be a ideal beauty thus when the greek form medallion of the roman emperor although hey be oblige to observe resemblance yet they add something of the ideal beauty this characteristic will easily enable connoisseur to distinguish grecian from roman medal have never find this characteristic so conspicuous as in the museum odescalcum where not only the counte nance of several woman but even the larvae or face of the mask manifest the line as there be maximum on the one side so be there minimun on the other as soon as we recede to degree « see the portrait of augustus caesar pharnace and other plate ix fig and give the countenance of negro as in the third figure of the first plate lower than give the feature of a ape still lower the resemblance of dog the utmost extent that can be allow for the face of a european be ten degree behind and ten degree before the perpendicular line hi all that exceed in either direction lose they beauty and even become mishapen but the ne groe have also they maximum and minimum of comelinef of these can not speak with precision as competent num ber of head be not in my possession nor have enjoy sufficient opportunity of compare they however the facial line must not sink much lower than five degree that be to as the countenance would too closely resemble low it would approach to that of the dog have observe that in all quadruped both genus and species may be distinguished by the position of the bone of the upper jaw immediately before above or obliquely under the ball of the cranium have draw the head of many different animal upon the same line which exhibit a ap pearance that not only would be of inconceivable service in natural history but of infinite service to the painter but this subject be foreign to we present purpose and to do it ustice would be to write volume what have be remark concern adult person be also applicable to child in the fourth plate have faithfully copy after the ori ginal before I in both the facial line be perpendicular which have not be favourable to beauty or to pleaf countenance the fourth figure of the fifth plate exhibit much finer face although the eye be not in the centre the upper rim of the socket of the eye be about the central point accord to the rule observe by de wit in imi tation of quesnoy and fiammingo only the occiput be too long respect this article have not be able to find out any determinate rule for infant when the child arrive to the age of three or four year the lower maxilla shoot downwards and the occiput become less it do not appear to I that we be under any obligation servilely to copy this unpleasing shape in we figure of young child parti cularly as in this country it proceed from weakness which render the head of child larger with we than in any country in europe when the facial line fall more forward see sz of plate fig and the whole form become destitute of regular proportion and the head assume a hydrocephalous appearance therefore the utmost extent with child as well as with adult be from to degree réspect the mouth it be to be observe that child have neither tooth nor project alveolae in either the upper or lower maxilla the tongue can not easily be confine within the mouth so that they have generally the mouth open that be the lower jaw be keep at distance from the upper and this give something of a oblique direction to the lower part of the face see in the second figure and xeb fig we may add that the lower jaw be shorter than the upper and as it do not make large angle with the hindmost part see in all the figure of plate iv the mouth open more easily and wider but still the orifice of the ear see of plate fig remain the central point by line from which to the point the inclination of the child be to be limit quesnoy have be very attentive to these peculiarity and he have make the line db describe the distance from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin very long see plate fig under or double chin be more strongly mark by this position the neck be shorter and the whole be more pleasing de wit on the contrary have take he proportion from under the nose to under the chin as be equal to one fourth of the height for this reason have he frequently give close mouth to he child which render they less pleasing than the child of quesnoy in most person the ear be of equal length with the nose that be one fourth of the height of the head it seldom stand higher than the middle line and the lobe generally sink lower than the nasal line alb durer make the nose preisser figure of children head be take from alb durer and have the same fault in table part iii the chin come too forward and be too long he connect with the general smallness of the feature make mixture of infancy and manhood in the same face of a adult about this size de wit make they larger and seem careless about proportion in he twelfth table the lower part of the ear be on line with the nose and the upper even with the rim of the eye socket and thus more than one fourth in fig and of the same table the lobe be not place so low in general he have place the ear too high and even the orifice which never vary be always parallel with the line of the nose alb durer and all he follower have do the same the propriety of my remark be demonstrate by the accurate figure of ofteology in the table of eustachius where the ear be represent pa rallel to the nasal line attention must also be pay to the breadth of the ear de wit generally make the breadth too small the antient have avoid represent the ear naked as much as it be possible in which they be to be commend as in itself it be not pleasing figure the cavity the rim the lobe and other part be too small and insignificant to suffer to cover the ear itself and to make the lobe alone visible however in some case they must appear totally as in the representation of bald head in this case the breadth should be equal to half of the height it should be draw in a oval the long central line of which should be make to incline à little backward but if the facial line be make to project forward to the degree then should the central line be perpendicular as in this case the upper part be already at à greater distance from the nose than the lower in negroe calmuck this line must be make to run parallel with the facial line few painter have attend to the real structure of the ear almost every treatise on the principle of draw that have see be defective in this article the french appear to be the most attentive to it in the dictionnaire encyclo pedigue the writer of the article upon the principle of draw have give very accurate representation of the ear in the book of draw by bloemaart there be not one figure of the ear that be natural nor even in that by preisser notwithstanding he have take more pain than any of he brethren to ascertain its exact proportion in child the ear be very broad and large as well as the head it be therefore best to conceal it as have be al ready observe since the ear can not add to the beauty of countenance in the above disquisition have endeavour to draw from nature herself the constituent principle of beauty in the form of the head be far from asfert that rigid conformity to the rule lay down will always

publish in the year at amsterdam plate facial line be too obvious to require further enlargement part the fourth the proper manner of sketch the outiines of head chapter concern the oval will writer on the principle of draw propose the oval as the best method of obtain sure hand in sketch head in every position and of every age no one have venture to deviate from the method notwithstanding every one must have be convinced from experience that this figure be frequently defective and merely applicable in few instance this shall endeavour to demonstrate plate vil fig let the height be divide

seat of the upper lip qr this method correspond with the proportion give in the second chapter of the third part of this treatisef this oval be good one and seenis well adapt to all those case where oval can be apply with advantage but when the feature be to be delineate in profile as in the second sigure of the same plate the manner appear to I totally destitute of the least advantage let ir be the length of the head and or uv the height form you oval as in the other figure this oval limit nothing neither the situation of the ear nor the direction of the facial line xy nor the seat of the eye all these must be place accord « van de pas have form the oval in this manner sce page the manner which alb durer follow in he first book of geometry be more complex and less perfect see the latin edition paris page fancy or by guef besides the cranium itself be not of circular form book on draw recommend the oval also for face that be place sideways between the profile and front direction as in fig well draw the oval as before and describe the central line deb in the direction of the oval then divide the oval into four part and the lower division into three part and you will find the point of incidence in the four division viz in the line adb this be the manner lay down by preisser most portrait painter follow this rule and they always place the mouth on the middle line which be too near to the ear it would not be difficult to demonstrate this or to prove that all the figure form accord to thefe rule of preisser be defective the same error be observable in face and if recollect rightly goltzius have also com mit it in order to be convinced how much this method be de fective draw the facial line dqr upon you oval accord ing to the third figure of the fourth plate either incline or erect as may be require then you will sind the point of it appear from the author s note that he have intend to treat this subject more amply see part plate incidence to be let these be consider as the middle point and the countenance become natural van dyk have pay due attention to this and also many of the italian master it appear therefore from the above example that in such case the oval be deceitful guide draw master ought not to sketch these line upon flate or any flat sur face but on ball of wood or clay properly model chapter ii of the use of the triangle in sketch profile tyoet carrache and some other teach we that to draw the face in profile a equilateral triangle must first be form as abc fig of plate vil that the foremost line be must be divide in three equal part fof the face that be the forehead nose and chin but the point be of no use unlefs to place the ear within it then indeed would the space between and be equal to two nose measure from the lobe to the line inter secting the nostril but the lower maxilla would be throw backward as in cand which be disproportion never to be meet with in nature however it be allow that by this method the facial line be admirably well preserve thus far be the triangle preferable to the oval some artist and particularly le clerc in he copy of le brun s figure of the pafsion have use the small equi lateral triangle dec when one side of the triangle lie on the facial line the point will mark the orifice of the ear with accuracy so that the distance from to or rather shall be equal to two nofe but he have not apply it in this manner and therefore it neither mark the proper boundary of the facial line nor of the ear besides this triangle only give half of the face with the ear for these reason think it of no great use vischer in he fundamentale regula artis pictoriæe et sculpturae use the larger triangle mark by we bc parizet in he treatise entitle nouveaut livre des principe du dessin have adopt the triangle of le clerc and with no greater advantage the great uncertainty and imperfection of the common method make I desirous of invent some other which should promise to be more certain and more generally appli cable this object have long employ my thought and think with success chapter iii new method of delineating the head de perpetually conversant with the skull and face of the dead and have attentively examine they after they be sawn through for anatomical use in the manner already describe and have also diligently trace the growth of the maxilla and of the nose in the head of infant that be but few week old a idea suggest itself that in draw or painting of the head the best method would be to imitate the process of nature first to form the cranium or skull then mark the facial line in the direction require and afterwards arrange the other part accord to give proportion the skull be a horizontal oval of which the hindmost part be the largest and the fore part round like the section of ball or globe first draw this oval by means of two circle the one be slvew which contain about three part of the head the other kuz which be in size eight ninth s of the other circle draw the horizontal line st . which extend from the centre of the large circle to the centre of the smaller and be one fourth of the larger circle from the centre let fall the perpendicular line sq this mark the seat of the orifice of the ear and of its lobe at draw pg the facial line in the degree of inclina tion require mark the place of the forehead the line of the eye the nose and third of or mouth complete the oval have which mark with sufficient accuracy the lower edge of the eye socket take gn which may be equal to the size of the nose or less accord to the inclination of the facial line and thus mark the commencement of the neck this manner be perfectly simple natural and indicate all the principal part in the proportion require not to observe that it be easier to strike a horizontal oval than perperi dicular one to delineate person advanced in year first draw the oval klve and the facial line pkhg see plate viii fig as in every aged person the tooth be want and the alveolae be obliterate by which the maxillæ have lose about one third of they size pursue the method recom mend in describe the second figure of the sixth plate to ascertain the present place of the chin consider to be the seat of the chin in its more perfect state place the compass in and draw from the curve line gg and place the tip of the chin at which be about two third from ib next divide gi into three equal part the upper of which be for the mouth also draw the protuberance kf as this generally project considerably from the facial line in very aged person finally take the length of nose at gn and sketch the neck no thus obtain a aged face with all its characteristic in the most perfect manner in child the form of the cranium be similar see plate viii fig the oval must be draw as before then the perpendicular line nq next the facial line pg since child have not the protuberance on the forehead as have be remark the see fig and must be place within the perpendicular line whereas in the first figure it touch and in the second it project beyond it the eye be two fifth of the whole height meafur ing from under the chin and three fiftb from the top of the forehead this agree with the proportion of de wit and alb durer the distance from to the place for the nose be equal to one fourth of the line lq but as the upper and lower jaw be from cause aslign already one third nar rower in young child as well as in aged person the line must be draw from ab to lq and the oblique line cd as be explain when we consider the fourth figure of the fifth plate thus be the point of incidence for the tip of the chin and for the mouth be now divide into five part also three fifth of which will indicate the line of the eye and two fifth be destine for the face in draw the sketch first strike the oval then draw the facial line pg let be note upon the line dc and then draw line from to the origin of the neck behind and all the principal point s will be accurately note when the mouth be to be represent more open must be place pro portionably lower and more backward sketch draw in this manner give the most natural re presentation of child s face to delineate the negro see fig of the eighth plate similar method must be observe after the oval be form draw the facial line pg incline backward accord to the rule lay down in the third chapter of part the first then draw à line from to and you have the point of incidence at which limit the mouth thus you obtain the particular form of countenance be equal to one fourth of point where the neck commence the other part and they proportion have already be too fully describe to render more circumstantial detail necessary thus be the remark of philostratus verify that line sim ply draw with chalk may characterize the indian by flat nose stiff hair prominent jaw this manner of sketch be acquire with equal ease with the one in common use it be also perfectly applicable to the representation of the passion of the mind in the ex pression of astonishment fear when the mouth be open the chin must be place lower and more backward the concomitant must be express by the action of the muscle and this action of the different muscle in the excitement of passion may also be explain in physiological manner with as much accuracy as flatter myself have be observe in these delineation of different nation and age the diversity of countenance be make by varying the proportion and change the position of the facial line these give large scope within the limit of resemblance and also of beauty the rule give by alb

productive of caricature which be seldom appli cable to the art of draw although it be not totally destitute of utility it be to be wish that artist would apply themselves to the ascertaining of the

other admirer of the art book ii lecture on the manner of represent the different passion on the point of similarity between the human species quadruped with rule for draw found on this similarity book ii lecture the manner of delineating the different passion the art of painting be in time the most remote not only value as pleasing but as very important art aristotle inform we that the greek make it a essential part of they education and that it be universally expect of the child of richer citizen that they should be able to criticise the work of they renowned artist with judgment and be qualified to furnish they own mansion with taste and elegance they laudable example be once imitate with zeal and success by the inhabitant of this country in almost every town the citizen of distinction be educated in some know ledge of the art we must now lament the change that have take place in most of the town which be once the residence of celebrate artist you city alone shew itself to be the patron of this amiable sister of poetry and its foster care not only promise every advantage to rise youth but inspire à spirit of emulation in the bosom of artist themselves that have be productive of work which reslect a honour upon the country at large will not expatiate upon the excellent lesson and judicious dissertation which have be deliver in this place by several member of we society as fhould offend the modesty of those who be present but the great attention that have be pay to my feeble endeavour upon former occasion man nifest the zeal of its member and they predilection for this delightful art the approbation with which my attempt to sliew the intimate connexion subsist between the science of anatomy and painting be crowned have encourage I the principle of which have long desire more deeply to investigate in the year have the satisfaction of demonstrating before you with what taste and with how much certainty the different feature in person of various age and nation may be delineate in the present lecture shall endeavour to explain to you in what manner the different pasfion in scribe upon the countenance may be express with the utmost accuracy but as this science be more refine so be the principle of it more difficult they require a accurate knowledge of we make not merely respect ofteology or the arrangement of the bone but also respect the muscle and nerve in order to judge with precision concern the rule shall propose the skilful representation of the passion of the mind by painting or by statuary have be admire from the remotest time pliny inform we that one aristide of thebe be the first who delineate with success the various emotion of of the body co operate in the expression of certain emotion vet the face have always be consider as they principal seat cicero term the countenance the mute interpreter of the heart and seneca who have make great progress in the knowledge of the human mind justly remark that violent emotion of every kind can not escape manifesting themselves in the countenance to these general observation the a tient have also add that the eye be most expressive of these emotion pliny that proficient in all the polite art say ee the mind dwell in the eye he also know that the motion of the eyebrow contribute considerable share to the oftentive effect must refer you to the treatise of junius on the know ledge of the antient in painting if you wishi to be inform concern the extent of this knowledge it be true the principal performance of they renowned master be lose but have investigate the influence of pain not merely do the face but the arm leg in short all the muscle of the body indicate anguish the lovelinef of the venus de medicis the dignity of the pythian apollo the deity male and female engrave on precious stone the different mafk the sportive fawn manifest that expression of countenance constitute no small part of the excellency which be so much admire in the statue painting and engraving of the antient the fine art be bury under the bad taste that pre vail during the middle age until from the fourteenth can tury every branch of science begin to revive and in the sixteenth and seventeenth century they flourissied with such vigour that europe seem to require pause to rest from the fatigue of produce so many eminent character but to return paullo lomazzo in he valuable work dell arte della pittura publish so early as in the year describe the influence of the passion upon the mus cle of the face and still more minutely the different posture and contortion of the body he relate that mi chelino miianese artist have paint two peasant and two country girl who laugh so heartily that no one could look at they without laugh he tell we also that to draw latgh feature be the great amusement of do vinci but need not inform you that at the period refer to cari cature be so much the mode that at length they become disgusting leonardo also who flourishied at the beginning of the sixteenth century very naturally describe in he im mortal work on painting all the various change of counte nance but like lomazzo he have chiesly study the different attitude of the body both these great man seem more attentive to general effect than to particular feature to the list of great man who have distinguished they selve in this department may be add the name of michael angelo and raphael who seem to have make the different expression of countenance they principal study well re member the astonishment feel when first contemplate the penitence of peter paint in one of the cartoon and who can remain insensible to the anguishi of proserpine when force away by pluto as it be chisel out in stone by buonarotil however no one have arrange the expression of the dif ferent passion upon the countenance more systematically than le brun who flourish about the middle of the seventeenth century he have execute this work in so masterly manner that every nation have follow he lesson and copy he example the great buffon alone have venture to deviate from he but not with the greatest success shall leave every connoisseur to decide whether be to blame in place much inferior value upon he drawing than upon those of le brun all the author have mention have either confine themselves to appearance or like le brun have reason metaphyfically concern the operation of the mind with out attend to the phyfical cause of the change produce by these operation but in my opinion speculation concern ing the manner of the soul work or concern the seat of the soul be of no use to the artist these belong to metaphyfician who by the way lose themselves in laby rinth of term or word with no desinitive meaning without have in the least explain the action of this immortal prin ciple upon the corporeal and mortal frame pliny do vinci and junius have particularize the prin cipal appearance but have mention little concern the connexion that there be between the part affect and still less have they particularize the change which necessarily arise from the various affection of the nervous system wit telet also have describe the passion and they influence with much good sense and in strain of eloquence it shall be my object not to speculate concern the working of the soul but to enquire what change take place in the body in consequence of its operation we shall investigate the ap pearance produce the uniformity of these appearance and they influence upon the feature of the face the first thing requisite be to acquire a accurate know ledge of the form of the skeleton and particularly of the cranium the second to be well acquainted with the prin cipal muscle of the face and they action thirdly to trace the nerve in they division and connexion with these muscle few example will illustrate my plan and indicate its importance however novel it may appear a oppress sorrowful and melancholy person let he head sink downwards or he support it with he hand the equipoise be no longer maintain by the muscle of the neck that be the nerve belong to those muscle be render inert lively content laugher on the other hand raise he head and he breast be agitate in the excess of the emotion he place both he hand to he side as it be to support he body at length he leg begin to refuse they office and he would fall to the ground if the fit continue person in the impetus of rage beat with hand and foot stamp till the ground shake under he and he face be convulse in thousand form deep reverence make the tongue to falter a inward tremble impede the motion of the body the most lively and expressive eye be abassied and look downwards the heart slutter if shame accompany this emotion as be be uently the case the face neck and breast be immediately paint of crimson colour it would be endless to particularize every emotion in similar manner the observation deducible from these effect be that in every emotion of the mind particular nerve be affect consequently every painter ought to make himself acquainted with the construction and connexion of the nerve productive of these change at least every one who under take to write systematically upon the subject should acquire such portion of anatomical knowledge as to be able to instruct he disciple in the general rule that slow from it the palenefs arise from fear or à sudden alarm depend equally with blusliing upon the action of the nerve these change of colour may be accurately express by the painter and in this he have the advantage over the statuary engraver but orator and public actor have the superior advan tage of give the greatest force to the expression of the feature by exciting the requisite movement in the part themselves as dissect of human body have be my constant occu pation ihave have frequent opportunity of examine which of the nerve communicate with these more active part must have be particularly affect consequently which of the muscle must have be excite to action by those nerve and from the action of these muscle depend upon they origin infertion course and connexion we may easily learn what pleats in the face what kind of action in the hand they must necessarily occasion it be these appearance alone that propose to elucidate in the present lecture it may be object that accord to the above represen tation the antient must have be acquainted with the ana tomy of the paffion or that they together with raphael callot le brun and other have succeed wonderfully without this knowledge that hogarth himself who excel in represent the passion be ignorant of all that have advanced to be so necessary that john steen who be be quently so inimitable in the delineation of the passion never dream of study the muscle stript of they integument or of acquire a intimate knowledge of those nerve which so many anatomist themselves know but imperfectly notwithstanding these objection be well assure that my remark will prove both important and acceptable to this audience trace the operation of nature be always a useful employment vou will also see and admire she wonderful address and finally we shall point out method by which not only youth but painter themselves may make speedy progress in this most enchant branch of the art we shall confine ourselves to the face shall first enable you to recollect the constituent part of the cranium its form cavity connexion proportion secondly shall delineate the principal muscle of the face and mark the true situation of the eye that you may be convinced that le brun have place they too much inelin ing downwards and that in he representation of laughter he have give a improper bend downwards to the inward angles of the eye he have commit similar fault in weep thirdly shall demonstrate that the pleats or wrinkle of the face must necessarily run in rectangular direction accord to the course of the muscular fibrillæ fourthly shall exhibit before you some of the nerve in order that you may understand the immediate connexion several of these sketch be extemporaneous and have not be preserve which take place in the action of some of the muscle in the same passion the sixth pair as they be denominate by ancient anatomist or the eighth of the modern have long be term the pathetic this pair communicate with the throat breast abdome and by the intercostal muscle with the nerve of the arm and leg the fourth pair or the lesser pathetics produce wonderful effect in surprise in love in die it be by the action of the seventh pair that we laugh blushi or look pale finally shall delineate the muscle of the lye that just idea may be form of they motion in the full vigour of life and in the article of death and subjoin some observation concern the synchronous and alternate motion of the oblique muscle in friendly greeting and in token of respect in die the eye be draw towards each other be cause the power of the will cease and the muscle act in consequence of the remains of life seat in they such be the principle we shall lay down the right study and application of which will enable the artist to ex press the passion of the soul with the utmost accuracy and in they full energy example shall first sketch death s head see plate fig the principal muscle of the face fig thirdly countenance perfectly placip fig fourthly express ing surprise fig fifthly contempt fig sixthly complacency friendliness tacit joy plate ii fig laughter fig eightly sorrow fig weep fig tenthly vexation and wrath fig finally the die fig ii the quick transition from one passion to another which be about to exhibit may not perhaps excite less surprise than that which the great ferdinand of tuscany experience when he see peter of cortona work with he pencil at florence the painter perceive that the duke be parti ularly strike with the figure of child cry convinced he that very few touch of the pencil would exhibit laughter he then restore the former stroke and the child be make to cry again to the no small astonissiment of the prince hope that you will experience something of the professor in demonstrating these change make the requisite alteration on the same face and also point out the defect of other painter in fimilar manner this have powerful effect upon the audience which can not be produce to a equal degree by distinct figure similar emotion although it be not peter of cortona that handle the pencil but simply lover of the art contemplate first the placid countenance fig every feature be at rest no one muscle be bring into particular action all be in state of repose without appear relaxed or inert there be tranquillity in the eye void of languor and the lip be in unconstrained contact let we suppose something to present itself which excites de gree of surprise or wonder fig the intercostal nerve be immediately affect and act upon the third pair hence the eye lid be open and the eye stand motionless in the socket the same nerve act upon the eighth pair at the same time respiration be suspend the free motion of the heart be impede and the mouth be open as the maxillary muscle destine to this purpose be affect but as these act alone upon the lower maxilla the tooth be not discover the hand be extend and more particularly the finger from the action of they muscular plexus the effect of contempt be very different fig the fifth pair of nerve be put in motion thus be the eye brow draw inwards and downwards the mouth be firmly close but as the lower lip rise in the middle it become arch the eye be draw sideways the musculus abducen and adducen act togetber by the force of habit . by make the head to turn towards the right and the eye toward the left hand the passion be render more expressive fig in complacency friendly greeting and tacit joy those part alone act which have a immediate communication with the seventh pair of nerve the angles of the mouth must never be draw up alone without other token of a incipient smile great care should be take to avoid draw the eyebrow inwards a error frequently commit by the french in they portrait laughter fig in laughter all the effect produce by the former affection be greatly increase and other be superadd the whole countenance incline forward but without the attention be fix upon any determinate object the outward edge of the orbicular muscle of the eye be contract produce wrinkle and fold around the eye the lip be open by the action of the orbicular muscle on the external side hence the tooth particularly the upper be make to appear small wrinkle arise at the corner of the mouth and the cheek become fuller lf you would add a arch or wanton look place the eye sideways and contract the upper eyelid expressive of wink in sorrowful countenance fig the fifth pair of nerve be principally affect the mouth be draw down ward by the descent of the upper lip to add despair to this emotion the face must be make to look upwards and somewhat obliquely the brow must be furrow with wrinkle and the middle of the eyebrow be draw up ward in weep fig all the muscle which receive the fifth pair of nerve act in very forcible manner hence the corner of the mouth be draw downwards the lower part of the nose upwards the eyebrow descend the eye be nearly close and tear be press out of the lacrymal gland if anger fig accompany the emotion the action of the muscle draw the eye wide open the eyebrow de scend still lower and the tooth be violently compress to gether die fig in die it be to be observe first that all the muscle of the neck open the mouth and elongate the chin secondly that the pathetic nerve draw the eye towards each other and thirdly that all the the muscle cease to act what le brun term veneration be not well express as the eye be represent draw upwards by the action of the two oblique muscle alone whereas the upper and under musculi obliqui must act accept gentleman these short specimen by way of elucidate my principle to represent every passion and possible emotion of the mind would require more time than could be allow by one who profess to be a anatomist and not painter my sole object have be to awaken at tention and excite spirit of enquiry that you may be in duce to consult nature herself without indulge implicit confidence in the rule and example give by the most can lebrate master which be frequently imperfect if in these specimen have not answer you expectation if my ex pression have not be sufficiently explicit and my hand have fail in give the requisite stroke of the pencil can still perceive by the satisfaction paint upon you counte nance that my endeavour to please you have prove suc cessful lecture ii concern the point of similarity between quadruped bird and fish the object of the prefent and follow lecture fhall be to shew the great similarity there be between quadruped and the resemblance of these to bird and fishi and also to indicate very easy method of delineating all these animal in the most exact manner should my audience deem the undertake of little mo ment or confider the precife form of animal as beneath the attention even of painter themselves could justify the design by quote the laudable example of the antient the greek the roman and before these the egyptian be oblige to pay the most minute attention to every species of animal not merely as emblem of they different idol but as insepa rable from they sacrifice race triumph but these could neither be paint nor represent in stone or metal without the knowledge of what constitute the beauty and perfection of the animal creation the high value in which this art be hold by the antient will moreover appear from the dog cast in metal which plinye inform we be preserve in the capitolium as a exquisite piece of workmanship with so much care that the superintentent be threaten with death in case of ne gligence we read also that myron have form so beautiful cow in metal that it be not only celebrate by the poet but copy by the most skilful engraver with equal zeal as venus or any other sine workmanship of the greatest master count caylusf have this cow engrave on cornelian which be no inconsiderable addition to the cabinet of that celebrate connoisseur canachis acquire no less honour by hart which he have form in copper that appear so light and swift that thread might apparently be make to paf under the foot tisicrate be immortalize by he lion simon by dog nicias by he painting of several species of animal and androcyde by he skilful representation of fishi whoever consult the monumenti antichi inediti of win kelman and particularly the introduction will be make acquainted with the high value which in the present day be place upon the lion in the capitol the sphinx in the palace of borghese and also the other animal by the fountain deli aqua felice the horse have excite still greater ambition stiall not mention the story of apelles nor of he follower lysippus they successor calamis obtain such renown for he horse that he be not only celebrate by pliny and cicero but ovid have immortalize he in he verse pliny say that he be unrivall in he representation of car draw by two or four horse notwithstanding that lysippus and he disciple euthycrate have distinguissied themselves in this department the valuable cabinet of stoschj manifest how great master aspafius be in the engrave of horse hylus have also excel in steer and lucius in horse many triumphant car with four horse abreast be repre fent in bass relief and engrave on precious stone in manner that exceed all imagination they be mostly repre sent with two and with four horse have never see they with ten though nero introduce hunt with this number in the cabinet of count caylus there be a engrav ing on cornelian of conqueror with twenty horse by the side of each other which can be minutely distinguished and of exquisite beauty it would be endless to enumerate all those who have be quire celebrity by depict of animal let I recommend to you the catalogne of ancient artist arrange with so much judgment by franc junius this will inform you of the number of artist who have acquire immortal fame by they reprefentation of various animal we will now direct we attention to those great master that be you immediate predecessor whose admirable per formance must have make a indelible impreffion upon you mind who of the present asfembly do not pant after the immortal fame so justly acquire by van berchem potter wouwerman wenix a adrian van de velde houdekoeter and other great man which this country have produce so superior and so manifold be the excellency of these master that it would require too much of we time to particularize they yet do not recollect that any one except the indefatigable crispin van de pas have professedly write on the proportion of animal or have give to the ambitious student any rule to forward he success what do vinci have advanced upon the subject of horse be not adapt to give general idea all that be commu nicate by lomazzo be merely poetic description of the beauty of some animal charle vander mander amuse himself with trifle and lairesse pass over the subject in total silence my undertake must consequently appear to you the more bold and hazardous but although the imperfection of the attempt can not escape the observation of this intelligent au dience yet be persuade they will sind a apology in its difficulty you will readily perceive that the idea could alone suggest itself by my attention to the close connexion there be between the tedious and indelicate employment of dissect animal and the most elegant of the artsl to the accidental union of these two useful pursuit in the same person may be ascribe all that may be deem useful in the follow remark will add that very large collection of the skeleton of different animal in my cabinet have give I frequent opportunity of compare together they specific form shall deem myself abundantly recompense if my labour should awaken and direct genius to bring this part of the science to the perfection of which it be capable propose to give two lecture upon the subject in the first shall point out the similarity that exist between qua drupeds of every kind between these and fowl and also fissi and finally indicate those peculiarity to which the painter or statuary should direct he principal attention between quadruped fowl and fishi and propose a infal lible method of sketch all these animal and shall con clude with demonstrating that like another proteus we may with few stroke of the pencil change cow into horse à stork or into any kind of fish we please will not waste you time by attempt to delineate ani mal in the most perfect manner with the pencil of zeuxis but rather like agatharchus hastily draw the outline and leave it to you taste and judgment to supply the minutia which add elegance to figure ishall be amply satisfied if you should be able to discover amidst these imperfect essays principle that may serve as the foundation of more perfect attempt no one who hold the art of painting in due estimation can doubt that it be the grand object of the artist to delineate he figure after the life and with the utmost accuracy or to represent by the closest imitation the different object which all bounteous nature have bestow upon we in so rich a abun dance yet it be highly advantageous and to excel abso lutely necessary for the painter to acquire a intimate know ledge of all those create being he wishie to represent and to penetrate as it be into the plan and design of the great creator in the formation of the astonishing variety which strike we in the animal creation and which excites within we the pleasing emotion of wonder and admirationl shall begin with man whom we will confider as the most perfect quadrupe and gradually descend to ape dog the yerboa thence proceed to fowl and then pass over to the finny tribe perhaps you will consider the undertake as extravagant and the expression unguarded but hope soon to convince you that fish and fowl as well as horse and cow may justly be deem quadruped although they be differently form that each may be able to exert the requisite movement in the most easy manner accord to its particular station fach animal differ also in the form of its head body foot tail accord to the design for which it be create yet extra vagant as the position may appear shall prove that the oyster bound to particular spot contain the first principle other quadrupe up to man himself would willingly give you ocular demonstration of the fact by place before you sketch of each but this would be impracticable within the limit of the hour shall con sine myself in the present lecture to the close resemblance that subsist between the different part of these animal shall therefore delineate before you the skeleton of man of dog a eagle and penguin that you may be con vince of the likeness that subsist between they the fishi we shall reserve for the next lecture you perceive by this general comparison that man be the most perfect of all animal not because he walk with a erect countenance as plato and after he cicero and ovid have remark as if it be peculiar privilege in man to look towards the heaven for as gale have justly observe several species of fish enjoy this privilege in more perfect manner the grand corporeal advantage enjoy by man be that he can walk and even sit in a erect attitude the publication be necessarily imperfect concern this very interesting article as the professor s principle can not be illustrate by the diversity of example he delineate before the audience in which he demonstrate the grand point of resemblance and trace progressively the kind and degree of deviation from they may also add that man alone be able to repose upon he back and that by the centre of motion be place in the middle of he body he be enable to turn himself to bend peculiar facility all these advantage necessarily flow from other advantage which it would be foreign from we pur every one that contemplate fine horse be strike with the beauty of he neck when we view camel the length of he neck and the smallness of he head strike we the most in the elephant its long trunk or proboscis be the principal object of admiration in the cow the thickness of its body be most remarkable in the greyhound on the contrary it be the thinness of body and slenderness of the foot that attract we chief attention in the mean time it be extremely obvious that these form of particular part be à necessary consequence of the end to which these different animal be destine cicero have give we beautiful description of these singular difference which manifest he deep penetration into the design of nature « some animal say he can be low of stature that they may the more easily reach from the earth the food it afford for they nutrition but those animal which for wise reason be taller as crane and also the camel be assist by the length of they neck elephant be furnishied with species of hand by which those ani mal gather they food from the ground as the immense bulk of they body render it impracticable for they to bend or stan this idea be exemplify in the shark which although it have long tooth be destitute of snout which would be useless as that animal seek and dévour its food while swim in the water many be the instance of the necessity of fnout in some animal and its uselessnefs in other and nature have wisely make they form correspondent gale have moreover justly remark that in those animal which gather they food from the earth the neck be the length of the foot however worthy these observation of cicero and gale may be of they author and applicable to we present purpose confess that have not a adequate conception of they im portance until my remark concern animal be bring to some degree of perfection and those further discovery be make which shall be hereafter explain that distinguissied naturalist ray have in he preface to willoughby treatise on fish express the thought of cicero in other term he have further observe that fish be destitute of neck not merely because they have not foot but because they can procure they food in every part of the watery ele ment without they aristotle have likewise remark that sish be destitute of neck snake be also without they and in this respect be they form very similar to that of fifh respect the foot it be to be observe that the wise creator have uniformly make the fore foot of those animal whose stature render long neck necessary lower than the hind foot as in the sheep the deer and camel and in such animal the dorsal vertebra gradually descend from the hip the giraffe be a exception be destine to other purpose if we attend to the belly we shall perceive that it be much larger in those animal that feed upon graf than in the carnivorous class and in those which chew the cud than in those which do not the reason be evident the organ of digestion or in other word the intestine destine to con vert animal substance into animal substance need not be so ample and voluminous as those whose office it be to tran mute graf into animal substance in this kind of vegetable nutritious particle be diffuse over large surface while it be comprise in much smaller space in animal food the cow eat à large quantity at once and afterwards ru minate the horse eat continually the cow must conse quently have much larger belly than the horse and this larger one than the dog the comparative length of animal be also proportionate to the number of the vertebra of the loin some as the elephant have only three the horse have five the cow six the lion cat aud camel have seven u in animal that live upon gramina as elephant horse oxen deer camel and in all that chew the cud also in swine the foot be horn whether they be whole as in the horse or clove as in the cow and sheep because the other be divide into two three four or five finger as in man more than five finger be never find in any quadrupe in fowl the wing terminate in finger all have thumb to each wing in the majority two finger be super add many be furnissied with nail as the ostrich and the spur water han the above remark be sufficient to evince this truth the more perfectly a artist be acquainted with the nature of animal and the design of they particular formation the better he will succeed in he attempt to delineate they but as verbal description may not be sufficiently obvious we will call in the aid of sketch the explanation of which will clearly indicate the truth and importance of my obser vation example the horse see plate iii fic let bcdef limit the body and foot of the horse for the animal to move itself properly the foot must be as ge and hd in length trace the course of the spine with its cavity let be the foremost rib and the moveable point of the first vertebræ of the neck all quadruped have seven of these vertebræ inference the neck and head of the animal must be so long that he shall be able to reach he food that be as when the head be small in proportion to the height of the animal the neck must necessarily be longer as take place in camel sheep when the head be erect the neck must necessarily be curve either externally as ner or inwardly as in aged horse and the neck be more or less in the direction of sar in proportion as it sink in order to support so long neck the process of the vertebræ nearest to the prominence of the neck or wither must be very long as in the horse see they be of consequence shorter in the animal whose neck be differently form and the shortest in the human species as man carry he head erect it be to be remark that the horse be furnishied with large muscle which run over sc to and unite with the soleus at which empower he to kick backward with so much force and which be peculiar to this animal the cow be destitute of it this part of the body be consequently hollow by the way the head of bourgelat s horse in the hippi atrique be too small the length from to or from the extremity of the shoulder to the extremity of the buttock be two head and two third whereas it must be two and one half as in the painting of stub and other good master in the english model of horse stript of its integument the head be only one third of the length from to that be considerably shorter unlefs these animal be furnish with extraordinary long neck they would not be able to graze the height be from the wither to the hoof be gene rally equal to and mostly five foot have find the majority of head to be two foot in length even in foal but the neck of these be proportionably longer example ii the cow plate iii fis draw the outline of horse as before secondly shorten the foot from to and from to inference in consequence of this considerable difference in the length of the foot the neck of the cow need not be longer than from to and when stretch in stoop to graze as from toy hence the neck can not be arch as in the horse nor be it necessary but it gently incline upwards the weight of the head always sink it and also the horn lower than the prominence this be always the case in that species of cattle that be mostly know in holland it be for this reason that the wither or prominence be not so elevate as in the horse other peculiarity will manifest themselves example iii the dog plate iv fig draw as before the outline of the horse and the line of the vertebræ contract the belly from gh to gz this difference be occasion by the nature of the food as have be explain the neck of this animal be of various length as it be quently eat and gnaw its food lie as well as in standing posture the foot must be make slender in proportion to the swiftness of the animal as the thigh bone from to be longer than in horse the leg become proportionably shorter the tail must be make to spring upwards example iv the camel plate iv fic sketch as before but the foot must be make longer and the belly thicker in consequence of this difference the neck must necessarily be longer than that of the horse and the head though it be of equal size with that of the horse will appear smaller from the same cause when the head be erect the neck must be make to curve from beneath upwards contrary to that of the horse and in such direction that the position of the head may correspond with the centre of gravity in this animal as well as in the sheep and deer the ine must have only small degree of inclination upwards example the elephant plate fio draw the horse as before be the neck of this animal to be as in the horse from toi that be long enough for the mouth to reach the ground high and prominent wither would become re quisite proportionate to the weight to be support but this form could not take place accord to the general con struction of the animal therefore must the neck be short ened as from to but the animal not be able to reach the ground trunk or proboscis become necessary the vertebra of the breast and back must now be make to form a arch the elephant have only three vertebrae of the loin and become proportionably shorter other peculiarity shall be leave to you own observation lecture iii the subject continue it have be observe in the precede lecture that no one except crispin van de pas have give we particular rule for delineating every species of animal with any degree of precision will now add that the skeleton which lay the foundation of the whole superstructure and direct the form both of man and animal have generally be repre sent in so imperfect manner that they be of no use to the painter all the skeleton represent by coiter be extremely bad those of meyer be still worse nor be there à single one in the costly and in other respects excellent work of buffon that can be of the least service to the artist in all of thefe as in the production of coiter the dorsal vertebra or back bone be in right line the shoulder bone with the bone of the fore arm the bone of the thigh with the shank be also in right line thus be the foot in proportion to the length of the neck so long that not one of these animal would be able to reach its food from the ground cheselden in he valuable treatise on the bone have give we very large collection of the skeleton of different animal which be beautifully execute these have be engrave by vander gucht and schynvoet in masterly manner but after imperfect model those of the lizard the turtle the crocodile and the eagle be beautiful those of the bear rabbit and swan be inimitable the skeleton of the ostrich may serve but that of the hog be entirely useless upon the whole the skeleton of animal leave we by cheselden be the most beautiful and accurate of any you will naturally suppose that the skeleton of the horse which be the most beautiful and most useful of animal must have be delineate with peculiar care and exactness but alasl exclusive of those paint by the great master in this department stub and engrave after he painting know not of any that deserve commendation the representation of carlo ruini who lead the way be ufeful to convey general idea of the anatomy of the part but they can not serve the painter what then be to be ex pect from the work of sannier and snape and of other which be merely bad copy from the imperfect engraving of carlo ruinil it be subject of still greater astonishment that in the celebrate royal veterinary school at charenton near paris there be not à single skeleton of horse that would admit into my cabinet although they be all mount by bourgelat himself in every one of they the shoulder blade and bone of the arm be badly place the skeleton of the horse give we by buffon and that by la gueriniere be still worse than the precede that of stub be masterly and accurate all the part be properly place be in just proportion and well delineate in he finissied piece the muscle be represent with a be curacy that can not be exceed in word he skeleton of master piece that the author deserve the highest honour that be ever bestow upon a artist if artist in general succeed so ill with the horse whose extensive utility place he perpetually before we eye what be to be expect in the figure of other animal that have not be imitate by stub it be acknowledge that minute acquaintance with the anatomy of every animal would require so much time that no artist could possibly attain it observation also manifest before they be thirty year of age but a accurate know ledge of the principal part particularly of those which have demonstrate to possess general similitude be absolutely ne cessary both to sketch the different animal with more expe dition and with greater degree of precifion this seem to have be the method follow by potter berchem wouverman snyder castiglioni and the inimitable testa whose work can recommend for they peculiar accuracy shall not mention reidinger because all he animal few of he dog and deer except be absolutely caricature and have nothing but the execution to recommend they van berchem be not perfectly accurate in the disposition of the part in he cow asf the shoulder blade be mostly imperfect particularly of those represent in front position the head of he ape be bad many of he sheep be ill delineate though etch by himself the skeleton be uniformly imperfect yet he book for draw be the least erroneous those engrave by vischer have the imperfection of they original and the hairy cover be much inferior in the hunt of the deer by dankerts be beautiful horse but the body of the deer be too slender adrian van de velde have well delineate most of the cow in he book of horn cattle the bull in stand ing posture be remarkably well draw and also graze neifer although it be foot be somewhat too long in some the hip bone be too long particularly in the walking cow he eating horse be bad the head be one third too small for the height the prominence on the neck or wither be not high enough and on account of the smallness of the head the neck be of a unusual length some may think hat the painter should avoid as much as possible represent ing horse in the act of graze as the extreme length of the distend neck be no pleasing figure great address be re quisite to make it graceful graze cow which van de velde have etch himself be remarkably beautiful paul potter have etch bull which be much inferior to that of van de velde many of he cow be very imperfect in they form he be always embarrassed with the shoulder blade this appear principally to be the case in those that have be etch by de bije but you will enquire why then do we consider the piece of all these celebrate master as so beautiful the expla nation be not difficult we own imperfect knowledge of the exact form of animal render we content with what ever be agreeably execute upon the whole we be en chant by graceful attitude by masterly stroke of the pencil or by the high finish of the whole and this con ceal we own ignorance as well as the imperfection of the artist the work of stan be in some estimation by con noisseur but all he horse be ill draw the foot be too clumsy the head and neck be too small all he grey hound be inaccurate in short he scarcely deserve the name of master what shall we say of de vlieger he landscape indeed be picturesque but he fowl be bad he hound be imperfect in they shoulder and foré leg neither be he hog or sheep accurate peter de laer have sketch he goat dog affe and hog tolerably well but he horse have the same imperfec tion as those of stan and he cow be bad joan vanden hecke deserve no commendation although he be not unknown to connoisseur he horse cow asf dog in word all he animal be badly delineate flame have succeed very well in he fish but he quadruped be very inferior to most other picart le roman have leave behind he large collection of lion most of which be ill draw some by rembrandt be extremely fine and that by alb durer be beautiful upon the whole but the head of all be defective except those by rembrandt many painter give à disagreeable physiognomy to they animal through inattention to the pupil of the eye al though the pupil be round in multitude yet in all animal that graze it be oblong in a horizontal direction in lion tyger cat it be perpendicularly oblong in dog the pupil be not in the centre of the eye but approach to the nose respect the tooth most artist be guilty of great error ph wouwerman have not only paint he horse in very spirite manner but with more accuracy than have observe in most other those engrave by dankerts and joh de vischer place in the superior class of engraving to enumerate every particular would be a endless task let it suffice that have point out to you all such defect in the greatest and most celebrate master as might have be avoid by the manner be about to explain but we will first examine what vander pas have do this artist in the fifth part of he work page the sixth have propose what he deem a easy method of sketch the figure of horse without the rule or compass he draw square by the eye see plate vi fig bcd this he divide into nine equal part see he then make three circle one for the breech one for the belly and one for the breast and shoulder van mander have also recommend three circle and it be possible that van de pas who publissied he work in the year have copy the method of van mander which be publish in de pas give third part of the fourth and fifth square to complete the shoulder and the lower part of the belly tenth square he destine to the neck the diagonal of which limit the length of the neck and head to the above method it must be object first that very few person would be able to form these square with sufficient accuracy by the hand secondly the author have not explain the reason why the centre of these circle should be place on the oblique line fg nor how they be circumscribed accord to this rule the crof or crup per rise higher than the wither at whereas the latter accord to bourgelat should be one tenth higher and accord to stub it be at least of a equal height this proportion differ also from he own drawing see of he treatise thirdly by this method the head of the horse can not be one third of its height for the height of the wither to the bottom of the foot be two head and a half or rather the head be equal to one fifth of the height and length of the horse fourthly he make the heel and the fore hand of a equal height whereas the latter be the length of one head from the groun and the former it be manifest that the method propose be imperfect and uncertain particularly when the animal be to be deli neat in any other posture the proportion give by bourgelat be not bad but the head of he horse be too small the direction of one heinrich lauten sake for delineat ing the proportion of man and horse be highly praise by chr theoph murr but have never see that pub lication vander pas in the twenty fourth page of he treatise give the follow direction for draw the cow divide the length see plate vi fig into three part twice one third of which or four part out of six describe the height of the animal and one third its thick nefs the head be make one fourth of this line the other part be not determinate nor do cow ever stand with its head so high thus the method propose be of little use to the artist for it neither describe the height or shape of the wither back or loin nor do it limit the neck the same author in he twenty third table propose the follow rule for the elephant he divide square into twelve equal portion and make a oval for the rump with out give any determinate size but the whole figure be unterweisung der perspectief und proportion der menchen und rosse void of proportion nor have he delineate the foot in proper manner he have make the hind thicker than the fore foot whereas in elephant camel and horse the reverse be observable the skeleton give by perrault be very imperfect and out of all proportion the same may be assert of that by buffon he representation of the elephant in plate make after model that be by no means satisfactory am positive that the model which have take of a elephant be accurate in all its proportion but it be only calf and its head be in reality lower than its back the head of the elephant delineate by buffon have the promi nence or wither higher than the rump be surprised at this difference but when be at paris last summer see much larger elephant than that have model and perceive that the head and wither be higher this animal be in size between that of bufson and mine thus the proportion have give be only applicable to younger elephant in he twenty fifth table vander pas have delineate camel and he have give a oval for the form of its belly every other part be also badly draw the dog represent in he thirty first table be universally defective and also the rule he propose for draw the cat he also propose in he forty third table three circle for the deer the first smaller than the second and the second than the third but without explain the reason or limit ing the size of either circle since this artist be the only one who have attempt to give we rule for delineating different species of animal and have demonstrate the imperfection of thefe rule though it be acknowledge that the attempt be highly laudable shall now proceed to indicate method that be more simple and much more certain general rule applicable to all animal see plate fig the first draw the line bc accord to the propose length or rather accord to the nature of the animal to be de lineat of consequence inclined less inclined or more in cline as in sheep camel draw the line fe to mark the shoulder blade and ch for the hip bone which for horse must be make equal to two third of the head in length and for cow equal to the whole length of its head sketch also the bone of the arm by eg and that of the thigh by ik so that the elbow and knee in horse cow be exactly of height and even with the belly complete the fore and hind leg that be draw kl mn no op and gr rs st when rand be of equal length the heel ml natu rally rise higher sketch the neck accord to the nature of the animal and afterwards the head pay attention to the rule al ready lay down see the precede example lecture ii by recollect the observation make respect the dif ferent form of animal accord to they destination and also the difference in the length of the loin the above sketch may be make applicable to every case rule the second by sketch the muscle of the shoulder and fore arm the form of the fore leg will be obtain and by sketch the form of the hind leg rule the third the foremost rib be always rectilinear and cover by the shoulder blade the hind rib always incline obliquely back ward in horse they run near to the hip bone in cow the loin be longer hence proceed the triangular cavity plate iii fig efg see page no rule the fourth in all animal with hoof or horny foot the arm and leg from the middle to the lower joint be the longest fig rs and mn in all animal that spring forward as lion hare dog the thigh be much longer than the leg see the grey hound plate iv fig of the above rule in delineating fowl plate vi fig draw the oval as before and place the arm in which be now fold up as the bird be in state of rest draw in like manner cd which may be term the hand and df which correspond with the thumb and de the remain finger draw next gh the hip bone and the rump ik the ham kl the thigh lm the leg and the claw draw the neck qn proportionate to the height of the body and complete the head gr in some fowl the upper jaw or beak be very moveable to the extent of rs as in duck if it be fly fowl the breast bone must be fur nishied with large rib destine to the insertion of muscle the oftrich and cassowary be destitute of this and also with a arch bone the merry think no for the same purpose by fill up with muscle the form of the thigh be obtain by place the feather upon these the whole form of the fowl cover first the wing then the thigh observation in order to place the centre of gravity forward nature have form in all fowl the back very short and make they destitute of loin many fowl have only six vertebræ and consequently not more than six rib on each side which be scarcely more than one third of the seventeen vertebræ with which the human species be furnisnied in the frog in which the centre of gravity be necessarily throw back ward the reverse take place it be necessary that this animal should retain the loin in order to throw the strength of the muscle into its thigh and hind leg thus have the supreme creator render it almost destitute of back and place the head contiguous to the loin for the same reason it be des belon de man have give two fkeleton tlie one of the human form and the gther of bird in which he have represent the resemblance of all the bone from the head to the foot in very satisfactory and elegant manner have not take notice of this before the year see histoire de la nature des oiseaux pub ish in page of rib and hence do it s body appear so extremely shiort ii since it have be shew that the fore foot of all ani nal be correspondent with the wing of bird and also with we arm it be to the highest degree absurd to give wing to the human form as be the practice in the repre sentation of angel cupid in like manner the ex istence of centaur be impossible for this quadrupe would in reality have six foot double breast and two distinct belly that neither triton nor mermaid can exist will appear from the above remark concern the form of bird « it be observable that in all the bird which sly the pectoral muscle constitute the principal part of they bulk peculiarly strong muscle be necessary to com municate such force to the wing that they should be able to suspend the body in the air and to propel it forward be the painter to furnishi he angel with these muscle they would become monster without they he suppose a impo sibility this idea might be extend much further in the human form mass of pectoral muscle infinitely larger in proportion to that in fowl would be requisite in order to overcome the weight of man s posterior which be intend to enable he to walk firmly upon the earth prevent he from spring more than few foot above it would not painter therefore do wisely to leave those unmean fan and in they representation of celestial being trust to the lightness and elegance of they form and divinity of they countenance lf custom have so far consecrate wing that they can not be dispense with surely much more care should be take than be generally observable that they be not make to carry greater weight than be absolutely necessary of the above rule in delineating fish plate vi fic ii the similarity of fish to quadruped may be demonstrate in the follow manner draw as before the oblong oval bacg as in plate fig since the fish neither have nor require neck except those that respire which be furnishied with fhort one place the head be immediately upon the back bone as the rump have no distinct and separate motion though it be in equipoise with the water power be require similar to the oar of boat see ane of fig to which the fish may now be compare as great mobility be requisite in fish it be obvious that the tail ch become necessary and also the large transverse bone for the insertion of the muscle in proportion as ne or the tail be long will the fish be able to move itself with the greater velocity in all fish the head be join to the first vertebra through the medium of cartilage in like manner as the vertebrae be united with each other inference inference the boat would be the most steady be the centre of motion and gravity to unite in the same point this be impossible in boat but it always take place in fishi hence it be that fish be able to swim in right line whereas the fore part of the boat must move from side to side but the fishi must keep itself in straight line and it be furnishied with fin for this purpose both upon the breast bf and under the belly at take away bf and the fish will fall upon its side inference ii since fisli be naturally in equipoise with the water and they all swim or row themselves forward by means of the tail it follow that they position in the water must be horizontal of the head and upon this circumstance will depend the length of the tail since greater diversity of form can take place in fishi than in quadruped there be space for much greater diver sity of species in the first than in the last the existence of such sea monster as mermaid and triton be impossible and the idea of they absurd as these animal must be suppose to swim in a erect pofition the tail form a acute angse with the back whereas the centre of gravity would unavoidably force they into right line but to return since fissi move by means of the tail they have no occa sion for thigh leg or foot also from the nature of they food they do not in general require a offify jaw as in quadruped and fowl the natural history of the frog afford we curious and strike example of the change respect these circumstance appoint by the wise creator in conformity to the exigency of the animal the frog be provide with tail as long as it be destitute of foot but when these protrude and have acquire sufficient force the tail gradually contract until it totally disappear this singular phaenomenon might be con template every spring be not the animal too common and deem too insignificant to attract we notice the transformation of quadruped into birdb plate vii fic change cow into crane draw the skeleton of the cow as in the second ex ample raise this upon the rump a in gc and the fore foot must necessarily rise from the ground as the centre of gravity can no longer be support by the affistance of the fore foot the hind foot ef must be bring forward to fi the carcase or body be raise so much higher above the ground the neck must be extend to gh and the head must be place backward to be support in hi the line of gravity the fore foot not be any longer necessary be change into wing which be to be form accord to the fourth rule as fowl be protect by they feather from be tease by fly à long tail be not necessary for this short and very moveable tail be substitute to assist they flight the transformation of quadrupe into the human figure plate vii fig order to avoid multiplicity of line which would create confufion it be best to represent any quadrupe upon its four foot the horse for example and afterwards to place he erect upon he hind foot the follow change will natu rally follow the hip will be compress into right line with the the fore foot will hang downwards close to the side of the animal hence clavicle will become necessary the thigh and leg will now be rectilinear the head need not be place upon long neck as the animal can not graze in this position and therefore the prominence above the shoulder or wither become unne cessary the back in consequence of these alteration be flatter the brain be of larger volume and place before each other require the head to be of rounder form and the centre of motion and of gravity must unite in the same point the maxilla be necessarily draw inwards the nose project beyond they the foot become shorter and terminate in five toe it follow from the third rule that the thigh and calve as well as the posterior must be make propor tionably thick to support the body in a erect position this have be judiciously remark by aristotle ec homo unus cauda vacat nate habet quod nulli quadrupedum datum est crura etiam homini femore suraque carnulenta funt . quorum causa una est omnium quod homo solus animalium erectus est itaque nate carnosa fecit et femora et furas thus gentleman have accomplish the tafk which have impose upon myself by point out to you the analogy that run through animal nature if have not succeed to you expectation in present the rule so clear and decisive as might have be wishie hope have awaken you curi osity by have make you more acquainted with the general plan of the creator in the formation of animal and de monstrate that minute acquaintance with this will best enable the statuary and painter to excel in the different branch of they art the end
