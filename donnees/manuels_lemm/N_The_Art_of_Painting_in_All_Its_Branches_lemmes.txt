englisb and the rather to use he own reason for that though many excellent author have write on painting yet in bulk they seem rather to cry up the art and artist than lay down solid rule for attainment to whichi may add that those author be mostly useless to a englisbman and few or none copious enough to answer general purpose nor at best be of general service in engiand where fresh and fair nature be prefer before the brown and warm colour of some other country especially italy where the best book have be write on the subject but principally for that think nothing have be publish here so learn full and complete and so well explain by plate and example as the author will be find to be nor perhaps wherein portraiture branch which england mightily affect be so copioussy handle the author learn the rudiment of he art under he father and at amsterdam whither he come young from luttich the capital of bishopric of that name in germany where he settle live and die give early proof of the skill and erudition for which he be afterwards fame accordingly he pursue history and its chief ornament emblematic learning and have make some proficiency in those two capital branch he congeive that other thing must be easy of course as be but rivulet flow from those main spring wherefore it be probable by what he write that in they turn he practise portraiture and the other part in such manner as to qualify he to criticise on all of they but the translator preeace but he thirst for the art stop not here he be persuade that so inquisitive so laborious genius as he be as proper for plate as the pencil and therefore at time he etchgreat number of print from he own design which have meet with good reception abroad especially in germany where set of they have be copy to good advantage as he practice be as useful laborious and universal as that of any painter of the age so also be the theory whereon he build it it do not appear that he ever visit france or italy or any other academy neverthelefs rome france england and germany know he in he work and at home he make himself master of such fund of classic emblematic historical and discriptionary learning print and book on painting architecture antiquity and other requisite and be so well bequaint with the work of the best master that he become good critic by this means and through he great industry he outline appear true and easy he colour warm soft and expressive and he composition noble learn and just amidst he fatigue he preserve the pleasant humour which reign in several part of this work particularly in the odd description of the flood book chap and the contest between antiguo and modo book chap what render he most dear to the age he live in be he kind and fatherly instruction and encourageinent to young artist and he communicative advice to painter in general who make he frequent visit which they acknowledge in often chuse he the umpire of they dopute on art esteem he decifion as oracle this public spirit this love for he art as they be always conspicuous in he without mercenariness so they remain with he to the last for notwithstanding he loss of sight the effect of two close a application to etch by candlelight as many imagine and as he himself almost beknowledge he as mon gericke rector and professor in the royal academy of art at berlin and painter to the king of prussia observe in the preface to he version of the author s drawbook make weekly thing not to be parallel in any other master the center of eircle consist of young student whom he instruct in draw by which he get maintenance and like the sun dispense he beam to all around he under he great affliction the painter he cotemporary know he have store large collection of remark on the art for he private amusement almost generally intreate he to reduce they to some order for public public benefit which notwithstanding he loss of sight and age they thonght he still capable of do he inability for painting a amusement to he chagrin he friend requste and design to be thoroughly inform to promise tyro swayed he to compliance and how well the work be receive may appear from the commendatory copy of verse pen by the best poet of tht time and prefixe to each of he thirteen book which havc omit in the translation as be of no significancy to a englisb reader the aforesaid remark aud observation be originally in french and in compile the author make several addition to they even while the sheet be print off which may possibly make the work seem in some place less smooth than otherwise it would be though certainly the better for they judge with plato non enim tadet bis dicere quod bene dicitur he tell we that if connexion in general be not so well observe as might be wish it be

common with other nevertheless ifhis reason be impartially examine he question not a aquittal for say he lf any work be read without love and impartiality the labour and instruction be lose wherefore he who would teach fundamentally and well must avoid prepossession weigh duly what seem odd to he and inquire and reason thoroughly before he fix either he thought or opinion of he also say that if he be any where find to prescribe rule thing which he have not always follow it be ow to he dark condition wherein he memory and idca become more vigorous bright and intent and consequently he judgment more strong acute and refine by continual reflexion on the art than when he have he sight and be busy in he employment for further satisfaction in this point see chap of the book of colour it now remain to be observe that as he chieftalent lay in history the noblest branch of painting and allow the greatest frecdom so the heat of he zeal and the many inconveniences attend portraiture might possibley induce he to speak à little too freely of the latter in book hope he will be excuse since he notwithstanding fail not afterwards to be very particular in he instruction on that head and if what he advance in book chap touch the representation of the first person in the trinity give any offence only observe that though he reafon be plausible yet he modestly conclude that herein painter must be very discreet and not abuse the liberty allow he by scripture and the consent of the father wherefore since such thing be not allowable by protestants of whose communion the author pro fess to be no further maintain the point than to say could not in justice to the work leave out the chapter which treat of it but principal satisfaction think necessary to be give touch the verbal or descriptionary table occur in several part of the work these though at first view they may possibly seem dull and tiresome yet when duly consider will appear to be masterpiece in they kind and not only display the author solid learn but also he great industry in inforcinghis precept by every method for as it be evident that he have spared for no pain both by discourse and example to evince the doctrine of disposition motion pasfion contrast colour harmony light and shade reflexion drapery grounds ornament and generally every thing which can constitute good composition so can¬ not but observe how wonderfully he reduce all those part to practice in the say table and there by illustrate diver thing and essential circumstance which could not be so welldo either by discourse or in any other manner in word they be summary of the whole and the best instruction for performance and to inform the judgment of lover of painting and therefore the work would have be incomplete without they it be certain that by such precept as the author lay down the greatest master in history have make themselves famous and by these even facepainter have attain the looseness and freedom may say the historical management we discover in they best piece but the author stop not here for he fail not every where to inculcate emblematic and hieroglyphic learn part of knowledge which though much overlook be very hopeful and necessary in almost every branch of painting on the whole as he great reading appear by the number of author he quote on this occasion and as he endeavour to be generally useful even to the handling of architecture statuary engrave etch and mezzotinto so it be hope the work will prove here as it have do abroad system of the art of painting and may pofsibly in due season also publish the drawbook of the same author work as entertaining as profitable to lover and artist whoever will study art and science must expect both trouble and labour without repine because he expectation be not immediately answer or the end just in view this be so true that even the greatest master be not always alike successful but if delay seem tiresome let we duly ponder where the obstruction lie and whether master can not help we over it surely if we be not too full of ourselves we may meet with such a aid accord to cato ne pudeat quee nescieris the velle doceri scire aliquid

painting book penciling secondtint and beauty chap of handle the pencil the handling the peneil be twofold and the two manners very different from each other the one sluent and smooth the other expeditious and bold the former be proper for copy neat and elaborate painting and the latter for copy bold composition as big as the life but he who practise the former manner have this advantage above the other that be accustom to neatness he can easily execute the bold and light manner it be otherwise difficult to bring the hand to neat painting the reason of which be that not be use to consider and imitate the full¬ neis of small object he must therefore be stranger to it besides it be more easy to leave out some thing which we be master of than to add other which we have not study and therefore it must be the artist s care to finisn he work as much as poffible it be ridiculous to hear the disciple of great master boast that by copy great thing they certainly obtain great and firm manner and fat and bold bencil and therefore be induce to disrelish every thing that be neat and elaborate but after all they can say it be certain that he who can handle best must study that manner which most exactly exhibit the different nature of the object which he be to reprefent for there be no other handling of advantage to painter than the two beforemention but further to convince any one that great and bold handling contribute nothing to the art let we place piece thus paint at due distance and then see whether the penciling make it look more natural this advantage it may perhaps have it may bring in more money since so happy master can dispatch double the work of another through the bent of imagination fitted to the expedition of he hand each branch have peculiar handling adapt to the nature of the object to be represent as the landscapepainter in the leaf of the tree the cattlepainter in the expression of wool and hair the ornamentpainter in foliage branch and the flowerpainter inthin penciling painter be also observe to use some longhair other shorthair pencil this thin that stiff colour but notwithstanding any such difference all be reduceable to the two handling aforesaid yet in such manner as that neither of they ought to appear but for the advantage of the artist only the art be theory of the mind and the handling manual practice consist of penciling in a orderly and determinate matter for represent a object certainly and quickly and without muddle many be of opinion that this be gift of nature peculiar to some only and thov can not entirely disown it yet must say that it lie more in practice and though we see many painter in the decline of they life fall into a hard and muddy manner yet that argue not against my position since it happen either through inclination or want of better foundation in they youth how often do we see master know by they disciple little and slovenly master never bring up neat and curious painter though it sometimes happen that neat master may rear slovenly disciple and the reason be plain for good instruction be not aloné sufficient without due and perfect apprehension of it carelessness be the usual parent of bad picture and so infect a evil will continue as long as the artist remain in he ignorance it be certain tnen in order to obtain good handling that right and early apprehension of instruction and thorough sight of fault be absolutely necessary when these point be gain the artist must endeavour at the three follow essential qualification boldness of hand in the deadcolour more care cireumspection and labour in the second colour and thorough patience and attention in the retouch or finisning picture the nigher to perfection the more care these three quality be as essential to painter as the three grace toenus we first work then must be to lay both light and shade bold with broad and fullcoloured pencil one by the other even and without muddle and then gently move the pencil to and for up and down as the nature of the object require we there by unite the colour and fetch out the relief with this caution nevertheless that the light must not be scumble too much into the shade or the shade into the light thus the work will have good effect by proceed in this manner we shall perceive no very particular handling in we work and therefore it must be good one for the first colour be hide by the second as that be by the third wherein lie the neatness have hitherto speak chiesly of painting in little and its manner of handling shall in the next chapter lay down instruction for painting as big as the life of penciling second tint and beauty chap ii of painting after the lije he who paint after the life and find it difficult through year and inabihlity to make good compofition must not undertake thing beyond he strength if ten figure be too much let he take five if these be too many two or one nay a half figure for little and good be preferable to much and bad again if he have no genius for drapery let he study the naked as spagnolet carbot and other master do but then like they he must labour to excel in that branch for middle artist will neither get honour nor gain here let I advise you to gain thorough knowledge of form or proportion and the passion that you may not only give you figure they natural motion but that it may also well appear what cause those motion express properly the condition and dignity of you figure by they carriage whether they be private person of either sex great man or deity seck the colour not in spagnolet or carlot but in nature herself let you carnation be as natural as pessible the fresn and fair you must paint so and the yellow or russet must be of those colour but above all industriously avoid incline to particular manner do not maintain that warm glow or brown colour be best bat be in he kind a beautiful as parrot for thenyou will certainly err and since man be too apt to hug they fault you care must be to be know by good manner and handle now for we artist s safer conduct we shall lay down the follow precept for the right ordonnance of piece let he chiesly consider where the piece be to be fix in order to place right the horizon and point of sight let he consider what force the light have in that place and there by whether the painting must have strong light and broad shade as be near windor or more faint and melt light as remove further into the room this we may soon perceive in landscape or other withindoor painting and whether the shade should be strong or not since it be certain that the object whether great or small have different effect in these two instanee and now if the perspective be also well manage and the colour lay frefh and proper and well handle by gently uniting they uith large pencil the piece will be good if this handling and melting of colour be not yet understand ishall clear the point in the follow instance take what colour you object require be they red blue green violet lay they broad and distinct by each other without scumble then view they through piece of lanternhorn you will perceive à perfect umnion of colour and that none of they lie distinct though in fact they do this fully illustrate what say of fluent or smooth pencil now the effect be the same when we paint in varniss or tough or fat oil because painting with starve colour on dry ground can never effect this smoothness in painting after the life we ought to use large pencil and though to some this may seem a useless admonition because great painting require such yet must recommend it because some use commonsized and wear one which so muddle the work and fill it so full of hair that it will bear scrape this evil be so steal that at last it become habitual and then the painter neither mind or see it himself because there be two fort of picture the one moveable the other fix the former hang at pleasure in hall or room the latter for ceiling or far above the eye each of they call for distinct management nich in gallery as near the eye must be range in the claf of moveable picture as well as portrait wherefore they ought to be neater handle though sometimes place higher at other time lower if it be afk whether a upright piece forty or fifty foot deep from floor tociel ought to be smoothly handle and finish throughout say no but rather to be so paint as high as you can reach less finish in the middle and less than that as it advance in height and yet with such general care that all part seem to have à like force and finish and though we find different conduct in jordaan s magnificent triumphal piece in the house in the wood near the hague yet that can be no rule because the painting be large the eye can not distinguissi whether the upper part be less finish than the under moreover the figure be bigger than the life but here methink difficulty may be start suppose in room where such large piece be another be to be paint by it smaller as single figure no bigger than the life how shall we manage in order to give this latter picture the same force as the former answer that force and warmth lie in the colour not in the roughness of picture whence it be that the small picture must be handle in the same manner as the great one to make they look agreeable for heighten and shad it with the same force will produce the same effect and if not immediately by the pure strength of colour yet by scumble and glaze we fetch it out but then say some it can not have due conformity with the life because on compare it with the large picture it seem less than the life answer that this objection must not make we exceed the common size of nature since no such large man as in the great picture be to be find in nature and if any such be they part would look too big they skin rougher pore coarser hair more bushy and strong than we see in nature but the contrary may be practise in cielpiece where the composition be mostly hieroglyphic and fictitious proceed now to shew more amply good manner or handle chap ii of deadcolour and how to perform it with certainty and expedition the most certain and regular way be to begin the picture from the depth or bointain especially when landscape be introduce fince all thing muft suit and fall in with the light and dark of the air and the several tint of the piece be modifie and govern by it as indeed must also the light on the foreground and the force of the figure otherwise the effect will be disagreeable and uncertain but if the main composition consist of figure or other large object only it be better to begin where you intend the greatest force whether it be on the first or second distance and then work to the offpart of the picture now in order to proceed with certainty we must take care that general harmony of part be well observe that the tint and colour be justly manage accord to the law of depth and distance so that nothing appear offensive to the eye and then the work will be in fit condition for second colour with little trouble many painter indeed err in not know where to begin rightly and only consult what object they like best heedlessly fall on they first for instance if it be gold vase they begin with that and then proceed to blue drapery then red one other begn with the nudity and so run through all the nakeds in the picture by which strange disjunction the work become misshapen and the painter make more uneasy than by a illprimed cloth but such painter never think on any means to extricate themselves out of this labyrinth to what purpose be it to shew they they error they be sit isfy with what they have do and salve all by saythe picture be but deadcoloured on finish it shall be otherwise what be now too light shall be bring down and what too dark heightenbut all this while the work do not go forward the rise difficulty pall the fancy and the work be in bad condition for second colour ch ap iv of the second colour and its requisite fo piece be well deadcoloured and havegood harmony and decorum we certainly render the second colour the more easy for then we can unbend we first general thought and apply they solely to lay neatly and finisn particular part and so to work on the former good ground but to do this in the best manner we must as have say begin from the greatest lointain the sey and work forward from thence by this means we have always wet ground to melt in with the outline of the forward figure which otherwise they would not have besides another pleasing advantage that the piece go forward all part well support and good harmony in the whole whence the eye must be satisfied and the mind continually spur this management be one of the prime quality of painter for what can encourage he more than a asfurance that he work on basis and which he find without seek it but unhappy be he who work disorderly for muddle on one thing as long as he fancy for it last and then thoughtlesly proceed to other and dwelling on they in the same manner he miss the necessary become air of he piece and at last all appear out of joint and disrelish have come thus far we proceed to the manner the french call it chap of retouch or finisbing retoucher we revise how fure painter be have get thus far let experience and he own reflection be judge for the figure have they proper distance strength and effect and all part due harmony and keep nothing remain but to give the piece the last force of light and shade to do which well rub you piece or so much as you think you can paint of it at one time and before the vernisn grow dry with good thin picturevarnissi mix with some fat white oil then work on this wet ground by clapping you light on the lightest part and by gentle scumble unite they with the wet ground aforesaid and the tenderness of the nudity and drapery in such degree as be necessary for each then put in the yellow or glow of the reflection if after all the light of the nudity should be here and there too strong reduce they by mixing little light oker vermilion brown red lake or asphaltum accord as the colour be tender or strong underthe vernisn glaze thinly over they then heighten upon this with such colour as you think fit do the same by the drapery thus the work will succeed and the colour be prevent from go in in drying chap vi of the second tint and the relief it occaston there be many who whatever pain they take can not be bring to they who have relisn thing in which they find so much difficulty long practise after nature be vex to see the work of other master better coloured and more pleasing than they own insomuch that with difficulty they reassume they profession and then eagerly hope to do wonder find they old vexation still return would these man rightly search the cause they trouble would end for because of we inferiority in knowledge yet we must not be therefore discourage but as faid study where the fault lie let we then make good reflection on neat picture in order to profit by they and also converse with better master than ourselves of penciling second tint and beauty it be to be lament that these man sometimes see fine thing in another master but can give no reason for it because they work rather by accident or chance than on sure principle as be the case of young painter some year ago who shew I some of he piece say this piece paint six year ago this four and that less yet can perceive no difference between they in goodnessnow though the difference be visible the last piece appear better manage in all part than the former yet he would not believe I say that notwithstanding all he endeavour he picture be grey and muddy when other be clean and pleasant and they light broad lay on my colour say he fine and warm as they do and then expeditiousty scumble they into each other now pray tell I what must tken occasion this foulness tell him—certain painter with whom you daily converse spoil you and as long as you follow they all my advice be to no purpose as for you thought and ordonnance like they very well but distike you handling you do not lay on you second tint clean enough by the second tint mean that which be lay on the light part towards the outline by means of which all relieved or round part be force to unite with the ground and to go off round this you must lay on clean and beautiful in the same colour as that of the light but it must not be muddy and like shade for be also light by the day the darkness and it be grey can have no effect upon it relief or roundness be nothing else than light reced or go off which ought to partake more or less of blue in proportion to the colour of the carnation which if yellowish the second tint must be greenish if red the tint must be violet and if white colour the tint be medium be¬ tween the two colour aforesaid from all which premise it be easy to apprehend that this second colour be to be get and mix with blue but not with foul colour because it then lose its flehhiness . here he ask I in what manner then he should make it darker answer that as the distance of object cause faintness in colour and what we call air make bluissi interposition between we and they so he must mix nothing with he tint but fine blue or smalt in proportion to such distance this be colour if may so say which give no colour or do it without much alteration this conduct relate not only to nudity but also to landscape grounds stone drapery and in fine to every object have either roundness or distance moreover another perfection necessary to this tint be that we must not let it be too dark upon the relief because broad light look majestic and fine when between it and the broad shade tender difference only appear —he return I thanks and go off there be many who know not the importance of the thing they slight and in comparison with other think they of no great moment as be the case of aother painter who copy piece of poussin observe nicely the colour temper even the half shade and tender tint exactly on he pallet but have finish the piece he in other picture fall again into he old road he himself see very well greât difference between this piece and those other and be sorry for it but the mischief lay in not retain the manner which he have before imitate with so much pain and this occasion he slightness we find even painter who believe that the second tint must upon extremity be quite dark mixing in it the colour of the ground and say the great mignard do so which intirely deny it be true that once read small treatise write by the famous bosse entitle le peintre converti or the converted painter in which among other thing he pretend to prove that mignard make he second tint too dark on the extremity of he object but say that it must not be understand from thence that he muddle the tint with fouler groundcolour but rather that in proportion to the lightness or darkness of the ground he make it either lighter or darker without use any red yellow or black in it as they pretend moreover we know the vast difference between foreright face and foreshorten one that the one on the near side grow larger than the other as the face in plate plainly shew which by observe or neglect give the the greatest difficulty some painter meet with be that one of the quality of good picture lie in broad light this they imagine to consist in slatness reasoning thus lfit be truth that picture with such light be best more round one must need be worse very loose argument certainly since nature and daily experience of round object teach we the contrary especially when it be not sunshiny weather ihave say before that the contour or outline ought to unite in the tint of the ground that go off from the more enlighten part it may not appear so much as the other to illustrate which we exhibit here in plate aforesaid round pillar against ground half light half shade so that the light side of the pillar be set off by the shade of the ground and the shade of the pillar by the light side of the ground now it must need follow in order to obtain the relief that the shade of the pillar ought to be make lighter on the extremity that it may round off towards the light ground otherwise it would be but semicircle on the opposite side it be the same except that the light do preserve it self and its own colour because the air which interpose cause the outline to recede and fall back and in the shade the same with this differerce only that there it be double by the lightness of the background partake more or less of its colour if this be not well apprehend let the next example explain it place globular body against light yellow ground as in the say plate then view it at some distance you will perceive the outline on the shade side tenderly to melt into the ground without any hardness this relate to the roundness only now let we observe how much the colour partake of it lf this ball be of blue colour the extremity will be greenish against the yellow if the ball be violet they become purplisn and if the ball be yellow as well as the ground they will be more yellow in the shade as we have already teach in treat of the naked the superficial roughness or smoothness of the ball cause little alteratior except with respect to its nearness to or distance from the ground look now on the light side of this ball we shall find that if the ball be lighter than the yellow ground the colour of the ground can not have so much force on it since the superficial colour of the ball can not be overcome by lesser colour than it and therefore the yellow ground can not add to its colour whence it happen that the meer interposition of the air cause the relief or the outline to round and go off again be the ground darkish or black yet the diminish of the colour cause by the interposition of the air will be neither less nor more but will be more or less set off by the ground and seem lef round artist err in think that the half tint which be lay next to the extremity on the light side and call mezzotint be the same with that place between light and shade under the name of middle tint for this last be whole tint and the other but a half tint and not so broad as the mezzotint which more than half mix with the shade and consequently be bluer although some give it upon the edge of the light side another colour more like shade than the colour of the object the mistake of which we have already shew but when the light be front or come directly from before then this mezzotint be half mix with the middle tint let I not here be misunderstand for speak not of the sidelight which painter generally use from all which premise it be plain that this tint though call mezzotint or break tint can not be consider as shade since it partake of the light again it happen frequently that in the same piece of painting some object be rounder or darker upon the extremity than other which ought to be so when by means of the obliquity of the point of sight we can discover more than the semidiameter of they roundness in some and but semidiameter or less in other as in the two pillar in the plate aforesaid for if the point of sight be in the midale of the piece and the light fall in it obliquely from the right side then the object on the right side will have broader shade and those on the leave broader light as these two pillar plainly evidence but if now on each side of these two pillar be some other pillar place alike distant from the point of sight and both cut from top to bottom through they center parallel with the horizon it be certain that at the proper distance we shall see not only the inward split but also some part of the hindermost half as in pillar now observe as the pillar to the left shew that the part which be see beyond the half on the light side round off so much the further and consequently become darker than where the main light round off on the contrary view the light side of the righthand pillar you see as much less of the foremost diameter or half as more of that on the shade side wherefore the outline can not round off so far on its light side nor the extremity be so dark as on the other pillar where more than the half be visible ch ap vii of beauty and the proportion of the member in au human body beauty be the most valuable part of painting it must therefore be the first and chief object of we work but my design be not to mention all that can be say of its power and influence since daily occurrence furnish we with sufficient example the wisest of the ancient venerate it as we see in plato who define it to be a human brightness of lovely nature have power to attract the mind by the help of the eye nay cato value it so highly that he publicly say it be as great sin io hurt it as to rob atemple nevertheless it must be confest that it lie most in a idea conceive in we sense and judgment whence it be impossible to think that it should center in any one single object the most we can say then be this that there be as many beauty as different object the proverb say wellso many mind so many beauty paris imagine accord to homer that helena wife to menelaus be the handsomest woman apollo boast the same of he daphne narcissus on the contrary think nobody handsomer than himself stratonica amongst the persian be account the greatest beauty and she statue worship the neck and breast of the athenian theodota be so amiable in socrate s eye that he fall in love with she many more instance might be give but see its standard be no where fix in order to know it certainly we can only observe that each country each lover think it have the greatest the grecian think the brown complexion the most agreeable the latin the fair spaniards think black hair and the german brown hair the most pleasing this love tall and wellset people that esteem slenderness this modest carriage that wanton one from all which premise it be plain beauty depend most on imagination beauty be threefold common uncommon perfect the common depend much on the fafhiion and satisfy common sense the uncommon be single out by we judgment from amongst many other and the perfect be that as we have say which subsist in the imagination but we must neverthelefs six on some standard or model for beauty which therefore we have draw to the best of we skill out of the many pattern leave we by the greek the beauty of nudity in either sex consist herein the member must be well shape they must have fine free and easy motion sound and fresh colour the member must be perfectiy join in manner best befit they nature and quality the head and face duely proportionate and the eye nose and mouth to have they exact symmetry the hand finger foot and toe and other part of the body to be of a agreeable length and thickness by easy motion we mean that all the member from the greatest to the least exert themselves most beautifully and without pain perform they action in graceful manner as we shall illustrate by example by colour we understand such a one as be visible in perfect healthy person not subject to impair and not incline too much to rednef or palenefs as we shall shew in its place these be the three quality requisite to beautiful naked and name by the poet the three grace affirm that they be all to be find in venus urania now in order to instruct the artist fully in the beautiful division of the member shall here subjoin the measure as take it from aman s skeleton when for profefsor birloo physician to the king of great britain accord to he instruction draw the figure for he famous book of anatomyfor ease in this measure have place by it in plate ii iii iv perpen¬ dicular line mark with sol and luna which be the length of the figure and be divide into four equal part call rough part mark bcd for the quarterly division of the figure from the head to the armpit privity knee and sole of the foot this line be divide again into seven equal part and a half call headpart and number the sirst of which be for the head which be again subdivide into four other equal part mark for the forehead eye nose and chin and by these last division we shall afcertain the several part of the figure ascend from the mark luna to sol accord to which the length will be and now question not but he who govern he figure by these proportion will find he advantage in it especially if he observe the gracefulneis of the statue for instruction in the second part of beauty the graceful motion of the member let the tyro consult the figure in plate vi wherein he will find the principal disposition for beautiful action consist in raise and sink the shoulder and hip and they contrast motion as also those of the lesser member in the same posture from whence arise not only the grace of beautiful figure but also advantageous shade which give the last hand to grace this instruction be of so universal importance that it ought to be observe as well in dead as live nature in paffionate as meek man rage as quiet sorrowful as joyful those in pain or die as in dead body nay it be impossible that any particular motion or posture of the body can be good which be not toturally exprest and conduct by the three follow quality fine outline free sway in the motion lastly beautiful colour for to colour living figure as dead one or the contrary rage one pale quiet one hot or mourn one in merry air would be egregious and against the truth and all lie be hateful must be unworthy of painting if seem unintelligible in say that sine action and colouriug ought to be observe in dead body void of boih it must be know that speak of paint dead body not natural one because this letter have neither the power of motion nor disposition however when require we must dispose the model for we dead figure in such manner as look most beautiful the face in front the breast sway fideway one hip rise one leg close the other flung out one arm flung this way the other that way and so forth this be call fine action and the whole beautiful figure as for the colour it must not be like wood or stone but flessy as we see in nature it if any object that because there be three principal stage of life vouth middle dge and old age each have its particular action colour and proportion it be difficult to chuse perfect beauty out of any of they answer that all three ought to be représent alike beautisul accord to they nature the young tender gay and frefh the midaleaged sedate and fleshy and the aged slowmotion and decay for notwithstand age each of the three have he commendable qualitythat be a handsome youththere be comely manmind the gravity of that old manand so forth but pray consult perrie s statue and carefully mind the youth of ganimedes let antinous or apollo represent the second stage of life and the old faunus the third and you will there by see that each of those figure be in he character perfectly beautiful to which add they fine colour agreeable to they year all of which confirm my affertion and the figure must be beautiful although now beautiful figure consist in good proportion and disposition of its part with respect to action and passion yet it can not be say to be absolutely perfecttill further improve by beautiful light for we often see that too faint light render object disagreeable and produce a effect contrary to we intention which which make we uneasy because we first purpose be spoiled and we knownot the reason of it but so itwill happen when without minding the effect of we object we chuse a improperlight as violent passion in feeble light which loose at once its effect and motion contrarily tender and pleasant object may by too strong and broad light and shade too sharp be quite broken and it be grace go hence it be of the last moment to consider thoroughly before we begin we work the nature and effect of the subject we intend to handle as whether it be the murther of julius caesar in full senate or the death of cato or the nuptial of strafonica with antiochus or the reception of the queen of sheba with she retinue of lady by solomon because different passion be to be introduce in those different subject in the former we must suppose great hurry and consternation fright and confusion nay all be in motion in the latter nothing be see but tender beauty easy carriage graceful modesty and authority and now whio will not agree with I that the two former subject ought to be handle with strong and siarp light and the two latter with soft and more tender one à this effect lie also in the very nature and quality of light themselves some produce strength and sharpness other sweetness softness and pleasure but former example may be call graceful confusion and the two latter severe amour wherefore conclude that figure well proportion and dispose have graceful motion and sway and light agreeable to its outline and motion may be call perfect figure chap viii of the motion of the member et we proceed now to the second of the part wherein beauty consist lnamely ihe motion of the member this depend chiesty on contrast or opposition of all the member of the body and on they light and shade which give figure motion and life and this be chiefly obtain by wind or sway as when the face be front the body must turn little sideways and the leg again front see fig plate vii second observation be contrast in the incline poise of tke body from head to foot for instance if one shoulder rise the other must sink the hip knec and foot the same as in the same fig wherein the right shoulder risc the right hip fall the right knce or foot rise again and the contrary on the opposite s side of tlie body third observation be that when the right arm and leave leg advance the left arm and right leg fall back this morion double when the right shoulder be see front for then the head and under part of the body must be the same as the same figure shew when the breast rise the head ought to sink and the contrary see sig the head must always incline tothe upper shoulder as in fig in a erect posture the foot must make rectangle to wit the heel of the one with the in¬ ward ancle of the other as in fig hand must always have contrast motion if one be see inwardly the other ought to be outward if one hang down the other should be raise up the under part of the arm be foreshorten the upper part should be see direct if the motion of the leg be almost like that of the arm compare the upper part of the arm with the thigh and the under part with the leg if the upper part of the arm sink the thigh must rise and contrast it when the right arm be raise and the leave depressed then the knee or foot must be contrary if the hip swell the upper part of the body sink into the under part if the shoulder heave the neck sink into they here take especial care that the hand and arm be not on line but that each contrast the other in a oppese turn as we see in the good and bad example fig the crof line of the face be never parallel with that of the body either fronting or profilewise northe upper part of the body with the lower in these motion consist in my opmion the beauty of the body with respect ferm as for other motion these three be the principal that of the head that of the hand and foot lastly that of the body those of the head be fourfold forward backward and on each side those of the hand and foot be the same the arm and leg have but one motion to wit one on the elbow the other the knee the arm bend and the leg draw back on the motion of the body be threefold foreright and on both side besides these there be yet four other fort of motion proceed from the same member to wit the simple the active the passive and the violent the simple be when the member move naturally as in walk one foot be set before the other in drink or eat the hand be lift up to the mouth the head turn and the other member be make subservient to the present action and to which child as well as aged person naturally incline the active consist in carry pull thrust push climb and the like which be do by knowledge and judgment this be only in part proper to child see plate viii the passive arise from disquiet of the mind or what the soul shew by the body in the paffion as love hatred anger sorrow joy spite scorn and such like the effect of these though mostly inward yet be see from without the body chiefsy in the small member as the eye nose mouth finger and toe see plate ix the violent proceeding from fright fear despair rage or any thing that be unusual and sudden and perturbate nature either by hear or see such such as sudden thunder spectre or frightful sight these cause shrink stretch and wind of the member to both which young and old be subject see plate but all these paffion together can not produce perfect figure without the assistance of the member because we can go up stair with hand in poeket or lift weight with both hand and yet the leg may be close person can be affright by something stand or lie before he without shew it in the face we can also be in love and it shall not appear in we motion but my principal intention be to express these passion by the motion of the member and to stiew how each member contribute towards they as when the body turn or wind the member stir one advancing another falling back one raise other sink but since it be very rare to see all these motion and paffion as happen very seldom and unaware and since no model can be so set as to give they do for certainty stand for they all express every one even to the lesser member eye mouth nose finger and toe and these be nimbly and dextroussy as you see design by my son chap ix of passionate and violent motionought to observe in the first place that the greatest part of these motion be but in part to be apprehend and mostly by represent the cause of they motion by the relation which they have to each other whether in they beginnings or conclusion for the end of one oftentime begin another as anger be step to madnef sorrow to faintheartedness and this produce despair or folly this be the effect of most of the violent trouble of the mind and pain of the body for this sinart stir the member violently the muscle swell the sinew nerve stretch out of measure nay sometimes beyond they power as for instance in burn wounding and the like which pain though they produce particular contraction in the face and other member yet they would not be plainly know or distinguished if something of they cause do not at the same time appear as pyramus stab with sword eurydice and hisperia bit by snake procry kill with javelin and the centaur nessus shot with a berow hippolytus wounded by the overturning of he chariot and more such by whom we must need as before hint represent something of the cause as by pyramus either the veil of thisbe or the naked sword and by eurydice the snake live or dead by procry the weapon gor with blood and thus of any other moreover we ought to shew the wound and haw it happen two circumstance equally necessary the same be also to be observe in nessus who be shoot from behind eurydice and hisperia bit in the heel achille wounded in the same part all which circumstance skilful master ought to dispose properly but lest these hint be not plain enough shall make they so in the following description represent the death of hisperia hisperia daughter of the river sebrenus be pursue by asacus son of priamus be bit in the heel by snake of which wound she die this young and beautiful maid be in the middle lie on the graf and surround by some nymph who mourn she misfortune she father standing dispirite against piece of stonework and weep for she death be attend by some other rivergod who endeavour to comfort he but in vain she garment be airy and thin and she breast open she goldcoloured headdref come loose over she shoulder she gown turn up which discover she thigh stain with blood boy lienear point at the poisone wound and at the same time push away nymph come by with short stick in she hand shew to the former the foreground where the snake lie kill by some boy with stick and stone thése boy in lively action beat the snake with stick and thornbushy one of they trample on its neck which make it gape another affright by it seem to run away at which third falls laugh wood be on the right side of the piece in the middle on the third ground be see some rise willow and other tree of the watry kind behind which run à river crof tne piece slow on the left side forward wherein float reed and other watry production on the bank of this river be some vessel and urn some fall down other lie partly in the water and one stand upright by the stump of willow some veil reed and lrisleave bundle together be scatter up and down several satyr dryad and other wood and fieldgod appear out of the wood some with pineapple other with torch of the same tree some shriek outrageoussy other view the snake other the dead body most of they be ornament with wild plant or oakleave about they head some of they be array with goatskin other with deer on the left side of the piece in the offskip a high impend rock be see and level with it in the middle of the piece thetis drive she seachariot toward the rock in order to save asacus who have throw himself from it be top here we see he flounce into the sea and full of sorrow beat the wave with he wing and heave he breast towards heaven with he head sunk in he neck seem to complain to the god of he hard fate some who be curious run in haste to the rock with loud cry and stretchout arm at which the foremost figure look back point at the sea to give they to understand that it be already over with he do not question but he who be somewhat acquainted with fable and history and see such picture will presently apprehend the whole drift of the story nay idare flatter myself that person not conversant with they will observe the pafsion in it and the catastrophe though he can not tell who the person be but to return to the motton it be certain that all upright figure whether of man or woman must for gracesake poise but on on leg never on both by which mean one hip will always rise the leg ought not to be further apart than the length of foot walk the hip can rise little or nothing the breast ought to bear perpendicularly over the leg which support the body lf the right leg advance the left must draw back by which mean the body be push forward the right arm or elbow fall back the left arm or hand as also the face must appear foreright the weight of the body of one rum be intirely support by the leg which advance the breast project the head sink into the neck and the other foot be off the ground person climb fink he head into he neck and the neck be erect if the left arm rise the right ought to incline contrarily the right leg be climb and the leave hang down the body bend over the climb leg without any visible swell of hip those who pusti and pull have different action from each other and be shew here sufficiently with those who carry wherefore we shall say little of they though this must be observe that no body can carry any great weight in he hand otherwise than on the side where the hip rise nor on the contrary pull down any great weight otherwise than with the hand of the side where the hip sink the head ought to bend over the rise shoulder there be still remain two sort of motionof noless importance than the other namely beseech and steep yet this last be not confine to the bed at night but occasion by accident in the day in old man throheaviness other by exercise of mind andbody woman by domestick labour and youth by they play and though we can not properly call these motion but rather cessation of motion yet think proper to exhibit they in plate x i wherein no shew slumber young man with he arm and leg wantonly spread be sleepy woman with she head somewhat inelining to she side but she arm and leg more modestly dispose than those of the young man shew a old sleeping man with he head on he breast he arm close to he body he leg draw in and body sink among the besecch no we see figure pray eagerly and incessantly no be pray in the utmost distress and no be humbly imploring the god for help think these example sufficient for find infinite other flow from the paffion accord to occafion and as the matter require more or less force zeal and pleafure but think not thefe here offer to be draw in they greatest force or the most expressive no be not so presumptuous but rather like wrestler who challenge the best master not to overcome they but to stand the chance who shall be the victor aspire at the prize but not with arrogant thought that all must give way to I it be foolisn to think that what have learn by practice and observation another should not learn nay improvey by he industry one light spring from another and from little one become greater this daily experience shew how many thing do we know which be hide from we ancestor whence we may believe that we successor will be more know than we as art and science be much improve in latter age so we may hope for the furtherance in the present polisn age if hercule hercule carry he valour to the fix column herculis columae theseus he successor go far beyond they and yet follow the same path this hope also to shew to the artist wifhing that by my labour or he own industry he may find shorter or more sure way to attain the highest perfection in the noble art of painting chap of the different colour of the naked in child man and woman in health sickness and after death ave carefully study this point find that one chapter be too little to comprehend it nevertheless shall here lay down the principal part of it hope to handle the rest in this work as it come in the way have already treat of two of the fix beauty of a human figure we shall keep nature still in we eye proceed to the last of they the different colour of the naked be as manifold as the object themselves nay almost innumerable but we shall confine ourselves to the three conditien of a healthy and sick person and dead body apply to child man and woman the child be in health be of rosy colour the man of warm and glow colour and the woman of fair colour but in sickness the child incline to yellowish pale the man to dark pale or fallow and the woman to milkish or yellowisn white colour be dead the child be violet the man more grey yet somewhat yellowish and the woman like the child but more beautiful as have the whiter skin the reason of which be that the child have thin skin and be full of blood must appear ruddy the man be more yellow and he skin thicker must appear more grey since the blood can shine less through it and the woman have white and smooth skin must therefore shew herself somewhat ruddy hence it be that child in its tender part be more violet man more grey and woman blue yet more upon the green than the violet all this be demonstrable by the colour themselves for mixing blue and red it become violet for child blue red and yellow make grey for man and yellowisn white mix with very little red and blue give greenef for woman now in order to strike the right colour for each take these for the child white and vermilion it be pretty ruddy for the man the same with the addition of some yellow oker which make it more warm and also more fiery for the woman take white little vermilion and some yellow oker and to know perfectly the proper tint of the tenderness of each of these three person you must in finish take some smalt or ultramarine alone and with soft fitch scumble you blue over the most tender part of you figure so that it lie soft and transparent and you will perceive that this tenderness pro duce in each figure particular and natural colour so much for healthy toture that of the sick and dead shall be speak of afterwards here methink can scarce understand though nothing more common the per¬ verse opinion of painter about colour they seck after art but do not understand nature make large enquiry to little purpose and as it be traverse the earth without move step they talk for ever of this or that master s colour of one they say ay that be beautiful and fressiof anotherthat be like flessi and blood another say that be very fresh and glow .other after have prattle long time and stupify themselves with enquiry give up the cause say such colour be not in the world can neither find nor imagine it it can not be imitate and more such talk but what sine thought be these lf we sense can not apprehend paint nudity what must nature herself be be not the original better than the copy have titian and georgione beautiful colouring let we follow they manner they choose nature for they pattern without imitate other master because in whatever other respects nature may be deficient in relation to the art she be certain in colour therefore the life must be the best model and what be not intirely like she though never so flatter be false and of no worth as have describe some weakness in painter so the follow be no less evil they pretend to correct nature though she be in colour at least not to be correct incredibly difficult be they fruitless attempt and as difficult they meaning through the neglect of essential method for do thing rightly and truly another mischief proceed from tyro themselves these fall upon the life at first setting out can hardly endure to be debarrby they master but desire such may know that by this hindrancetill they can copy well they master act prudently after this let they proceed to the life since it be certain that they must first get thorough knowledge of the mixture of the colour without which they will make but poor work of the life besides it be far more easy to imitate a object paint than one neither design nor coloured the bettermean artist must therefore not pretend to arrive at fine colour without consult nature for the greatest grace lie in its variety viz in rosinel yellowness and blueness as well in old as young principally when each colour be rightly apply and naturally represent but this variety can not be see in the academyfigure by night but in the dayfigure at the draw school now for the docible artist s sake shall in the next chapter treat of such colour as have make use of in the dead colour second colour and finishing not with design to confine he to those but to open door to further enquirie for oné country use these another other colour and yet both good if they at last answer the same purpose some again may have be taugnt other colour but submit all to practice and they own judgment chap xi of the colour and they use with respect to bath the sex fair and tender woman be deadcoloured with white and brown red in the second colour with white and little vermilion for young man the same except that we also mix little light oker with itin soldier brown red and little white in the dead colour second colour as the other for fallow or sunburnt peasant white brown red and umber for the dead colour light oker and white for the second for sick person white little vermilion or brown red in the dead colour light oker and white for the second yet but little ruddy the figure be bring thus far retouch or finisn they in this manner brush thinly over you figure some vernish mix with little light oker then clap on you main light scumble they softly and gently into this wet ground as far as be necessary for child mix under the vernisn little vermilion some light oker for man and somewhat less light oker for woman but chiesly observe that the bluissi tenderness must not be mix or lay on in the two first colourings but on finish be scumble in with the main light and melt into the wet ground of vernisn not with grey or blue mix with white but with pure and thicktemper smalt or ultramarine only touch with fitchpencil as have already intimate thus also the reflexion be to be manage whether they be strong or appa¬ rent or of what colour soever they be of which more in its place the tint of the naked be but three namely the light the mezzo or second tint and the broad shade but except the ruddiness which be also divide into three degree or part the three former tint ought to be make and proceed out of one colour in shade as well as light but reckon not among they either the greatest shade or main light use in retouch the colour of dead body could by this interposition have no place after those other in such figure use brown oker and white in the deadcolour which be thinly glaze with lake more or less accord to the age and condi¬ tion of the person it represent thereon paint with light oker and white for the second colour in which have due regard to finger toe and other sinall part both of body and face which ought to be grey and violet as in live toture those part appear rosy and blush if any afk why expresly asfign light oker vermilion or brown red to this or that body and be not content with recommend red and white or yellow and white he must know that there be vast difference between red and red for instance take vermilion and white and brown red and white and observe how much the two mixture differ in force and beauty thus it be also with the yellow which make great difference in the colour of the three nakeds aforesaid and also in they tint but do not absolutely confine myself to those colour name they only as my opinion touch they and that may be the better understand in what say about they have the artist mind in the second colour to put in the tender tint à let he do it but they will on view the painting at some distance appear like spot he will also find more work and trouble because the colour lie too thick whereby he be convinced and oblige to work it over again another tine before end this chapter must propose one familiar question frequently start why many disciple give into worse manner than that of they manster which resolve thus they bad manner be the joint fault both of master and disciple the masterchiefly in be sometimes negligent in he instruction for though he understand the grounds he do not teach they he pupil the greatest care he take be to put they on copy all sort of piece as well of old as later master each handle in particular manner sometimes quite different from he own the disciple on the other side be content with superficial likeness viz this part as red that as yellow blue or green as the original which they themselves must find out by temper and retemper thence it follow that in one part or other they generally fall into extravagancy after they have leave they master be they mastera hard manner theirs will be harder be he rough they will be rougher he warm and glow they fiery do he colour slaring they will exceed he be he manner to paint young and old woman alike they will paint both woman and man young and old after one manner and make they wife or maidservant they only model as for painting worse this lie at the disciple s door through propensity to some particular part without regard the whole one affect drapery another likes nudity another delight in byework but such must not take it amiss if compare they to thistle which where they fall stick but master who seek honour and esteem must not only be acquainted with what have now deliver but many more thing if he will be value for history the universal painting ch ap xii of agreeable and beautiful colour ince piece cleanly and beautifully coloured must need be very pleasing as well to the ignorant as the know and the contrary one be displeasing we shall treat of it as matter of great importance but many miss the mark herein some knowingly other against they will say knowingh in take fancy to this or that manner whether good or bad and against they will when they be past recovery and custom be become habitual sometimes it also happen through carelessnefs and fear of do worse these it be true give good ear but neglect right method as pure light cause object to appear clean and beautiful so it must need be that the more it be break and sully by darkness the object will also become darker and less beautiful many great master have in this very particular be much mistaken as among the flemisn ruben and in holland rembrandt lieven and many other of they follower the one in endeavour to paint too beautiful be fall into flar manner and the other to obtain softnef get into rottenripe manner two extream which like two dangerous rock ought to be avoid but prudence observe mean in every thing and skillful master will make judicious use of the colour in general whether in nudity drapery landscape stonework or what else have often wonder how some bave torment themselves in the different colour of man and woman painting he warm and fiery she tender and fair without reflect whether such colour be proper to they condition or not nay without make any distinction between deity and man the nobleman and elow which think very filly now whether they intentionally do it to shew how masterly they can match such colour or whether they be fond of such extravagancy or bid defiance to those who colour the nakeds of man woman and child with littie or no difference will not determine but must at least observe that though good colour in general be very commendable yet what we most shew we judgment in be the give every object its proper colour accord to its nature and quality for the difference among object on the fore ground onght to bemuch greater than those of the second or third grounds because the distance or medium of air between unite every thing less or more as well colour as object the end of the first book the art of painting book of ordonnance or composition chap of the quality necessary to the first idea or sketch in order to give the curious artist previous notion of every thing think necessary to the main matter to the end he may duly weigh he qualification for it say that he ought in the first place to ave good memory to consider well what he be to represent and to retain it in he thought and next free and nimble hand to execute instantly on paper what he do conceive lest it slip out of memory again buf these quality will be of little service unless he observe order in he pro ceeding the more important the composition the lef delay because bright thought sometimes come unaware and be as suddenly lose and though perhaps it may be retrieve yet with meaner circumstance than at first in fine as we take more or less pain about the matter so the loss will be the greater especially to those of weak memory to whom we may apply this emblem man em¬ brace the smoke of burn pile of wood with both arm with this inscription —he who embrace too much retain nothing how often do we find that when we betake ourselves to think we be by some outward cause interrupt and we project spoil by the confusion of we sense to obviate which it be best to be alone and then have paper pen and ink or crayon and settle the scheme of yope ordonnance as to height and length you must mark out the plan or ground and fix the point of sight whether the design be landscape or for chamber palace grotto or what else after this weigh well you whole design then what sort of person must enter it and who ought to have the first and most visible place which mark instantly and they bigness not in figure but stroke here on the first ground there on the second accord to they character and merit begin with the king or prince and next he retinue or other proper person if there be still another party to be introduce of less moment than these and yet as essential to the ordonnance mark it with point in its proper place without more ado have bring you design thus far you may some time afterwards reassume the thought of it begin with the principal figure and now consider by what passion you figure be move how they ought to stand sit or lie what they be do whether they sly or run and whether before or against the light how they contrast and how they shall be set off against each other sketch all this on another piece of paper and though in so do some circumstance may have be omit yet the consequence can not be great since the lesser like à river flow from the greater without burthen to the memory go to you sketch again at some other time with fresn thought and then connider what character must be naked what cloath what heautiful what common together with the proper colour and it be agreement and order thus the design be bring to bear and this in my opinion be the surest way to help and eale the memory thus much of ordonnance in general proceed we to treat of each part in particular chap ii of ordonnance wonder at nothing more consider how many history can be collect from facr writ that we see so few of they handle and those so lightde different in design for in qoo lately publish most of they be on subject which have be represent before without any attempt on such as have be leave undesigned as if no ordonnance could be make of they it be the same with ovid homer virgil and many other though from they might be gather matter for above three time as many composition the cause of all this find after much pain and inquiry to be ignorance and carelessness those two impotent sister who check the sense and obstruct inquiry a evil to be cure only by diligent exercise we need not doubt but that the ancient painter have pick out the best hi story but it be folly to think they therefore despised all the rest it vyere unhappy if the secret still remain have before all discover for then we might bid adieu to all future endeavour but supposing that the best subject be choose it fall out nevertheless that those which be slighted be oftentime the most painterlike and have the strongest passion and at the same time the most elegant bywoork so that we need not despair of sufficient matter to handle but we see in cattle that they will follow one leader and so it be with some painter who think they have do enough when between they composition and the old one on the same subject the difference lie in figure sit instead of stand the action in the open air instead of be withindoor or by some alteration in the ornament and by work but nobler soul soar higher they do not sit down content with what other have think but strive to excel in thing better and new or at least as good as the other what praiseworthy piece must those be which be build on other man s thoughtsp the original designer tax with ignorance and little sense because they work be see thus correct in action drapery colour and ornament bat let such artist continue to torment themselves as long as they please man of sense will always think meanly of they and give the praise to the first inventor great soul be always ambitiousto share equal honour with happier master for who of the poet would not be equal to homerp of the philosopher to aristotle of the painter to raphael of the statuary to michael angelo great man have do as great thing to acquire name desire of glory have feed the fire of they labour and this have secure they both honour and rich they do not vouchsafe when the day be shut in to spend they time in company but ardently fire they lamp for night improvement and thus they attain the greatest happiness these thing judge preliminary to what follow and therefore we shall proceed to management chap ii of the ordonnance of history vhe management of history will serve for univerfal conduct throughout this whole work for no one can be say to be good master without perfect knowledge of it ft be so general that it affect every branch of the art as the group of figure place of colour choice of light and shade laying grounds nay even the disposition of each fingle figure but shall nevertheless be brief and so proceed when now you have choose you subject whether in history fiction or emblem make rough sketch of it and so imperfectly as only to understand you own mark and stroke then read with attention the best and exactest writer of the story in order to conceive it well and fix it in you memory mark immediately what you have read on you next return to this sketch you must principally consider in whaf country in zohat season and what time of the day the action happen and whethe within or without door whether in stately place or common one and lastly the quality and dignity of the person concerned thus much for circumstance now mind exactly the essence of the story and then the aceident proper to it the event of the story must always fill up the chief place in the composition and the beginning of it to be dispose in the offffip as can nonball shot from distance batter near bulwark and scatter whatever oppose it by this means the drift of the matter will appear at first view note all these thing in you poeketbook that you may remember they and be sure to consult they often for that purpose some day afterwards early in the morning when you head be easy and clear reconsider the whole matter imagine yourself to be the figure which one after anothe you be to exhibit and so proceed to the most inferior next extend you thought to the place where the action happen this will bring you to apprehend the nature of it and you will quickly perceive all you figure in order and the quality of each they diftance and proper place mark this in general with stroke only put each principal person s name to he figure that you you commit no mistake in they or the disposition ssip out of you memory after this you must mind every other particular figure and lastly consider by what pasfion they be all move by this method it be certain that we be far advanced in general but little in particular the design be as yet no more than as if person stand on a emi¬ nence or the top of steeple be view in a open country the preparation of great army he see all neatly divide into troops and regiment here the horse there the foot and there again the general and further off the officer yonder again the carriage for provision and ammunition and so forth now such a one only know the object to be there and the place where but have good order and follow it he can the more easily represent the rest but he must still go further in consider from what side and in what place all be to be see and whether the horizon must be low or high place you principal object as much as possible in the midale on rise ground fix you point of sight determine you light whether it must proceed from the left or the right from behind or before and whether the story require sunshine or common light next dispose the rest of the figure in group some of tæo or three other of four or five more or less as you think proper but of this we shall say more in particular chapter in the mean time to help those who may not presently apprehend this we shall give a example from off the fore ground say then that you must place you principal figure conspicuous and elevate upon the fore ground give they the main light and greatest force of colour in one maf or group the less object must be somewhat lower and they force of light and colour more spread the second ground ought to be in shade or sill with sady object and behind they on the third ground which must be light again dispose the object of smallest consequence observe always that large object be place behind small one and small object behind large one as also strong light against dark shade if vou cannot find it by the snade endeavour to affect it by dark colour as we shall shew more amply in another chapter have get thus far make you sketch anew on another paper wherein design all the medity after the life and the drapery from the layman figure after figure as finish as possible dispose every thing so to the light that neither more or less shade appear than the zhole require forget not to place you figure and layman agreeable to the point of sight in you sketch now consider the motion and passion which to represent naturally shall here shew proper method stand before lookglass make with vour oton body such action and motion as you figure require the passion you must conceive from the history for instance for figure in fright observe how you stand what you be do with the right hand and where the left be how you turn you head what the left leg be do and what the right how you bend you body and so forth sketch all this with they circumstance without heed proportion but the motion of the member only then set you layman to that sketch dispose it so as you shall need it in you ordonnance chuse the moft beauriful side best light arid moft advantageous shade for the purpose if the figure must be clothed clothed cast you drapery as fine as possible accord to its character then design it curioussy on blue or drawpaper but finisn the naked from the life onsy take the same method in other paffion and figure as we shall shew further in the sixth chapter in the mean time begin you general design on the cloth from you last sketch and compleat it after you finish drawing or model as for bywoork and other proper decoration we shall treat of they in another chapter chap iv of the use of fine print academy figure and model in few part of the art be greater abuse commit than in the use of fine print and composure of greater master for many accustom theinselves so much to they as seldom to do any thing which be not borrow from print or other man s drawing be they to compose a history emblem or fable they bring it together piecemeal and by scrap and search they whole store of print drawing and academyfigure take a arm out of one leg out of anothe here face there drapery and out of another body in order to make of the whole a ordonnance but to whom do the honour belong have somebody use a ordonnance of poussin be the design that personor poussinthis be like duckegg hatch by a han and we be puzzle to know to whom the praise be due but it be certain that if the true owner of such borrow goods be each to take he own from such painter fear they genuine offspring would be but small it would even fare with they as with erasmus s cuman af who with the lion s skin look terrible but he ear discover he he be stript of he borrow clothes and severely banter by every one but another mischief attend this method of proceeding be that it make they slight the life nay oftentime forget it whereby and the neglect of rule they never become good designer the necessary use of print consist herein that next to what have be say in the precede chapter and the sketch settle we inform ourselves what great master have think and do on the same subject how they choose they object and with what by work ornament this will improve we thought the next thing we be to observe be the grace of they action face light and fhade and if any thing be for we purpose seck it in the life or if drapery take they from the layman thus we may call the work we own but above all we must make use of academyfigure of we design especially those do in privateno figure must be paint twice in one ordonnance without urgent necessity but the follow ornament whether we own or other we may lawfully use such as tree stone tomb fountain urn statue ruin all sort of architecture and other ornament as much as we please he who go further bigot heself so much to print and other man s thought that he think himself under necessity to express every thing they way but it be certain we aim in view print print be twofold first to soothe and please the eye next to enrich we thought when we be about composition of we own for then they prove of the greatest advantage to tyro in give he not only fine thought but also pleasant and beautiful manner agreeable posture graceful action wellcast drapery and what be above all quickness of think and warmer inclination as be more amply shew in my drawbook chap of probability and what be painterlike in a ordonnance of few or many figure drobability as operate on the mind and imagination by the help of sight ought chiesly to be observe in the partition and representation of history and be next in consideration to the three branch wherein beauty consist of which we have already speak it ought to appear not only in general but in each single object and we must take care to reject every thing repugnant to it in order to it consider what character the subject consist of whether of people of fafhiion or ordinary people or of both mixt let this appear in they carriage shape graceful motion and pleasant colour as be people of education if the figure be rustical let rusticity be visible in they not only in dress but in they behaviour colour and motion and if therein some agreeableness appear let it still savour of rusticity by this means and what follow you thought will appear natural and likely to wit by give more or less beauty to person of condition and more or less simplicity to meaner person one may be fhort another may be tall one squab and corpulent another thin and slender one somewhat crook another of brown or pale complexion one of quick another of slow motion nay in three or four figure there ought to be at least one quite unlike the rest might say that hardly any two ought to be alike among six or eight one at least should be hunchback and though this may seem to contradict what we have before say touch beauty yet it gainsays it not in reference to condition since a hunchback wry shoulder distort hip bigger or less head have as good a agreement with the other member as the most handsomemake if it be afk what would be want if the figure be all wellproportion yet some inferior to other in beauty answer that these last but in some measure partake of the agreeableness of the other and one in less degree than another and as it be truth that great people be subject to deformity of body as well as little one so they deformity be not so visible as in meaner person hence think my opinion not ill grounded that chiefly in resortual composition such as play divine service court of justice and concourse of all fort of people all foris ofshape be to be introduce as crook short tall awry fat and lean and even some lame and crippled as occasion require but but then they must be so dispose that without offence to the eye they do by comparison infenfibly set off other figure near they which be main proof of the likelihood or probability of a history but to make this point the plainer shall shew the difference between one old person and another aad one young person and another each in less or greater degree of beauty and confirm it by example as for the handling of fable and emblem these be not fact but fiction consist mostly of virtue and vice require à quite different inanagement for in represent virtue no blemish must appear and in vice no perfection as to deity who ought to be perfect in every respect we shall as occasion offer write more at largé and treat of they thoroughly in select chapter and in the mean time shew here some different handling of the same thing in person of different condition as in plate x ii example no shew the different grace in take hold of glass the one take it with full fist no take it lower with some manners no be princess holding cup with the tip of she three finger draw warily and agreeably the little singer from it no be lady s woman who fearful of spiling hold the glass handily yet less agreeably than the other no prince hold it handily and cautiously below on the foot example ii here you see again the effect of education between people of condition and more common person very worthy painternotice no shew clownish peasant and how greedy and disorderly he eat out of he porringer he sit and lean with both elbow on the table embrace he disn with both aris lest somebody should take it from he he hold the spoon with he thumb and finger under the porringer he mouth over the dish and he chin advance to meet the spoon he head be sunk in he shoulder and he bend forward with he upper part no sit upright and be better breed hold the porrenger by one ear and the spoon with three finger by the end of the shank he open he mouth but little again appear difference in no represent gentlewoman hold the spoon with the tip of three finger and the hand over the shank in very agreeable manner and in no you see à lady manage spoon with lef grace than the other this pleasing air be admirably observe by the great raphael and correggio and particularly by barocci as we may see in fine print after one of he painting where mary be represent with spoon in she hand take some spoonmeat out of dish hold by a angel in order to give it to the child jesv who half swaddle swaddle stand in she lap this print be in my judgment so adnirable for grace and so natural modest and great that nothing could be better exprest though the two precede example might be sufficient to shew all other handling and the difference of action in particular condition of person we shall nevertheless add third example iii shew how attentive the two peasant land listen the one with a high back advance he chin and stare at the speaker as if he would look through he he hug himself and rest on both leg which with the toe be stradl the knee somewhat bent and the foot turn inwards the other stand streight poise he body mostly on one leg have one hand by he side and with the other take hold of he garb on he breast the other leg little turn be somewhat more forward and he belly somewhat stick out he whole carriage more agreeable than that of the other here again we see reputable gentlewoman of modest gate she carriage lofty and agreeable one hand rest under the breast towards the body the inside ing with attention she with the other hand lift up part of she garment she stand streight she head turn sideways little forward she knee and foot close and one heel turn towards the inward ancle of the other foot now on corn difference educarion make in people s action both she hand rest on she hip she stand on both foot without any sway the upper part of she body bend little forward she breast and chin advance she head somewhat tosf she mouth little gape but she hip fwell not in such observation as these consist the very nature and grace of composition be it of many or few figure in reference to person and therefore can not too much enforce the enquiry into so important point speak here of grand manjestic and moft agreeable action for the contrary be naturally and daily to be find in we and though many would be better think of yet they shew the contrary by daily conversation with mean people whereby they slip the opportunity of getting better idea of genteel carriage content themselves with shoot at rundom only however they excuse themselves by say that they have no opportunity of get into sine company weak shield to defend they slothl do not the church the playhouse and the park give they handle enough to see fine people and to observe how they behave as for I before have the happiness to which we may sometimes arrive by the smile of friend miss no opportunity of make observation and noting they in my pocketbook which a history painter ought always to have about he wherever he go and with good reason for thought be often so volatile and slippery as to be retain with difficulty as have before intimate in the first chapter about ordonnance nay when see a handsome gentlewoman walk in the street imade it my business to enquire into the reason of she grace and in what it consist and why she appear more agreeable than other and on the contrary why ofher be less agreeable by such research as these we come to the knowledge of what be handsome and ugly as well by the one fort of people as the other but best by study what be most sublime and grand let I then persuade the artist to this method not as think it the only true one or to dissuade he from any other but as a inlet to so useful knowledge and by which we obtain the finest thing which as have say when once lose may perhaps never be retrieve many mistake who think that magnificent garb and rich ornament as jewel pearl gold and silver stuff be infallible mark of the greatness and power of people but can the most discerning certainly conclude they to be such by these token without enquire whether they education be equal to they grandeur à even then also they may be deceive since some mean people have naturally or by imitation such a air and carriage that be they dress answerable they would be take for great one the reason of which be that at firff sight there appear little difference between false jewel and true though on nice enquiry may be find as in the jewel so in they action and behaviour such difference as point out they true character again if these different condition depend only on rich cloath nothing would be more easy to painter than this difficult part of art since at that rate there could be no fashion or broomstick might become lady s hood neverthelefs there have be and still be painter enough infect with this opinion and follow it as law think that david solomon and ahasuerus would not be know for king do not they croun shew it these forsooth they must always have wherever they be and as well in the bed chamber as on the throne and the sceptre as well at the table as at the head of a army say nothing yet touch they royal robe he who duly weigh what have be say must allow that state and carriage be two such excellent qualification that picture can not be say to be good without they nay think they the very soul of good picture but as noble soul in wellshape body without the addition of ornament visibly shew itself so of course such be needless in express true greatness indeed when ornamenis be introduce with judgment and caution tney add to the splendor of picture but nothing to character nor can cause any paffion as we see in raphael poussin dominichino and barocci who far from approve it have by the very simplicity of they figure snewn the extraordinary greatness have be speak of if any object that raphael himself have not observe this conduct in he story of bathstieba where he represent david in window with crown on he head or where abraham court he sarah in sunshiny weather which afar off be see by abimelech lean on bullustrade as for the first composition must say if may speak my mind that do not overlike it or indeed apprehend it but rather believe it to have fare as some faulty thing do with I which be do in my apprenticeship be still under some concern for but by the intro duction of the sunshine he thought may possibly be finer than they appear at first view because have not the sun shone on that amorous couple abimelech couldnot at he distance from they have see they courtship and if he have represent present they in any other cornef of the room than that where they be they could not have be sit however since great master have they fail it be probable that raphael s bibleprint be sooner or later either design or paint by he best disciple viz julio romano gio francesco penni or pierino del vaga from he sketch and afterwards retouch by himself since it be impossible that one master could dispatch so much work in so short time though he have quick pencil besides he custom be to keep he work long by he for the sake of improvement and to give the last hand and the utmost perfection to they but as for this bible if it be observe with attention there will be find great difference between one ordonnance and another though in some the greatness and likelihood be well preserve but to conclude the matter of this chapter must say that my precept ought not only to be observe in a ordonnance of many but of few figure also since it be very difficult to bring they all into one story but if the subject be coartly as of solomon ahasuera or suchlike it must be know that the person to whom majesty and grace be most proper ought to exceed in it viz the king among he oourtier the queen among she lady governour among citizen and thus the greater above the less accord to he quality office or dignity this cause propêr distinction of superiority and exalt the prime person above the rest even peasant who be à little conversant with the town and know somewhat of good manners be observe to surpass other worsecarriage than they in they discourse holidaymirth and churchceremony but clownisnness must appear in they though with respect to the paffion some may appear to excel other except that if burgomaster or top citizen be mingle amongst they he must appear superior to they all by he handsome carriage and citybehaviour chap vi of the difference between youth and age in both sex the artist ought not only to mind nicely the action but also the difference of the person who be to compose he ordonnance and he must have great regard both to iniversal and particular difference as well in the sex as they age chifd alter commonly every three year andtill they be six year of age have always short neck and round finger the difference between boy and girl be visible in they outward part without open they leg as testa do in the small member the difference be not very visible though girl be somewhat thinner have smaller ear and longer head they arm be likewise more round next and above the wrist and they thigh thicker than those of boy but the upper part of boy arm be thinner and smaller those of francesco quesnoy be incomparably fine to paint after nay nobody have attain he perfection we see he often represent either without hair or but very little whether he think it more beautiful or it be he choice in make model can not determine yet methink boy may very well sometimes be allow hair and that frequently curl girl may have theirs twist and wound on they head with sly lock serve not only for ornament but distinction of sex boy of five or six year old may have hair finely curl girl more thick and display another difference in the sex may be this that girl hair be more soft and long boy more curl and short child of five six or more year old ought seldom to be represent with close mouth they upper eyelid be generally hide under they swell brow they have commonly quick look young damsel have vigilant and lively look raise forehead nose à little hollow small but almast half open mouth round lip and small chin in which as in the cheek be à small dimple they have no under chin . virgin we see seldom openmouth they eye be more sedate and compose than the other old woman ought to have more set and heavy look and hollow eye they upper eyelid large and loose yet little open the under lid visibly swell nostril somewhat contract mouth close and fall in and when they be very old and without tooth they under lip come over the upper they also have risings under the cheek on each side of the mouth long but little crook nose suit they but in man more crook one be proper people in authority become grave look forehead somewhat raise and large heavy eyelid and those half open they aspect settle and calm they face turn little sideways the nose alike with the forehead and eye mouth shut and double chin it be necessary to take particular notice of the different make and form of person so far as they be describe in history in order to express the better the nature of the matter as alexander and hephestion in the tent of darius wherein hephestion ought be taller than alexander in saul and david the former tall and the latter less and ruddy and thus of any other circumstance of history we should here have bring in some example of physiognomy but as there be lately publish on that subject sine treatise write by mo . le brun and translate by de kaarsgieter we think it not necessary to say any thing about it but refer to the book since it be of service not only to painter statuary and en graver but also to poet historian and other in the observation about take and hold any thing have take notice that infanis be very fickle and harmleis in it and because they member be very feeble and commonly ply any way they act as if half lame they hand be alway squab and therefore most open zoung girl be wanton in they taking and hold as in the manner of goltzius virgin and stay woman be modest and mannerly in they taking and holding as have shew before but aged people have stiffand dry hand for which reason they be most time shut and they can not extend they finger although different accident cause a altération inthe face and posture those alteration be neverthelefs very unlike each gther therefore each ought to be handle in distinct manner chiesly when any particular passion move we to tlris or that action whereby the feature and lineament of the face be double by the say unlikeness suppose for instance that all face be cast in one mould and each govern by particular passion as forrow gladness hatred envy anger madness hence it be certain that they will be very unlike and different as well the action of the body and if now you give each particular make and lincament this will augment they difference this observation be of great use to face and historypainter and the contrary as useful when nature and circumstance induce we to make teoo or three to be like each other in one composition namely company of figure all of one family who therefore may well take after one person in likeness as the son of jacob the horatii and curacii for thus we evince the truth of the story again in handle the fable where the daughter of cecrop open the basket in which be erichtonius here we be oblige to make they face alike to shew that they be sister for otherwise who would know they to be so though represent alike beautiful and it would be afk how the affinity appear seeing it be not enough to say they be sister or that pallas be jupiter s daughter or the longbeard asculapius the son of youngspollo but if you give these three sister one and the same aspect yet to each distinct passion they will then differ very much for instance let the youngest who open the basket with surprize start back as if she be say good god what be thisp the second full of fear run away call out d dear sister save I from this monster and the third be elder and more rlay step back with amazement saywhat this be à monster tiisrproceed three different motion from one aspect or likenefs for though the resemblance be somewhat alter yet the same proportion and feature still remain the case be the same between parent and they child for instance if the the father have crook nose or that of casar the child will in some degree have nose somewhat longisn and rise have the mother long and streight nose the daughter will have the same except that in tender youth it be less or more bend as in old age it be thicker and broader but little different in length as experience shew we see in the twelve head of the roman emperor they natureand inclination well express and agreeable to the history of they life yet doubt whether they all agree with the true aspect of those emperor or whether the cotemporary master who be wellskilled in physiognomy have not thus altered they accord to they nature rather to represent they innate faculty than they outward appearance it be adfnirable to consider how we sense be surprized when all the particular aspect bewell observe accord to the passion wohich they represent methink we there by discover mens inmost secret that this person sing high tunethat low one that one bellow with pain another inwardly laugh the tooth of one chatter with cold another parch with heat and thirst thus small line can let you into whole countenance less or more fatness also much alter face but but for the artist s benefit think proper to shew he way of find out all sort of aspect after certain and easy manner let he take lookglass and draw himself by it in such paffion as he desire as joyful sorrowful spiteful and imagine himself to be the figure he want to represent draw this nicely with red of other chalk on drawpaper observe nicely the knit of the brow look of the eye swell of the cheek contraction of the nostril closeness or openness of the mouth jutt of the upper or under jawbone accord to he position whether streight or bend then let he take plaisterface and make mould from it of lead or other hard matter in order to make afterwards as many impreffion of clay as he please these let he alter to the before mention draw either with he finger or modelling stick as he think proper take away something here and add something there but still preserve the general likeness thus they will serve instead of the life chiefly when the face on which the mould be make come to be like the draw that by the aforesaid alteration the artist can also see how much the feature likewise alter thus all sort of pasfion may be mould with little trouble and the mould use in as many different manners as he please whether they be to be view from below or above or in profile he who be provide with store of such model will find great help from they since we can not be furnish with they froin life itself nor from we own person otherwise than in single and front position in lookglaf as for know how to make they few day and little instruction will teach we as much as be necessary if we can draw well zalf to these the artist add mould for child and woman the set will be thermôre compleatbe we conclude this chapter it be necessary to say something of the disposition of both sex in fketch of capital ordonnance as in concourse of all sort of people at a offering play where we see that those of sex get togethe and youth to youth age to age man to man and woman to woman but young woman out of curiosity be observe to crowd under the people and though notwithstanding they join themselves to they sex yet they be afraid of mishap and therefore for protection s sake often take child in they arm but man of judgment will nevertheless distinguisn these maid from other by they breast headattire or dref though attend with three or four child it be improper to let child of three or four year old run into crowd without mother brother or elder fister to guard or hold they by they hand in place of publick pleading firm and high place should always be assign to woman as against stonework wall and the like because they bashfulness make they timorous and they reputation ought to make they covet rather old mens than young mens company to guard they from the insolence of the mob soldier or other who on such occasioa intrude any where tolraimmage rob or play trick the vulgar commonly press close to the plead place light woman be mostly find in the middle of the croud and people of falnion stand behind chap vii of the property and choice in the motion of the member in order to express the passion previous to the matter of this chapter ishall insist on a observation which in my judgment be worth the artist s notice as be for he advantage as well as he diversion it be in asfign the reason why many make so little progress in they study now imagine it to proceed from they inconstancy and lukewarm affection which tie up they hand unless necessity drive be so lucky as to do it or it fall out they to work they often say be if the business depend on fate not on mathemabetter than expect d tick but it be quite otherwise with those who pusn on with zeal and goodwill and confider earnestly and sedately not accidentally what they be about these be not satisfied with have paint picture well and be as well pay for it but reflect how much they be furthered in the art by it and consider if they be to do the same again what alteration and improvement they could make in it since it be certain that though we improve by practice yet by shorter way we can attain perfect knowledge and in less time too we own fault make also deeper impression on we when discover by ourselves than if observedby other because we naturally hate reproof nothing affect I more than when find my error or more rejoice I than when have correct they which nevertheless do not fully satisfy I for endeavour still to make what be good better about twentyfour year ago have mind to paint in little the story of stratonicapay antiochus visit take abundance of pain in it and it be extremely like some year after a opportunity offer of my do the same thing again but six time larger idid not think it proper to govern myself by my former thought though much approve but diligently consult the best writer on the subject reject the trivial one and then proceed as carefully to finish my work which get I more reputation than the former because execute with more simplicity and less pompous circumstance it represent only king seleuchus stratonica antiochus and the phyfician whereas in the other have introdue train of courtier about they and in fine every thing could think of to make it look pompous and gaudy thus out of single flower we may by care and industry produce doublé one as be the case of another picture of scipio and the young bride which be in the apartment of the state of holland at the hague thispicture be of my first thought but handle the same subject second time this latter as better compose get the preference though do but two year after the other which submit to any one s judgment who compare they now if any one afk the reason of this great difference and in so little time too answer that have perceive my ignorance and error in the first composition double my pain inform myself better make nicer reflection and spared no trouble in order to exceed myself if possible in the second performance this circumstance also attend my first alexander and roxana for that which paint afterwards and be at the late major witzen s house in amsterdam be of thus ithink have sufficiently shew by my own example the great difference between sit down content with what we know and do seek further improvement nothing delight more than to findwhat we seek and to improve daily in order to which ishall give the artist the follow example example plate xiii of mutual or reciprocal love two child be see to exchange light torch which each give with the leave and receive with the right hand there by signifving that what be give with goodwill ought to be receive and requite with thankfulness the right hand denote mutual kindness or help and tuition decency teach that the giver should hold what he give at the upper end and the receiver to take it underneath or in the middle the giver offer it with a arm stretch out contrarily the receiver take it bassifully with he arm close to the body both incline the upper part of they body they head lift up and incline over the side of they gift in friendly manner and mouth open give the torch crosswise to each other they be in all circumstance alike in beauty shape motion and aspect except difference in they mouth with respect to the priority of intreaty the giver hold he torch with three finger the other accept it with full hand now after each have recive he gift they may be suppose to exchange right hand and they shoulder to meet they left ear cross each other that be they head come cross wise over they left shoulder and if you please each kiss the otherleave cheek they right foot advancing come close to each other example ii of voluntary submission here we see coward surrender he sword to another he hold it by the blade close to the hilt the other receive and take it close at the hilt as these action be twofold so be both the paffion the one shew he pusilanimity the other he courage the giver stoops he head very low with eye cast down at the otherfoot he stand on both leg alike bent as if he be faint away the left hand open he be put forth or press thie outside side of the hand against he breast as if he be say thereall have my life be at you merey the other contrarily stand set and upright he foot advancing he left hand on he side and turn hindwards have stern look he mouth shut he under lip and chin stand somewhat out look with scorn somewhat over he shoulder on the giver example iii in plate xiv of liberality this reputable man who in pass by be give a handful of money to poor one hold out he right hand sideways inside downwards beholding the poor man with calm and set look he stand upright and with swell belly be step forward the receiver on the other hand make up to the giver bow he body stretch out both arm as far as possible with he two hand hollow like bowldish look on the gist with joy eye stare open mouth as if he be fay hol example iv of benevolence he who prefent a apple to any one hold it fromunderneath with three finger as friendly intreate press he left hand inside upwards close to he breast he breast and chin advaac he head bend somewhat over onc shoulder the other contrarily receive it with respect take it on the top with four finger advancing the upper part of he body and somewhat bow he head he discover modest gladnef look on the gift in the mean time the other be watch he eye example plate x v.. of the same he who offer he friend fine flower hold it with three finger at the lower end of the stalk the other take it with the thumb and fore finger next the flower withhe head over it in order to smell the giver as have sinelt it draw back he head over one shoulder from it he face lift up eye somewhat shut but onemore than the other he mouth half open he left hand close to he shoulder he hold wide open as in surprise he rest on one leg advancing with the other the receiver contrarily be stand on both leg close with he left hand behind he the giver stand firm the receiver waver examplevi offidelip or friendsfip the person who be present à ring to virgin as take of fidelity or friendship hole it upright with he thumb within it and the stone upwards he advance he body and face and look direct clapping he left hand to he breast the virgin on theother hand stand or sit strait up she breast somewhat heave close to the ring she head somewhat bend and sway to she right shoulder she left arm hang down the hand open receive the ring with three finger of she right hand the giver look not at she eye but she mouth speak with look between hope and fear she with modest and serene countenance look down on the ring rest on one leg she foot close the giver advance with he left leg he knee bend and rest on he right toe these three last example exhibit but halfway since the disposition of they lower part may be easily understand as the gift in all the example be different so the sentiment be often very various as well in give as receive whether it be do in sincerity out of hypocrisy or for the sake of decency the motion in either case differ very little because in they all the party endeavour to act with as much dexterity as possiblé nay sometimes so far that think to impose impose on each other both be frequently deceive in such case we must take appearance for truth and the contrary but such representation would not answer right purpose as have false meaning for instead of dissimulation or decency we should take it for pure love since in all three as say the motion be the same therefore to remove all doubt and uncertainty we must have recourse to emblematic figure which will clear the meaning and point out hypocrisy falshood deceit by proper image beast or hieroglyphic figure which bywork prudent artist ought so to dispose that though inactive or mysterious they may yet answer they purpose for they who be deceive or miss should not perceive the least tittle of it some may think that the deceive as well as deceiver ought to be set off with such emblem but this be superfluous for as both party seem to profesa sinceritv nothing but hypoerisy must be shew ovid tell we that mercury have fteal some oxen and perceive that one batius see it and fearful of be betrayed desire he to keep it secret which batta faithfully promise however in order to try he mercury disguise heself and little after come to he in the shape of the owner of the cattle and afk he whether he could not give tiding of they batius point to the cave wherein they be hide which incense the godly thief so much that reassume he form he beat the traitor and turn he into touchstone nowit be very probable that in the disguise mercury hide he wing cap and foot and caduceus that he might not be know the same we find related of jupiter and calisto when he in the shape of diana deceive she but here the matter would not be know do not some token make it evident that it be jupiter and not diana though he appear like she the case of such picture be the same with theatrical representation where every thing be exhibit as if it really happen the character deceive and belye one another secretly without know it but the spectator perceive all nay they very thought ought plainly to be see and hear chap viii of the ifue or result of thought touch history there be grounds and principle in all art and science whereon we must build and we can not without exactly keep to themi either execute or gain true knowledge of thing so they ought chiesly to be observe in the art of painting and especially in the ordonnance and since the memory can not furnisn out story with all its cireumstance in such due order as regular sketch require we must establisn certain rule in order to supply that defect since though person should be so happy as to have strong memory and brisk conception yet the hand be not so quick at execution no the thought exceed they some thing also must necessarily go befcre other follow which imply and require time could we but draw as faft as think memory would be useless whercas it be certain we can design nothing but the idea which memory first convey to the sense however let no one imagine by what say that master must first sketch what he first think and run through tlie design as thing occur to he thought for conception never observe order and therefore by such irregularity the performance would be abortive as in the follow inftance suppose representation of cain and abel and the fratricide the first thing that offer be cain flying from god s wrath next be abel lie dead next the burntoffer on the altar and lastly the weapon lie by it now the last be furthest in you thought it be first scratch down with you pen then the altar appear aftersward abel then cain and then the almighty and at last the landscape which to determine the bigness of the composition judge now what such confuse method of design must produce it be therefore matter of indifference how you begin design for the principal figure must be first consider and then the iecident asgold be separate frem the earth and clear by refine we ought then to proceed orderly in the design make first the plan next the stonework and then the figure or bywork however we handle this subject in the chapter of ordonnance of history hieroglyphic figure where we maintain that the principal ought to be place first then the figure of less consequence and lastly the bywork .. but what intend now be to shew fhort and certain method of commodi¬ oussy apprehend and retain thing whether they be give in writing or by word of mouth prolix or brief together with they circumstance be they many er few that youmay sxetch they exactiy in all they particular perfectly agreeable to the relation as well iin mation colour dref and probility as bywork of singular use to those of short memory but who be nevertheless skilled in the expressinn of action the paffion and they effect use of colour and drapery accord to sex and age lay of colour against proper grounds difference of country sunshine and ordinary light and more such have consider well of the subject and where the action happen first make plan or groundnext determine where to place the principal figure or object whether inthe middle or on the right or leave side afterwards dispose the circumstantial figure concerned in the matter whether one two or more what else occur must fall in of course after this to each figure join its mark of distinction to shew what it be as whether king philosopher bacchus or rivergod the king must have he minister courtier and guard the philosopher must be attend by learn man or he disciple bacch must have satyr and bacchanal about he the rivergod have he nymph and naiad the king excel by he royal robe croumn and scepter the philosopher be be know by long and grave vestment cap on he head book rolis of vellum and other implement of study about he bacchus be adorn with vinesprig crowned with grape and armed with thyrsis the watergod be set off with urn flag reed and crowned with waterflower all which badge be naturally proper though not describe in the story nay if they be you need not heed they since they character remind we of they when we be handle they as if we be read about the goddess of hunt every one know that she have à retinue and be equipt with accoutrement for sport and that the charming venus be attend with she grace this may suffice for personal character as for motion ake be command philosopher contemplate bacchus ramble and the rivergod in he station when the king command all be in hurry iand metion to execute he will he retinue be obsequious to he word and nod when the philosopher be exercise himself he be either reasoning write or contemplate when bacchus be on he ramble the menade bacchanal and satyr madly attend he chariot shriek and howling and with tabor pipe timbrel cymbal the rivergod in he station either rest on a urn or pot shedding water or be sit among he nymph on the bank of à river thus each character be occupy accord to its nature and so we deduce one circumstance from another without seek it or be at à stand have such fund of matter in we head that onthe bare imention of person we must conclude that such and fuch property tare effential to hethe next businef be the effect of the paffion when the general move the whole army be in motion when the king threaten the accuse be in fear and the minister and other remain in suspence when the philosopher discourse the audience be attentive and each person move in proportion to he apprehenfion or attention one have he finger on he mouth or forehead another be reckon by he finger another scratch he head another lean on he elbow cover he face with he hand when bacchus speak the noise cease when the watergod be take repose every one be husn fitting or lying promiscuousty at ease if these example be not sufficient to establisn my purpose shall add one or two more and the rather because no one before I have handle this subject so methodically nay may say hardly touch on it we read in scripture that queen efther overawed by the frown of king ahasuerus swoon away that belthazzar peroeive the handwriting on the wall be with he whole court troubled in mind again in ovid s metamorphofis ariade in despair on the fhore be comfort and make easy by the acceptable presence of bacchus who offer she he aid from all which and the like circumstance we be enable to conclude with certainty that single paffion handle handle accord to the manner before lay down can alone furnish matter enough to enrich whole ordonnance without the aid of other bywork since many thing and circumstance do proceed from that one passion onsy for let we suppose two person pass by each other as in zlate xvi and one see in front the other in rear he who walk on the left side and be go off have bundle on he right shoulder from which something drop behind hehe have boy and dog with he the other come forward and perceive what fall call to tell he of it whereupon he look back and the boy run to take it up now refer to any one s judgment whether my thought by of simple relation be not presently conceive since it be all the story fancy they be but yet still better if keep within the bound of the relation be to make fketch of it for though the bare description of the thing easily make a impreffion on the sense yet he who be not conversant with the fine motion and beauty of action which consist mostly in the contrast of the member can never hit the writer s mean place then the man call out foreright and the other man past by he look back and hearkening to what he say in these posture both look over the left shoulder now if any one afk whether he who be paff on could not as well turn to the right as the left in look back and the other do the same say no unless we will run counter to nature for suppose that he who be approach have stick in he right hand and with he left point to the cloth which be drop and the other have the bundle on he right shoulder he left hand rest on he side by which also the child hold he now because each otherleft side meet and onc see the cloth drop at he leave he kindnef compel he speedily to call over thé same fhoulder to the other man who plainly hear turn to the side of he who call whereupon they behold each other the boy be nimble run quickly to the cloth and the dog outstrip he in get to it first from all which premife be imply natural motion and turn of the member without we say the upper part of the body front the left or right leg thus or thus—lf we know the place of stand towards whom and what they have to say the rest must follow of course such revery as these give we right judgment of picture make we retain it and help to remove difficulty and ifto this be add some certain stroke to point out either the place or action of figure it would be more easy and helpful to the memory know painter who make each letter or mark have its particular signification for instance anl be figure sit on the ground christ crucifie and so forth moreover he have another secret whereby he express certain figure he make use of as decumbent figure of caracci run one of raphael fly one of berettini do cortona child of quesnoy light and shade of la fage and many other if now the precede example of the two manpass eachother should seem insufficient will subjoin one other of the same nature but fact imean the story of judah and tamar see plate xvii when come from he countrydwelling he be in the way accost by she in the habit of a harlot put the case case thus judah come forward and the road lie on the left side of he house along which some of he servant be go off in order to sheer sheep tamar sit on the right side of the road on the grass airily and wantonly attire and with veil over she head now it be probable that have lewd design she first accost judah who like man of repute past she but when she lift up she veil and beckone to he he stand to hear what she have to say thereupon suppose he stand still rest on one foot and advancing the other to make a halt to see who call he he turn to the leave open he left hand like one in surprize and then clap it to he breast to shew that he be strike there and lastly take hold of he beard as ponder what he be go to do in the mean time she rise and lay hold of he garment the servant be see either in profile or backward as the road turn and wind to the house have scissar or sheer with they the house may lie as the road shew it though accord to ordonnance the middle suit it better than side this be sufficient for understanding the meaning of this story and the right method for handle great work by fhort introduction if any one suppose that if the road be to lie crof the piece and the whole disposition alter so as to make the man go from right to leave and not place the woman on either side it would be all the same since then she would still be on he left side say no for she call he we should then of both theirbodie see but one of they face and what be such paffionless statue good for again we could not shew he principal motion which be very essential to the fact wherefore the other way be best but let no one deceive himself by my manner of relate this history for consult the scripture he will find that have invert the sense to subject shew how to give two person distinct passion and thereby to embellisn picture for by the scripture it will appear that judah be go to the place whence make he come in order to send tamar lamb or goat to redeem he pledge leave it to any one s judgment whether it can not be plainly infer what motion these two figure must have to make thereout three distinct and pro bable reprefentation which thus deduce first in the man s person a unexpected rencounter secondly a enquiry who she be and what she want lastly criminal paffion first he be grave afk and understanding what the matter be or at least imagine it he wisn it may be true then begin to make love at last be fully persuade he give loose to he paffion grow bold and venturesomethese three period produce peculiar paffion in both different from each other the first grave and modest the sccond kind and loving and the third wanton and bold the woman contrarily be move by three paffion first she be friendly and lovely secondly wanton with dissembling stand off lastly they both agree first she accost he with a entice air overcoming he gravity secondly secondly he approach address she in friendly manner but alter she speech she answer he roughly and will not be touch lastly he be transport with passion at which sne secretly laugh sne pushie he coyly from she on one side and lay hold of he on the other from all which premise we may find three position spring only from the word which we suppose must naturally pass between they perhaps some may sayknow nothing of such effect since they never hap but it be certain there be very few who never feel they and even they can sometimes account for they better than other who have know they many know the virtue of medicine and poison without taste they argue with judgment improve the performance otherwise art would be impracticable or at least attainable by few if it consist in inquiry only for who run mad and could afterwards tell how the frenzy seize himp the truth be we can only guess at it but this last story be propose by I for no other reason than to make it plain and evident how the member be move by the impulse of the sense and the intercourse of talk and how by such motion we express we inward thought there be many such occurrence in author chiefly in ovid as jupiter and calisto salmacis and hermaphroditus phabus and leucothae mercurius and aglaura jupiter and semele vertumnus and pomona venus and adonis apollo and daphne befide some other in history as appelle and campaspe alexander and roxana scipio and the young bride tarquinius and lucretia antiochus and stratonica and in scripture david and abigail hagar with the angel christ and magdalen in the garden christ and the samaritan woman at the well mary annunciation the visit ef mary and elizabeth and many other all which ought to be treat in the same manner accord to the nature of what they be do as at each word exchange cvhat motion throughout the body muft follow and what lineament of the face how the carnatien must change either to red or pate more or less fierce and so forth by means we may design any thing and come to perfection the shortest and surest way chap ix remark on some mistake in historical composition will not be amiss as caution to other to censure some mistake of master in historical composition in order to shew of what great consequence it be to represent plainly the true nature and state of thing that we may improve and not meet with rebuke instead of glory man of good sense may freely exercise he thought as he see good but many think they merit much by follow the letter of ftory though at the same time they overlook above half its probability which bequently happen when they be get into esteem and have name but alas what rich man would not be think such what valiant man do cowardly action or wise man commit folly only through wilful carelessness truly it seem unnatural and think that nobody of but moderate sense would strive to excel in this or that art without be tickle with the desire of fame either in he lifetime or after death and although some instance may contradict this vet yet you must observe that be speak here of pare virtue for he who build the remple of diana and he who fire it though instigate by one defire to leave last name behind he have be as different in praise as action from whence infer that no artist can be void of inclination for praise and honour which otherwise he must not expect and if so would blast he credit by a imprudent act raphael in he adam and eve have represent he receive the apple of she and rest on wither stump and that smoothly fever as with a be or see which be double mistake and if do wilfully not to be excuse for how be it likely that tree which have hardly receive life and place so near the tree of life should so soon be wither this must be a oversight like that of cain who kill he brother abel with sharp pickbe and in another piece eve have distaff what improbability and impertinence be this for when eve have spun she flax whence must the weaver come and who make the scissar to cut it but perhaps these be not raphael s riper thought but rather those of he youth wherein the greatest wit sometimes mistake charle vermander thotgh writer poet and good philosopher have mistook as much in he confusion of babel for the tower and scaffold be represent unfinifh in the middle of the piece divine wrath with slame waver over it moreover be see the child of lsrael march off in tribe and here and there distinguished by troops they with they peculiar standard sit or lie all about not like people confound by diverfity of speech and stray confusion but as meet together from all quarter only to form congref for there we see egyptian persian arabian moor asiatic americans european turk nay scoisser all in they modern habit surely we need not afk they whither they be go because the love for we own country prevail above all thing and therefore every man be return to the region whence he take he character manners and habit what this painter s meaning be know not but in my opinion it be true confusion can not omit another piece of rowland savry represent paradise wherein elephant rhinocerose crocodile bear wolf unicorn ostrich eagle which must intirely lay it waste now appeal to any man whether such stance of eat a apple which might as well have be do by a ape squirrel or other small creature which make it look rather like deerpark than garden of pleafure have more people be create than adam and eve the cherubim need not have guard the entrance to keep the savage creature out fince they be already enter but rather to keep they in in order to save the rest of the earth from incommodity have see more such composition but to avoid tediousness shall not mention they here it be sufficient by few example of great master to know how easy it be to commit mistake through ignorance or want of heed in the first of the aforesaid example would shew how it fare with those who amuse themselves more with small part than the whole of story and with a arm or leg which no way concern the matter without be in any pain for force nature or turn the sense of the second example shall fay nothing here since it may be guess what mean by the iron of the pickbe of the third that some man seck five leg on sheep as we say whereby instead of clear they make the matter more obscure and intricate as for the fourth some make no difference between a stalian floor and green field if they can but have a opportunity of shew they wit introduce every thing whether congruous or not as to savrypiece my thought be that all beast be create by god but not in the same manner with man and that each clime produce its proper species of animal which come from thence to adam to give they name becording to they nature which be no sooner do but they return to the country they come from some to the east other to the south accord to they natural inclination to this or that climate so that the garden wherein the spirit of god dwelt be only for adam and he consort in it they live happily and besides they no irrational creature except such as could delight they eye and ear moreover it be my opinion that this garden could not harbour any uncleanness putrefaction or noxious creature wherefore my composition be this these two naked person place as principal in the middle of the piece on small rise close to fine tuft appletree of larger size than ordinary and of soundbody adamsit with eve in he arm who half in he lap direct the apple to he mouth he with he face towards she with stare eye and raise brow look surprized and seem to put the offer away with he hand to the acceptance of which she with lovely and entice air seek to persuade he at the same time with she other hand behind he she be receive another apple which the serpent hang on bough réach out toher behind she be peacock with its tail spread and cat paw she besides fine hound who look back be go away introduce also cock s and hen and other tame creature proper to the region for embellisn the landscape plant there all sort of tree except the cypress to gratify the sight and palate small bird be sly about to please garden on the right side of the piece shew the entrance into the place and on the side two square pillar of green leave beset with melon pumpkin and the like besides long and high green wall run up to the horizon and uniting with the offskip the horizon be level along the green wall be see orange and lemontree intermix with datetree the whole piece be en lighten with a agreeable sunshine to this composition shall add another of the flight of adam and eve be formerly of opinion that when this pair receive they doom and be drive out of paradise and both subject to the same fate the beast must fly with they have learn to know they own nature wherefore intend to make my ordonnance accordingly to wit the two naked and afhamed person die from the fiery sword which threaten they and for embellishment great great confusion of beast each attack the enemy of its kind as the eruel wolf setting on the innocent sheep the sharpsight eagle on the timorous hare and so forth but as by this violence the main action would intirely lose its force and fall into pervert sense desistedtill have better inform myself of the matter especially see no beast stay in the garden but each return to he country think again how can this be like the slight of adam out of eden look more naturally like two condemned malefactor drive into forest to be devour of wild beast which they fear and friglitful look make more proble and therefore afterwards contrive it thus in adamdlight the labour ox accompany he to help he in till the ground the scaly serpent move before turn and wind on she belly by the ox be the longbeard he and wanton shegoat the woolly sheep the crest cock and hen and other such like creature for sustenance as also the faithful dog and paw cat and such other tame animal as be proper in a hieroglyphio sense after these follow noxious creature as rat mouse no sunshine appear but all be gloomy and the wind blow hard whereby the tree shake and they leave drop all be waste and wild as if winter be at hand the rug and dry ground part by the heat make here and there up and down the water in the fens be dry up the frog gape for breath the sun be quite hide the moon or northstar appear such be my thought of this story will end this chapter by sketch third composition of my own for the studious cattle painter benefit be the story of orpheus s death lay the scene in desolate place yet fill with man beast tree hill rock waterfalls and brook full of fish and what can be more proper to the matter all be in disorder ovid relate that this ingenious poet and singer son of apollo and of the muse calliape do with the charm of he harp bewitch this crowd but it last not long for the mad bacchanal enrage because he despised they stew he casting he head and harp into the river hebrus call by the greck marjsias as the poet say now we see the unhappy body of this excellent musician throw from small hill at the foot of tree which move by so sad catastrophe bend it bough with sorrow endeavour to cover the body with its shade next we behold the insulting mad and intoxicate woman girt with skin mock run away after have flupg the head into the river runon one side ayong girl who fling in he harp be likewise drive by the same phrensy behold now guzzler who though so much in liquor as to want support yet must vent she spleen by kick the body and fling drinkingpot at it which make she seem to tumble backward here lie break thyrse potshred bruise grape and vinebranch scatter round the body in great disorder the longlive stag make to the cover the dreadful lion and spot tyger grimly paf each other each creature seek and attack its enenay the hurtful mouse till now sit quietly by the partycoloured cat hang in she mouth mouth the greedy wolf seize the sheep by its throat the faithful han escape the thievisst fox who near fall firtree catch the lascivious dove the hill and rock retire clash against each other whereby they tumble here we see a huge stone there fly tree nay the water itself seem to flow backward the frog and other marshy creature afraid of be devour by the vulture and other bird of prey dive under water but yet the white stork fly with one of they in he bill the cautious hare run from the swift dog stop short whereby the dog go over he and the hare to make she escape take side course the black rave and solitary owl chatter in the tree at one another beholding the murther body which they desire to eat and by it lie the faithful dog howling regardless of any thing else the piece have no agreeable sunshine but the air be stormy and full of drive cloud forebod tempest the principal of the composition be shady and sling off by light lointain which be almost in the middle thus enquire into the genuine state and nature of thing like a huntsman who trace the course of deer find at last he cover not that do it for curiofity s sake as philosopher but because these and no other means can help I and as long as keep this path hope never to err or commit the beforemention fault especially see nothing argue stupidity more than untimely fimplicity whereas critical inquiry be the key of naturetreafure and of she deepest secret be not unlike what the wittv greek have feign of minerva whom they exhibit with abox and key anddispense the science to man becording to they ability ufe formerly to imitate the unthinking in not lessen or augment the sacred story but adhere to the letter of the scripture without more ado and without make any distinction between heavenly and earthly thing between soul and body or in short between something and nothing lknow that as to we eternal happiness nothing be want to compleat it but many thing with respect to art must therefore remain in ignorance or dull simplicity in the scripture they say all be write that be to the purpose but then how come the beast into the garden of eden where get cain a iron pick be and eve distaff or the babylonian they particular dress since no mention be make of such circumstance but when you read that the king go to visit such and such person that dob not imply that he go alone as when vou find that haman be carry to the gallow somebody must attend he besides the execuitioner josaua in slay many thousand do it not alone without the help of he army as for I my opinion be that in true history either sacred or profane no improbable or impossible thing ought to enter into the composition nor any thing leave dubious but that every thing tend to the clear up and better understanding tiem in they full sense and force chap of richness and probability in history by the courage and curiosity of seafare man many remote country nay new world have be discover so in painting when artist spare neither trouble nor pain they will likewise but with less danger discover new world in the art full of variety to please the eye we want not new homer virgil or ovid and they invention the present have leave we material enough to work on for thousand year and that not sufficient for the execution of tenth part of they thought and if we do not mend we pace ten thousand year will be too little the reason be that we content ourselves with patch up old house with new material and vet they be old house if some part decay the worst be repair and the rest rather leave unfinished than the whole improve but leave simile we will use other means though uncustomary to forward we in the art curiosity be repesent with wing to shew its eagerness to attain thing unkrown to she let we not then stop in barely inquire into old thing but enrich they with new thought as a example let we open ovid and seehis fable of deucalion set down in he first book of metamorphosis deucalion be king of thessaly who with he confort pyrrha be the only person remain alive of the human race after the flood these be enjoin by the oracle of the god themis to cast the stone of the earth over they shoulder whereby human race be propagate and the world repeople wellgrounded thought lead the way to many other even so it happen here in this poet s fable lay down as truth nay so agreeable to the truth of the flood and noah s preservation that there be little difference between the truth and the fable for what be in the one be also contain in the other and the circumstance of the flood be the same in both the matter lie now in probable expresfion of the damage which the earth suffer by so total a inundation and to execute it sketchwise as conceive it ordonnanee of deuccalion and pyrrha after the flood suppose these two aged person walk on level ground the man s head cover with corner of he garment and the womanwith veil knot behind with he left hand he hold he garment full of stone she lap be empty cupid conduct

and encompafse with water on the left side in the offfkip represent the ocean fufl of triton and nereide fwim about the mount to this hill fasten a anchor the rope whereof be tie to the boat which be leave by the water remains hang keelupwards these be the principal of my conception as for the lesser circumstany fhall not limit they here fuch as the disperse of the rainy cloud by the east wind reappearance of the cover hill and rock discovery of buiiding domage by the water piece of wreck statue seamonster bone of man and beast ornament and other remains appear here and there out of the mud plashy and infinite other thing remove by the force of the wave from one part of the earth to another and wash from east to west all which leave tothe artist s discretion but now it may be afk why introduce cupid who in naso s description be not mention and give this reason that he be the eldest of the god and accord to heftod bring forth of chaos and the earth by he consequently all thing be produce accord to the poet therefore it be probable that in this second creation he can be spared no less than in the first love be also the principal nay the only paffion which these people preserve to each other after they great misfortue and which they cheriffy by they simplicity and uprightness again though they be aged and near they end yet they be study means to escape death and to render they race immortal and who of the god can contribute more to it than cupid must not japiter himself own he sovereignty therefore though the poet inake mention but of two person yet reason permit nay would have we bring this god into they company especially fince painter have the liberty to add new niatter and more figure for ornamentsake when they be not repugnant to nature and likelihood for which horace give they full commission in he lyrie song on poetry pictoribus atque poëtis quidlibet qudendi semper fuit æqua potestas thus paraphrased by mo . dryden poet and painter free fron servilé gide may trear they subject and they obyect drate add then freely when the writcr be silent one or more figure to you work not to gain mastery or to excel butto make the matter more plain and evident which in fable be very necessary though in history it must be do emblematically only after have entertained you with my conception of this story give I leave to exhibit representation of the same subject handle by another painter not to shew the oddness but the superfluity impropriety and illbestow time and the ignorance of presume pedant especially since contrary argument frequently produce truth and there by shew the validity of rule which be level at absurdity this painter s friend pay he visit he put he piece on the easel and thus entertained they behold gentlemenl here be proof of my judgment and art call neithe the leaen nor the virtuosi to unfold its meaning no a ignorant pea¬ sant can tell it you at once there be the world after the deluge as natural as if it be alive but no wonder for the ark be plainly discover on the top of mount parnassus here you see the wonder of the heaven shut up and the fountain of the earth stop with cork there the sea run high in valley and full of all sort of woodwork as table chair bench paper mill and what not besides some dcad body as well of woman as man one of they have leatherapron another crown on he head and another nightcap this gentleman concern only what be carry away by the water but there on the land lie camel next he silver salver and by it dead nightingale in cage here again you see the grave of mabomet and about it some scatter roll of virginia tobacco and before a that hillock some card and egg shell but have almost forget the cardinalcap which lie there and assure you be paint with carmine as alsp

horse tail behold all the toy blow out of nuremb toyshop scatter here and there there by the old lantern lie drum with its head turn to jelly by the water isay nothing yet of that iron chest in which be keep the record of the imperial chamber of judicature at spire nor of a hundred other thing besides house and monastery nay the vatican itself for all be turn into ruin and rubbisn no living creature be to be see but deucalion and pyrrha and they three son and they wife all do to the life now who will not take this to be flood and believe that all happen in this manner look there myself be sit on thé fore ground on a hillock andmodelling every thing after the life and there be my name and the date have say this he stand much surprised to see they do not extol he fancy and approve it since he think it so well execute for my part think that no one before he ever represent such outoftheway thought many indeed have have now and then err but be make sensible of it they have rectify they mistake whereas this whole composition be but one mistake scripture jumble with fable mose with ovid antiquity with novelty cardinalcap vatican card thing find out thousand year after with antiquity what be all this but chaos of folly methink such a artist be like common chymist who to extract gold fling any thing into the crucible that will melt drudge night and day and waste they substance to find at last in the bottom of the devour crucible nothing but little scum of can not tell what a unknown nothing without colour or weight when good chymist will get the true knowledge of metal and they nature in order to obtain the precious gold by art and labour even so ought painter also to obtain the knowledge of object and they nature time property and use or else the substance of he art will evaporate have often observe that superstuity instead of render thing more forcible and conspicuous have lessen and obscure it and that too large ground thinly fill have no better effect we must therefore avoid this scylla and charibdis as two dangerous rock can not compare such proceedings better than to excessive and melancholy temper or the other from lively and too fertile aone or that some man be superstitious imitator of other man s work as we see daily in one the greatnef of carracci in another the fine colour of titian in this the graceful simplicity of raphael and in that the natural expression of guido this method be indeed what some man be prone to but let we consider the difference between modelling in clay and cut in marble to return to we subject about the flood let we make comparison between they and raphaelin order to form judgment raphael make noah and he family the principal character in he composition we do the same by deucalion and he zoife and the other contrarily exhibit they very dubioussy and too much out of sight in the offskip in raphaelnothing be see of what be lay waste by the water or dead body beast in ours so much be visible that the cause and the effect plainly appear and in the other so great superfluity abound as if the whole world be contain in the single picture in raphaelbe see noahgo forth of the ark in ours deucalion and pyrrha be of the water be scarce perceive wherefore in medio securo that be secure we tread when neither foot be see too high or low but in the golden mean let we therefore ponder and weigh thoroughly what we be about in such a important composition and then proceed to work as quick as possible chap xi of the ordonnance of hierogylphic figure have before say cursorily that a excest of fuch figure often obscure they meaning nay render they unintelligible think it proper to treat of this subject here since they be of such frequent ufe and service not only in handle fable history and emblem but in carving statue and basrelief for great man and they palace caesar ripa s treatise of lconology be questionless a excellent and useful book for all person whose art have any relation to painting but although it treat copiously of hieroglyphic manners paffion zeal virtue vice yet something be still require to the right use of that book accord to the occaston and difference of the subject which by that great writer be not lay down since it be without dispute that each figure must express no other passion than its ocen but when they be use for bywork or ornament to illustrate some principal real character they must then subserve the end for which they be introduce for instance in fight victory should attend the conqueror honour or fame a excellent man love or cupid a amorous man the vindictive revenge the hypocrite falshood the cancrous man envy the innocent innocence and such like omit other as anger madness sorrow modesty boldness authority charity temperance cruelty pain because these have no share in some act nor come into play except they be use alone and without the company of living person as the element against each other virtue against vice and so forth it be therefore of the greatest consequence for painter statuary poet or orator to know these thing thoroughly and keep they in memory which practice will make easy remember that when be under my father s instruction and study design my gusto be for emblem which collect from he and other master work and then make intire composition of they which though trifling because of my youth and inexperience yet surprised many who advise my father to let I pursue that kind of study but whether he think I too young or that rather inclined to history he divert I from it as much as possible especially since it draw other master disciple to see my odd production which he much dislik but when my eldest brother bring I out of ltaly caesar ripa s book aforesaid which hitherto we be stranger to or else be lock up as secret then my flame for emblematic learning break out again by the help of this book produce many and strange design which for they fingularity be account as prodigyor dream by some out of spite against I other through ignorance however my proficiency be such that it yield I a annual profit because the jesuit scholar yearly bespoke of I the embellish of above of they position or thefei with emblem history or fable in watercolour judge now whether these my study tend not to my advantage and improvement and what honour be shew I in prefer I to the employ before my cotemporary and fellowdisciple and what little sxill they must must have in hieroglyphical learn though doubtless then make many mistake but leave digreffion let we return to we subject and illustrate it in the story of dido s death which we fhall handle two different way natural emblematical in the first manner we reprefent the queen in despair and past hope on pilè of wood and after sacrifice stab herself when lris cut off the fatal hair she sister attend the solemnity in tear and lamentation all be in confusion and every one affect with sorrow in greater or less degreethus far virgil in the second manner we shew how despair accompany by rage be drag love to the grave with this inscriptiondido s death and so design it for the frontispiece of monfieur peltragedy on that subject now it be easy to see why in the former manner neither rage nor despair nor love attend the princess and in the latter why neither princess by stander altar nor pile of wood be introduce since in the first manner no aid be want because each figure fufficiently act its own part and shew every thing which its paffion naturally lead it to wherefore it would be redundant nav obscure the story to double all the several motion with the same passion and sense by these figure whence it be that they can have no place but where the subject be purely emblematic and emblematic figure the principal character as in the sccond manner they must come into play because each figure then express its natural quality in order to clear and illustrate the sense of the story without the addition of any body else in this manner apelles contrive he piece on he be accuse by antiphilus wherein he reprefent innocence pursue by rage vice lie and slander and drag by they before a ignorant judge thus many thing be couch under single allegory but when any particular person man or woman and they cha racter shape countenance be burlesqued in this manner then such design may be call pasquil it be without dispute that every man have but one predominant passion at time which move and govern he wherefore prudent generous and valiant man when he be do prudent act may be accompany by generosity and valour but not with prudence because that quality appear in he act again if in a attack he perform valorous action such must appear in he person and pradence and generosity only must accompany he if he shew he generosity as in restore captive without ransom prudence and valour be sufficient to attend he without the addition of generofify the case of famous master be the same for he be possess of several good quality as judgment assiduity quick conception if he be represent employ at he easel those character may all illustrate he except affiduity which shew itself by he motion and posture if philosopher do foolisn thing all other good qualiry should ornament he except folsy because he be commit it such observation as these be worthy of notice and without they a emblem cannor be good this part of the art be very liable to censure but yet few understand it because the fact be always couch under uncommon appearance be secret cret to the vulgar without explanation nevertheless they should be so handle that people of judgment at least may know they meaning and the artist not be reprove remember to have see picture of bacchus and ariadne wherein observe mistake in place sorrow and despair about the princess the latter be see fly from she which in my opinion be right and proper in the master but we dopute be whether the figure of sorrow have any business there he justified it by very plausible reason say that although by the presence of the compafionate god she sorrow be at a end yet it abate not suddenly because she be to give he relation of she disaster and then to wait for favourable aswer and so long forrow must be with she have say he represent she with sorrowful look and tear in she eye point towards the sea at the perfidious theseus the occasion of she forrow bacchus be attentive whose upper garment be open by cupid and because ariadne know not whom she have with she man or god love discover he godhead and make she sensible of he power this picce be in my judgment fine yet think sorroze should have be leave out of the composition because accord to we position no paffion can act in t place at once for though the princeis s countenance sufficiently shewed it yet as be overcome it be take its flight have see more such mistake but it be no wonder for we be not bear wise in the use of hieroglyphic figure for express the passion consider in a especial manner whether those paffion work internally or externally mean whethe the action or motion of the body also shiew sufficiently it predominant paffion fora goodnature sedate man need no auxiliary action to shew he be such because he countenance do it effectually but when we desire to make know love and sorrow which be internal affection of the soul these must be express by means of hieroglyphic figure and yet if the body be disturb and move by those paffion the act passion may be clearly perceive without hieroglyphic notwithstanding the necessity of this knowledge in all who have any relation to painting yet many young statuary imagine that be generally concern in carving single figure only it do not affect they but they mistake for suppose they should be require to set off figure with emblem whether on pedestal or in niche in baf or whole relief in order to blazon the quality and virtue of the person it represent they would be at stand and the rather as we see painter exhibit most of they emblematic figure in stonework in order to make a history clear now the statuary not able to trust in he own strength rely on the painter s aid to design he such and such thought which he set he model and so proceed to work after have fufficiently speak how figure ought by its form to expref the paffion we be lead to say somewhat touch the order or succession of be action for though in story the one oftentime proceed from the other and revert and fall back again yet especial care must be take that they be not express and shew all at the same instant of time but that each wait for its proper turn and season as if gentleman should order he servant tobeat any one three motion arise from hence which can not be perform at once because the order must precede the hearing and performance be the consequence again it be preposterous that prince should stand in command posture at the same time time as he fervant be execute he command it would be as unnatural to frame the story of the uoman catch in adultery in this manner christ be write in the dust while the people be sneak away discontented and afhamed and which be still worse some provide with bafket of stone either wait on the second ground for the issue or depart out of the temple though we saviour parable poussin possess this conduct in high degree as may be see in he picture of this story when general be spirit he army each soldier observe filence and attention while the harangue be make in my juvenile year paint the story of progne where in revenge of she deslour sister philomela sne be shew and casting at tereus the head of he son whose body be almost eat up by he at which pursue she in rage she be metamorphose into bird represent those outrageous woman shew he the sever head at which the king transport with fury rise from he seat with draw sword the table be overturn and the drinking vessel dish and other tablefurniture lie break to piece about the floor and the wine spild at they foot and yet make the woman keep they standing hold the bead to reconsider this story it be natural to think that in the begin the tyrant fat quietly at the table ignorant of what be do afterwards the woman enter the room shew he the child s head cut off attend with speech proper to the occasion which put he first out of countenance and then pierce he heart he furiously arise froin table and overturn it and draw he sword in order to pursue they he push down every thing in he way notwithstanding all which rage and disturbance the woman remain in the same posture and station as when they come in you may easily perceive my oversight and improper handle this story it be true indeed that all the different motion be sudden and quickly successive yet she keep the head too long in she hand to throw it on the table after it be overturn in all likelihood at the end of she speech she must have throw down the head and take to flight as soon as tereus make the least offer for rise and then must follow she nietamorphosis and she be off the ground iiconceive therefore that the table ought ought to have be still stand and sne after the head be throw up into to be fly and to snew she inhumanity with sword or chopknife in one hand and menace with the other but paf on to shew my cooler thought in another example be the fable of apollo and the dragon python this ordonnance exhibit wild prospect on the right side on the second ground in low morass be see the frightful monster python say to be engendered of the vapour and exhalation of the earth lie half in and half out of the plasn lade with arrow

sly towards the hill look back at apollo if it be afk how we shall know this to be apollo answer by he beautiful air and golden lock he lovely aspect and the devoir with which he be view the nymph and by the arrow with which the fly cupid have pierce he besides do not know that ovid s metamorphose afford any such representation of shepherd thus enamour with nymph for it must be observe that apollo

as picture view its full lustre but in all thing there be a use and abuse and so it happen in painting the use lie in handling of noble and edify subject as fine history and emblem moral and spiritual in virtuous and decent manner so as at once to delight and instruct thus the art gain its lustre the abuse appear in treat obscene and vicious subject which disquiet the mind and put modesty to the blush he who follow this method can never expect the reward of virtue which horace say be a immortal name but rather eternal infamy we shall consider the matter in both respects when historian treat a history they seldom paf over any circumstance though ever so indecent nay though it be intirely evil poet do the same in they fiction but in worse degree because flatter tale easily ruffle often missead the mind of reader in fine it be to be wishie that when such liberty be take which should never be without absolute necessity naked truth be either veil or cast into shade in order to prevent unlawful desire but if discourse can thus captivate the heart how much more must the eye be attract by painting since the sight affect the sense in greater degree painting the good man noah wallow obscenely in liquor and would it be less crime than chammock he he do it only to he brother who turn away they face cover they father with they garment in order to hide he nakedness whereas the painter expose he to all the world it be as indecent to shew poripharwife naked on the bed in a unseemly posture inticing joseph though it be private fact and not attend with the worst circumstance nor be michael angelo buonaroti more to be commend in exhibiting he leda stark naked with the swan between she leg circumstance certainly tainly that he might have omit be it not to be lament that since there be such fund of matter forfine design virtue as well as vice whence we may they so barefaced and circumstantially that they want nothing but smell as horace intimate nam frustrâ vitium vitaveris illud si the alio pravum detorseris but leave this unlawful subject as unworthy of a artist let we proceed to shew the token of good picture writing print be more intelligible than the scrawl of a indifferent penman and so it be with picture if the story be well exprest and each object anseer its character with respect to the story time and occafion leave naked or cloath the figure

the effect of desire and luck the latter of prudence think that master resolve best who consider in the course of he study of any branch whether he fortune and wellbe depend on one particular person or on the body of the people whether it be not more advisable to accommodate himself to the occafion and temper of the people than to confine himselfto he particular inclination lastly how he study may be sometimes enrich with variety of new matter he be say prudent artist who weigh these premise betime as quickly put they in execution especially since the world be best pleased with variety and novelty which spur they to love inclination and desire what can subsist without variety lave cook who can dress but one disn and one way to be compare with he who can do several we have many sad

landscape nothing but wilderness and desert if flower nothing but flowerpot if seas nothing but storm and tempest if architecture nothing but grotto and auin it be true that it be more commendable to excel in one branch than to be indifferent in many but as true that variety of food cause new gusto in short make virtue of necessity we be oblige to alter we notion and submit they to season and occafion we shall now proceed to enquire and observe what ready and constant material each artist in he practice have occasion for and whether those be copious enough and lastly what be proper to each branchthe general fund consist first in the variety of paffion and design secondly secondly in pleasing new matter move to love as the proverb say nen sufficit unus wherefore variety and novelty be necessary but mean not that it should appear in every piece we do but now and then occasionally in order to please and retain the curious lastly it must be consider whether there can be find such

deafnef a ear pipe and so forth borrowing from fine painting and from print and drawing these latter be always to be have be in such case no reproach moreover we may without hurt to we honour employ seilful hand if he conform to the subject and sense we be handle it be remarkable that piece paint by two master seldom or never answer the intention of the composer the distinction appear either in force handling or colour but this be no wonder when each of they follow he own gusto and manner without any regard to the other as if the afssistant s share in the work be as great as that of he employer when general find himself too weak for a enterprize he callin some body to assist he but not to command so we painter when we need a assistant intend not to shew what he can do for he own credit but that he should work in conformity to the composer s direction and purpose but we shall confider a affistantqualification and how he ought to accommodate himself he should be skilful in perspective colour and penciling by der spective to give more or lef force with regard to the composer s manner by colour that hebe more or lef beautiful and that in penciling he be agreeable with the otherif the piece be tenderly and naturally handle the bywork must also be keep tender and well finish if the piece have light and bold manner the bywork must have the same so that the whole work get there by general decorum seem to be all of one hand this be so necessary conduct conduct in a affistant that he service can not otherwise be say to be of any use to we nay grant he to be greater master in fame than he employer he ought to take care that he work do not predominate fault which would disserve they both and when this fault be heighten by ignorance or malice the ma¬ jesty and elegance of fine composition be lose and the work subject to the scoff of the curious as have diver time experiment chap xv of the four sort of table or ordonnance what they be have be long in suspence whether might without be tax with presumption offer to publick view my revery about the general table or ordonnance which spring from refine judgment and be of important use to curious artist and poet as well to exercise they pen as pencil but at last presume that the product of my weak ability would not give offence pursue my intention imperfect as they be shall be at least pleased if my endeavour give handle for better inquiry it be agree that fable or ordonnance be representation of some fact either with the pen or pencil poem be fhort and plain account of the most material circumstance shew the true cause from whence the fact proceed three quality be necessary to good poet a exact acquaintance with history and the best author good knowledge in antiquity lastly a easy and delicate poesy to which add a agreeable stile by which after have weigh what material and pasfion be proper he dispose every thing in consecutive order and the most perspicuous manner grace be as necessary in poesy as harmony of colour in painting but though all the aforesaid beautiful quality be well observe yet they can not produce perfect ordonnance without the aid of the rule of painting for sine history of great personage accompany with elegant byornament in delightful country unartfully dispose be so far from perfection that it can not have the utmost grace though it be the life itself much may be say for subject well treat but more for a ordonnance of fkiful master paint accord to the law of art which make even crookedness seem strait ishiall now treat of the nature force and quality of table or ordonnance as necessarv for landscape as historypainter and therein consider they kind they name which of they have double use and which have single suppose four kind viz historical poetic moral and hieroghyphic the first be simple and true fact the second double fiction exhibit fabulous story or mixture of deity and mortal the third have threefold moral teach we duty to god we neighbour and ourselves and the last be fourfold as couch under short and mysterious sense the three before go handle virtue and vice for the benefit of soul and body and shew the happiness and immortality of the one and the corruption of the other in history the poet or painter ought intirely to confine himself to truth without addition or abatement he ornament though borrow from poesy must be so restrain that nothing serve for illustration create improbability for instance not to represent daybreak by the poetic figure of aurora or the night by diana or the sea by neptune which be needless and a error because those thing can be naturally express by colour as daybreak by its appearance of yellow red and blue or by the sunray appear on the horizon the night by its darkness and by the moon and star the sea by its wave and billow rock monster and shell on the shore also the nile by its crocodile or any thing proper to the sea or river the poetic table differ from the historical in this that instead of true story they consider fiction only intermix deity with mortal as we have say and there by signify nothing else but the course of the world through the four element as air earth fire and water and though historically handle yet each be simple figure have mystic meaning either in name or shape and often in both as soylla atlas leda cyclop and many other and thus the fable be both philosophic and moral in one and the same manner prescribe virtue and decry vice as we gather from ovid virgil and other it be necessary therefore in design such a ordonnance to keep intirely to the fable as before be say without any addition of hieroglyphic figure as temperance prudence anger jealousy which be so improper here as hereafter shall be shew that they destroy the very intent of it for there be other which though in different manner will express the same paffion as cupid instead of lovs pallas instead of wisdom and many other as we collect from the poet the moral ordonnance be true fact or history propose only for edification or instruction exhibit either the gallant act or crime of human nature and these explain by some additional emblematic figure which express the paffion by which they be move or misl for instance with alexander we may place ambition next marcus aurelius humanity next augustus piety next scipio afr icanus he moderation in restoring the young captive bride to she spouse and many other as horace in he emblem artfully exhibit in this sort of ordonnance we be no way confine to time the sun s place or the quality of the country for we may intermix summer with winter even all the element may appear the subject may be in the front of the picture in africa and in the offskip at rome or elsewhere even in hell itself another scene may be act so great latitude have moralist but he must take care to avoid supersluity and thing improper to the main action which as in play spoil the beauty of the representation the bieroghphic ordonnance be quite different from the three former in they nature and quality have no other affinity with they than a intention to exale virtue and debase vice by the reward of the one and the punishment of the other they be as well christian as heathen the christian affect the soul and the heathen the body the former demonstrate the immortality of the foul and the latter shew the vicissitude and vanity of the world these table consist in assemble several emblematic figure of different paffion which all together be to express single meaning as piety peace war love and such table be call emblem by they application and emblematic use and by be make up of compound object which have they proper meaning and relation or else derivative from they as the palmtree laurel myrtle cypress or the sun moon and stare or a hourglass dart slame which signify any power virtue or extraordinary effect these table like the precede admit not of the least superfluity to obscure they signification because have neither history nor fable to build on they consist only of single paffion proceeding from the subject which may be at we own choice explain and make intelligible by the other emblematic figure which must not be improperly introduce lest the sense of the whole scene be alter but here we must observe to make dotinction between heathen and christian representation the heathen admit of venus cupid or anteros for love the christian shew charity or woman with child about she and flame on she head the former have hercule for fortitude and the latter st . michael the one take jupiter with he thunder and the other justice the former express piety by woman with a oblationbowl in she hand and near she a altar with crane and the latter chuse cross instead of the bowl but all this be uncertain and not confine to time or climate be well apprize of these thing we obtain the best and surest method for defign any kind of table or ordonnance how abstruse soever nay be you design ever so single it will always afford plentiful matter to furnish out and enrich large and capital compofition as shall shew in the follow table though but in part as leave out the city of

hurt he but thus it happen in the midst of he security he meet he death mor inevita bile faium some perhaps may afk why have choose but single figure for the subject of this ordonnance my reason be to shew those who be skill in landskip method of give they byornament greater lustre and excellence those mean who be so rich in invention of inanimate object that be content with one figure and at most two and those perhaps of little significancy though it must be grant that the name of a excellent wise and celebrate person represent in a artful landscape give the work lustre and the master reputa¬ tion for fkilful landscapepainter certainly deserve honour but double when he shew that he also understand history and poetry many landscapepainter not except some famous ltalian chuse commonly low mean and poor subject and byornament for my part generally lessen my landscape to give room for embellishment in fine if we can not be alike perfect in all thing we may at least through perseverance go great fength for gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed jake cadendo that be by constant drop the stone be hollozthro which greater single force could never do the aforesaid ordonnance be very fine for landfkip and the rather as it handy a uncommon story attend with few circumstance for the whole be but fingle figure through the scene as be beautiful open field would easily admit of three or four consider then excellent professor of this branch what have lay down the trouble will be but small and it be in you power to make it easy to you qui eupit capit emniachap x vi of the use of ovipmetamorphasis and what be further necessary to the sketch and execute table or ordonnance experience tell we that truth lose by repetition and that he who eafily believe be as eafily deceive but the master who make it he bu finess to build on the most certain infallible means in order to obtain he end bid fairest for excellence what poor work be it after have see wellorder defign of another mast adorn with elegant by work and fine colon to be slavish imitator of it by introduce neither more nor less figure nor other drapery and colour what reputation be get by it be it ever so well executed nay if differently dispose and incomparably paint it be certain that something more be neceffarv before we undertake subject prudent general will not rely on the report of one spy nor spare either man money or pain to get right intelligence of the enemy s defign good painter should do the same in order to excel which to do the follow observation be highly necessary we must know how the story we pitch on be describe by the author and consider whether we agree in every eircumstance with he opinion we must consult the comment of the best writer on that subject in order to get the true meaning of the story we must weigh the suit and application of the drapery and they proper colour and byornament how the four element the four complexion and the four hour of the dav with they form ornament and colour ought to be represent thus we may obtain truth and the master will make it appear whether he have go to the bottom of things¬ few painter excel in history especially fable for want of inclination to en quire thoroughly into they subject reading they think be troubiesome and needless since ovid s fable be now in every body s hand copiously handle with three or four line of explanation under they by which they know whether it be venus and adonis vertumnus and pomona zephyrn and flora be not that sufficient say they and do not see that the one be naked and the other drest this man that woman this have dog that bafket of fruit and the dther flowerpot xohy then should not these be my pattern since they come from such great master à readily grant that book of print be of great we to painter but to use they in this manner be willing slavery unlefs we can not read in my youth be so conversant with the least of ovid s fable that on hearing but the name of one of they could repeat the whole circumstance of the story but they meaning and use which fhall be we present enquiry my fothe have never tell Itill long after lead by curiosity reconsider they and with the asfistance of my brother jame who be master of the greek be lead into some of the mysterious meaning which they contain many have superficial knowledge of ovidfable but few understand the drift of they what they gather be mostly from print nothing from the text wherefore wherefore we shall now explain ourselves in two example of the sun and moon attend with all the necessary and circumstance and observation which we have before insist on and first in the fable of apollo and hyacintrus ovid relate that apollo be in love with this youth for he extraordinary shape and beauty and that as they be play at coit together the youth be unhappily strike with one of they which occasion he immediate death the comment say that this youth be also beloved by zephyrus he offer to make he the chief ruler of the most agreeable springflower but he rejecting the offer keep close to the conversation of latona s son in return for which apollo promise to teach he all the virtuous exercife which become he condi¬ tion and like such as shoot with bow the gift of prophecy touch the lyre and fing but principally wrestling with privilege that sit on swan he might behold all the place wherein apollo be most beloved and worship the west wind have make fruitless effort to gain the youth s esteem at length through rage give into despair and plot means to be revenge of he rival wherefore take he opportunity as apollo and the youth be at coit he secretly blow coit so violently at hyacinthus s head that he die on the spot apollo be extremely grieve thereat the earth in compassion turn the young prince s blood into flower in order at least to make he name if not he person immortal the table or ordonnance hyacinthus in he bloom be on the fore ground to the leave and fall backward he back most visible he belly raise and he right leg flung up and somewhat bend the left leg stretch off from the ground contrarily lift up he right arm with the hand open and finger spread he left elbow draw back and the outside of the hand against he right cheek he face trickling with blood be in profile and he head flung back he hair be bright short and curl chaplet of flower falls from he head by he right shouider which with half he back be bare and lower he vestment be girt about he body apollo appear twenty or thirty pace behind he to the right of the point of sight stepping back in great concern he be see in front stoop he breast sway from the light he under part contrast it and he shoulder shrunk he mouth be open he left hand from he and close shut he right arm acrof he body and the hand up at he left ear he left leg stisly flung out he right leg quite bend the foot hindward support he body he be naked and he hair light yellowissi and long fly above he shoulder he be crowned with laurel zephyrus or the westwind whose rage be the cause of the sorrowful accident we represent wing and fly from the youth towards the wood on the left side of the picture he right foot be upwards and he upper part sway to the left part of he head and back be cover with shoot and leave of tree on the left side side of the piece forward be see enzy in shade peep out of the bough and laugh behind apollo we introduce piece of stonework extend almoft from the point of sight to the extremity of the picture and therein two large circular openinings overgrown with mof and wild shrub near he be large tree

the aforesaid large tree where the river eurotas be glide from leave to right on the right side of the piece forward we place large sphinx on broad pedestal whereon lie hyacinthusgarment and against

come from the right and the point of sight be in the middle explanation of the fable hyacinthus who accord to the poet be metamorphose by apollo into flower of that name be true emblem of wisdom for apollo preside over the mus and learning hacinthas be represent to we as youth beloved by he for he beauty have he natural faculty as yet uncorrupted as be child without judgment or discretion yet beauriful exalt he mind in order to contemplate himself whence we learn that when the sense forsake the folly of youth they bring forth the flower of wisdom adorn with virtue whose immortality be by writer sacred to all age further note the use of the bow latona have two child by jupiter apollo and diana both expert archer apollo be esteem the god of prophecy and oracle on ithe gift of prophecy

philosopherthe sun and the moon bring forth the man.by the swan and they easy death be chiefly denote virtuous man who part with they life chearfully in order to meet immortality animadversion on the forego picture with respect to the painter s ordonnance that the agreeable youth be of noble extraction he fine mien and purple garment shew he wisdom and knowledge appear by the sphinx with the instrument lie by it the chaplet of flower shew he amiable quality the garment he wear on this occasion point out he virtue and modesty the cypress near the olivetree give we to understand that all sulunary and sensual pleasure how pompous soever end in misery have do with the sun we shall proceed to handle the moon in the same manner the poet differ in they relation of this fable of diana and endymion but mostly agree in the explanation of it as fhall now shew they say that the moon diana fall in love with the shepherd endynion flung he into a everlast sleep on mount in caria name latonia that she mignt kiss he at pleafure but other report otherwise pausanias intimate that they go further than kiss and that endymion begot daughter on the moon other affirm that she yield to he pleafure on condition he make she present of some white sheep though all be fabulous yet it carry some probability for pausanias conclude that endymion be the first who observe the phase and course of the moon pliny also testify that endymion first observe the motion of the moon and learn she nature and quality which give rise to the fable that she fall in love with he alexander aphrodisius likewise write in he emblem that en dymion have great skill in astronomy and because he sleep by day to fit himself for night observation it be feign that he have carnal knowledge of she and also wonderful dream by which be philosopher he get that knowledge other say that he be poor shepherd as seneca in he tragedy of hyppolitus through king s son and that he dwelt on mountain and in solitary place the better to observe the moon s motion the learn gautruche thus have itthe fable say he testify that dia to fall in love with the shepherd endymion who for too great familiarity with juno be by jupiter condemned to eternal sleep but we hide he in mount in order to soreen he from she confort wraththe truth be that endymion observe nicely the moonmotion and therefore use to paf whole night in solitary place in the contemplation of she which circumstance give rise to the fable let this suffice for the story the part and ordonnance whereof follow table or ordonnance of diana and endymion endymion son of estius king of elis beautiful and wellshape youth be lie lie asleep on he upper garment on near mount on the right side of the picture under he arm be jacob s staff crook near he and at he foot large celeftial sphere and some book and papers whereon appear character and diagram he be profile he upper part somewhat raise and hhe leaus with he left ear little forward on he left hand he right leg be extend and the left thigh and receive strong reflexion from the moon diana little off not in she hunt habit or sit by he and kiss he with the half moon on she head as usually represent naked descend from the cloud with full moon behind she as big as herself and surround with star with the attendance of love or cupid she be in front position bend little forward with she left knee on low cloud she arm wide open as if about to embrace the youth and in she left hand be æ sistrum she aspect be beautiful and gay and full of desire be light by sunset as well as cupid who be descend with she on she right side with he face towards she and hold in he right hand behind he he bow downwards and in he left which come forward a arrow with which he point at the sleeping youth he fly somewhat obliquely with he upper part from she with he leg see hindward through the cloud boy stand on endymion s right side look to the leave at the goddess he left the left side be pull of she garment flap whereof twine about she right thigh which be somewhat foreshorten below this child on the left side where the mount decline sit two child join and blow they torch and behind they appear the offskip be valley with low horizon the sphere book and papers lie to the leave at endymion s foot be with small which part cover he privity be purple that of the goddess skycolour the sun be low proceed from the right explanation ef the fable by endymion we may understand virtuous mind which the heavenly spirit endeavour to caress and kiss through violence of affection the high mount imply that when the soul ascend to heaven the body be seize with heavy slcep or death for since the body hinder perfect union with god it follow that as soon as the soul have disengaged itself it go casily and quietly to heaven diana by she increase and decrease represent the changeableness of thing for the greek poet assert that jupiter see diana go naked and indecently for virgin charge mercury to make she garment and that though he make she several yet none would fit because she shape be always change wherefore « sistram be mufical instrument generally represent in the hand of lsis as we see in medal and other antiquity fore she figure be natural emblem of increase and decrease and of the mutability of worldly thing this figure have also other necessary use with respect to human life as st . ambrose intimate who from the example of the moou whose light be variable always increase or decrease teach that nothing in the world be stable but all thing subject to decay the sistrum in diana s hand the use of which lie in the motion also denote the vissitude of worldly thing and they continual destruction and renovation other think that the sistrum signify the sound which the moon cause in the course of the heaven in such manner as this should all history fable and fiction be examine if the artist aim at reputation think have give the curious satisfaction enough in two example for should go further the subject would not only be tiresome but swell as big as the whole work wherefore for variety we shall pass to chap xvii of rule for the management of small figure in large compass and the contrary tdheregreat difference between the ingenuity of good painter and that of mere designer with respect to ordonnance the former pro ceed by the establish rule of art the latter only aim at what be designerlike the one be master of principle and rule the other be ignorant of both the designer consider only what relate to relief be stranger to the nature and effect of stuff colour and tint and therefore he must find all thing by means of light and shade only but painter have more liberty and advantage because he can besides the shade effect every thing by he colour and tint but the difference be further visible from the set of print daily publish whether in landscape perspectiveview architecture ancient or modern story in all which the designer generally travel the old road of composition and the etcher or engraver as closely follow he but when good painter handle they all the part will be improve and become more excellent as well the invention disposition and harmony as even the motion by which mean person of small ability can not but be better pleased and often for the sake of one or two fine print buy whole set as in oudaenbook of the roman might in which one plate engrave by abraham blotel do by its neatnef and elegance eclipse all the rest and this be the more remarkable because in he medal the figure be shade not with hatch but with thick stroke and touch on the shady side now agreeable to the title of the chapter we shall paf to the necessary management of a ordannance with large figure in small compass it muft be grant that a ordonnance in large extent require more circumstance than smaller although in higher the chief matter lie but in three or four sigure for what in the former come close and sill must in the latter be spread spread in order to fill up large space and to do this artfully we be oblige to introduce other bywork and those though insignificant yet probable and not repugnant to the subject tend to explain the story for instance in land¬ scape to introduce some building fountain pyramid or statue or in a hall or other large apartment hanging alcove bafrelief and such like either for ornament or to make larger group in short any thing that will entertain the eye since small figure in large compass be not of themselves capable of do it wherefore with respect to such the byornament onght to be large in order to creare broad light yet these ornament must not be so monstrous as some have they who in order to swell the composition make pillar bigger than three of the figure can fathom with castlelike capital and frizal figure almost in full proportion nor so outoftheway as those where in landscape be see tree three or four hundred foot high term mere colossus and pyramid higher than any in the world to which add house in the offscape where before people can possibly approach they they must be lose by distance but this be egregious conduct for we should always bring together such part or object as neither lessen the figure or cause any obstruction in the composition mean that large compaf must either look large or else be fill and adorn in moderate manner as we shall shew in two sketch of the mourn venus plate xviii each represent in different manner to demonstrate that in large compass great maf of light be absolutely necessary the story be venus inconsoleable for the death of she dear adonis even the the aid of cpid fail whose bow arrow and extinguished torch nay she beloved garland of rose she trample under foot mar though secretly pleased at the adventure however pratend to sympathize with she in she forrow but in vain for she slights he offer iand push he from she she rest on the tomb of she slover wherein eitherhe body be depofit or accord to the custom of the country he afh be keepin the urn the other bywork be grove of cypress and myrtle from the urn might proceedsprig of the flower which be ascribe to he since it owe its origin to he blood on due comparison of the plate we may discover the disference between the two composition in the uppermost the maf of light be neither so large or spread as in the undermost which prove that in greât and close ordonnance in small compass as the upper such great mam of light be not necessary much lef by work in ordersto encrease it because the figure there principally govern and be large have on that occasion the greatest force as well in the execution as beauty and colour the bywork serve to shew the placc and occafion but not to draw the eye whence icbe easy to seethat what create decorum and elegance in the one appear infignificant and disagrecable in the other speak of the light onl which require alilistinct management in both wherefore since in large compass the byornafient make the greatest part they must consequently cause greater mass of light thereand icontrarily in small compass where the bywork be least the main light ought to take the figure only and to confirm thismustsay that what in the undermost representation please the eye and set off the scomposition even be it as large again be only cause by the light because the bywork be the most abate the light of the figure which have in the upper with the dark tomb more force must create such confufion as to weaken the strength of the principal figure in word the largerthe figure the morestiade ought tobe about they audof consequence the smaller the figure the more light ch ap xviii of the ordonnance of history portrait stilllife in small compass ere we end this book or leave this subject it be proper to confider furether whether it be not more artful to represent story natural and close in small compass than larger which think to prove from the example of raphael caracci dominichino poussin le brun and other excellent mafter moreover daily experience confirm it it be certainly troublesome to be confine to small compass especially to those who affect to load they composition because largenef be very entertaining to the thought the difference between both management be the same as painting as big as the life and in little where we see that in the former lie the most art since we can more easily go from the large to the small than contrary though both be do from the life the case of these two artist be like that of fkilful steersman who capable of wrestling with storm and danger sail unconcernedly in smooth river when meer ferryman would be put to he shift to steer on the ocean he then be happieft who have be always use to large thing since the small spring from they like a inland river which lose its strength the further it go from its spring of which the old master be not insenfible who though much employ in small painting yet lay in for large work be conscious that what require the most trouble and sxill get they greater name and profit the force of large painting beyond small one and its advantage be these the natural representation have better effect for view it near it raise love pity anger or any other passion as if we sympathize with the story it raise the master s fame lastly the work be much esteemit be needlef to mention other arlvantage wherefore shall confirm my opinion by example we read of picture of stratonica that the sailor in storm take it for deity and accordingly worship it and that in juno s temple she standing figure be soi artfully paint that she eye seem to look every way and at any ueholder wherever he place himself appear severe to the criminal and geatle to the innocent the reason of which effect be that the two picture be so highly finisnied and have so natural a human shape that they seem to be rather flesn and blood and to have motion than to be painting this shew what influence large representation have on the sense let we now soe what paffion curigsity raise as in this example suppofe murther corps lie somewhere neax it person weep littie further the seizure of the murtherer murethererand the geople run fome towards he other towards the body now it may be afk whether all these circumstance do not sufficiently shew the fact without other person or greater paffion to whioh answer negatively for we ought to see whether the wounded person be dead or not and in what part wounded next whetherknow the affaffin whether the woman lamenting he be of quality or ordinary and whether she be ralate to the wounded perfon accordingly come nearer think know he be affright behold the wound which appear ghastly to I and be the more affect by tke tear of the troubled woman who ftand at he head look for the murtherer with concern and revenge and see he dragin iron between twoofficer he look pale and he heart forebode the worst in fine every one be variously affect some concerned other indifferent with refpect to the fate of the wouaded or murtherer now if such variety of object occur in fimple accident waat force muft the life have when feen near in such representation especially if naturally exprestp but we need not wonder that so few tread in that old path since they faek case and want the ambition to excel by a exact inquiry into nature once think igot reputation by painting in littie but be afterwards convince that large work orthe life feen near be the sureft way to excellence but envy and strife stop my career what the painter in large in these country merit may be eafily determine since lfew of they ido it masterly through ignorance ofthe true antique or beautiful life by true autique understand perfect antiquity without mixture of modern mode not venus with stay mar in fuit of armour pallas in strawhat which be choice that can never get reputationbecause such mafter have no thorough knowiedge of tlre life nor bring workenough int he ordonnance if heget bold and light pencil that be think sufficient he drawingbe commonly so flight that thuy disgover little more light than what be neeessary for the most relieved part without regard to half tint tender part and soft muscling and fromthese drawing he paint as big as the life whersby he be oblige to supply as hecan all the other requisite which in the life he slightedthus the composition come out lame and what make it worse he aversion to drapery andbeautiful fold which be so graceful in picture and so easily to be have from the life but drap say he be trifle as they fall out letem paf if it be not linnen it may seive for wooll and if for neither it be at least drapery but when on thecontrary view the old master work what vast difference do not discoverl what pain have they spared to handle they subject pro perlytis true they admit not of many circumstance in they composition but what they do be perfectly artful elegant and natural view but caracciwoman by the well raphaelsimon magus dominichinos judith ziba esther and david pouffin s esther and ahasuerus or le brun s beautiful death of st . stephen how wonderful expressive noble natural and close they be order and that with large figure all which plainly prove that painting as big as the life be much preferable to that in little and that he who have make the former he practice can easily perform the latter though he in littlé can not so eafily give into the large large to have finé and natural expreffion in littie be certainly commendable but it be more easy to mark out camp and draw up a army for battle in large plain than in narrow compass spread army be weak but closenef of troops make itstrong wherefore in narrow and illsituate place general must shew he utmost conduct we s usually say that the best writer and poet be short and concise in musick the same perfect harmony lie in four part whether vocal or instrumental it be likewise more artful to conipose piece in few than many division charle du gardin be exceed fine in little and yet he have great inclination to intimate the large manner but he do not succeed mieris the famous painter in little lose all he credit with he patron the duke of tuscany by he portrait in full proportion and so it have happen to other those who practice in lighttle use small puppet for they layman but not puppetdress they academyfigure be draw on white paper uncertainly snade with mezzotint or tenderness and no higher finish than serve they turn other who fancy they know betterand as if they have notion of broad management sharpen the extremitie of they figure and darken little against the light have no need of second tint becairse theysigure shall not round once as be draw at the academy tmet with person who manage in that manner and desire he might be afk because then understand not the language of the country why he do not finisn the figure better since he have time enough for it whose answer be he have no occasion for more finish as painting small thing one two or three foot high at furthest then cause he to be afk that supposing he be to do something larger whether he would not be at loss he answer that he hope he should not as long as he keep to he text which indeed be truth as appear in the consequence for have a opportunity afterwards to paint some figure in full proportion there be no more in they than he draw¬ ing which be he model more instance of this kind be superfluous since itit be hope the better advise will conduct they study rightly in due examination of the life in order to qualify themselves for larger thing this observation touch small and large compass be not only useful in history but also in landscape portraiture flower fruit shipping architecture in fine in all part of painting chap xix of the division of history all thing we should observe order which some proceed in accord to they fancy and other act counter to rule not know that thing be establish thus and thus by a universal consent and why he who think himfelf to do as he please may indeed paint jupiter with foolcap and yellow or green garment and momus in purple drapery and so forth because there be no other punishment for he but he ignorance but welladvise artist make better inquiry that he may justify he work or that the work may speak for for itself let we love virtue say horace for the sake of virtue and shun vice not only for fear of punishment but also for the odium it carry although no one need fear corporal punishment for disorderly management of history yet he be not free from the reproach of ignorance and blunder punishment great enough to generous mind wherefore we should submit to establish order as the conductor of we study the surest way be best and the beaten road nearest if good historiographer in compile story make a orderly division of he materialere he begin to write dispose first the general head and then the particular one afterwards the incident and which of they be principal and how many and which of they happen without and which withindoor moreover consider whether the story throughout be to be handle in all its circumstance in certain number of part or in some principal one only as whether he will contract homer s twentyfour book into twelve virgiltwelve into six or ovidfifteen into seven or eight at pleafure so judicious painter in handle magnificent history should make himself master of the true content and meaning of it as whether the part be few or many if many whether he can not bring they into small compass and if few whether he can not add to they moreover he be to consider which be the principal part and what can be leave out in order to reduce they to such proper number as will answer he purpose always remembr in case he should fall short that he may use any licence that be not against nature and reason even to make two incident out of one when occasion require we be therefore to establish it for general method in handle thorough history divide into three four or five ordonnance more or less that the first picture must always shew the drift state and place of action and the last the conclusion of the whole story large history such as of joseph alexander hercule and other which best become palace saloon apartment and gallery can not be handle in single piece because of the variety of accident they contain which must be continue in several picture whether in tapestry or painting again if the god come in play which frequently happen the ciel be proper for they take care that either the beginning or conclusion of the story be over the chimney as shall more largely shew in the book of cielpainting there be many such long story in homer virgil apuleius tasso even in scripture itself now if we would chuse two incident out of any of they or make two composition and those to be hang together we ought in the first to bepresent the most remarkable part whether it be the ist ad ath or gth becident accord as it happen so that it be fellow may be the last as the end of adenis or he death the fall of phaeton or he grave sardanapalus burn heself aneadeification reincuddisinchantment and in facr story solomonoffer to the idol here it be necessary to be observe that all history have two contrary beginning and conclusion some sorrowful beginning and joyful exit other contrary to which add third which be neither joyful nor sorrowful the story be divide into three accident the first should serve as a introduction to what we intend to treat of in the second should appear the main action and the third should turn in the happy or miserable event for instance we may represend julius caesar enter on the government next he condition or further pro motion lastly he death we can also divide story into four part or stage as the birth rise life and death of vulgar or noble person but five division be the most perfect more be superfluous because any history may be sufficiently represent in five part thus the person s begin in the first he rise in the second he condition in the third he fall in the fourth and he end in the fifth as we shall further illustrate in the chapter of fellow or matching of piece in represent a history the artist be not always confine to the law of write story good historiographer be oblige to go through with all the particular fact from the beginning to the end in successive order painter contrarily have greater liberty of choice since it be indifferent to he whether he fall upon the begin middle or end of story and therefore sometimes begin where he plcase pick out of the story what best suit he intention either what go before now be in action or must be in consequence be oblige to exhibit no more out of the whole than can be see together at one view horace divide the drama into five act the first contain the sense and introduction of the story in the seeond be the sequal or consequence arise from the first in the third the contention or dispute in the fourth be see at distance the issue of the story and in the fifth the catastrophe or conclufion either in forrow or joy but the drama differ from painting in this that the one contain in each act particular time place or action and the other exhibit only momentary action the division of the drama into five act be not without reason from the example of the suncourse which begin with daybreak secondly ascend all the morning thirdly have meridianaltitude fourthly decline in the afternoon lastly set in the evening he who would act sure and orderly should use the follow means which besides the truth of the story will furnish he with plenty of thought the time the place of action the condition of the person conby the time we understand either the past present or to come and therein divifion into night morning noon and evening also into spring summer autumn and winter and into month week day as for the place we must consider whether it be in europe afia africa or america whether in town or country within or without door in stately or vulgar building or mixture of both in the condition of person we meet with great and illustrious one as emperor king prince senator general as also deity and highpriest male and female in the second tire nobility merchant and citizen lastly the common people countryman begger in these order of man we distinguish between great king and less and the same in the other condition and divide they again into old middleaged and young among people in general we find tall middlesize short thick flender well and misshapen healthy and sickly sensible and foolisn all differ as well in they nature and humour as in they countenance and shape we may add in the fourth place the manners of each and the particular custom of nation whether of roman greek perfian armenian german together with they dress confist of various stuff as silk line course or sine woollcloth long or short lastly the knowledge of phyfiognomy perspective geometry architecture anatomy proportion colour harmony reflexion and every thing that occur in the chapter treat of those particular which we shall not here repeat it now remain only to be observe first that there be two sort of picture natural and unnatural secondly what good history be in order to shew they continuance in one painting the natural picture be those in which we exhibit the nature of story or accident by single paffion by single representation of the person on whom the stress lie the unnatural be those wherein the same person be represent more than once and there by two accident mix together which happen at different time as the one by day and the other by night which be contrary to nature and wherein be often use more than one point of sight secondly the most pertinent and intelligible history be such as that of heliodorus describe in the maccabe when he be punish by the angel to which add the highpriest prostrate before the altar intreate the almighty and further the widow and orphan lamentifig and cry all this shew the continuance of the history and may be bring into one piece another may be that of pompey where he be burn all the letter and papers of perpenna in he sight and then order he to be carry to he punishment and many other chap xx of the observable in frontispieceplate oince we have treat of many particular and they requisite it will be proper here to subjoin the disposition of object in frontispieceplate and they observable as be of different nature from other ordonnance and tending in all respects to embellisn the book only like fine gardenwalk where the object whether vase statue tree be place to answer they purpose the figure which denote the subject of the book ought by all means as the principal to appear in the middle of the plate set off by other byornament over head or beneath must be large table or flat face with the book s title thereon either in thick black letter or else doubleline one and the other figure which serve for illustration place of equal height on each side either stand or sit thus much for the fore ground the offscape have little concern in the matter we may dispose where we think proper with low or rise grounds in order thereby to give the uniformity of the subject greater lustre and painterlike decorum the principal visto ought to be in the middle but if two be necessary necessary sor the sake of shew fomething in the offscape they must be on each side and equally large and extensive but we must take especial care that the title be encompass with architecture or rockage or tree or at least remain within the fore ground which we ought to consider as theatrical stage open on one or both side with curtain sometime set it off with colonade frontispiece or else inclose it in moulding or compartment in which case there should always be sounding fame either before or behind let the subject of the book be what it will even the fame alone with the title of the book will look more proper than the figure of the book without the fame it look well to inscribe the title in the pendant of the trumpet when it be in the middle of the plate and in doublestroke letter but if it happen to be on side of the plate it be improper the capital black letter suit the middle and bottom of the plate however when the title must be place high the open letter be best because the other would take the eye too much and weaken the rest of the work thus much in general with respect to particular we must observe that the figure represent the book should always possess the chief place in the middle of the plate and that to be elevate the figure of less consequence somewhat lower and further in and thus with the other each go off accord to its rank action and quality to the offscape and if other additional ornament be necessary they must be contrive here and there in bassrelief but to explain myself shall give plateexample and take for the subject book entitle ar militaria or atreatise of military exercise bellona as the subject of the work sit exalt on a high and large pedestal in the middle of the plate set off with all kind of warlike instrument as usual beneath she on one side stand person in a offensive posture and on the other defensive person these three figure make the whole story the latter be represent as brave citizen with table in he left hand whereon be draw the plan of fortification and under he right arm sheaf of wheât the former appear as vigorous young man with spikehead staff in one hand and spade inthe other and at he foot crow or wallbreaker on one side in the offscape be townwall and on the other some armed man set house on fire behind the former stand vigilancy and behind the the latter subtilty now we may observe that the aforesaid uniformity in the figure accompanying bellona and which help to explain the sense be unavoidable for if one of the hieroglyphic figure next she be sit and the other standing it would cause a absurdity in the ordonnance because those two figure ought to shew a activity or at least to be in readiness to undertake some enterprize wherefore they as well as those behind they must be stand the latter be place there not as capital figure but to aid and subserve the two other and therefore be rather ornamental than necessary they may be leave out as also may the offscape since the subject sufficiently appear without it nevertheless it may be retain when it do not obscure the main design but should rather chuse to contrive it in bassrelief in stonework all frontispieceplate should have the three follow quality to delight the eye to tend to the praise and honour of the author and designer to be advantageous to the seller these observation though little heed yet be very necessary since all thing have reference and tendency to something and though by proper application we must shew they quality as in the three instance aforesaid yct we have liberty to make further addition if not foreign to the main design of the composition say then that if the capital figure be set off by a area palace or other building that ornament must come on the right side of the plate next to the bind of the book and run off to the leave as scantily as the design will permit it would be improper to represent table pedestal and vase or such like half in the piece unless the print have border broad enough to be suppose to hide the other half or it be on third or further ground we also remark that the light fall on the object must be suppose to come from without the book that be it proceed from the left side or opening of the book and shoot to the inside of it in order thereby to create between they mean the print and the book perfect union and sympathy like that of the soul and body suppose the book to be the body and the print the soul which move it to which add in confirmation of my position that the back of the book give rise to the print and leave the reason why dispose the object thus whether light or heavy be because think the contrary very improper and illgrounded as the decorum of it may be see in the frontispieceplate of my draw book design in that manner which shall explain and give proof of in the two follow example example place on the right side of the design fine frontispiece or porch of court or temple with wing come from it on each side and on they some people lean over ballustrade all run to the point of sight which be in the middle of the piece at the entrance stand prince princess or vestal virgin and before he or she on the step man or woman kneel and receive staff or roll of paper fame on high sound towards the leave and on the second ground also on the left side but half without the piece some affright people take they flight on the same side the offscape should appear vistowise like gallery up to the point of sight now the design be light from the leave and only slightly sketch with black chalk or pencil and rub off on another paper the former will face the book and the reverse the contrary example ii in landscape on the right side be massy tomb support by sphinx and set off with other stonework as pedestals and vase the foremost whereof be more than half without the piece and all run to the point of sight as in the forego behind behind it be close ground of cypress and other tree up to the point of fight and beyond it be the offscape from the left side on the second ground may be see in part only some people come forward as priest boy with sacrifice utensil the be bearer and beast for facrifice before the tomb on the plinth should stand small altar forward two or three harpy take they flight and from the tomb cupid fly after they with a arrow in he bow as drive they from thence now reverse this draw also and then observe the decorum it produce although this method of proceeding be found on reason and good grounds yet fear many will take it for chimera on supposition that we pretend to amend something and lay down positive law for what have be several hundred year leave free and unlimitted since book may without the aforesaid observation be good sell well and bear price again if book be good and have but titlepage without frontispieceplate thatenough even plate ever so poorly handle will pass if it but shew what the author treat of but let I afk whether it be not more acceptable to give print great decorum and make it better with little trouble than to beat the old road especially when we can support it by certain rule which will dicover the error of former management some perhaps may say why have not other mention this since the position be so positive but answer that though many thing have be find out something still remain to be discover by the study of curious and inquisitive man we grant that if book be bad the frontispieceplate will not mend it however if the proverb may take place thing well set off be half sell and therefore elegance be very necessary in all thing of the representation of dream apparition unusual thought and fiction at leisure time who can blame studious artist for amusing himself sometimes with sketch odd conception or for painting they think it very commendable and take of greatness of mind and the best method for excel in design it be certain that they who make they art they diversion have double advantage in it because they exercise they judgment with usury in the most abstruse design which the sense s can comprehend let we only consider with respect to the people how acceptable such a artist must be since most man have a itch for novelty as in play which draw the greatest concourse of people the more uncommon they be if any think lay rather to maintain that such artist ought not to be regard and that they should find they pleasure in better thing let I afk in what whether in hearing idle talk read useless book walking the street all which be rather waste time than improvement it be not unknown that raphaele michael angelo and many other famous master do sometime exercise they judgment with outoftheway thought whence infer that they think it no shame but contrarily what good can come of excessive drinking and dip into other thing as if painting no longer concerned we it be certain we can not serve two master at once and as certain that he who study study difficult point and intend to master and practise it must not at the same time for pleasure give into another which be more difficult and of different nature lest he destroy he first point we ought therefore to accustom ourselves to thing which neither overcharge the sense nor too much burthen the memory in we pastime young artist who at he leisure endeavour to qualify himself for fine composition must especially shun excessive drinking hearkening to old woman s tale enquire after news read trifling book of story and romance principally account of murther and sad accident intiding too much affect the mind and series of trouble put we beside weselve reading of murther seize the heart and make we unfit for study curiosity instead of be satisfied be so craving that when we design something sedate it can hardly find place in we thought and the study of musick or to explain what say touch the design of uncommon thought at leisure shall give three or four example each of different nature but must first inquire why painter will not give themselves the trouble to design unusual or barbarous history such as the indian japan or chinese and find that it be because no author have write any thing about they worth sketch those nation affording no other scene than cruelty murther tyranny and such like disagreeable object which would rather offend than delight moreover that the oddness of they dress manners and custom do not at all quadrate with the grace and beauty of the antique it be certain that the principal business of a historypainter be to express the story with proper and lively paffion that he intention may appear plain and satisfactory to the curious and yet this would be no more than the read it in the author if the grace of the figure be not also to becompany it what disgust in fine play more than ordinary action bad dress and contemptible stage if fine voice be agreeable to the ear how charming must it be when the eye see it comé from beautiful woman beauty cause love but deformity aversion it be therefore no wonder that we have no relisn for such odd subject fince european be too conversant with real beauty to be pleased with such shadow and ghost yet notwithstanding what be say of the figure and history think it not unworthy of landscapepaintersometimes to exhibit such uncommon landscape because the oddness of the grounds tree and building find in they be pleasing to most people especially those who be con¬ versant with they history and indeed this novelty of prospect be no way so repugnant to art or nature as the people and they manners in spoiling the shape which god and nature give they if it be say that such landscape be improper without figure of the same country it must be grant nevertheless as the byornament of landscape be usually the least regard think it not disagreeable to exhibit here and there some of those creature in order to shew the nature of the country judicious artist may dispose they as he think best for the good of the whole picture and the pleasure of the eye and because those country be well know to european he can introduce they there and intermix with they traveller from other country as persian roman greek who may add to its improvement as we introduce white into the black country and black into greece but perhaps another difficulty may be start against such landscape namely that they can not be handle so natural and true as where we can have the life before we which indeed be probable however it must be grant that the author treat of those part be so many and so particular that man of judgment may gather sufficient instruction from they the temperature of the air fruitfulnef of the soil shape of the tree and other green and they nature and colour be plainly set down and if the green happen to be little lighter or darker or the ground more yellow or russet who will go about to disprove it if artfully manage for my part should make no scruple to paint such piece fince painter ought to ssip no opportunity of get praise and wish to have do it accord to my present idea of it lf we omit do many thing for want of proper knowledge of they what can not the pencil of judicious master do if he will but set about it yet some man will not go out of they old road as be the case of fellowpupil with I under my father who on my afk he why he paint not other subject as well as bible story answer that he have no occasion to scek after other since the bible yield more than he could do in he whole life which indeed be no wonder fince he paint one story ten time if it pleased he but we shall now come to the representation we promise remorse of conscience occasion by a apparitien see plate xix after sextus tarquinius have ravishied lucretia the unhappy lady who have stab herself in revenge of she violate chastity appear to he as he be lie in bed shew she breast gor with blood at which he be so terrify that he know not where to hide the figure which accompany she holding dagger with cypressleave about its head and waste represent despair as the broken pair of compass stick in its girdle plainly shew now perhaps it may be afk because lucretia be opening she wonnd whether the dagger should not become she which grant as have commit the fact through the otherinstigation it be certain that there be no need of byhelp as we shall prove in its place in the bassrelief of aseleagar when the mischief be do by we hand but here the case be very different for meleager be there die and the revenge not yet execute whereas here the revenge be already have because she be produce she wound and therefore the greatest effect of despair be over and she shew he the bloody dagger by means of despair which figure would indeed be superfluous where she not suppose to be say this steel do it for if sne be in desperate posture with the dagger in she hand the figure of despair would be unintelligible and therefore superfluous again it would be absurd to make she stab herself at he bedfide since no spectre of any person can appear before separatiou from the body wherefore she shew herself to the debauchee as the cause of she untimely death in order to bring he to remorse and for that reason despair be represent inhaec invicta manet triumph manner as if say megara by the bedside with she head beset with serpent scourg he with smoaky pitchy torch intimate not only remorse or reproof but all other inward trouble grief rage horror disquiet the lamp on the table and in princely apartment may perhaps seem odd nevertheless think it have fine effect on the foremost figure and also help to make the tablefurniture conspicuous without hinder the other light do still more good as be lamp and have burnt long time without snuff and therefore casting gloomy russet light when that of the spectre be bituminous burn white and blueish as for the small compass of the ordonnance some would have fill room three time as large with those figure and even represent a hall adorn with picture bassrelief table stand for candlestick and withindoor visto a ltalian compart floor and many other thing representation of vanity accord to the saying man s life be dream alexander repose on bed the follow spectre appear to paf by he first time with he hourglass next ambition hold torch next valour follow by asia africa and america in iron then follow rich and pleafure and then honour and glory the former with pyramid and the latter with coelestial sphere naked man bring up the rear have deject look and hug alexander ging himself who in pass the bed accost the prince thus behold I reflect on what be and what now be the whole world be at my doposal my valour purchase I the highest honour and glory rich and pleasure be at my command but nos in nakednef paj by as à shiade —sic transit gloria mundi this cavalcade exhibit in a hall richly furnish represent the figure in wave motion and skim over the floor foot high on thin cloud cross the picture to descent of two or three step on the left side and thence on the same side up to back door on the left side of the point of sight where they disappear the bed little raise stand backward in the middle of the piece the aforesaid shade be vapourisn but not sharp forward on the left side place on pedestal the figure of sit aezander with thunder in he hand globe in he lap and a eagle by he side and behind the pedestal stand two centinal in earnest discourse insensible of what be do let it not be think because make the three part of the world fetter that alezander by he valour subdue they for accord to the testimony of some writer he do not conquer all asia nevertheless that he ambition make he hope to do it be not improbable since he cause himself to be worship as second jupiter ammon as he himself have give we to understand by these wordalterius jovis altera tela question not but that if such shady ghostlike manner be well execute it will appear very uncommon though do not lay it down as fact happen to alexander but give it as my own invention have have say that the shade or appearance walk as on cloud by which mean thin vapour serve they for ground and give faint shade to the hallfloor yet the vapour and groundshade be of no other use than to express thing in supernatural way and to make distinction between real and imaginary people have see such think paint by jordaanwhere man be dream in he bed and before he stand naked woman appear as real one who one would think be go to bed to he have not the artist paint there some cloud as if she be stand in door of cloud whence be lead to think she might be spectre but then not have ghastly appearance think she have too great communication with the rest of the picture she be see from behind and very beautifully coloured and other therefore conclude that this woman be only model to which the other particular be add in order to patch up picture and sill the cloth but to return to we ordonnance my thought be that alexander must not be represent naked on the bed but in princely attire for otherwise the door must not stand open and be not confine to the chamberlight because of the shade or spectre wherefore in reference to that have two point in view first to keep the light beautiful as sunshine or secondly which be better and more ghastly to keep it somewhat gloomy in order to express naturally the vapouriness and by it the vanity of human condition a odd fable the fablewright tell we that in the beginning of time difference arise between apollo and diana both in they youth who should produce the finest animal wherewith to furnisn the world jupiter as chief ruler in heaven for pastime allow it and give they power to do it after many challenge and dopute it be finally agree that apollo in the presence of all the god should make the first essay and accordingly to general admiration he produce large lion diana sensible of it and see the god take up with the sight of so strange creature and fearful that she should not produce the like bring forth cat creature not unlike the lion but as much inferior in strength and shape as the moon be to the sun whilst the god belaugh at this apollo be so nettle at the presumption of diana in think herself he match that he instantly bring forth mouse to shew in scornful way that the cat be not comparable with the lion whereupon diana summon all she wit and power to bring out monkey which creature like the former be find to be very ridiculous and she endeavour judge fruitless by the god sne be so provoke as to create a eternal enmity between the lion and the monkey and the cat and the mouse apollo as youth of about fourteen year of age stand à little to the left of the point of sight hold in he right hand scepter which rest against he hip hie stand in daring posture on one leg have fierce look and on he right side little from he sit large lion overagainst apollo little forward

several piece for hall gallery we have several time assert that strict probability ought to be one of the principal care of judicious master in he compofition without deviation on any pretence whatever be the choice figure landscape architecture or any thing else becaufe as the proverb say truth though obscure for season must appear at last now to obtain this likelihood or probability besides the requisite which we have in they place already lay down it will not be amiss to observe that the principal personage retain they own form character and colour from the beginning to the end of the work by the form we be to understand the proportion of they body by the character the feature which alter from time to time with they year from youth to maturity from thence to middle age and thence to old age by the colour we mean the fair rosy pale or brown bestde long or short dark russet light or black hair long or frizl beard in fine such a one must must be knouyn to be the fame person through all the composition without any alteration the same conduct must be observe with respect to the attendant or retinue especially black man and woman who if they have any part in the stately attendance in the first composition must maintain that post to the last because being slave they be seldom exchange and by they presence they master be better know especially when they have be observe to attend they several time it be not improper to make mention of black both man and woman since they be see in the retinue of most people of power in all nation the one more the other less and drest in particular garb by way of distinction like great menslivery it be necessary avoid mistake to know how many olympiad the whole work take in and exactly to enquire into the different year in which the first second third and fourth story end in order to assign each character its certain age bat for accident which indeed so alter people that they get out of knowledge as in the thin and slender become thick and fat and in the brifk and sprightly become dull and heavy and the contrary and yet those accident leave the feature whence likeness proceed in they perfection but here perhaps it may be afk if we follow this observation punctually whether the likness would not be so lessen as to be quite lose in old age to which which agree so far as respects the colour and fleshiness the one in greater the other in less degree yet the character with all its know feature be what maintain likeness be man ever so old wherefore it be necessary to make that appear in the person from time to time alexander be very young when he waged war with the perfian and at the end of he conquest die in the flower of nis age of darius and casar we ought to observe the same though differ in year from alexander christ at the age of twelve teach the scribe and pharise in the temple when full grow he do he miracle and be finally accuse condemned and put to death at about thirty lastly we ought to observe that the life and atchievement sometimes follow in long fery of year and successively as in the story of romulus julius caesar scipio alexander and many other and in scripture christ john of some of which we have largely treat in we book of table and emblem which we shall publish in due season we leave it now to any one s judgment to consider how necessary the aforesaid observation be in the continuance of a history wherein we must also take care that the horizon through the whole work be of one height and level with the eye of the be¬ holder as we have several time say in its place the same conduct as we have recommend for figure respects also all immoveable object belong to the story for instance if the general subject require that palace or house must come in more than once it be necessary that it always keep it first form and station only alter the point of sight as we would have it see either in front or rear or in flank either near or distant the order and ornament of architecture likewise come under the same regulation for the frontispiece balcony porch step rail ballustrades statue window must remain the same in each composition and not only so but of the same marble and same zoood abating for the decay of time with the inward ornament the case be the same for the room must not be adorn in of different manners but with tapestry or picture of such or such choice the inner court may be set off with fountain statue no greater overfight can therefore in my opinion can be commit on such a occasion than to employ different hand in so capital work because they commonly differ in manner handling and knowledge as much as night and day whence it happen that the chain of story be so broken and dubious that without a explanation it be difficult to know whom or what it represent one follow the antique gusto another the modern one give he personage certain likeness and another give the same person character quite different from that of the former as it hit they fancy and choice so that virgil s say be remember to have see two piece be the continuance of one fact in both which be represent one and the same general in the former he be in armour and barehead more or less antiquelike and in the latter he be triumphantly carry on à shield clothed in buff and with shoe and stocking hat and feather and with naked sword in he hand as for he carriage it be as little like that of the former as he dress now how ridiculous this must look let any one determine could give more instance of this kind of blunder but think this sufficient caution to those who may be concerned in fuch work shall pursue we main defign and come to likeness which in word lie in the feature how much soever person may advance in year to hit the likeness well and prevent the afbresaid mistake the follow be thé best method chusc fine plaisterface ci hér of man or woman which have such a air as the subject require whether modesz austere dr amorous this face we must make use of from the beginning to thé end of the work where those observation be necessary either in front or profile eud with such light as be proper to the whole design whether right or leave sorward or backward candle or torch all this to be do without any variation except somewhat in the liveliness and fleshiness which through year be continually abating in both sex as we have before faid as to the motion of the passion cause by particular accident we have in former chapter shew method how to manage in such case without the life have say thus much touch the ordonnance think it not improper to subjoin two observation which be as necessary to what have be say as to what shall hereafter be treat of namely description of the condition of man in the summer and winter season and conclude this book with a emblem man in summer be vastly affect by the heat which thin the blood make it flow with ease to the extremity of the body whereby the motion be freed from restraintthe head be raise the shoulder sink the arm and leg spread the hand and finger open whereby each part of the body seem to refresn itself afford every where free passage for the cold the mouth be generally open the eyelid feem to be brisker because warmth enliven all thing cauf also the vapour which ascend to the brain and fall on the eye the hair stick behind the ear hang down the back so that all seem to be uncover man in the winter season to exprefs this figure well it be necessary to explain cold itself as be the cause of the subsequent motion the blood wherein lie the warmth of the body be by means of cold which be its opposite and enter from without through the pore force inwardly so that it pass chiefly from the small member to wit finger and toe to its center wherefore we see that to keep off outward cold people sink they head into they breast raise they shoulder hug themselves very close with they hand under they armpit which the cold can not easily affect the knee join leg somewhat bent and the whole body stoop the eye almost shut or keep open with difficulty the mouth close the upper lip hide by the under one which cover it up to the nose to prevent the cold enter the body the hair hang carelessly both before and behind emblem the best method person of weak memory can take be to exercise he judgment on thing at the instant they present themselves to he that be to set down what he have mind to keep that he may at any time have recourse to it for he future information and remembrance and this to be repeattill he have gain what he want but thiscan not well be do unless he at such time suspend the use of three of he sense hearing taste and smell and retain only sight and feeling accord to we sketch thus young man in he prime be sit at small table with pen or crayon in he hand memory be sit over against he hold upright a open book wherein truth be represent to he on the table time stand by he on one side point at the figure oftruth and prudence on he other side be guide he hand sight and feel stand by he at the table the three othersense be at the command of judgment conduct by temperance to another apartment behind memory judgment be see drive away some child who be observe here as vice and untimely hindrance prejudicial to memory those unseasonable im¬ pediment always hover about we and court we smile have each they particular token in they hand the first timbrel the second rackerthe third plate of grape the fourth pye the fifth patridge the sixth foolcap thus we may easily see how weak and imperfect we be when judgment do not affist we and we be miss by the bent of corrupt inclination th be of iaen book iii of thing antique and modern chap the difference between what be antique and modern be now oblige to put in execution we purpose of make proper distinction between thing antique and modern since the difference between they be so great that they can not unite without cause excessive deformity for thing antique be always the fame bat the mode continually change it be very name imply its mutability fince nothing be more inconstant than what depend on fafhion which alter not only annually but even daily in those who mimick the court these contrariety which be so confound and cause such variance between what be antique and modern we see chiefly in the composition of history fable emblem and such like in which both yet the modern most be blend together congruity and suitableness in the composition of history be true token of judicious master what be more glorious than while we be ravifh the eye to pierce the heart while the sight be recreate with the beauty of the art to transport the mind with the decorum and energy of the composition he therefore be esteem prudent master who not only give every thing its proper colour but also its due expression pure and uncorrupted thus we see that great master who be get to that perfection do not blend thing promiscuously and without dotinction as east west south and north in chaosmanner because with the little master we should then act against nature it be therefore necessary that we nicely consider what it be we intend to represent to the end that we may not fail in giv¬ ing the true meaning of it how can the truth of thing be know unless it be represent as clear as literal explanation let we then curious artistsl sedately weigh what give the art such a effect and lustre have ye mind to borrew any thing for you ordonnance examine first the story ye design to handle whether it be perfian greek roman will ye represent à darius chuse all you manterial fromthe perfian for he attirement will ye bring demosthene on the stage learn the proper circumstance of the athenian and make he appear great heroe will ye exhibit the valiant scipio give he roman dress and other neceffary from that people suitable to it by this means each perfonage will have he true property and you will shew you skill in history and also by observing the time when and place the here represent the subject accordingly would ye exhibit high or louedutch englisnor french story fetch no material from persia greece or staly each country can furnisn fufficient matter proper for its climate to wit plant manner of living pastime houseornament stuff dress publick worship time and manners of eat and repose all which particular must be attentively consider in order to gain we point and for which purpose reading and book be necessary for as professor in law must draw he knowledge from the marrow of the roman german and other writer of jurisprudence divine from scripture and the commentator thereon and philosopher the same so painter ought to be skill in the representation which he make he principal study whether the same be ancient or modern hence we judge what fund of knowledge be requisite if painter would be universal he should almost know every thing nay more than many other artist in they particular calling for he ought to have tolerable knowledge of mathematics philosophy geography history do not meddle then either with thing which you be not conversant with or follow the advice of other for it be more commendable to sketch dog or cat zoell than a elephant camel or crocodile poorsy be you dispose to handle a ancient story borroz nolhing for it that be nez and of modern invention since what be doguise with falsehood can never be truth like traveller who darken truth by he own addition whose whim make he describe thing he never see and that to person who on due consideration soon discover the fallacy the artist s judgment itself must therefore alzays go before and all that he undertake be govern by reason and nature a italian should not be in a indian dress or persian in slashied doublet since the person we desire to know do there by become unknozon each country and people be know not only by they habit but by all the other circumstance beforemention give then to each its own requisity and every thing that be proper to it how excellent must picture appear and with what admiration view when every thing have it be due quality and the whole prudent management what will not the artist merit if he perform nothing beyond he strength and knowledge for since we can not know all thing in perfection we must keep within the bound of we understanding he who would be every where be seldom find any where and by confound thing do instead of real judgment discover he little sxill represent then no more than you capacity will admit and principally take care not to iniermix modern and ancient « he and he army be defeat at marathon and afterwards by miltiade general of the athenian he conquer sicily after he have lay waste the country of epidaurus pl will by whom carthage be destroy ancient dress and furniture in the same composition thus we shew à generous spirit for eminence and with the excellent former and latter italian french femiss and other master a emulation to excel in what be noble great and artful think canbetter describe the difference between what be antique and modern than by windball and a egg thus the ball by be toss to and for and at last burst represent short duratien afford nothing but wind but the egg hatch and open produce live creature not only something but something good the former mere nothing or if it have name it be vanity and therefore rather bad than good painting be by the ancient roman so highly esteem that none but nobleman durst learn it as we may also gather from the painter several of whom have be of noble extraction and the reason of it be very evident since it be not only probable but reasonable that such ingenious spirit should have dotinguish inclination for art suitable to they quality above the vulgar they meditation action and perception be fix on great and sublime thing they enquire into and consult many excellent author of history fable and emblem as well sacred as profane and the account of ancient medal from whence they have draw plentiful and ingenious matter for they studious what excellent painting have they not oblige the world with how many temple palace and other rare structure have they enrich with elegant device incite to virtue whereby they have bequath last name to posterity how do architecture never enough to be praise flourisn in they time but whatt alteration do we see now how be the beauty and profitable use of painting either funk obscure or slighted since the bombocciade be multiply in these country at prefent we can fcarce see one virtue appear but ten nay a hundred vice will rise counter to it thus have sprung up à second hydra like that of lerna so that we want avaliant hercule to lop off those dragon head which be always sprouting thus architecture itself how excellent soever be with the right practice of painting bring into disgrace and slighted by other nation since we scarce see beautiful hall or sine apartment of any cost that be not set out with picture of beggar obscenity geneva stall tobaccosmoaker fidler nasty child eas nature and other thing more filthy who can entertain he friend or person of repute in a apartment lie thus in litter or where child be bawling or wipe clean we grant that these thing be only represent in picture but be not the the art of painting a imitation of the life which can either please or loathp if then we make such thing like the life they must need raise a aversion they be therefore too low and unbecoming subject for ornament especially for people of fafhion whose conception ought to surpaf the vulgar we admit indeed that all this be art or at least call so when the life be there by naturally express but haus much the beautiful life sxilfully handle differ from the defective life of mottern painter let the curious determine it becertain that man and beast too have each particular and different inclination to particular thing whereby they love what be agreeable to they nature the one good the follower of bamboccio celebrate painter of mean subject good the other bad becanse as some pretend they be govern and insluence bycertain constellation happen at they birth this at least we know that one man incline to hunt and countrylife another to war strife and contention another to merchandise and deceit this to politics and great thing that to pleafure so that in each we discover what he nature and pafsion be prone to but let uà reffect on two art noblé and ignoble or antique and modern and see how much they differ both in object and execution the antique be unlimited that be it can handie history sacred as well as profane fable and emblem both moral and spiritual under which three head it comprehend all that ever be be and shall be the past present and to come and that after a excellent manner which never alter but remain always the same the modern contrarily be so far from be free that it be limit within certain narrow bound and be of small power for it may or can represent no more than what be present and that too in manner wohich be always change what be past and to come be without its power as also history fable and emblem as well poetical and philosophic as moral hence we may judge what the modern art of painting be and why it can not be call noble much less of any harmony with the antique could assign more cause for this disunion but shall at present omit they for two reason first because man s judgment be so various and each argue accord to he paffion and inclination in proportion as he like or dislike thing secondly which be the principal that may not be think to raise any suspicion of partiality or prepossession but why should restrain my thought let I speak plain in spite of other say then that although modern thing seem to have some prettiness yet they be only to be esteem as diverfion of the art moréover maintain that such painter as never produce more than one choice of subject may truely be rank among tradesmen since such reprefentation can not be call a exercise of the mind but a handicraft trade but such remark as these we may sufficiently perceive that from apprehension knorvledge and judgment spring the lustre and elevation of the antique art of painting and contrarily that ignorance negligence and selfieill debase and subject the modern so that the ancient have not improperly place minerza by the one and midas by the other intimate by the former still in the art practice carefulness and a heavenly talent and by the latter imprudence blind zeal wordly defect and hindrance but if any one would perhaps examine whether there be not means to make the modern noble as well as the antique that they might both march together they would find it to be labour in vain since defect once get foot be not easily remedy but further we often hear with wonder that painter persuade one another that in handle subject it be enough to follow nature though sne be defective as crook lame squinteye or blind and that when she be imitate with delicate peneil that be sufficient and such be they zeal and extraordinary pain that one paint for that end the air of he wife though ever so ugly with all she freckle and pimple very exactly whereby the agreeableness of beautiful woman s face be quite loft another chuse he clownish unmannerlymaid¬ maidservant for he model and make she lady in saloon another will put lorddress on schoolboy or he own son though continually stroak he hair behind he ear scratch he head or have downlook think it sufficient to have follow nature without regard to grace which ought to be represent or have recourse to fine plaisterface which be to be have in abundance the beautiful and wellcompose air in picture of many or few figure have great effect on the mind of the know of which the ancient be thoroughly sensible for in the most perfect body they make the face chiesly to excel in beauty and agreeableness no one of judgment will deny that beautiful and wellcarriage woman have such a ascendant as most effectually to move she beholder in two different manners as by two contrary pasfion under misfortune or in rage pain she will pierce man s heart and move he to compassion and when she entertain we on any joyful occasion with sing or laugh she will at once delight we clownish woman contrarily will not produce any such effect for she beholder through she unmannerliness and simple behaviour despise she mirth and mock she ridiculous sorrow what great defect do we not still find in modern painter when they use or rather abuse the life not do like those who be accustom to nobler manner view the life with knowledge and judgment that be not as it ordinarily appear but as it ought to be in its greatest perfection whereas the other blinded by custom have no such nicety because they imitate the life just as they fee it without any difference we even see they make it more deform than nature ever produce for the more misshapen face bamboccio oftade brouvver moller and many other make the more they be esteem by ignorant by which lozp choice we can easily judge that they be stranger to beauty and admirer of deformity however it be a infallible rule that daily custom and converse with people like ourselves contribute much to it thus deformity and vice be prefer to virtue and what should be shun seek whereas he who be sensible of virtue will always endeavour to escape error chap ii method for represent what be citylike or elegant modern yhe continual change in worldly thing afford we plentifulmatter for modern manner without recourse tohistory fable or emblem even so much as the be endless as may be gather from the affembly for public worship pleading in court play family occurrence and the like all which we perceive to be either majestic amorous sorrowful or otherwise those thing how different soever can be represent in the antique manner as well as in the modern provide each keep its quality as have already intimate and shall further insist in the subsequent example which can be handle in both manners alike natural and proper without eitherborrowing any thing from the other but the subject this think worthy worthy of remark and the rather since to my knowledge no author treat of thing antique and modern have say any thing touch it francis mieris have not only curiously follow he master gerrard dou in the elegant modern manner but be in some thing he superior and the rare poussin and raphael prince of the italian painter excel in the antique let we then follow they example in what be most agreeable to we gustoand though the latter far exceed the former in nobleness it be however more commendable to be like good mieris in the modern manner than bad raphael in the antique though remember to have séen picture of old mieris which as often as think of it furprise I it be a halflength figure about the bigness of the palm of the hand represent the art of painting hold vizor in she hand its air headattire dress and furniture so very beautiful and truly antique that never see the like do by any other modern master how skilful soever whence it appear how rare it be for modern master to give into the antique let we now represent the case of parent permit they child to take seme diversion in bathing design which can be as well execute in the antique as the modern manner the bagnio come forward in the piece have descent into it of two step the boy from twelve to fifteen year old about the water and in it be naked daughter of twenty year of age be see with fine white linnen cloth over she body in order to cover what modesty conceal and as be customary on such occafion nevertheless she arm and part of she leg be bare she be come up the step on the left side one of the aforesaid boy hold she fast by flappet of the wet cloth in order to prevent she go up further behind near bed the eldest daughter about twentyfive year old appear almost unshifted and near she maidservant to put the cloth about she the father we represent drest either in he cloath or japan nightgown stand on the brink of the bagnio and laugh at the boy who be in it and play they trick one of they be stand with he left leg on the step and with the other foot just touch the water the youngest boy lie on he belly extend on the lowermost step plafh with he hand in the water the cloth of the daughter who be step out of the bagnio drop wet stick so close toshe body that the nakedness of the member appear so transparently through it the mother all this while be busy in serve some sweetmeat on table cover with napkin near which child of two or three year of age be sit in chair in he shirt to whom she offer macaroon somewhat further be see silk gown petticoat velvet fcarve hood hang on pin on table be lie pearl necklace bracelet and other trinket in fine the whole disposition be most orderly natural and beautiful as for the boy cloath to wit coat hat breech stocking shoe they lie on the brink of the bagnio now refer it to the judicious reader whether the daughter who on the left side be step out of the bagnio ought not notwithstanding she be cover with the cloth to be represent beautiful and shapeable in she arm leg hand and foot nay even she body also so far as the nakedness appear through the wet cloth she modesty appear evidently by she bafhful look what carriage shew the foot and whole body while she endeavour to cover the part which modesty modesty conceal and how modestly do she stepup instead of expof those part by wanton gatel afk further whether the boy who be stop she by the flappet of the cloth ought to be less beautiful and wellmake than the father in the flower japan gown the boy the same who lie extend on he belly in whomn must appear innocence and childifhiness the eldest daughter in she bloom well descend and virtuously educated to whom shall we like she whence must we fetch she beauty and whom must we use for model vulgar person or one of better appearance even this latter would be infufficient for the purpose if not well educated and finecarriage hecause beauty without grace look mishapen and stiff this virgin then who be except in she foot quite naked ought principally to be paint as beautiful and agreeable as grecian venus mean not wanton one but a « heavenly one virtuous one for as much as the soul differ from the body and the body from the dref do nobility from commonalty virtue from defect if any one afk where he shall find those byauty refer he in the first place to the book which treat of perfect proportion wherein true grace consist whilst he be studious in those he ought to have the best plaisterfigure before he in order to exercise he understand and there by acquire solid judgment if it be again object that the plaister be not equal to live nature own it for mean not that the artist should paint fleshcolour after they but get perfect idea of they beauty grace and agreeablenefs both general and particular whence perfection spring for the colour be evident and easy enongh to be find in the life as could prove in several instance of some ordinary painter who coloured well who before they have make much progref in the art be cry up for great man and yet have any thing extraordinary toodo be not able to fketch well a head hand or foot the modern painting can theréfore not be account art when nature be simply follow which be meer imperfect imitation or defective aping she even where thing represent ever so natural welldesign and properly order the condition manners and custom of the country well observe and the colouring most exact yet the know will not think it artful but when nature be correct and improve by judicious master and the aforesaid quality join to it the painting must then be noble and perfect say therefore with respect to the naked whether of man woman or child that when it be not exhibit most beautifully or in its due proportion the modern painting can not deserve the name of art and with good reason since this be the only method whereby to make those two unlike sister accord van dyk never enough to be commend gain excellence in the antique as well as the modern manner by strictly follow the aforesaid three grace in both and he there by acquire the epithet of matchless let we therefore follow he noble example in what make he so famous since he be the first who carry the modern manner so high as to gain it the name of art whence we may easily conclude what great difference there must be between painter who make the « venus urania the three grace the modern or defective life he study and excellence and one who follow the antique or make thorough enquiry into every thing that be beautiful and perfect the difference be even so great in every respect that can not but wonder at it especially when consider how much greater the number of the former fort be and how they daily increase wonder say that nowday virtue be so little heed virtue which take it s rise from heaven be now as formerly the godly astrea do fly thither again and vice contrarily which sprung forth of erebus and black earth keep its station but it can not be otherwise since blind love alone rule and a anteros be no more the reason of so great à difference can be attribute to nothing else but the different inclination of painter to object agree with they temper they who content themselves with follow defective life will never produce any thing perfect or deserve the name of artful master because not knoee or not care to knole what be dest they can not so much as strive at it to which add another mischief they more easily judge of what be bad than good as shall explain myself in the follow example young man as painter with pallet and pencil attend by zeal be lead by blind cupid to the figure of nature whose face be cover by vulcan with veil the sun behind the young man enlighten the aforesaid whole figure mercury on cloud with he caduceus in one hand hold star over the artist s head in the other the meaning be this nature be the painter s object the jun represent knowledge vulcan the gross part of the air or earthiness and mercury inevitable fate the rest explain itseif thus much touch modern painter another emblem may have this difference that instead of vulcancover the upper part of nature with veil pallas be take it off and anteros introduce instead of cupid the meaning be that judgment by pallas which signify bedom govern the upper and most perfect part and discover to the soul all it need to know when aitero signify love to virtue be lead the painter attend by zeal to it but to speak still plainer we shall subjoin third ordonnance we represent to young man of equal age the one standing on the ground before the figure of nature and the other on one side or behind he somewhat raise on stone or step by the former be place vulcan and by the latter pallas the one fignifying defect or earthy part and the other the soul or perfection let the astrea or uprightness sincerity love and all heavenly virtue be understand by she she be the daughter of one of the titan and themis accord to hefiod but ovid call she the daughter of jupiier and themis she come from heaven in the golden age and when vice and cor ruption get foot stew thitheragain by he be understand hell and the night some name he the god of hell and say he wa marry to the night also a hellist river of which vijgil fing thus in he eneid venimus magnos erebi tranavimus mmneis from erebus and the night be bring forth lie envy stubbornness poverty fickness porpkiry couxrerlove son of veaus and younger brother to cupid see suida paufanias the figure of nature be enlighten by the sun and cause triangular ray to proceed from those young man s eye upon it the ray of the former extend from the foot up to the middle and those of the latter take the zohole figure let we now judge when the sun represent knowledge which of the two young man can see and comprehend the most and be most perfect he who view the figure but halfway or he who examine it up to the upper part whence we may learn that the mind and judgment be beyond the hand and practice which without theory be of no worth tis art to produce something which we have not in sight but mere copying and aping to intimate what we have before we apply to the case of the lover of the antique and modern manner we suppose then tzo lover instead of two painter and take the art of painting instead of nature for the object which they like the other view the one en tirely the other but halfway thus he who comprehend the figure throughout know most and have the best knowledge and be consequently greater lover when the other be observe as lover of loco thing and ignorant of the more noble of this latter fort we find the greatest number in we country it be certain position that some man though hinder in they youth by a ordinary education from attain sublime thought and great thing can alter in time by art and exercise even conquer they innate disposition and fit theyselve for noble and excellent thing so that we need not wonder that domesthene be not more eloquent than demade who though he seem as if nature have not bestow on he either tongue or speech yet become so eloquent that he singular example shew there be nothing impossible to art nay few defect which like demade diligence and labour can not overcome do we need not read of heraclide that he become philosopher in spite of nature and education why do socrate not prone to virtue become virtuous wherefore we need not wonder that many great man have obtain great endowment though naturally unfit for they and from hence we may infer that art and exercise be of more worth than the production of nature have not yet make mention of several man of mean extraction who though they spend many year with pleasure and affiduity in loco employment yet afterward arrive to general surprize at the top of they art as be say of polydoro do caravaggio who in raphael s time have be a hodman tohis eighteenth year become afterwards great master the same be the case of quintin matsy who have be to he twentieth year smith give into painting and much surpass he cotemporary martin hemstirk countryman s son andrea mantegna cowherd and many other of mean birth also go great length in the art be not among the ancient philosopher protagora countryman s son pythagora a engraverjphicrate general of the athenian taylorthe orator demade aforelaid failorand the mantuan maro prince of the latin poet the son of potter even the mus themselves be poor they nobility sprung not from they birth but they science we could give many more instance of this kind but not to seem tedious shall proceed to chap iii the nature of citylike subject which daily afford plentiful matter for modern painter as the genius of artist differ one lead to the sublime manner another to the common even to the meanest so we find ourselves oblige to treat of all part ofthe art in order to be alike useful to every one we have already observe that there be three sort of people the courtly or high the citizen or commonalty and the mean or poor state the first be speak of in the forego book of ordonnance and the second shall now follow we suppose that every artist endeavour to excel in he choice of subject that some seek fame and money other money and fame other money only at the same time we think it no less artful to represent jest than serious matter countryman than courtier or a af than a horse since either require good skill to express it properly although there be great difference between citizen and courtier yet the one as wellthe other may excel alike in beauty and goodness it be grandeur alone that make the distinction between the city and court for luxury and pride be peculiar to the latter but modesty and temperance to the former have premise thisit will be easy to exhibit plainly the further circumstance as occasion shall call for they first observe that as the citylife be peculiar to we with its daily occurrence of asfembly pastime familyaffair and other particular mention in the precede chapter so it be the more easy for painter to make such subject he practice especially one who find himself insufficient for the grand taste for whose sake we give the follow scheme and first a example of intreate and refuse two virgin be see at table drinking tea the youngest be in she withinddoor dress and the other friend pay she visit each have she cup and saucer that of the youngest stand fill before she and she have the tea pot in she hand in order to fill the cup of the other who have turn it down set it on the table she be friendly intreate by the other to drink another dishi as if she saypray dear isabel one dishi more but fervant enter the room to call she away she refuse it with she hand on the teapot to hinder sill seem to say thank you heartily fill no more these two paffion cause two contrary motion in the whole body hand foot and face the mother who be let in the servant with he hat under he arm hold the door half open and be shew he he mistress the opening of the door discover sledge the usual carriage of holland with which he be come to fetch she now in order to express more plainly this rise from the teatable we may place another virgin at it near jsabel who look towards the door seem to rise and set down she cup the man we may make approach he mistress with à letter letter in he hand and the mother stand at the door and look little boy may also properly stand at the table who steal bit of sugar out of the box be watch he sister to see whether she observe it thus the matter may stand with respect to these two viigin have we mind to represent the same occurrence by gentleman we ought only to change the tea into wine the teapot into bottle thecup into glass the teaequipage of kettle chafdisni into cistern accord to the season and the mother into menial servant the apartment if in the summerseason to be in gardenhouse and in the winter chamber with a entertainment or collation such subject as these be very commendable and may be nobly dispose to the credit of a artist but he must avoid handle cottage brandyshop alehouse batdyhouse corpsdegard and the like we shall exhibit another example of daily occurrence whereby appear more passion in order to shew that they must not be want in such representation example ii of a accident which happen at painter house the artist have one morning fine plaisterfigure and two bust bring home and set they out of the way on chest of drawer and then pay the figuremaker let he depart boy of seven or eight year of age fitting near the drawer eat piece of bread and butter see this who after he have eat and he father leave the room take chair in order to view they near and think they plaything must need take they down but either through they weight or the totter of the chair whereon he stand he drop the figure on this noife the father apprehensive of what have happen come down into the room and beheld the misfortune with sorrow the boy affrighted fook about for corner to hide in and at last run to he mother hang about she neck and beg she to save he she though concerned for the damage yet desire the father to consider the child s innocence upon which and the intreaty of he daughter who have rush into the room on hear the outcry he be pacify order the maidservant to gather up the break part and to fling they away after which he take the two bust in he arm and return to he roomalthough this accident be in itself of no great moment yet it will furnish matter enough for modepainter as well as the contrary to fill three cloths with be full of efficacious paffion elegance and variety and as rich in subject as if it be fiction it can not be deny that this subject though no history be of a historicat nature and require as much pain as handle some fiction out of homer or virgil we grant indeed that the nature of it give we liberty of add what ornament or take away what heavy bywork we please fince we be master of we own invention and can manage we thought as we think fittill we have bring they to we like which be licence not allowable in other kind of history nevertheless when we have mind to exhibit a accident like the preced ced we mnust confine ourselves to all theparticular of it though no history because by abating or leave out any of they it would make no impression on we this example then though only a introduction to such sort of composition yet require punctual imitation and we get in time richer in those invention by daily occurrenee they must be even pleasant to painter in the grand manner since they recreate the mind require no reading and may in great nnmber be meet with at leisure time prince often disguise in mean habit for they diverfion and citizen and commonalty in rich one for the same reasonbecause any fort of varietytickle and each seek he pleasure foreign to he usual way of living but it be more easy for citizen to play citizenthan any other part and for painter to keep to the management of what he daily meet with than any thing else since the mind be like glass ball hang up in the middle of room which receive all the object present and retain the impression of they thus ruben and van dyk by daily converse with the great at court be fix they thought on what be sublime and lofty in the art jordaan and rembrandt again on what be citylike and bamboccio and brouwer on what be most vulgar and mean thus each in he way accord to he conversation with people like himself the follow accident be as remarkable as the former composition exhibit mother hold lookglaf before she child this woman sit upright with she back mostly against the light close to window which run to the point of sight and be but half see through which window she receive she light little front she dress be long dark blue upper garment and she under one have long sleeve be light gold colourwith purple reflexion with she left hand she hold the lookglaf upright in she lap look at the child with smile yet she mouth somewhat open she head in profile incline little to the left shoulder she right hand behind she rest on small round table whereon lie a open book frame with needlework and some bobbin of silk the child stand before the glass with foolcap on he head hold a apple against he left breastin he right hand and have he left arm with double fist up to he ear and whimpering threaten to beat the glass he turn to the left look angrily at it and draw back with he right leg he coat which be white be loopt on the right shoulder and he left breast bare he be girt with risecolour girdle maidservant stand behind he be see front with she backside stand somewhat out to the leave she garment be greyish violet with white cloth about she body in she left hand she hold key against she breast and under she arm she have dust brushi she right hand rest on she mistress s arm and with she head flung back towards she left side laugh so heartily as to discover she tooth she hair be tie under cap except black twist lock come over she bosom on the left side she smock sleeve be turn up to she elbow close behind the mistress hang light grey curtain curtain mostly shade by aepier of the walling between the window on which the maid givelarge groundshade which fling off the child on the left side of the composition door be see half open forward appear cushion on cricket whereon lietabby cat and by it some little flower or wither chaplet and timbrel now with respect to this representation consider the follow observation here be something more to be remark than the innocence of the child he grow angry at see himself inthe glass imagine that another child because he own dress be unknown to he be come to fright he and get he apple the chief design of the ordonnance be to express exactly the proper paffion of pear by the posture but also by the dress assign they and they colour to wit in the child innocence in the maid folly in the mother moderation although thiscomposition be no more fact than the former yet it affect we pafsion as truth and because the dress do not quite chime in withthe mode it may if well paint and execute hang better near a antique history or fable than one of company of gentleman and lady whose rich dresssnine with ture will maintain decorum which will not abate in thousand year if the circumstance of the bywork be well observe by introduce timbrel instead of marble nicker or cockal and give the maid dustingbrush instead of broom or mop and place by the mistress a open book or frame of needlework instead of spinwheel or puddingpan we shall perceive the childish simplicity of the first the servitude of the second and the tutelage or command of the third the very catlie by the dead flower on the cricket intimate childisn play and fondness to scatter all thingabout the room if the artist find no taste in represent thing in the antique way and yet think the modern too mean such a one may very commendably employ himself in handle such subject as the follow picture of virtue she appear sit composedly before large lookglass the frame whereof be carve and gill and adorn with monster she view herself init hold round serpent twine with laurel she aspect be sedate she sway majestic and she s attire like roma near she stand some child attentively view the the frame and with general laugh point at the monster one of these child wear foolcap anotner have nest of bird third have jingling iron fourth shell of water out of which he blow bubble with reed and fifth be play with puppet these child be partly boy and partly girl the sense of this table be easy but if the curious want further scope let they consider only for instance in what good and bad family consist andthey will find that there be four sort of people namely in good family prudent and respected father careful and goodnature mother obedient child and humble and honest servant the father give law the mother enforce it to the child and both they and the servant obey again the father punishy the mother reconcile and the child love and fear good father be also liberal in the support of he family the careful mother manage with frugality yet with honour all be in peace and order and virtue they aim in bad family we contrarily see the father careless the mother lavisn the boy wanton the girl pert and the servant idl and dishionest the father indolent the mother unreasonably indulgent to the child the girl saucy and proud the boy rampant and gamesome and the servant catch at what they can lay hold of think it best to fisn in troubled water and feast daily at they master expence again there be otfier object in divide family when the man be pious andthe wife worldling we see frequently wick child contrarily worldlyminded man and religious woman often have virtuous children the reason be plain if such thing as these be well observe they furnish abundance of matter and produce a extraordinary effect in any familyoccurrence in what condition and on what occasion soever we confider they whether in prosperity or adversity great and noble common or in the mean state and as well in theymanners and carriage as they dress and if these thing be well execute whether in the antique the modern taste they be each way commendable subject for a artist chap iv continuation of the same connexion to what precedm touch the tzoo afbresaid manners shall give some further thought though short of what can be say of those two unlike sister since the field be so large thatcould write whole treatise on that fubject only representation of vanity plate x x this ordonnance exhibit a hall which receive its light through large winlow on the right side behind against the wall stand table on which be large ocelestial globe at the foot of this globe lie a open book on the left side ofthe point of sight be see through doorway go down with step visto with part of fountain and on the side whicht run to the point of sight several vase and bust of famous heroes on the left side of the apartment be closet afsteen to by two step between two handrail in the middle of the piece forard we place round table deck with all sort of woman s furniture as lookglass box at the window be see two child boy and girl the the boy with shell in he hand be lean on the frame of the window and blow bubble through reed or pipe the girl who be get on footstool support herself on she right hand and laugh poinr with the other at flying bubble upon which the boy look back hold the reed or pipe with he right hand in the shell on the right side of the hinmost table stand philosopher in study with finger at he forehead and hold pair of compass on the globe in he left hand by the closet which be half open stand a old willman look forward with she head sidling and rub she hand by the further handrail of the step maidservant be kneel and whiping the say rail with cloth have by she box of sand pot with water and stiff rubbrush the closet be full of plate at the round table forward sit young lady dress at the glass she bosom be open and she be loosely drest in sine linnen and silk with she left hand she be bring rightside hairlock over she bosom view herself side way and with she right hand take pearl necklace out of box the apartment be of light pisan marble the philosopher s garment be of dark violet that of the boy at the window white and of the girl blue the lady be in white and light red changeable with blue and she have beautiful dark blue girdle about she waist the old woman s garment be greenisn blue somewhat fad and the sleeve face with light yellow the maidservant be in light grey and have pearl necklace about she neck by the step lie pair of sandal the round table be cover with dark green carpet the floor be of stone and divide into square it may also be of wood shall now for certain reason give the reader my thought of the disposition of the object in this ordonnance but first he will much oblige I if he will please to examine what have hitherto say and shall say on this head because he will then be enable to judge whether it be impoffible for I as some mali¬ ciouay report to make the disposition of a ordonnance with the due action of the figure and in they proper place and colour accord to rule because of my want of sight for would these man themselves but open they eye they would quickly perceive that disposition depend on positive and certain reason first dispose the apartment with the immoveable object after these the fiveable object at the same time as assert the proper place of the window table and closet now do not say on which side of the table either right or leave the lady be sitting because it be needlef and she can not be dispose otherwise than she be since the lookglass must be place against the light consequently she ought to front the light that she may see herself in the glaf for how could she shew she breast front when the face be to be in profile and be she to bring the lock of hair over she bosom with she right hand and to put the left on the table she would be without sway or good posture and from head to foot in profile let we next consider whether the philosopher could be otherwise dispose than where he be on the left it can no way be for two reafon because the globe globe be on that side very much in shade and therefore unfit for he conclusion because he would then be partly in the light and shew almost the fame posture as the lady where yet ought to be a opposition again be he stand before the table or globe than we should neither see he motion nor he contemplation where fore no place suit he better or be more proper than where he stand by which this advantage also accrue that because he now receive more shadethan light the lady there by get more beauty and decorum he can also more commodiously view the globe and make he remark by turn he body because one side be just front the light and the other contrary to it it may be the same with the old woman next the closet since it be impossible that she and the rest of the figure can be otherwise dispose with so much advantage and decorum this defign could also be well manage in portraiture especially in familypiece of man wife child and servant for we find daily occurrence enough agree with such representation but to discourse clearly on this composition and to shew that it be found on good reason we shall make some further remark upon it say then that it will bear diver interpretation though as will appear below they may be bring into one the lady at the table and the old woman at the closet both signify vanity and yet it may posfibly be say that the former may as well be take for pride and the latter as stand before the plate and with smile countenance rub she hand naturally express coverousness the old man see here as philosopher may consequently signify philosophy but say that this only seem to be so hecause if the explanation take that turn it can not be compendious emblem but confnse medley of diver thing from which no inference can be draw wherefore it be proper to explain we thought of this composition thoroughly even to the smallest object gradually come forward fromn the greatest distance the bustoand fountain in the offscape as also the servant clean the hand¬ rail tend altogether to vanity as the old man with the globe represent vain contemplation for who can penetrate the secret of god and nature the sense of the young lady and old woman we have explain before wherefore the true meaning of this subject be only to shew that all be vanity which yet could not be absolutely conclude from it be not the child there since the other figure and object might be diversly apply to wit to pride covetousness philosophy and therefore the child who employ themselves in blow bubble be now the soul of the work and without they therewould be neither connexion nor conclusion even each figure would have distinct signification and each call for distinct apartment and though we be minded to exhibit different paffion into the same picture yet something must be appropriate to each ofghem in order to shew its meaning for picture be not in the same case with frontispieceplate wherein be general representation of the whole subject of the book viz the seven wonder the twelve month the aforesaid design be also not much unlike true history and might likewise serve for moral or emblem for each figure have its particular and proper character character man incline to study woman to gather rich and goods daughter grow up in luxury and misspend they time young and innocent child busy themselves in trifle so that on the whole the conclusion must be that each person in what he incline to love vanity if any one here object that astronomy mathematick and philosophy be not vanity as be ascribe to wise man he must know that wise man themselvs be by « some account fool wherefore pythagora though a heathen would not be stile wise but à friend and lover of good discourse and science knowledge often make wise man presumptuous and prevent they consider with the philolosopher that science be vanity thus we see daily that the rich be haughty and disdainful the handsome proud and voluptuous through beauty and pleafure like morningflower decay with the evening and we may well say with the poet that volutuousness be shadow and momentary delight and therefore poor creature they be who covet jhadow aud transient happiness all which thing occur almost daily even in one and the same family as we have more largely intimate in the precede chapter some perhaps may censure I for introduce into the aforesaid example such trifle as pair of sandal which seem to belong to the old woman but say they be not trifle but proper for such woman as make idol of they house and chuse rather to go barefoot over they floor than bedaub they though they have they maid always at they elbow with wooll cloths to clean after they but since this sacrifice to neatnef of house be here in holland too obvious we shall urge no further but for peace sake silently reflect oh / the vanity of too spruce dutch zvoman even the maid as dependant on the mistress humour she vain defire however since those serviceable creature in they condition have likewise something which shew vanity give the servant in the example before we she coral or pearl about she neck although she be as ugly face as vizard or like the peasant in latona s time when turn into frog for how ordinary soever those womon be they think themselves handsome if they have but coral necklace and cury hair wherefore it be plain that such circumstance be needful and have in they place good effect as for the ordonnance of dress in this example modepainter may dispose they as they please agreeable to they choice have only sketch they here to shew that we may represent vanitas as well in the antique manner as in the common way of modepainter the sophist term wisdom foolish scandalous and vile pythagora of samos he reject the name of wise which be give hin of thing antique and modern chap of dress we need not doubt whether the art of painting be or will be otherwise than it be at this time with respect to its different choice because from the beginning there be modepainter and as each climate have its particular custom in dress so each nation follow its own fafhiion whence it appear that anciently as well as noz man be of opinion that they own be the best without give any reason for it the eastern nation have they particular dress and the northern theirs these last prefer cloth wooll and furs before the finest and thinest silk of the east and thus it fare with all other dress each nation say whether italian spaniards french cherish its own mode wherefore it be no wonder that painter follow those which best suit they choice nevertheless the case of art be in this particular like that of religion there be but one true the rest be sect so that the dress which be the moft constant and remain alzays the same be also the beft nevertheless we leave each nation to its own choice that the modern painting vary from time to time in goodnef and be continually decrease in that respect be not to be doubt since we have daily instance of it in many which be full of mistake but let I afk whether the tuscan order which be the most simple and strong do not require good architect as well as the corinthiaz or best the mode painting agree in all part with the antique subject in relation to art to wit in design disposition colour light and shade and byornament a ingenious modepainter ought to take care not to meddle with the antique or to mingle the one with the other for that weufd be a unpardonable mistake since he may be sufficiently furnish with modern matter for he study it be not great folly to introduce foreign word into tongue which be of itself copious enough why be the learn hooft and huige so famous be it not because of the force and purity of they stile especially that of voudel who therefore be justly call the dutch virgil we see daily how imperfect and defective the falhion be each day create a alteration and each make we think best if it get but general approbation as may be prove if we confider how ridiculous we forefather habit seem in we eye and consequently how much he would be mock who should appear in one of he great grandfatherand would he not be think madman the case be the same with respect to the old representation of dress with they stiff double ruff closewaist and pink doublet do any thing seem more odd to we and be not such old painting though well handle much slighted what reason have we to think that the present mode will better please we successor when we ourselves even dislike that of the year past thofe who take to such choice be not qualified to handle any history of atiquity how ridiculous would it be to dreis queen esther in stiffbody gown bedeck bedeck with ribbon ruff about she neck wide and quilt petticoat lace ruffle set close at the hand and pointofspain headdress instead of diadem and every thing else answerable and withher king ahasuerus sitting in spanissi leather èhair with narrow crowned hat on he head ruff about he neck fhort doublet with long sleeve and over it fhort cloak line

stand on theladder with the hangman and franciscan friar at the foot of it hold up crucifix to he would not this be fine ordonnancet and yet such thing happen now if it be afk whether the mode painter who paint market kitchen and thé like be not to be reckone in the number of figurepainter say they be so far as they keep to such subject nay be they to handle fictitious story or even parable ethich be tie to no time as of lazarus and the rich man of the publican prodigal son and the like or any daily occurrence fince such representation be the more affect as they fhew foreign dress and foreign mode be rarity be not so soon dislik as we own but fuch painter must not meddle with scriptural fact or the story of ovid virgil and other whicharé tie to time as have before intimate yet such be the unaccountable rafhiness of some that they dare represent sophenisba entirely in the present mode velvet gown white sattin petticoat trimed with gold lace lace rufffe a attire of false hair on she head white stipper and in a apartment hang with gill leather with fire in it and the floor of wood wherein the grainand knot be nicely obferve the room furnish with plush chair fring and brassnail over the

from each other question not but the reader will by this story sufficiently understand my meaning we have formerly asfert that those who daily converse with mean and bad people commonly become like they as those contrarily who keep company with the wellbreed and virtuous become good custom say horace be second nature and the proverb intimate keep honest company and honest thou shalt be he then be happy who have true sense of good and bad chuse the best and most profitable and govern all he do by that standard he who have becustom himself to bad manner can not easily get rid of it perhaps will betain it all he life he contrarily who give in to what be good will reject evil because it be against he inclination reasoning thus it be easy to apprehend how benefical it be for tyro to inure himself to any such fine thing as be proper for he study and to reiect the imperfect and unnecessary too many goods the famous bartholet use to say be no goods here pray observe a emblematic ordonnance of painter debauch by excessive reading of all sort of unprofitable book in order to shew that none must be use but such as be proper for he study which seneca affirm say that we ought to study few but good book the cause of the aforesaid painter s doorder be also attribute to the vast quantity of useless print drawing he consult which be as great enemy to the best thought as a excess in book here be see a anrigue table lay with board in painting room and in the middle of it dissi with cake in the shape of pyramid and by it cupfour vcome be fitting at the table viz painting

plaisterfigure print drawing academyfigure or other model reject every thing that be foreign to we study since we have hitherto speak of what be modern it will not be amiss to make some short observation on the antique he who would nicely follow the antique ought to know that it consist in these two quality viz beauty and goodness beauty again lie in perfect proportion of the member as we have snew in the seventh chapter of the first book and goodness in the grace arise fromthe moiion of the member which motion ought to be free and without exaggeration thus much as to the nudity the the drapery which be well cast and of adjust as not to hinder the graceful motion of the member be certainly the best as we evidently see in the work of raphael poussin and some other who practise the antique the ordonnance light and what else be requisite in perfect piece ought all to be most beautifully choose in this manner we must also confider landscape architecture and other embellishment all ought to be either pure antique or entire modern we shall here subjoin one other ordonnance for the conclusion of this book ordonnance represent driving azay of the mode or what be modern fram the antique instead of beauty and virtue which in the former be lead by judgment we may introduce here beautiful and modest young virgin attire in thin line which docover the naked on she hand sit phoenix and on she head be chaplet of flower judgment may be set off with gold fillet or diadem on its head and scepter in its hand instead of deform vice and the chimera we may exhibit sly young damsel in stiffen gown and high lace headdress with sable tippet about she neck she armsleeve full of lace moreover she have shoe stocking and glove and under she arm be bafket of chinaware and mushiroom which by she rude motion she be drop prudence be beat she with lookglass hold in she other hand a arrow twine with serpent the aforesaid young virgin s chaplet ought to be compose of small and everlast flower vig ptarmica austriaca and gnaphalium the muelhroom fignify short duration or sudden rise and decay the scepter of judgment be long thin rod with knob on the top the end of the third book art of painting book iv of colour chap of the colour and the order they it be remarkable that though the management of the colour in painting whether of figure landscape slower architecture yieldgreat pleasure to the eve yet hitherto no one have lay down solid rule for do it with safety and certainty contrast in motion be found on reason which by practice we can in fhort time retain and inculcate to other as be also the division or proportion of the member since accord to albert durer it may be mathematically demonstrated the same may be say of light and shade by means of perspective all this may be thoroughly learn in we juvenal year but the dispose of colour by and over each other in order to fetch put good union and harmony be not to this day fix on certain principle meer chance be herein we only comfort a engrave or etch print beautifully design and dispose and agreeably light and shade be very commendable but picture which besides those quality require a artful diversity of colour merit the highest praise nevertheless master have in they colour they particular manners one have faint manner another dark one another grey manner some have flar manner other muddy one occasion by they not know that colour require a orderly disposition like a ingenious gardener who in the production of choice beautiful and large flower consider what ground be proper and which need dryness and which moisture and what sort thrive best in each which require sun and which call for shade which want improvement from pidgeon s dung and which from dog s dung in order thereby to make greater advantage than other other people do in like manner paimter if he make thorough enquiry into che nature and effect of colour and against vohat grouud they be best set off aud will hest anszeer they purpese shall be convinced that he gain point above other by seek much be find and notwithstanding any rub in the way we must beaew weattempt how many attack have make on flis fecretere could make breach in it à have not intimate alexander and cut the gordian knot should have be still to seek shall now gladly impart to the artist ali my discovery and improvement and refer it to he judgment whether they be of any moment the number of the colour be six and these be divide into tzoo fort the former sort contain the yelloz red and blue which be call capital colour the latter be mix fort consist of green purple and violet these have the aame of sreak colour waite and black be not reckone among the colour but rather potential or efficient because the other can not have they effect without the help of theythese colour have also they emblematic fignification and particular property the zehite be take in general for light and black for darkness the yellow for lustre and glory the red for power or love the blue for the deity the purple for authority and jurisdiction the violet for fubjection the green for servitude the colour confider in themselves be certain faculty imperceptible without the interposition of and lay on body like the moon which could not receive she light from the sun much lesscommunicate it of we gtherwise than by means of body white be also that from wbich the cobur cone forth and the body whereby they become perceptible to ue the cofour give life to all thing without in reference to the art of paenting those it would be imposlible to distinguisn between life and death wood and stone air and water gold and silver nay light and darkness they have particular great power uniting by they agreement separate by they force and crudity they cause some thing to disappear in thin air and force other to appar out of the backgrounds they variety produce the utmost charm and harmony as well in nature as in picture especially when in the latter they be dispose by judicious hand for what be more beautiful in landscape than a azure fky green field deck with thousand varioussycoloured flower differentlycoloured grounds this russet or yellow that green or grey as each require also the ornament of the brown cypresstree the grey willow the fair olive the white poplar the green alder the red fir and joyful linden éach accord to its nature add to this the diversity of stonework how agreeable seem the porphiry of tomb the serpentinestone obelfk the white marble vafe and terme even architecture receive vast addition by the different colour of stone as when the dark grey stone freestone white marble and such like be finely match and put together and the building within be adorn with redsperklegreenish jasper porphiry ornament of gold silver copper and alabaster and the floor inlaid with all fort of costly stone as lapis lazuli porphiry and variegate marble in order to please the eye but all depend on a orderly disposition it be impofible to effect any thing charming with such costlinef if those colour be not duly match and artfully place it be therefore highly necessary that the artist know perfectly they nature and particular effect in order to proceed with certainty as good writer acquainted with letter bestow he thought on word only as forthe disposition it must be observe that as in a ordonnance of many figure divide into group one of these figure be always the principal and to which all the rest must be subordinate accord to they rank so it be the same in the colour that they may altogether produce good general harmony nay be it recessary to place the three capital colour together the yellow must be forward the red next and the blue behind which will produce fine harmonythe three other colour may be dispose in the same manner when the purple be place forward the violet may be behind it and the green last as be the weakest these latter colour be call weak and break because they possess very much the quality of the former the purple for instance be produce by mixture of red with blue the violet the same and the green of blue with yellow but though each of the colour have itdifferent force and effect yet they do not observe any particular rank or order because strong colour sometimeshappens to come before weak one and the contrary as occasion require for be they always the keep order and the yellow to be principal so that the other must diminisn gradually there wouldthen be no difference butthe effect always one and the same whercas it be here as with a actor who sometimes play king at other god vet if the principal part in picture whether through choice or neceffity consist of white light or weak colour the part about it how beautiful soever will be no obstruction if they be but varioussy and well order again if the say principal part consist of yellow red blue or green and be there by set off all the other part ought to be intermix here and there withsmall portion of this strong and predominant part as if they be enamel with it yet in such manner that they seem to owe they origin to the say ruling part and though separate yet have but one effect and uitethe whole like the great body of the moon surround with glitter star this suffice for the order the colour in general and yet they can not have they full effect or due decorum without chuse proper backgrounds for set they off agreeably avoid those which create confusion or be too harsh and discordant of the former fort be such as follow white suit on all sort of darkgrounds except warm yellow light yellow suit on purple violet blue and green light blue or green violet and yellow not warm or fiery light green have good effect on purple violet and blue light light violet have the same on green and blue on white suit black violet green and purple but not yellow or blue on light yellow fuit violet purple and green on pale red fuit green and blue on pale green fuit purple blue yellow and violet on pale blue suit dark yellow red and green but be we to lay dark blue on light yellow or the contrary it would appear very harsh and disagreeable there be other colour wbich be neither harsh nor disagreeable in themselves and yet appear unpleasant and without force as if one or the other be quite dirty and muddle such be purple on red beautiful red on yellow or beautiful green on yellow purple on blue or violet and the contrary also white on warin yellow and the contrary or red upon red or blue upon blue as experience teach touch the colour which be use in reflect on changeable silk shall say this that with muskcolour suit best masticot with light purple or violet in the reflexion with afficolour blue suit yellowisn white reflect with rosecolour with orpiment agree dark purple with bluc reflexion on beautifui green suit rosecolour with light blue reflexion and with purple or violet agree napleyellow withseagreen reflexion but we must especially observe that all reflect or changeable stuff kecep they own colour in the shade to wit that of the main light for we must not commit the same mistake as the old master who paint all changeable drapery with two colour only as yellow changeable stuff with blue reflexion they make the main light yellow and the shade blue and thus they manage all other truly great mistake and quite contrary to naturé since we have thus far engage in the bycolour and they effect and harmony we shall also treat of thole which tend in particular to embellisn land¬ scape history or other painting on graf pale red be exceed well set off and appear pleasant to the eye as also dark violet dark blue light yellow changeable silk with red and white and light blue with purple or violet reflexion on russet earth grounds agree à dark violet blue and dark green on dark grey stone commonly call bluestone agree light red green yellow and yellowish white on freestone suit all dark colour viz purple violet blue and green but we must not use colour of pure lake and white nor single light and red orpiment without urgent necessity and then very sparingly the green and red of one tint either in light or shade also disagree on account of they harshness wherefore they must not come together in piece of many or few figure which be to hang against dark ground or in shady place also in landscape against dark and close boscage white have fine effect especially napleyellow red and light orpiment vermilion and fine light red again in light apartment of white marble orlight freestone or in landscape paint light clear and full of sky blue purple violet green and black have good effect whereas the colour beforename be in this case not only disagreeing but they also look weak and without strength except white which cannot be use too much since it be no colour and therefore suit any where except against fky nevertheleis do not here asfert that the embellishment in the aforesaid picture must consist only of light and warm colour but that they be intermix with some dark and zeak one and that in the latter picture where we use dark and weak colour for the byornament we must dispose some light and zoarm one among they now some may possibly think because we place blue by the other colbur that such would obstruct the offskip or that the lointain which by reason of distance be commonly represent blue would be damage by so beautiful spot but this doubt may be soon clear up by consider that do not chuse here all dark colour but that the offskip will thereby in some measure appear more distant faint and uniting it be also true that blue in landscape be often harsh and make the painting look flar but by the darkness it become in this case soft natural and tender besides blue mention also violet green but my meaning thereby be not that it be indifferent zhere those colour be place as blue against the blue of the sky green against greën tree violet against violetstone or ground or light against light and darknef against darknef for that would be improper because as there be light and darkness in landscape so we have always means to give dark and light colour they place with candlelight either within or withoutdoor or other light proceed from fire suit violet purple blue green white black red without exception these be piece in which those colour have a advantageous effect and wherein they predominate on they proper grounds for yellow and red be almost the same as burn candle which have great effect by night as it have none in the daytime because the sunshine make it hardly perceptible now as the two former picture consist of strong colour viz white yellow and red and the two latter of purple violet blue and green yet those of the one fort may be join to those of the other in order to create a agreeable mixture and harmony by place with the strong some that be weaker and on the contrary let each in its place have the mastery on its proper ground but have particularly observe that out of the three aforesaid predominant colour other may be temper of less force brown oker with naple yellow pink with white and such like and place they by the other as middle colour we may in conjunction with those other setch out great maf since white have tts degree as well as red always observe that the principal mnst predominaie both in force and beauty and that those colour which be draw from it be disperse here and there through the whole piece as be best set off against the general ground have now plainly shew the quality and use of the colour and they difference we may easily think that the picture wherein they be consider must need be very affect we shall not here say uhat where and how one colour mix with another be to appear because it be impossible and unconceivable the principal method for obtain this secret be to observe to what piich we work up we first and strongest colour and to let this colour predominaie for which reason it be maxim with some that we must not introduce into picture more than one capital colour or colour which represent it but have already shew that several may in that manner be brougnt together in the same piece wherefore the eye and judgment must determine this point for if we find it proper to introduce beautiful colour where we have mind to place such a one why should it be bad this only make it so it be accompany by by colour not well order as warm colour against warm and grey near blue whereby those colour have no effect or else by place too strong and too many capital colour by one another which overcome the aforesaid beautiful colour and make the painting look slaring but that we may not mistake in this point let we chuse any colour and in order to find a affociate for it take one which be discordant as if we pitch upon red take grey one if dark light one thus they be as proceed from each other join together and by such means we can never be at lois in find different colour for different drapery yet with this proviso that in all those colour the force or distance of the figure must be observe for the ready obtain these thing have find out very easy method which always shew I the particularity and harmony of the colour it even often help I with certainty over the difficulty about the difference of the colouis in drapery especially such as be changeable first temper on my pallet out of my general mixture fhree particular colour viz one for the main light one for the halfhade and one for the shade then take card and severally paint they with one of the aforesaid temper colour when they be dry place and replace and shift they so long till have satisfied my judgment sometimes when this would not answer my purpose shuffle they and then take parcel from they at random which if they happen to please be my director this method help I most in reflect drapery which there by often produce very advantageous and ef sine colour it be especially useful when have any doubt whether such or such colour would suit well with such or such a onc or not for the card certainly shew I the thing as well as if have the stuff themselves and save I the trouble of uncertain inquiry it will not be amiss to say something further touch backgrounds it often happen that person see colour in picture which seem to he very agreeable and yet on imitate it he find he colour have not the same force and effect through he not observe against what ground that colour be paint point worthy of the utmost attention if we would avoid mistake in colour wherefore we must always observe the grounds and place of the colour if we would have we colour predominate order the most disagreeing against it for instance to make the yellow predominate place blue against it or else the dark of other colour would you abare the force of yellow place green near it and to bring it lower put colour which proceed from yellow whether it be freestone or any thing else of yellow tint in the same manner you may handle all the rest of the colour observe that as the object diminisn by distance so the colour must proportionably be fainter and gradually more grey nature shew it and yet have find that we may place even capital colour in the offskip and it shall be prevent from approach by accompany it with cclour like it and draw originally from it as we have before shew chap ii of the property nature and colour of dress the have before say that the art of painting be a imitation of nature in she visible part nothing be impracticable to it and yet observe due order in all thing and as we have before shew the general order of the colour so we shall now handle it in particular with respect to drapery wherein it chiesly lie drapery consist of four kind of thing viz line silk stuff and cloth and these have each they particular nature and manners of fold they property be also different and to shew they by a example shall divide the kind into the four time of the day line drapery be for people in the morning of they life silk for those in they zenith stuff for those in the afternoon and cloih for those in the evening of they life but to speak more intelligibly there be four particular condition of man viz infancy youth manhood and old age and each provide dress accord to he year child should be dress in line young people in silk fullgrow man and woman in stuff and old people in cloth the colour for the several stage of life be these for childhood white for youth green for manhood red for old age dark violet and for death black in the first chapter we have shew that white and black be not account among the colour since the one be but the parent of colour and the other the depriver of they wherefore we introduce white as light without which no calour be visible dark sillemot or tazny shall serve to represent the earth or greenness zohite to snew the water blue the air red thefire and black the darkness abcve the element of fire for there be not any matter or æther beyond it which can contain or be penetrate by thesunray we also know that there be four season viz the joyful spring golden summer fruitsul autumn and melancholy winter in the spring we begin to leave off cloth or heavy winter raiment and to wear thin stuff summer and autumn permit we to dress accord to they heat either in line or silk wherefore certain author say that we ought to suit we dress as well as we word to the season the season may be also express by colour as the spring by green summer by yellow autumn by red and winter by black yet among the deity there be some who have always one proper dress and colour as jupiter purple mantle juno blue veil diana white and blue garment neptune seagreen one these we can not alter without commit mistake but the figure must nevertheless be order if possible zohere they suit best all brave personage of either sex should likewise be clothed in red or warm yellow it therefore behove prudent artist to have perfect knowledge of the nature and quality of the aforename stuff even be the figure ever so small he must notwithstanding shew in he work of zehat sort of stuff the dress consist and although reftexion can not be well observe in small figure yet we ought to see by the course of the fold whether the drapery be silk cloth or other stuff neat painter in little ought also not only to distinguisn the thickness and thinness of he drapery by they fold and colour but in the particular nature and colour of each drapery they diminution and variation as between thin and thick silk oppose to sattin and more such for if the eye at first sight can perceive and distinguisn they we ought also to make they appear what they be chiessy in small and highlyfinish picture as mieris and other have artfully do to such degree as plainly to distinguisn between silver pewter tin and polisn iron as becomingness subsist not only in the stuff but also in they colour so know that we shall not easily mistake in the choice of colour and drapery but must here give some painter a hint about the nature of stuff especially coloured one they believe they can paint sattin after white silk and changeable silk after coloured silk but this be lame work for what in plain silk be shine in the light will often be find quite dark in satiin wherefore in this nature must be consult for these reason the eye be pleased when in painting of concourse of people or publick shew it can easily distinguisn all sort of people and the condition and age of both sex and at the same time they motion accord to they nature and quality and the dress and colour which become they as a old man heavy and weak standing on both leg and sometimes by the help of stick become long darkcoloured cloth garment viz of umber dark violet fillemot or black fasten with string or buckle and set on he somewhat negligently young man should appear in quite contrary motion as be frolicksome fickle airy and stand often on one leg he must be paint in most beautiful purple green red or yellow drapery of light stuff or thick silk fasten on the shoulder and not too long that it may not hinder he continual motion because man if full of fire love to have he leg free woman and young virgin as be tender sedate and modest be chiesly distinguished by they white garment of thin linnen and all sort of airy and womanisncoloured silk viz light blue appleblossom pearlcolour or light lemon cast loossy on eachother and in such .manner that the beauty of the naked may easily appear appear through they they posture be modest and set they leg close they body upright they neck basnfully bend they arm close to they body they mode gay and take hold of they garment which hang down to the foot child be see mostly in white linnen or lemon blue or violetcoloured silk they be often in white vest without any hanging drapery but when they have such loose drapery small one about yard in length be sufficient and this fasten on the shoulder for security while they be run bustling and roll on the ground this conduct be in my opinion of great consequence though few have observe it nay even some good painter oftentime fail in it make no difference between manly and womanisn colour give a old man feminine colour and manly onc to woman intermix they as if there be no certain rule for either but it must be grant that the silkcolour which befit young sturdy capricious man be very disagreeable to virgin who be tender weak more sedate and less voluptuous he require strong she more soft and beautiful colour yield pleasure to the eye it would also be very improper to paint child in black young man in dark brown colour grow man in party colour and a old man in beautiful one once see picture of a unknown master in which all the particular have recommend be plainly and nicely express it have such a elegance and give I so great satisfaction that stand in surprize on mature consideration of this painting perceive that it be purely design to answer this very purpose for see here and there some aged people mostly in dark and clothcolour there agam group of young and gamesome people in variety of beautifulcoloured stuff also fome woman in lightcoloured changeable filk near they be some old woman in dark dress here and there appear child run about and play in the sand all drest in linenhabit and soft colour this ordonnance vastly pleafed I and put I to consider what it could be like to and find it to be the same as the four time of the day for let we take the child whether boy or girl for daybreak the young man and woman for noon when the sun be at highest and the old people for night between midday and night be vesper or the evening which may be represent by join something of both condition also between aurora and midday the same so as make in the whole proper differenee between the condition and age of man here let we not forget that old people sometimes affect white to shewthey become child again contrarily black be sometimes wear by young people as thin black veil to signify some sorraw or else to distinguish marry woman from maid chap iii of tle colour of dress and they fuit with each other as we be treat of mress it will be proper to say something of the suit they colour mean what lining or furniture each coloured garment require quire matter of great moment though as little observe in picture as the life wherefore let it be note first of the weak colour when the apper garment be white the lining or undercoat may be rise colour fillemot purple violet or beautiful seagreen with light blue garment suit furniture of yellowish white violet dark fillemot or dark reddish blue light or pale yellow garment ought to be furnish with violet sea green beautiful green dark fillemot and purple pale green garment must be set off with yellowish white skycolour violet and dark red now follow the strong colour and they proper mixture lemon colour garment may be furnish with sea green violet and dark fillemot garment of red orpimentcolour suit furniture of violet sky and greenish blue musk and umbercolour skycolour blue garment may be adorn with rose colour yellowish white pale yellow and light beautiful green fillemotcoloured garment may be furnish with pale yellow rosecolour light afhicolour violet dark purple and dark green all these colour reverse have the same effect here let it be observe what mean by the word ljurniturej it be a adornment or set off as when large drapery of plain colour be adorn with one or more small one whether veil girdle or sleeveface under garment or breastcloth this furniture be either of changeable silk or of partycoloured stuff when it be to set off large and plain coloured drapery and the contrary the same as when the large drapery be changeable the small furniture ought to be of single colour for further satisfaction shall subjoin a instruction of what coloured stuff may be best adorn with gold whether slower leaf or stripe on green ground fuit flower on purple and violet narrow sprig or stripe on muskcolour close and large flower or leave on rosecolour appleblossom and white thin silk suit stripe purple fillemot muskcolour and white also look well with fringe either scanty or full accord to the substanee of the stuff it must be observe that what have hitherto say of the ordering of the colour be not to concern single figure only but to serve any occasion by diffuside and agreeable intermixture nor do mean that among several figure there must be but one withsinglecoloured garment and the rest of changeable or break colour forwhen they be separate and the drapery large each in particular be to be set off in the manner have before lay down for instance if all the small drapery be separate from the large one and we drest as many figure in they then each must be further adorn with other small drapery of colour suit withit in such manner as the large one be before in word if we only confider that single colout ought to be intermix with changeable one and changeable colour with single one we shall perceive what order this affair require in order to look decorous and please the eye but for further explanation shall give two example of it the first be company of five or six aged people either without or withindoor now if these figure must be all drest it require no art nor be it sign of knowledge to give each singlecoloured and equally large drapery although we might find as many different colour in order to join they agreeably and this for two reason first because that can not happen in the life without premeditation and secondly because the figure may not seem to be emblematic for though to the twelve apostle be appropriate they particular colour yet we must not infer from thence that if they be all asfemble together we ought to give they single colour from top to toe because though we break the colur they yet remain the same as blue with green reflexion remains blue yellow with purple remains yellow and so of other we second example be wanton meeting of young man and girl modishly drest accord to they year these be skip about and play in field or room now it would not be at all proper to join all they dress of break colour together though they be couple in such order as they require and for the former reason namely that it can never happen but through premeditation and necessity and though it would appear elegant and pleasing yet not at all artful without a intermixture of some singlecoloured drapery nevertheless we find many do it either because they take no delight in changeable drapery or else because they can not paint they and therefore make shift with broken colour again there be other who have no value for single colour and therefore on all occasion introduce changeable or broken one we have also meet with third sort who do not know how to make difference between changeable stuff and break colour though it be certain that reflect or changeable drapery be a intermixture of two or more colour and breakcoloured drapery but of two as violet with red and blue green with yellow and blue whence they be call break or miwe colour in the first chapter treat of this management we have speak of reflect or changeable drapery and as we be now again embark in the same subject it will not be amiis to explain the matter further many fancy they make good reflect drapery when it be well fold and different in colour in the main light greatest shade and reflection even raphael and other great master have be mistaken in so do whereas good changeable drapery ought to dracv its reflection from the colour of which the main light consist the shade likewise proceed from the ruling colour yet have some tincture of the changeableness and although the drapery be changeable yet it have constant groundcolour of the main woor of the silk thus it be a usual exprefsiona green and yellow changeable this then be the true quality of refect silk that all that be see front on the relief keep its main colour but the side of the fold go off cause the changeableness which we may easily perceive on layung changeable stuff smooth on table or floor for view it perpendicularly from above it will then appear red or vellow but if see parallel along the stuff often appear blue when it follow as we affirm that only the folus which go eff become changeabee and alter in colour when thet other in the main light and shade keep they own colour again what in one stuff change red will in another appear green or yellow accord to the woof or warp by reason of such accident we be oblige to have piece of particular stuff in order to shew the difference which can not be learn by heart because of the nicety of the matter we have say in the forego chapter that in a ordonnance of many figure we ought to observe the sex age and condition of people and that each must have he proper stuff the golden suit deity and those who be deify purple become prince thus each down tothe slave now to those of weak memory shall shew good method for they become master of this point in fhort time set down in you pocketbook the follow head or title old man and mairon marry man and woman young man aud maiden boy girl and young child place these title under one another and write against they the proper dress stuff and colour of each sex and condition these note you must often consult and especially when you be about a ordonnance of fewor many figure you may also make column for the colour of drapery set they down under one another as white yellow blue green red and against they write they lining andi ornament asthave before mention it will not be improper here to observe some particutar on different occasion in a ordonnance of many or few figure with respect to colour noé as if they be unknown or not observe by ingenious artist but because they be oftentime neglect and slighted either through carelessness prepoffession or a opinion that they need notbe sostrictly confine or else because beautiful colour be most pleasing to people and therefore they must especially satisfy the eye without reflect that they there by injure the art and they own reputatation such painter be like great talker who say little to the purpose truly the colour have great efficacy whenwell orderedi and suired bug they raise a aversion when unskilfully and confusedly dispose a ingenious person will undoubtedly agreë with I that there be particulur character which distinguisn one man from another pringeefrom anpfficer aan officer from vulgar person rich man froin pgor one by whaf means then be this difference perceivedp be it not by he authoritative countenance grandeur and stately carriage and by he garbsonger ansf of miore costly stuff and beauty than the other ifso it will be éasy to appiehend that though luch person be not endow with all the aforesaid quality but with thecontrary he ought nevertheless to be make know by something ior other as we have shew in treat of ordonnante whefore be it needless ten say any thing further in this matter to bring we to the present point touiching the colour namely to shew on what occafion they olght to be use beautifully and op what not for which purpose shall éxhibit three principal accurience as exaiple whence we may deduce and order all other the first may be à coüneil or lriumph or such liké wherein all thedressas ought to appear intirely of the tuost magnificent rich and beautiful stuff in the second confist of bacchanal countrymerrymakings and herdfinensport the colour ought to be half beautiful and half break each agreeable to the condition of the party and in the third be publick sight viz pleading mountebank juggler merryandrew and such like make up of common and mean people coarse stuff and dirty colour ought to be be most visible now here it still be to be remark that in the one fort of colour as well as the other the most beautiful excel and as those three occurrence be not common imust say that among the meanest as well as the best there be some which have the preference among the beautiful be some more beautiful and among the mean meaner one thus much as to colaur in order to know good master but ere we finisn this chapter iet we observe in what part thé coloured stuff appear most beautiful since stuff be very different in this respect and have they diver proper beauty we say then that black stuff be most beautiful in they strongest saade zuhite yellozp and red in they main and greateft light and blue green and purple in the half tint but all stuff not have glof ought to be much more beautiful in they light than they shade because light give life and make the quality of the colour appear when contrarily snade obscure and extinguish they beauty consequently all object will shew they natural colour better when they surface be lef fmooth and even as we see in cloths line leave and herb which be rough or hairy in which no gloss or shine can appear because they can not receive the reffexion of neigbour object but fhew only they true and natural colour unmixed nor ting with that of any other object except the rednef of sthe sun when by he tet he make the cloud and horizon partake of he colour chap of the disposition of sbady object either distant or near against light ground ight against light and fhade against shade naturally unite against llight ground suit well dark figure and against dark ground lightone in order that they may be strongly set off however the setting off of object either much little or less on the sirst second and third grounds certainly differ very much now it may be afk when parcel of figure stand or sit have zobite background and appear some far from other rear other against it whether dark colour would not be proper in allthe three group say they would but then they ought to be confider in another manner for without intermix some of they with light colour they could not subsist wherefore it be necesary to give some more other less force the figure close to the white ground ought to be mix with light colour in order to stick to the light and to break the less they force and yet the dark colour will predominate the light one of colour only as say to have communication with the white ground thereby to keep they distance and to unite with the great light of the back ground the figure on the second ground which come more forward ought again to have less light colour and the group on the fore ground the least whereby they have less communication with the white ground and consequently more force against it it be the same with light against darknef for we can easily perceive that white and black never approach each other without participation the more black be mix with white the more it incline to white like large and thick festoon mostly light place against dark ground now if you would have this festoon appear close to the wall for it be not with nature as with picture you must need use it in some dark flower and leave order they about the extremity the moft white or light to be in the part moft relieved darkening it gradually towards the two extremity nearest the ground whereby the one stick to the other and unite remain yet light festoon though intermix vith darkness it be the same with dark festoon against light ground the dark flower be in the middle and gradually diminisn on each side it be certain that it will not shew such decorum and relief though it be shade be in proportion as strong as that of the former yet it be only to be use in case of necessity when the matter and condition of the place require it wherefore we must accommodate ourselves to all exigency this effect be not only proper for slower but also for fruit ornament even all kind of gold and silver ornament may with elegance be join together by the colour after the same manner now follow a example in plate bxi dispose after the aforesaid manner here on the fore ground appear five figure of man and woman against white back ground the three middle one close together be dark and strong and the two on either side of little lighter colour whereby the group keep a agreeable relief and union on the extremity on more distant ground stand two other figure of which the foremost be dark and the other half behind the former light yet both of less strength than the foremost group the last four standing close against the ground differ still much from the other as be here and there intermix with more light one have white stomacher another white cloth on she head this have flower that with light hair another with white pot light drapery nudity which littleness notwithstanding have not so much force as to enlighten the whole group the doctrine of harmony teach that we must always place darkness against light and the contrary but this be only medium shew agreeable to that position how and in what manner light and darkness may appear either close together or distant like the aforesaid festoon but it must not be consider otherwise than as part of picture if we would have perfect ordonnance we can order at pleasure fuch dark figure as those against light grounds and the contrary for instance would you have on the right side of the piece adark bush in the mièdle visto and on the other side house or stonework neither light nordark you may place against the buih light figure or other object and in the middle against the offscape dark one and against the house other again which suit best execute each correctly and in particular accord to the say example and then nothing will be want that concern the tint the colour join toit make the work compleat think have fully explain this point of darkness against light and the contray yet several thing serve my purpose still occure to I which be forget in the first chapter judge they proper to be mention here say then that all light colour even be they break appear wellagainst dark ground but not with such force as the strong one as we have formerly say that warm colour appear best on faint ground and the contrary whether they be light or dark it be also constant rule that the strong colour as light red and light yellow do not suit on light or white ground more than beautiful blue on dark one though reckone capital colour but let we return to we examiple we have hitherto only speak of the tint or light and darkness it will now be necessary to shew also the colour of the dress accord to they order place and power no be sea green yellowisni grey violet less beautiful green than no violet not beautiful but the girdle beautiful light yellow oker and violet reflectiongreenisn blue red orpimentviolet umber with little red observe now from behind forward whether these figure as they advance do not become gradually stronger by the intermixture of strong colour the offgroup have none that in the middle have one and the foremost two of which one be very strong lf it be afk why place here the strong one namely red orpiment as hav¬ ing no force against light ground say it must be observe as the foremost figure be encompass with two dark one let it also not be think because thus exhibit the colour of each figure that they ought therefore to be of the same colour from top to toe consult the sketch and remember they drapery one large another small of broken and faint colour with which they be intermix and suit the ground as we have already intimate that in order to form great mass of capital colour viz yellow red or blue and they to predominate in a ordonnance we may enlarge or break such strong part with mixtnre of the fame as ted orpiment with brown oker umber or such like zohich nevertheless remain yellow after such manner we may handle all the colour to wit beautiful green with other green red with purple violet with blue or grey yellowish white with grey in à word if but one of the two be less beautiful chap of the harmony of colour they who be conversant with book be sensible that fewauthor have write of the harmony of colour and what they have do be so obscure and unintelligible that shall endeavour to make the point clear it must be grant that in every part of the art nature be we patern since she dispose herself in the most perfect manner if we at any time discover something fine and pleasing in she which we often do and yet know not the réason why it have such elegance and decorum we ought to consult the rule of disposition and harnony and examine with which of they the object agree by which mean we shall soon apprehend what decorum be and on what reason found harmony proceed from place faint colour against strong one and the contrary wherein such a union appear that the one seem naturally to floi from the other as in this instance let we suppose a ordonnance to be divide into three grounds or distance place the principle figure in the middle on the foreground and let some of they be strongly coloured and the whole group as strongly sling off by shady hollow rock come behind they place to the right on the second ground some figure beautifully coloured yet tint darker than those on the foreground and behind they a airy greyishgreen bush and further on light offscape fill here and there with small tree let this bush be tint darker than the second groundfigure on the left side of which ground place other figure as of girl and young child in faintcoloured drapery which though come against light building and the blue sky of the offscape will notwithstanding appear beautiful and harmonious now in such disposition we be enable to perceive horv each of the three part keep its distance by the nature of the ground behind it the foremost as the strongest and consist mostly of light approach with force against the greatest snade and those on each side though almost as light yet be limitted by they back grounds which differ but one tint from they whereby they appear neither further nor nearer than they really be from all which premise we may plainly perceive that grant those three part or group have like strengih and colour yet they may by means of they back grounds be bring down in such manner that at pleafure only one of they shall predominate and the other tzoo retire would you have the foremest figure dark reverse you former conduct and you purpose be answer thus you may easily join grounds and object in order to fetch out harmony and by harmony one of the perfection of painting but the more clearly to evince the force of colour against proper grounds with respect to distance shall explain the matter in second example see plate x xii irepresent the boat as thé nearest object gill with gold and strongly glitter against the shade of the tree and rock to the foremost fly figure on tke same distance as the boat give light red drapery against the shadiness of the say rock in force equal to that of the boat the second fly figure somewhat further in have green drapery also light against the rock where be break colour it become fainter and the third which be further in shade and have dark blue drapery be flung off and keep it be place at the furthest part of the hollow of the rock which with the yellowisn blue sky next it be lightish the standing figure in the stern or offpart of the boat be more strongly fet off by dark and warm yellow drapery against the aforefaid hollow than the blue garment of the hindermost fly figure and less than the boat s head and timber which have the greatest force as be the greatest part double by the reflexion in the water on the riverside against the tree be see other figure partly naked and in faintcoloured drapery viz appleblossom light changeable and white intermix here and there with yellow and they reflexion and that of the green of the tree in the water now those figure though faint and light be in they diminution of force in the same degree with the middle fly figure as have the same distance and be of the same nature and compose of break colour so also the red of the foremost fly figure agree with the yellow of the boat both be strong colour the rower be in dark blue though this example sufficiently enable we to manage any ordonnance whatso ever yet mean not that there must be always forward yellow object behind it blue one and in the middle green purple or violet for you may chuse zohat colour you please as instead of this gill boat red one and give the fore flying figure instead of red yellow drapery affign to each proper back ground although the yellow of the boat and tne red garment of the figure be strong colour yet they be distinct in nature for as the yellow be in itself lighter than the red so the red require darker colour than the yellow in order to be flung off again if instead of the figure by the riverside which be clothed in appleblosom blue we would use other colour as green or red we may do so provide as before we give they such proper back ground as will fling they off with respect to they distance for it must be remark that although they be distant yet there be no necessity for give they faint or break colour li be maxim with I that any colour how strong soever may be moderate and restram becording to its distance the colour in this example be dispose accotd to they rank the strong one forward and the weaker in degree of distance according to they nature only to shew the method of place they in word whethe they be to approach because of they natural strength or to retire by reason of they natural weakness but it be scarce possible that in ary subject all the colour sheuld accord to they nature happen to fall so advantageously and therefore we may on any occasion alter they for instance if instead of the gill boat we be to introduce piece of white marble adorn with moulding and baf relief and strongly light the visto behind turn into close ground and the tree behind the stonework instead of greyisn more sensible warm and approach this stone say would have the same effect as the boat and come forward with force though white we all know be not so strong colour as yellow for herein it will happen as in camp where in the generalabsence the liestenantgeneral command and in company and in company the lieutenant for the captain tain and the ensign for he even the serjeant be not without he power therefore when strongnature colour be not in picture the weaker supply they place in greater or less degree as the matter require wherein lie the crisis of the management let I add to this instance of the white stoneworkthat it must be the strongest and most catch object in the whole ordonnance and that no strong object must come near it to lessen it s force or to kill it unless they be weaken and bring down either by mistiness or by means of they backgrounds whereby they may then have no more force than break colour chap vi of the dispofition of irregular object and light against darkness and the contrary hhe place and ordering of object be of great moment for if after we have choose they all most beautiful we dispose they carelesly they will abate of they lustre again good dispofition will make a object though unelegant in itself look agreeable to give fome example of it fhall begin with plate x xiii on the foreground on the right fide be lie a overset pot against large overset pot against large ftone and both of they strong and warm in the light against the darkness of same high tree which be on the second ground on the third ground lowver and by the waterside rife column building which be light again in the middle of the piece the horizon appear very low with some hill and on the foreground ape three figure make the greatest group and mostly in warm and darkcoloured drapery against the faintness and light of the offscape on the second ground be young man who with the house at the door of which he stand be beloz in the shade occafion by the groundshade of the tree opposite to it this house be of freestone and therefore light against the blue fky the foreground have no verdure and be all light chiefly about the figure this iketch shew we the irregularity of object in a ordonnance and how we ought to dispose they accord to art some high ofher low together with they force in order to create deverfify decorum by object imean both the moveable and immoveable viz man cattle bird tree hill building as well horizontal as fall back behind each other as to force it consist in light against darkness and the contrary for except by the diverfity of colour there be no other way than this to set off object against one another we have faid that the three foreground figure be strongly coloured and come againft the faint offacape whereby shew that in one piece there ought pot to be two light on the same ground although they be both strongly set off hut that one part must consist of strong light and the other of darkness it be also casy to conceive that the three figure because they come against the light offscape scape and not into shade must need require dark colour contrarily the pot and stone be set off against the dark tree by general rule that when there be some light object on one side of the composition those on the other should be dark let we now view seeond example in plate x xiv as be a observation depend on the former see neither can subsist without the other this tend to illustrate the management of light both above on each side and behind one anothe and that we ought always to order after such manner when the former example shew we the irregularity of object in they high and loze disposition the forward sitting figure be with the first ground dark as be shade by drive cloud so also be the walking figure down to its middle the building on the second ground front the light together with the two standing figure which be set off by the dark side of the house thethree hinmost figure be in the shade of the same building against the sky which be they ground the column also on the second ground be almost to the top in shade against the hindmost tree which run to the point of sight the man be half again in the light against the dark column and he under part which with the first ground be dark be set off against the second ground which be light but it be not sufficient to place here or there groundshade we must also shew the occasion of it that it may not be afk what cause it for all snade be not alike some be more dark other more clear moreover they differ also sometime in colour wherefore it will not be amiss to say sometliing of it here though shall treat of it more at large in its place the ground shade of tree often appear lefss or more green accord to they transparency or closeness the groundshadecause by driving cloud be faint and have no other colour than that of the air between the ground shade of red green or blue stretch curtain be also of the same colour those of a house or other heavy piece of stonework be grey and dark but to return to we subject it be plain that what be demonstrate in these two example touch light and darkness above on each side and behind one another be the same when reverse namely if that which be now dark be light andthe light dark it be also indubitable that if one of the light be take away the ordonnance and agreeable harmony would be spoiled at once even so much as not to be bring right again withont general alteration for instance suppose the walking person be dark above how could he be set off by the column since we have beforé say that darkness against darkness be improper and be thé column to be light how should we manage the sky .. and if the sky be dark behind the column that would be as bad again for the whole fore ground and all upon it be dark and the second ground be light again wherefore every thing would be in disorder and indecorum from these premise we may plainly perceive that this be constant method for management and when good difposition of the colour accord to they quality be join to it for we knniv that object have various colour of which we can chuse the most proper the decorum will still he the greater and the eye more pleased tree though they appear always green be yet yet diversify accord to the season and they nature some be seagreen other deep green this russet that greygreen these again light green other dark green grounds likewise differ as hilly sandy clayish and muddy stone do the same all which we have fully shew in the first chapter of this book as for man none except what colour have they not in fine he who well understand the ordering of the colour and the suit they will never be at loss but let he especially observe that in any ordonnance whether of history landscape or any other branch one side must be contrary to the other not only in light and shade but also in height and depth the design of these two example be not much unlike that in the forego chapter yet here be greater variety for the former be of the force of object either dark or light against contrary grounds whereas these though grounded on the same observation shew we how they be to be order above one another when it so fall out for instance we see group of figure on the fore ground against another on the second ground somewhat higher and that against another still higher and so on to the cieil or sky we have shew in chap how we ought to set off object behind one another and to unite they with the ground but these example teach first how light and dark object above one another ought to be mamage so as to serve each other and that each may keep its distance secondly how for warn of shade we must make shift with the affistance of colour lastly how irregular object ought to be place against each other which be the soul and life of a ordonpance especially where there be many people but it be not confine to humas figure for it respects all sort of object whether grounds hill ballustrade ragtlement window roof cloud and sky in fine every thing we can see behindany thing else whereon people can appear speak of cloud it must r?observed that we may reprefent figure fly in the air and sit on cloud the same manner as on the earth matter of principal concern on the occasion where the major part of the object consist of height and many be at lose in the different light colour and tint wherefore docible artist à regard he as a infallible rule and consider every thing which have lay down in the bresaid example to prevent you falling into the mistake which be gerein finally commit shall now subjoin third sketch plate x xv touch the crossing and go off of sequel of the two precede example boat go off against crof height or earthern wall river people be lean by one another who with the tree rise bethe regularity of the wall the approach figure appear again offscape which run acrof be in strong light against the shady wall which end in the middle where the foremoft approach figure be set off with light both hindward dark figure which have they effect again against the light of the building in the offscape the sky on the right side of the piece abound with heavy hanging cloud and on the other side be none orlvery small one here we perceive first greot motion in the disposition of the objcct which cross crof each other up to the horizon on one side and on the other the contrary which cause a agrecable variety especially as there be some object go off which shew the point of sight the second obfervation be the harmany of lignt and shade as in the former example this example then shew what method we may take in order to fetch out such effect and it be for that reason that this point be exhibit severally and in different manners which we may make use of as occasion offer as much or as little as we think proper though never too much since variety tire no one but be always pleasing as here visto there boscage house here wind road there again build hide part of the offscape here level ground there river beset with tree partly run towards the point of sight and then bend either to the right or leavecross the piece round rock and at last to doappear variety feed continual delightful desire but we must know that it principally respects ordonnance in the open air or landscape chap vii of agreebleness in irregular and contrast object twe have not knowledge in composition all that we endeavour at beextravagancy even should we bring out good disposition it would be ow to luck when wellorder piece though indifferentlv coloured will always have a harmony the truth of this find clearly evince in irregular object which give life and motion to a ordonnance as we have several time shew in treating of ordonnance and also in the first and last example of the forego chapter this motion be happily fetch out if the contrast object be considerately join for by this mean they will meet each other so agreeably as perfectly to please the eye not as place thus by nature but as the result of a artful composition by the irregularity of object understand they form as when one be high another be oblong this point that square round oval but ere proceed further shall shew the easy method take in order to get the knowledge of irregularity first draw all sort of figure in different action as sit stand staning lie walk and cut they out with seifsor next make sketch of my ordonnance and lay it down flat and put my cut figure upon it move they about till be satisfied where to place fitting stand or lie one how many suite here how few there and thus after much shifting bring forth good ordonnance which then design fair make such alteration in the action of the figure as think proper yet retain they posture in general leave large and stand one where they ought to be and the small one lie or sit in they place and so forth by this means have find that landscape with many and small figure ought to consist of large bywork for set they off viz large and close tree heavy stonework broad grounds and zoithindoor in palace or apartment cross there ought to be behind small figure large and flat wall with sew ornament for be they to consist of many part all would seem alike large and be we to place by large figure some large part all would appear small or to speak better equally large large object must make another small a oblique one another together that the one may shew the other it be the same with light if large part consist either of light or shade let one be the groundfor the other for instance if on the second ground large part be in shade let the third have some sharp and glitter light this will help the broad shade and wanton light but those two choice require different management the principal ought always to precede and the other to be subservient to it in landscape the immoveable object predominate and the moveable one serve only for ornament contrarily in a ordonnance the figure be first dispesed and then the bywork for when we say that a upright standing figure must be place by bend tree and crook stem by standing figure we understand by the former the stem to be the principal and the figure the affistant if in landscape but in a history the figure be principal thus it be also in a apartment with architecture statue bassrelief and other ornament the irregularity of object do therefore give particular decorum and elegance for what satisfaction would it be to the eye to see some beautiful grape and melon lye each in separate disnp but if grape melon or other gibbon round oval and large fruit be group together they would add lustre to each other we know that small house visibly magnify temple or palace and that long and low building make tower or mausoleum look high such contrarietia as these aré many and to name they all would be as tedious as impossible wherefore shall content myself with name some of the chief plate xxvi the examplé no with a high horizon shew the ordering of object accord to perspective the step run up against parapet the figure sit on the ground where the step rise and forward where they sink stand the figure the point of light be on the horizon no shew the contrary of the former when the horizon be loze flate x xvii no shew that lie object require stand figure no be the contrary by lie figure ought to be introduce high standing object viz column tree and the like with gyramid end in point or a high and narrow square stone suit stoove sitting and lie figure also stand figure but mosdly in profile under or with statue in nich or on pedestals agree no set standing figure unless one be sit with thin bushie or cut coppicès suit best standing lean and stoop figure but not any lie or sit against a elegant stone with bafrelief ought to be figure with slat and broadsold drupery the contrarily be also good with straitcourse river break shore and bank with lie cattle stand man and the contrary with horse ass and cox agree boy with sheep goat and other small cattle fuit fullgrevon people with stat mufical instrument suit round one viz the hautboy lute and the like with timbrel cymbal or triangular ring iron but when any thing be introduce into a ordonnance to create contrast the principal piece which we would break by the by work must always predominate chap viii of strong object against faint grounds and the contrary or darkness against light and light against darkness tave already speak largely about the management of the colour which be one of the capital part of painting have take great pain in build some rule thereupon with view that when occasion require might give under my present misfortune this comfort be leave good reason for so do that now have nothing to hinder what firmly purpose and therefore can consider it with more vigour than ever ieven imagine it in degree equal to nature herself since know perfectly the strength and nature of colour and they effect consider then the follow example plate xxviii whether it be of moment the man in warm fillemot drapery be against the faint offscape the woman bin light blue drapery against the tree behind she or beautiful skycolour blue and pale red again dark beautiful red and rosecolour or purple and white these be the principal and most suitable alteration besides changeable stuff some perhaps may afk whether the blue drapery which we place here against the offscape do not contradict what we have formerly say namely that blue be reckone among the weak colour and yet here we asfert warmth against faintness and the contrary to which answer negatively because we call warm colour those which be pure and unmixed viz beautiful skyblue beautiful yellow and beautiful red whereas when those colour be mix with white they warmth no longer subsist because they darkness give the glow we see on the contrary that light blue light yellow and light red even white itself serve for weak colour against the dark as this example shew the reason why ought now to be of single or capital colour be because the offscape be make up of so many tender and faint colour shall have no communication with it which make the one the better retire and the other appraach do the same contrarily this small example be of such nature that any ordonnance of what kind soever as well within door as in the open air take from it must be good if we introduce instead of the offscape building with bafrelief figure or other ornament of weaker colour or else of marble it will answer the same purpose and if instead of the tree we exhibit curtain grotto rock or other building of warm stone it will be the same again with respect to colour but if come against flat ground of one colour whether grey or white then that figure may be of different colour or changeable stuff likewise if we place bagainst a hanging or partycoloured ground that figure must need be of single colour or drapery wherefore we be enable to judge how far this observation extend yet as this example shew only light and darkness we shall subjoin another in plate xxviii aforesaid with third or middle tint which with the former will suffice for give right notion of compose all fort of ordonnance as well within door as in the open air as before say although the design be to consist of or more group observe the grounds against which they come whether faint strong distant or near to the end those group may by the force of light or weak colour obtain they due beauty speak not in reference to any one in particular but all in general we find that when dark colour be place against faint offscape they be vifibly set off and make the one appear distant and the other near and the more when we set some light and weak colour on the fore ground whereby they still have greater effect as we may observe in figure from which premise it be plain that the same can be effect by the contrary method so that the argument of some namely that strong and warm colour ought always to be place forward in order to approach the more and the weak one to be in proportion to they distance the fainter the further be en tirely overthrown for want of consider that the stress lie mestly in the back ground the example now before we be like the former the fore ground except which be add to it the better to explain we meaning in the order the colour to advantage by which method we can dispose we ordonnance with ease and so as to fetch out beuatiful harmony see plate xxviii aforesaid place on the left side on the fore ground in the graf sitting woman with she right leg front the light have white under garment and over it red one she rest she right hand on dark greeaishblue pot little further behind she stand a half column of grey stone which set she off and whereon lean a old philosopher drest in dark blue have on he head crown of green leave on the right side on the fore ground which be sandy and here and there intermix with russet lie large flat basket of dark russet colour and in it be large italian pumpkin on à beautiful dark blue cloth spread half out of the basket onthe light ground by it stand girl drest in rose colour hold she lap open behind she appear a heavy white terme and on the left side from she stand woman drest in light violet who be put garland on the terme the girl be in profile and the woman front the philosopher shew to the willman before he the terme which sne turn towards and look at the terme girl and woman be close together make with the ground great light against chap ix of the painting object dustily here be still one thing which many painter carelessly pafst over though very useful and elegant if well and naturally observe it relate to such cbyect as be dusty as well in room as in garden for though the former be sometime sweep and the latter clean yet pedestals balluitrade parapet vafe and statue always escape gallery and public place for walk in be likewise seldom clean it be therefore in my opinion very improper in those who with great care represent the pavement of the say place with stone of diver colour very distinctiy joint one dark another light without spot of uncleanness which make it very difficult to get good decorum or cause those pavement to look stat without offence to the eye cause moreover a excessive stiffnef be the colour ever so well order whereas usually in large apartment daily walk in we can not in the afpresaid distinct manner perceive what the colour of the floor be except towards the extremity and next to the wall wherefore the middle where be the most walking must appear dull uniting and almost of one sint some painter express the compartment of such floor so distinctly that you would even imagine they xeere wet grant indeed that sometimes in the life it be so by means of the dark stone yet if we break and make they little lighter they will then not stare so much and yet be no less natural as if a apartment be surround with marble surbase and the middle of the room be gill cistern by which the floor may very well appear strong because of its agreement with the marble and the glitter of the cistern ine ni for my part should rather chuse plain floor than compart one but if we lie under necessity to introduce the latter the best method will be to unite the colour in such manner that the tint differ but litile from each other this observation do in a especial manner affect landscape since it be certain that the part which abound with tree whether wood or side of road be subject to rain and wind and by means of dust or sand the green tomb pyramid vase and all other object in such place be so sully and cover that the true colour of the say object be hardly perceptible for instance in such place as we now speak of stand red tomb on black plinth now if we make this tomb or plinth too dark or too strong it will look as if it have be zoffy where as contrarily it ought by means of the dust of the branch and leave which sometime fall on it to be so cover over that we shall scarce perceive whether the tomb be red or the plinth black . although some may think this obfervation too trifling and farfetch it be nevertheless highly necessary in order to find besides by other method the likelihood in picture whether it be for break thereby in some measure and uniting object which through the nature of they colour would have too great force or for any other cause yet not without reason that it may not appear too affect but here methink hear some object that if we thus observeinievery thing this dust and sully long gown and train cloath can not be free from it especially those of woman which be commonly of beautisul and light colour andmust must consequently be at the bottom as well as they white sandal more or less disty tothe no smalf ianighter and wonder of the people to which anfwer that should more wonder to see person come dry out of the water than clean out of dust and dirt for though we do not see it observe by other who have always make the sandal beautiful and white even those of common soldier as well as of general and train gown the sam yet say that this observation do not tend to countenance mistake but to make we mindful of the nature of thing and to express they in we picture with all likelihood more or less as the matter require not superfluoussy but in moderation virtue which take place in other thing should not be neglect in this point judicious master will observe a equilibrium in order to prevent aversion since thing roo beauriful be unnatural and those which be too dirty disagreeble to every one this management would also not be justifiable could we not as have say perceive the reason of it as in poor people countryme and such like with old and tatter cloath which wear not without soiling and gather dust this observation be of no use tothose who not apprahend the cause of thing will have every thing as beautiful as possible whereas likelihood should appear in all part prudenter agendo th art of painting book iv of light and shade chap of the different light of picture judge this point to be one of the most important in the art of painting for without thorough knowledge of it it be impossible to to make good picture wherefore shall shew all that by docourse can bring forth as the result of what have learn by many observation and long experience of common light object in common light have no broad sharp light and they shade be uncertain the second tint and shade keep they own colour much better in clear air without cloud because the object be light on all side without vapour appear sensible and more relieved than in sunshine this light think best for portrait and such object as we would have enlighten from without the picture as a open gallery or such like place and though the object thus light have no great force we nevertheleis find that the main touch both in lignt and snade be stronger than in ocher light this light get great elegance and advantage by lozo horizon when it make greater fhade as under the leasing of tree moulding and projecture of buiiding and such like of the light in coudy sky we need not wonder why the object in cloudy air appear more sensible than in sunshine or clear weather because the air or vapour be mostly exhal leave the object below wilhout mistiness and thus afford much sharper transparency for view every thing without the least obstruction for which reason thing in cloudy air seem less to go off from we and appear dark and near and of more beautiful colour especially the green of grass and tree of sunsshiny light object enlighten by the sun be more or less misty as the sun shine strong or weak for this reason that the atom or mote between we and the point of sight seem more dense by the strength of the sun than in common or clear light and be more or less ting by which mean the shade of object become faint at once and go off more suddenly than in another light wherefore we may easily conceive that though the shade be broader and more sensibly limit than in another light yet they appear not so sharp as some master have by mistake express they especially berchem in he object less than the life this indeed would be well enough in cover place as gallery palace apartment where there be no air whereby the object then appear more perfect plain and less retire suppose for instance you walk through same shady tree it be certain that come towards the end of they you will see the object in the open air plainer and better than in the field the prospective glaf evidently prove this be the day ever so clear observe then in general that as have say the object grow faint more suddenly and disappear in sunshine which herein principally differ from common light of the light in hall room and ofher apartment for piece to be hang against wall of apartment the common light be most proper if the disposition of the light of the place will permit as be the most moderate and agreeable when well and naturally express this conduct then be principally to be observe in it that the figure and other object be light more or less strong and broad accord to they nearness to or distance from the light of the window and though stand on the same ground they ought neverthelefs to be different in force of light and dullness of shade so also the groundeshade on wall grounds and other object should be some shorter stronger and more sensible than other the figure close to the window must therefore certainly receive they light from on high and have shorter groundshade than those which be further from they but as it may happen that the object distant from the aforesaid light may receive light from other window so they shade ought also to break more or less and to become faint because they be encompass by larger light besides reflexion from the wall the shade of such object be also warmer than in the open air where the blue of the sky and vapour very much weaken they and make they faint we must likewise observe in general that in a apartment hang with red yellow bluc or green all the shade of the object be there by reslect and partake of the same colour but the touch and shade of the faintest object will appear the stronger compendium of the lighis in cloudy weather the object be less retire more warm and more sensible in clear weather without cloud little more retire in sunshiny zveather still more retire and less sensible in suggy weather as at the latter end of the year or in winter the most retiring and more suddenly disappearing the grosser the air the more body it have and the more body the more visibly light whereby the sight be shortne and the object appear more indistinct thus much as to object in the open air these four particular light naturally handle be certain proof of fkilful master and it would in my opinion look very agreeable to see such piece hang by one another embellisn as follow in cloudy weather the herdsmen fearful of rain and storm be packing up they baggage the sheep every where make towards they listless and hang they head which they be drive in a hurry into the wood look continually at the sky in fine the bustle be great and every one in motion in clear weather the herdsmen walk hand in hand other sit here and there by fountain in discourse third group divert themselves with sing and skipping about and some play on the hautboy fife reed or strawpipe instrument usual among country people and in the mean time they flock be graze in safety in sunshiny the eather the shepherd and shepherdess sit at ease under they spread clothes some by water fall wass themselves other sleep in the shade of fountain or tree they flock be graze up and down in group some chew the cud for coolness other drink at river other lie in the shade in foggy weather the herdsien be drive they flock homeward walk with concern and shrugg they shoulder and pok out they head carefully look to see whether sheep or goat have not be lose in the fog and closely guard the flock on every side the young woman follow with cloths or veil on they head and some be stop they nose with they because of the fog chap ii of the condition of the air or sky the sky be wide expansion seem lower or higher as it be more or lef replete with vapour now the sky be certainly never without vapour since be there none it would be every where blue as well on the horizon as over we head but we see it appear lighter next the horizon than vertically because the vapour fog and diminisn the beautiful blue there it be also plain that the nearer the air be to the earth the more dense and gross it be and in pro portion to its afcent the more rarify and transparent the vapour be likewise more or less sensible in proportion to they density or raritv we must observe here that when the sun rise in the east it be then in that part lighter on the holizon than in the three other and at noon it be lighter in the south and so round because this large heavenly body communicate it be insluence toevery thing near and about it ishall now demonstrate by a example the reason why the vapour the further they be from we become the lighter take thin gauze eight or ten yard long and strain it in the open air on four pole mark each yard with crossline number to then place yourself under no and look along to the end of the straininig you will perceive the blue of the sky less in the sccond division and the further still lesser because the thin thread double before you eye there by thicken the gause more and more and abate its thinness or transparency insomuch that at last you perceive nothing but a entire white stuff suppose now that the star be up and you be to make the same experiment you would find they to appear most distinct in the first division and disappear in proportion as they go off which be plain proof that though the air be ever so more light it be for this reason that the star be never see very near the horizon and if we do perceive any thereabout they be but small and weak between the air and water there be no difference the one seem to be a impresion of the other to wit both of they light towards the horizon and the air overhead and water forward both dark as for the ground or plan which receive its light from the heaven do not find it necessary to assign other reason for prove that the case of this be quite contrary to that of the air since perspective shew that every thing enlighten if it have but solid body darken more and more the further it go off from we suppose for instance a open gallery soo foot long have a even floor you will perceive the first foot to be lightest and so on to the further end less and less light the same may be observe in figure chath in zohite and how much the first will differ from the last speak only of what be in the light for the case be quite different with what be dark and in shade as we may see when figure be drest in black that then they become lighter and lighter by the the object which appear in level field when the air be without eloud and the sun hide either behind mountain or tree will receive light from all side and yet keep they relief by reason of they strong and dark touch they colour be not break but retain they natural beauty and through the sun as before say be hide by something and can not then shine on the object they will nevethelefs receive more or less light from the air on the side where the sun be hide without alter the colour that the blue ofthe sky be no colour we can plainly perceive by the object in a open sield when the sun or light cloud shine not on they which be not in the least tincture by it as be nothing else than vast remotene ss or height from whence it come forth and therefore not able to impart this colour to the object as they do theirs to ene another for want of body since we be treat of the virtue of the air it will not be amiss to say something of its reflexion matter worthy of observation since in that point be often commit great mistake and to explain it we shall exhibit the three follow example the number signify the tint as be one tint one tint darker and tint darker than the precede the figure plate x xix be tint darker in shade than for this reason that the trunk of the tree have rough supersicy which can give no light and the white house contrarily can give great light or ressexion now if the house be not there but level field instead of it would rather be lighter than darker and if the trunk and bushie behind it be also take away those two figure would have like shade whereas we see now two figure on one line or ground one darker and the other lighter through the darkest shade in the latter keep they own force which do they appear otherwise would be against nature and the rule of art the second example have the same observation now be well assure from experience that if we be to give to some who have never see this sketch or know the reason of it a outline of the follow or such design dispose alike and one figure as far from the tree as the other be near ie stand in line parallel with the horizon in order to shade they accord to they notion they would represent they bolh alike in light and shade though by a infallible rule he who stand furthest from the tree have more light round about he than he zoho be nearer and therefore it can not possiby be otherwise than as we see here exhibit to wit bone tint in shade and in the groundshade and tint in shade and in the groundshade now behold the willman on the foreground who like bhas one tint in shade by reason of the re flexion of the stone stand near she the groundshade upon that stone consist of three tint and if the stone or any such hindrance be not there the air would cause the same effect though not so strongly some may possibly think that the house be too far to cause such reflexion and that then the figure ought not to differ so much but say that the trunk with the maybunne behind so interpose that the figure can not receive any reflexion from the house and therefore it must naturally be one tint darker in shade than would you make à far fetch opposition and dress in white say then that there would be no need either of the tree or house when vet it be plain that the one as well as the other be thus order to serve for a example the third example plate x xx confirm the two former in which we plainly see the reason why object be weaken more or less in they shade not only by the reflection of other object but also by the air on the left side and the groundshade the same which be darken more or less beyond the reach of the say air or reflection as it appear on the three column in which it be evident that the groundshade of and be tint fainter than that of the pillar light of and the air and by the air alone the pillar be about halfway from the bottom darker in its reflection than above and it be groundshade one tint darker than and by reason of its standing nearer to and whereby pillar come to cast its groundshade on which groundshade cover the light of halfway whereby this last can not reflect thus far against nor in its groundshade these effect happen as well in sunshine as common light without the lcast alteration we exhibit here another example in plate x xx aforesaid which afford no less consideration than the forego and whereby shew the force of light and the cording as the horizon be high or low and be the instance and and the proof of it that it can not be otherwise the case be the same whether the light be sunfhine or common or whether it be front or sideways the horizon be as we see between both head and the point of sight in the middle or somewhat more to the right side the light proceed also from the right now consider how the two head and though have one and the same light differ in they mainlight touch have those touch on the forehead and all the project part as nose and chin under lip and so forth and have they on the rise of the brow corner of the eye beside the nose and along the cheek tip of the nose and chin which alteration be only cause by the point of sight accord to its position either high or loz when the object be they of what kind soever if but smoorh and even as marble copper or the life itself stand under a high horizon the aforesaid mainlight touch go upwards and on the contrary descend the more the object be elevate above the horizon as we have say and be here demonstrate now observe of the same stuff as the foremost head and light by the same light where have strong heighten on the rise part which descend more or less as it rise above the horizon this example be of great moment and produce uncommon thing in which we should sometimes be at loss and which would not occur to we in many year speak in reference to those who be too confident of quick conception and do not duely weigh thing for it must be allow that without the knowledge of perspectiue it be imposfibe to trace truth from the secret of nature in order to bring it to pass in we work it be true we can imitate the life gold or silver pot kettle dish or other shine piece of housholdstuff as fine as the life but may be vastly mistaken in the use of they in we ordonnance if we do not regard the motion ofthe glitterings which be as various as incredible and yet all those thing may be easily apprehend if we understand and sometimes practise per. ctive chap iii reflection in the water the represent reflection in the water be certainly not of the least moment and they agreeableness make they worthy to be naturally express but as there be not assign or will be find any certain rule for they without the aid of perspective so it be lose labour to seek any for which reason some landscapepainter often paf over the reflection in the watet to avoid the trouble of perspective nevertheless the incomparable poussin have not forget to make use of they and he have get great reputation thereby speak of nichola who be as famous for landscape as figure and who never meet with any difficulty which he do not surmount have earnestly apply to this point consider whether there could not be find other shorter means to effect it than by planning line that so agreeable part of art might not be neglect and after long trial discover the follow method take a oblong board of what size you please and place thereon some waxfigure as close to the edge as you think proper or accord to they distance from the water which they ought to have in you picture bend these figure into such action as you sketch require and place they by means of little bit of wood or potterearth as high or low as you desire then take trough make for that purpose of lead wood or tin paint withinside with such ground as you want whether black umber or terrevert and fill it with water and set it against the board and figure as high or low as you sketch ground direct next fix you point of sight and after have find you distance place yourself there either stand or sit and thus design the figure with they reflection slightly also mark the shade then set you layman to each figure and design it very carefully fix the layman each time in the place where each figure stand so as to see its reslection like that in you sketch here especially take notice of the length and breadth of the reflexion for it always shorten more then its object because it be so much lower under the horizon when you place the model or layman as much above the horizon as it beflect under it and design it thus correctly in order to paint after it you hold the draw upside down here you will possibly say that the reflexion ought to be reverse which do not disown but then you can make a impression of you sketch on another paper and whereby perceive the good effect have proceed thus far and paint after you sketch you may be assure every thing be right but here let it be observe that the reflexion must always be perpendicular with the object above they as if grow out of each other as we may see in plate x bxi this method relate not only to the place of figure but all other object of what kind soever as horse dog pyramid stone with bassrelief vase pot and other thing and whether they be forward backward or at the side of you painting you may instead of watertrough use lookglass but it be not so totural as the water which may be make to look deep or shallow and as dark or light as you please by place little mud grass or sand in the bottom of the trough as for the colour experience teach that the more the water be enlightened by the sky the more uncertain the reflection be and when the shun shine di¬ rectly on the water the object will appear much more uncertain as well with respect to we as those who view themselves therein for the reflection then appear only as descend ray without any shape as we sometimes see by candle the moon or other thing which give only reflection on the surface of the water whether in sunshine or by night because we can not then perceive the transparency of the water the reflection in the water though it be quite dark and clear be never so light as they object without but always tint or a half darker now to represent the ressection in run ceater you must first paint it with light and shade on ground rub thinly over with little tough oil then take large soft pencil and here and there crosshatch it but better way be to take longhair fitch and make the stroke as close as the vein of the water run take care not to striké out too much of the outline but as glaf be diaphanous body and therefore have no constancy or fixedness nor can effect any thing but by means of something else have more body as by the earth which be afirm body this we see when the glass be silver or pitch so with water the case be the same which will produce no effect nor receive the form of any object unless there be firm ground to fix its transparency as we may see by piece of ice will be necessary to observe somewhat about object stand in the water point well worth we noticé on account of the uncommon occurrence which happen in it though as little heed as if they be on the land and no water thereabouts we must suppose the water to be like the air and that the object between it and the air see from top tobottom appear the same as ifthey be upside down against the air there be no other difference between the light of either than that water be à little fainter than the air as may be apprehend by lookglass in which the object though tlicy appear ever so plain do not come up to life itself these thing be premise it be easy to conceive that object stand in the water be enlighten as well from beloas above speak not here of the the reflection of object but of the object themselves and they shade as may be see in plate x bxi aforesaid the man who extend he right arm over the water receive strong reslection from below of violet colour like that of the air above he along he shade side and he left arm across he breast receive double reflection to wit from the water and from he body whereby it be of more warm colour than the other the young man stoop over stone view view himself in the water in the shade of the tree by he shew that the reslexion of the water be like that of the air but little fainter as faid before the face on the stonc exhibit the famc but more sensibly be also light from below here we must further observe that the further or higher object be from the water the more reflerion they receive as may be see in the man who withhis breast be close to the wvater without any reflexion because the light over he can not shine on it since he be stoop forward and shide the water to the ground with he body thus far have cxperiment and from whence other circumstance may be deduce by practice in the mean time we may observe how much those object differ from those on the land of which latter we must note that the more they rise from the ground the less reflexion the shade receive because the light of the grounds be on the superficics they maintain they own constant colour touch the reflexion in the water besides the contraction and reflexion have be long doub about the irregularity between they and the object theyselve since perceive by the rule of optick or practical perspective that there be something more to be take notice of apprehend also that as there be air and sun above and below so those two light must need cause a uncommon effect in the object and they glitter or main heightenings but vet could not firmly conclude how or in what manner and the rather because which be much surprised at never hear that any person have certainly demonstrate it at last find the greatest difficulty in explain my conception do to give sketch of it cause a enquiry to be make into the truth itself as plate x bxi aforesaid shew wherein we plainly see how far thing may sometimes go beyond we guess those who try nice experiment must be rejoice when they make greater discovery than other we say he zho seek find but nothing be to be obtain without labour and practice observe then that the stress lie here in the mainlighttouch as the aforesaid figure plainly shew but they may be qualify accord to occasion and as you think fit both in the object and they reflexion we take then for example the object stand on the water be under the horizon equal to they height and receive they light from the right they stand on each side of the point of sight and have they proper light and shade accord to perspective as also the mainlighttouch or gloss on the relief the same experiment may be make with all sort of object in all which we may perceive how much reffection in the water as well as the contraction will differ from the object themselves this be a uncommon observation but study will make it familiar chap iv of groundshade accord to the difference of light not will not be improper to make some observation about the groundshade of object and the course of those snade accord to the different light proceed from the fide round to the fore part as perspective determine exactly the length breadth and depth of thing so it be impoffible to represent any thing duly and well without it though as may say we be to practise the art a hundred year and the ordonnance to consist of but two or three figure will not say of ten or more it be no wonder that we so early cause young artist to learn perspective before they take to composition it be even commendable if they understand it but indifferently and shun those who not only reject its rule but laugh at those who study they conversation very prejudicial to young and unexperienced tyro but to return to we subject we find great advantage in use side light in we ordonnance with respect to the groundshade because those shade whether forward or distant always run parallel with the horizon without any foreshortening which we may easily find without perspective as may be see in plate x x xii fig because they may be conveniently measure with pair of compass on else guest at we may then well perceive how much easier this uy hian where the light be more front and the groundshade consequentlyxufi somewhat oblique and shorten and therefore not mensurable by the compass much lef to be guess at through they great variety and diffimularity if the object change they place the groundshade also alier oné runsalmost parallel another more oblique and shorter and other still more ikproportion as they go off from the fide whence the light come as in fig whereby be shew method for find such groundshade without trouble or loss of time in what manner soever the light fall as to the frontlight as in fig imust further premise that as in such case the groundshade go off backward so we need nothing but the point of sight in order to find they and they foreshortenings can be only find by means of the gradationline which though small trouble may be sooner make than read my method be this first fketch no for my ordonnance fix my horizon and point of fight groundshade at rardom accord as suppose the light to be little frontnext set my line whereon be mark the gradationfoot on the right side further draw parallelline from the foot of fig to the aforesaid line which shew its distance now in order two exhibit the coursé of it s shade lay my ruler to the foot of fig trace its groundshade up to the horizon where imake little star from which star fetch all my other groundshade both fore and offone from one side to the other whether figure stone now to find the length of all thefe groundshade draw again from the end of the groundshade parallelline to thegradationline then count the degrade foot foot supposing the figure seven foot high and its groundshade six foot long going six foot into the piece as mark on the gradationfine thus nyay allidther object be manage by only count they height in order to give the depth of they three groundshade accordingly it be now easy to judge how difficult it would be to find the variation of shadow without such line as aforesaid this method have further advantage in assist those who will finisn all they figure after the life for by the course of the say groundshade we can prer sently know where to place the model or layman with respect to the light of the piece as we have demonstrate in we drazobook of reflection in general ch ap nake this observation plain have think proper to illustrate it by one or two example bocguse it be one of those principal beauty of picture whereby weevery where diseer the master it be not improper ffen wedried huntsmen or nymph to rest in shade as in this example plate x x xm here they sit forward in the left corner of the piece on greea bank wotlt wall quite overrun and shade by the tree on the top whereofsexere and therg be see some sijall strong light the standing figure receive the strongeff light almost doyn tò the knee and the remain part uniting with zhe grounenas its distancé the light of this figure have however not so much force as tognne want behind ghe sit figure any reflection partly because those jigure be between and partly on account of the roughnef of it as be fuill of break holeg and project branch and leave which double the shade nahd admjt little or nothing of the reflect ray of the figure we see contrarily chat the figure over against the light object or sigure receive without hindrance strong reflsction the one from before the other somewhat sideways accord to they sitting either behind forward or in the middle it be of great moment to shew plainly the true cause of the say reffection as to distance colour and force of the colour shall say this for the distance have already shew that be the say light figure drest in beautiful light red and strongly light by the sun and the four sitting one drest in purple yellow blue and white they would certainly be adulterate by the red reflection and partly lose they own colour in order to take that of the other and be mix with it as for instance the purple will become red the blue violet the yellow russet or fillemot and the white appleblossom or fleshcolour yet some more than other accord as they receive faint or strong reffection distant or near moreover the naked will become more warm not all over but in the part which be ting by it for the air round about be see less or more whether in the shade or between it and the part which receive the reflection the the second example in plate x xxiii aforesaid shew the breaking of the shade accord to the place as well in colour as force the stonewall be of russet and warm colour the standing figure dress in white or light colour eat with the stone and ground about they lighten hy common light or sunshine these object shew we that through the light which come upon they be pure and unmixed they shade be nevertheless quite adulterate because they be hide from the air and surround with warm ground and receive no other light than from the reflection of the say ground the colour whereof the shade take we see the contrary in the undermost fly figure to wit that the more the object approach the air the cleaner they become and keep they own colour as appear in the uppermoft figure which ishalf in the air and not the least alter in its shade save that it become little more purplish accord to its distance which may be visibly see in its under part and in the lowest fly figure which be still in the dark and can not be touch by the blue of the air be of quite different colour from thhe uppermost to wit more warm as be also the figure which stand below formerly few master understand reflection efpecally among the italian among the french we find som make use of they however freely own that such of the italian be there but one who observe thent understand they in perfection and the french but indifferently though voutet get he reputation by they have therein do more than all the french and ltalian nyaghichenake I believe that the reflection have not be long in practice since we yetval ebany old piece wherein they be not at all observe can not but think tha hat time they be unknown to they but what be still worse some as lastmadet rorwanapdo not know when a object be in shade on which side it ought elight or dark wherefore theyshade it like other which be in thoelight more or less as if it be glaze somuch darker for instance in piece light from the right side you will sometime see figure in the shade of stone or other object now the shade of this fil gure instead of be on the right side occasion by the stone they make on tne leave like all the rest true sign that they know nothing of reflection raphael himself be not expert in it for at that time they know nothing ef plar light against light and dark against darkness on which occasion the reflection come most to pass whereas tkey seek the chief effect and harmony in oppose light to shade and the contrary and therefore need no reflection moreover they avoid all great shadeand broadness but nowday the management be quite different we be for great shade and what make a ordonnance look finer than great shade and light whether buiding with figure and bass relief woody grove or any thing else quite in shade agreeably light by the reflection of grounds air or other light object it eertainly give the eye great satisfaction with respect to variety and at the same time produce a agreeable union and tenderness as well in the whole as the part of picture nevertheless it fare with restection as with all other thing superfluity cause à surfeit there be also some who so delight in reflection that they shew they at all adventure and will often express almost imperceptible one with the greatest force by vermilion ultramarine red orpiment we find such chiefly among the fleming as jordaanrubeand many other we must take then particular care not to represent any reflection without shewing the reason of they and how far or near they be to they cause that we may rightly judge what force or weakness they receive or give in word that we need not be oblige to afk whence tae reslection proceed why it be red yellow or blue so strong so faint chap vi that sunsbine have no more force than common light with respect to shade be certain that object light by sunshine have no darker or stronger shade than those in common light though they seem to have stronger for the blue the air be light more or less accord to the sun s strength or weaknef and therefore keep alzopy the same tint as prove by the first example in plate x xxiv the column whether plain or ornament with bassrelief like the trajan or atonine be set up in the middle of the field and at distance from it at the side of the piece a high tower or bulwark the groundshade whereof above half cover the column wherefore the sun shine powerfully on the upper part only and yet we shall find the shade from top to bottom of one and the same tint it be the same with the light of candle in darkish room or in the evening which though stronger and of more force than the other light yet do not in the least darken the shade of the part on which it come but let they remain alike as we see in the second example the lanhtern in the boy s hand light the object near it in part when the refidue be light by the window we see then say that the part illuminate by che lanchern do not become darker in the shade than if the say light iere not there and if the day happen to be shut in and night approach it will not only be darker about the say light but all over but it be quite the reverse with trnasparent object such as stuff alabaster horn for want of the solidity of the preceed object as we see in the third example suppose that the column either of paper or alabaster receive its light through à small opening either from the sun or candle you will find the snade about the part so light to be more or less light accord to the strenght of the light in such manner that it may be plainly distinguished from the other shade whereabout be no light this observation especially prevail in nudity and transparent drapery in nudity light by the sun we shall find the small or thin part to be always more or less transparent as the eyelid nose ear finger and therefore they must not have firm shade but it be contrary in stoneface for though the sun shine everso strong against the thinnest part yet they will not be transparent but remain as dark as the thicker and be this face to be paint with beautiful and natural colour it can not be like the life but rather dead person speak with respect to transparency for we know by experience that the blood be warm be thin and transparent but when chilly or coagulate it be corporal or solid solid wherefore it be certain that in this case dead person be more like stone than natural figure we can plainly perceive this in slaughter oxen when the en¬ trail be take out and candle set within the carcaf the breast and part between the rib will be more transparent while the flesh be warm than after it be cold and have hang longer it be the same with dead body for if candle be set behind a ear or next to the nose they will not be transparent the single fold of thin drapery appear more transparent in sunshine than in common light and have therefore fainter shade than coarser and more thick vestment but the shade of double hanging fold especially when they be close togethe appear in sunshine much stronger than in the single fold of thick stuff leave of tree do the same the difficulty be thus solve namely that the strength of sunshine or candledp not make the shade darker than they be in common light we shall to acccrgilish we purpose shew therein the sun s strength consist matter easily to be apprehend by those who have well weigh what have be before say we finct by experience that object light by the sun have much greater force than thee in common light which be not effect by strong shade but by they broadnerare sharpness which common light do not give either within door or the open act some imagine the strength to be greater in the sun than in common light which can only make object approach in proportion to they magnitude distance or nearness as small life and large life yet say that common light have this property as well as sunshine what difference then be there between either no other than in the one broad and sharp shade and in the other more round and melt one the former caufe plain and long groundshade and the latter short and uncertain one hereby we properly distinguisn sun shine from common light that the one be more forcible than the other be no wonder the proof appear in the two follow example in plaie x xxv better than can express it in word of these the sirst be light by the sun and the second by common light both alike in darkness of shade the one sharp with long plain groundshade and the other the contrary once paint a emblem or rather narcissus view himself in the water take the light more front as it be commonly order in sunshine with a intent only to shew how apprehend sunshine with respect to the melting of the sharpness and also to avoid groundshade which child s head near he would have cause on the cheek of narcissus the principal in the piece and heleave cheek already in shade if the light have come sideways which would have look so very offensive that he view could not have shew the beauty wherewith he be so much enamour it be moreover indifferent to I whether the light come from side or be more or lef front because it respects the general design no more than if it be intirely front it be true that large groundshade cause the greatest elegance in sunshine if they come not to of close together for then they look disagreeable and cause certainmlancholy in picture but appear more pleasant when intermix with gleam of small light to breakthey too great breadthcall this piece a emblem because the poet fayss thatthisyouth see he own likeness in the water fall in love withhimself now this fort of love discover vain conceit or weak paffion in man so far cloud he knowledge and judgment that he be insensible of what he be do for the more natural expresing which sense have place near narcissus aschild with foolcap fawn on and embrace he and deck he hair virginlike with slower and to shew the delight he take in he folly he motion and lookbespoke one affect with the reflection which the child shew he in the water this piece be richly fill with bywork as figure architecture bascage cattie flower and water with design to represent all the particular object lighted by the sun each accord to its quality and in the most suitable manner it be thoroughly finish by finishied understand when every thing be in it to the most minute circumstance not when only the principal part be exprest and many small circumstance leave out or when thing be curiouslv soften as some by the word would make we believe be that as it will have not leave every thing unsoftened because the difference would then have be so great that the piece must have have too much nearness since it be certain that as object go off they become more uncertain the small and subtle thing such as small fold and feature disappear yet the painting might well be say to be finish since every thing be in it that ought to be with respectito its distance have before paint the same design for model of that above it be lay on flat and not in the least soften whereby the difference between they be very visible now must own that softening be very allur and have a apparent dotance however we may always perceive that the one have as much force as the other we have before asfert that object light by the sun cause greater force and motion than in common light which some imagine proceed only from the sharpness of the snadenow it be so in some measure with respect to they broadness but principally for the plainness of the groundshade which the gbject cast on each other whereby thing be often break and divide in such manner as if all zere double even six sigure in common light will not sometimes give so many piece as four in sunshiine whence we may plainly perceive that saarpness give nearness softening more and more as the object go off so that no object whatever can shew any sharpness unless they be nearbecause of the air interpof between we and they if it seem strange and unintelligible due iinquiry will make it evident wherefore argue that the nearerer the object the more plain and sudden be they shade fora less air interpose between we and the nearest so it must increase in proportion as they go off here it will not be iunnecessary to relate particular accident as confirmation of my asfertion have formerly say that in my youth tmade my design in watercolour now thad one time among other paint one which by reason of its starve and hard penciling so dislik that purpose to try to give it better face though be to spoil it intirely first try it with the glare of a egg which not succeed six it on pastboard and make brim of wax round it then pour clear isingglass on it and let it dry by which mean the painting become as neat and soft as possible and shew it to one of my intimate he be of surprized that he could hardly believe it to be the same piece because the body of the isingglass have take away the aforeraid hungriness and hardnef but afterwards on inquire into the nature of thing this experiment appear not strange or wonderful to I by this occurrence would intimate that mist or air take away all sarpness make thing grof and rough seem light and smooth like varnisn or glue gloss every thing in nature before we eye touch object light by the sun they can not by means of strong and dark shade and with yellozvissi only look natural or sunny becaule there be no difference between this and other light with respect to force mean in object less than the life the sharpness of broad shade and the form of groundshade withthe colour of the light and they reflexion how weak soever can naturally effect it but object as big as the life be beyond we power if they be only to consist in force now some may possibly say that then it be the betier to be represent in litile to which must answer that then the painting would not go off in proportion but stick to the frame of which we shall say more in another placochap vii of the groundsbade in sunshine tis certain that the groundshade in sunshine which contribute much to the decorum of picture consist not only of length broadness and sharpness but in conformity with the object which cause they whether pillar pyramid square the groundshade of a upright standing figure fall on the ground or any thing else nst be perfectly see even so much that though the say object be not see or be hide behind something yet we may judge by its groundshade what shape it have which be one of the principal token of sunshine some think this no great matter and that when they have strike on the ground long stripe of à certain breath that sufficient without shew whetherit be the shadow of pillar or man speak of this can not omit mention blunder of certain great master he have represent st . francis in the wilderness on he knee at prayer with extend arm béfore crucifix as he be generally exhibit the piece in itself be very fine but casting my eye on the crucifix which be compose of small twig of tree preceive that it make distinct shade of the whole on the ground though it be almosthalf in the shade of the faint but what more surprised I be that he body with the arm in the same position as the crucifix but ten time bigger do not cast like siade on the ground but the shade of mass or black wthout arm now we have say before that though figure or other object be hide behind something yet we can judge by the groundshade what saape or formit have as shall shew in few word for instance place afperson in palace or aparment behind pillar or the like and let he be light by the sun heshape will planly be see on the ground by he shadow again would you introduce into landscape landscape pyramid tower or bulwark zohich be not there it may be do by means of the groundshade when it fall into the piece from the fide of the light whereby the object and every thing belong to they will be plainly visible ingenious painter of sunshine have still a advantage above other that they need not make any high tree hill or building in order to create here or there large groundshade for bring forward foreobject and fling off hindertone they order they shade where they think proper and can always support they so do with reason because we often see in sunshine small driving cloud shadow whole piece of ground and another ground shall be light again and so several béhind one another thus they can divide field at pleasure into light and shade in order to shew thing agreeably have with great attention observe the colour and shade of the sun s light and find especially in the month of september about two or three in the afternoon when the sun be strongest that the sky have clear blue colour intermix with small driving cloud as for the object when the sun shine strong they appear as if heighten with red orpiment and white and the shade reddisn grey as white black and little brown red mixt together not uniting with the blue as in common light as some imagine but become gradually little more violet and grow fainter toward the horizon where no blue be to be see the tree on the fore and second grounds appear finely green the blue of the object be greenish the red be orangecolour the violet russet and thus all the colour in proportion deep water shone on become greenisn grey this exact observation agree perfectly with what have formerly experiment in bright sun fhine by means of small hole in the window of darken room by which see naturally on the white wall as on paper the reflection of every thing that be move without door but let we proceed further to confider whether misshapen shadow do not make object unintelligible beauty in general subsist either in figure landscape or other object exhibit all thing plan and distinct in they shape and form ithout diminution or break they for thing contrary to each other can not possibly raise a agreeable beauty in we eye nor convey to the sense true idea of they form unless by medium consist of second or middle tint which unite the two contrary part namely light and shade when they come too sharp on each other thereby to soften the deformity on the object and to unite they un speake of thing which be though broad which make round object instead of look relieved seem square or angular as if in sunshine wherefore they appear not beatiful but misshapen and the reason be plain people be not sensible of any other decorum than what occur to they eye for its certain that thing alter by the least accident whether of unusual light or shade which make they strange and unknown let some boast that it be broad and the best manner maintain that thoughit be sunshine it be all ène and the same and if we be to speak of what be ageeable and perfect say that it ought to be know that picture with common light be the most perfect light which shew we more exactly and plain the preper form of object what be round remain so and the square alter not as for the misshape of thing exhibit in sunshine we have sufficiently shew shew they as alsg that the stiarpnef of deform shade spoil the true property of the object for instauce suppose too stand figure talk together be light by the sun if now the one cast shade on the other so as half to cover he face we need not doubt but he will become less know even be he parent in architecture or moulding it happen as bad because the offensive suarpness of the shader disfigure and confufe they form and neatness at once think it therefore sign of pusillanimity not to say cowardice in landscapepainter zlways to make choice of sunshine which be certainly but small part of he art as if a architect be to be continually employ about chest or box flowerpainter about flowerglass cattlepainter about cow or sheep stilllifepainter about skull or hourglass seapainter about sloop or boat or statuary about crucifix he be no historypainter who always represent a herodias with st . john s head in charger or lacretia stab herself or jael with a hammer or st . joln with lamb all which be but particular incident which scarce déserve name a artist therefore must not be afraid to exhibit every thing that can be represent with every sort of light but the opinion of most paiter of sunshine be as ridiculous as that of those who always practise common light both proceed from mistake or ignorance whereby they can not rightly judge of thing differ from what they have be always use to now they judgment be only conclusion agree with they apprehension in point which they pretend to understand and which therefore ought to bethus and thus when yet it iscertain that before we can judge of thing we ought firft to enquire into they and by comparifon between both to observe wherein they differ sunshine be not so proper ffor history a for landscape and architecture arise from hence that on such bccasion iit be obstruct and appear hard and unpleasant by reason of the sharpness of the shade and groundshade as we have before intimate neverthelefs if the matter require it it must be use yet with such caution that no mifshapen groundesnade appear to obstruct the sight or create a averfion but if sunfhiine be the best and most advantageous light facepainter would certainly use no other of which to this day we have not one instance because first thé colour doi not shew themselyes in thatlight to be what they really be secondly becaufe it be impossible that either man woman or child can without trouble and a alteration of countenance especially about the eye and mouth fitany time with they face in the sun thirdly because the fun never standstill but be always alter fourthily because the sweetnef of the feature would thereby be spoiled at once and because it would beivery improper to hang such picture in room out of which the sun be keep it would be ridiculous and absurd to say of woman that she be unlike man unkss they so resomble that weccan see no difference between they for as the willman be like woman lanid the man like man so there must need follow one of these these conclusion to wit ehat he catmot or wifl nob beit we oould add à ehird as contempt of the woman namely that fhie be not entireiy like man but this last which attend most people s judgment be most ridiculous and to be espe¬ cially shun by thofe of right apprehenfion as be often the fource ofhatred and envy and even ruin as experience daily shew in those who through prezpoffeffior despise every thing that be difagreeablé to they work and fancy shall not enlarge on this point but keep to my puhpose af shew the pre possesfion of funffmnepainter as well as other and to be the better understand premise that there be thrée thing wherein the whole matter iconfife and which we must first fix and distinctly observe namely funshine comman light and faint light which

muff need be good without the word broad which proper ligh and shade they abuse by introduce it any how do not think thep true artistsl that the piece nhich be nas boad ape aptas good those light by the sun moon ch ap viii houj sunssbine be to be reprefent in piece have common light this proposition may possibly seem straiige to some and perhaps fein but be in fact so farfram if or be atrifle that it be matter of moment and found on good reason we take it for grant that the sun differ in s force from other light and be à tint lighter we often see in changeable weather abound with driving cloud that the sun be obscure by very thin and hang airy vapour in such manner that whole tract of land house hill even whole wood be overshadow which shade however be thin and exhibit all the object more or less plain than in common light but let we corne to the point which be the represent in common light piece sunshine with one and the same force of colour each in its degree without impediment to each ôthermean when the sun be not forward or in the front of the picture or be not tèomuch fpraad which wpuld thereby seem too flar to do it therefoue accordto ghe rule of art divide for instance aland¬ scape into fonr grounds of which let the first be white and the three other di¬ minifh in proportion let the second white ground serve for the sunshine now it be plam that as the common lighit on the foreground already possess the force of the colour it must need follow that the sunshine which iz one tint lighter as before say and have no other force than tthe fame white nan alsohave no nearer place than that of the seoond grounc a plain proof that if it be place on the third ground it will differ so much in force now in order to distinguish the difference betweon this light on the sécond ground and that on the first and to represent it tozurally weought to exhibit the shade and groundshade of the object saarp doroall aad long é wihevaby we mayt peroeive that this be sunlight and the other with dull and short groid stiad to fhew that it be conmoa light but the better to coooeive the naoure of sunlight obserwe its colaur in the moraing and eyen to aid those uho may not presently understand what bave say shall lay down fhort method of management in certain and easy manner have sketch you design and settle the part which you would have en lighten by the sun deadcolour it neatly as if it be to be throughout common light but in the second colour you must somerohat more heighten the part which be light by the sun whether whiter more yellow or more russet becording as you would have they and so as to perceive visible difference the shade also to lie more distinct and broad without make they glow except here and there in the reflexion now if on the foreground or about it there be no white we have a opportunity to throw here and there on it some sunray by the force of white yellow or russet accord as the sun s colour then appear which could not be do if we have before lay the sun s force in the offscape here let it be observe that if we enlighten some forward object by the ray aforesaid they ought not to be of light and bright coloured matter such as white marble or light freestone very light drapery or beautiful carnation but of such tint as appear dark in comman light because these strongly heighten with the sunlike white will fetch out the same light now to finish the work with certainty and to find with ease the proper tint of object light by the sun proceed thus temper you white with red or yellow orpiment more or less yellow as you would represent the sun early or late then instead of pure white mix it with you light first tint of all the object which be light by the sun whereupon you wilf find each colour to be break accord as its quality or force with respectto its body differ much or little from the rest thus the work will have the desire effect experience the daughter of truth can testify chap ix that the shade of object in sunshine be not more glow than in comman light any be such stranger to the truth of thing and of little enquire into they that to retain they groundless habit they slight reason and maintain they error this be evident from they universal opinion that the shade and object be more glow in sunshine than in commonlight which entirely deny but that the shade and reflexion become lighter and lighter inproportion as the sun shine stronger be true that the sun s light be more glow than common one be indifputable for as the sun s light be more or less yellow or red it be natural that every thing he shine on should partake of the same colour not only in light but also in the shade which receive the reflexion of the grounds and other néar object but as there be no object what strong reflexionfoever they receive which do not here and there preserve some unreflected stade as when oné object be cover by the groundshade of another so the say shade ought fince they have no communication with the sun or he reflexion and be of another nature to be more grey like those in common light as receive no colour but what the air give they hereby think we can best distinguisn between sunsnine and common light wherefore it be strange that people who commonly seek shade for the sake of coolness will notwithstanding have they warm it be therefore no wonder to find so few winterpainter have see winterpiece of breugel as warmly coloured as if for midsummer even the very ice and snow as glow though in winter all thing receive light reflexion and have littlé or no shade the groundshade be lightifhi and blue and yet every thing have its distance and gooff though some contrarily make they offshade as warm as the forward one for this reason it be necessary for the artist sometimes to exercise himself in sunshine and make due observation on the nature of it not make it he constant practice but particular and agreeable study if he can not be perfect in it he ought at least to know as much of it as of common light in order to use in he work sometimes the one sometimes the other as occasion require some think because of the broadness that sunshine be more easy than common light but it be not so since think it as difficult for sunshinepainter to represent common light as commonlightpainter to exhibit sunshine with respect to naturalness many perhaps may differ from I in opinion because in sunshine the groundshade be distinct and limitied whence they deduce this argument that in piece light entirely from side and the sun have meridian altitude the groundshade of all the object appear third less than they full length and therefore they may be correctly measure by the compass each in proportion to its length on to the offscape which willingly grant and to which will say further in they favour that it be to be practise not only when the grounds be level and horizontal but likewise in up and downgrounds where the compass be useless if the ground drip the groundshade will do the same do it rise they do so too as the know in perspective well understand thus far say thy be in the right but suppose it should happen that the piece be light from zeithin or from without be it not then as uncertain as in common light and because the compass be useless much more troublesome to find the shade and groundshade and they enlargement forward and offdiminution which ought to be as sensible as the sun be either off or forward contrarily how easy be it in common light where they be small and dull the task be therefore not so easy as some imagine who endeavour only to represent right or leavesideshade to represent the sun in all position be quite another tning and there be few such painter for we do not easily find sun shinepainter meddle with common light but contrarily that commonlightpainter will fometime practice sunshine and the reason be plain the common light take in every thing wherefore he who understand this well can easily give into sunshine the point be only that sunshine be warm in the light but not in the shade as some imagine now it sometimes happen that two piece à funshine and common light hang together both have the utmost force of colour and so alike as hardly to distinguisn the sunshine the light be both alike and broad for since the word broad be come into fafhion some will paint broad whether it be sunshine or not as well within door as without moreover the light and shade warmwhat now be to be do when two such picture fhuff hang together in order to dotinguisn the sunshine nothing else verily than to abate the strength of the one somewhat and heighten the force of the othef not by make the fhade darker but by more warm and bright light with long and distinct groundshade zot onsy broad but sharp understand nere that the commonlightpiece ought not to be iaferior in its kind but not broadlight or snade unlefs the cause plainly appear but we seldom sce too such pilce together doné by the fame mafter because most painter make but one of thekind they business and if it once happen yet they do not think the one ought to be lighter than the other and if they be do by two different hand each master endeavour to make the colonr anfwer he own inclination thus it happen that the sunshinepainter be in little concern about it for think re my dbject to appear by the force of lighte iwill by tle strengt h of fiery shade maintain the superiority we have say before that in proportion to the sun s strength the reflexion become lighter the reason whereof we shall now explain we find when the sun be low and the object be strongly light that they receive stronger reflexien from each other because the sun s ray fall not obliquely and glancing on the object and those on other but strike directly upon they and return reflexion contrarily when the sun be high the reflexion of the lighted object can not touch the other with such force because the reffexion of the light must need revert to its origin for instance if in a high light two man stand in discourse and the one receive the sun on he brest and the othier on he back the light which fall from on high on the breast must need reflect agam upwards whencs it come and therefore pass over the otherhead so that the former figure can there by receive none or but very weak and almost imperceptible reflexion thus think to have shew that reflexion in sunshine ought to be represent much stronger than in common light the proof of which may be deduce from the life itselfchap of thé difference of groundshade proceed either from the sun or radial point in pdlate x xxvi the first example shew the sun s place or quarter which observe as east and opposite to it in the west be building which be light throughout from the gast not as by ray proceed frompoint and grow wider but by such as be parallel to each other mean not from the center of a asfiga sun at the side of the piece but from the whole quarter wherein the sun be or fromthe whole side of the piece as wide as the opening thoughout which he shine into it the second example shew the contrary to be false when the sun be directly behind the object the groundshade be not fetch from the radial but another point for if this be good it mist follow that when the sun shine directly through the midle of street he would enlighten bothside of it whiich be contrary to nature and to what we have shew before and in the third example it be plainly visible that when the sun be in the east and the room inthe go the object on the ground must need be light directly from be¬ hind as well the one asthe other without the least difference which they groundshade and the line of the floor fufficiently shew both proeeed from the point of fight andthe latter shew we the caft and west through the whole room the fourth example in plate x xxvii affirm the same represent southern colonade light direct by the sun which be in the oppofite point of which build each column throughout caft its fhade against the pillar behind it not proceedinp from point but by parallel aceord to the rule of perspective the fifch example contrarily fhew great mistake which yet be often commit in make the groundshade proceed from a affign point each column seemm to cause particular groundshade which be against rule and thé nature of sunshine it wifl not he amiss to say something here of the dight of graunds to wit that in what manner soever the light come whether from behind sideways or front the plan or ground will always appear alike that be in the front of the piecé thé most light the the sun ever so low nay on the horrizon and not enlythe aat grounds but every thng that receive light the reason whereof be so evident thatit wouldbe superfluous to say any thing more about it than what be shew in the fixth example ofside front and backward light which perspective suffieiently justify if some think that when the light cpme from behind orside the ground must be light to herwise than front for many keep it always most light on the fide whence the light proceed allow it with respect to candle or toreh but speak ing of the air must say ithey do not at all understand the matter indeed it would not be very improperin aground run off from the light but level floor or grounds can not admit of diminution be they if may say so thousand ft?p tong nay the ground will always be most light forward without any diffference let the light come from behind or forward think no artist will be so tafe as to afk howthen it shall appear whence the tight come since it be generat rule that the fhade and groundfhade of the object plainly shew it and in case there be no object on the ground the air ifthere be but the least hout wifl make it sufficiently apparent chap xi of the representation of different light in the same piece some thinkit impossible for different light in the same piece to look well for say they if it be good raphael caracci titian poussin and other great master would not have reject but approve that manner even the french acadeniy which be arrive at so high pitch unanimoussy agree that no more than single light be necessary and reject picture which have more wherefore they judge that double light be only the invention of dutch master who do not understand the antigue but only follow nature in order to please ignorant to all which answer that though raphael poussin and other great master have nôt shew it in they work but only keep single and common light we must not infer from thence that they despised or reject that manner as contrary to perfection in this particular yet do not say that piece with different light be better than one finglelight if naturally represent mean only that if it so fall out and be judicioussy manage it give painting diversify elegance beleive many common painter will not much thank I for disclose this matter because should lover desire such piece they would have more troublé in do it however let every man do what he will or can it fare with we art as with other if man will learn all that be necessary to become good master he may do so or if he be content with halfenquiry no body will call he in question for it but he who be able to represent single light well may in my opinion also do the other well how many brave master surmount every thing they undertake what should hinder they exhibit three or four light as well as one but let I not here approve the manner of some landscapepainter who introduce many small light into piece fond conceit without any basis think it proper to handle this matter of different lighis to shew that we ought not to regard the partial opinion of ignorant but always chuse what be most natural and agreeable mean that we should enrich we ordonnance in general accord to occasion and without affectation for which purpose we shall here exhibit a example different light plate xxxviii in expectation to hear what difficulty some will raise against it we see here building or gallery and before it mote of water on the brink whereof be man fastening boat near the water lie a heap of various kind of household goods two man be see bring forward some small vessel on bier on the pavement stand grave matron with young virgin direct the hindermost porter to lay the goods to the rest somewhat deeper in the piece be two soldier one barehead carry some household goods servant be come down the step with a heavy chest on he shoulder through a arch of this this gallery be see at the further end of field garden ascend by twenty or thirty step inclose on each side by agreen hedge some people be see go up and down the step in the field sit a herdsman with dog near stone the forepart with all the object thereabouts be little light foreard yet strongly the gallery and the figure on the same ground be light directy from the side every thing in the field be light like the step and the object on they be light forzard receive its light from southeast from south cfrom eeast and like from southeast appeal now to man of judgment whether the light ought not to differ from each other as well in tint as shade and the field to the step receive as aforesaid they light from southeast in which point isuppose the sun to be wherefore the air be there lightest the south on the right side which light the gallery only through a opening thereby become à little darker than the forepart of the piece the stepsc in the offscape cover by the rightside hedge from south and southeast and by the left from north must need receive they light from east and the air over head whence we may perceive that the object be never without light however they be encompass since what they lose on one side they gain on the other exhibit here another design plate x xxix also tend to shew different lighis in the same piece let we considerit assquare room which can receive its light from the four cardinal point for instance we suppose to be north east csouth and west again no to be northeast southeast southwest and between these point be southsoutheast eastnortheast which be needless now we ought to observe this room be open on the four side and figure stand on pedestal in the middle of it and light from the four side from which side it would receive its strongest light certainly from the east where the sun be and next southeast northeast atint less then north and south still tint darker and so the same with southwest and northwest the west side only should be the shade by these example think to have sufficiently clear the point touch the nature and effect of different light and also shew the advantage of know they as well in sunshine as common light with respect to the variety either in landscape or other subject together with the abundant means they afford for enrich a ordonnance and that above the common method subjoin that in judicious use of they we must be very careful in they disposition that they may not as ihave say seem force but natural and necessary that there may be general union and that the principal part have its predominancy ch ap xii curious observation on sunsbine hhave already say much touch sunshine and yet as matter of consequence for history and landscape painter shall from three design which for that purpose exhibit make general observation upon it and there by shew the mistake of some and the good qnality of scher as prefident for those who would get honour by live embellishment three young painter have once controversy about the representation of sunfhiine they be each of different temper one cross and positive another meek and of good judgment and the third be by the other generally account silly in the end they resolve each to make a ordonnance and to shew they skill the two first choose one and the same design see the fketch in plate xl the first have give all the object without dictinction yellowish light and make the shade strong and glow there by pretend to express the sun as fet not consider that he there by expose he ignorance as have make the groundshade too short the second have exprest theshade and groundshade not so sharp or so long as represent the sun much higher and à littie fainter yet herein shew so much more conduct on make the woman and boy who be look at a huntsman sounding he horn over tne wall whom the man come out at the gate shew they put they hand over they éyes as nature zeach when the other who have represent the sun much stronger have not take any norice of that circumstance the first place man before the tree steep in the sun the second con¬ trarily have place he in shade behind the tree and some other people be sit in repose against the wall in fhade to avoid the sun s heat the third have make delign of he own see plate x li to shew he nice observation on the sun which the other as count he silly at first laugh at he have represent naked boy sit in a open window and make bubble with pipe the child receive he light forward from the common light of the room through the window appear the top of fome house and part of as cedumn with sundial affix to it now on nice examination it appear that thislast have best beftow he thought on the sun and that neither of the other have fhewn so many good effect in they piece as he in so small compaf for first he exhibit the ccolour of sunshine in the sky and on the top of the house sufficiently differ from the common light secondly it be not enough to reprefent the sun strong or weak or with long or short groundshade but we must also see by the groundshade hozo late it be wherefore he have introduce the sundial the groundfhade whereof be on thirdly he have observe the dubioufness of the edgy object go off and lastly to shew that we can not bear the sun s excessive brightness without door he have place the child in the window in the common ligiit of the room that he might with more liberty stare about at the bubble than he could in the bright open air thus he justified the conduct of he who have make he figure shad they eye and advise the other to give he figure those of a eagle say to be the only bird which can look against the sun by these natural observation the other own themselves convinced with excuse that they laugh not at he skill but he choice which at first seen odd to they chap xiii of the sun three quality as we ought not only to view as far as we be able the wonder of nature but also to represent they likeness so we shall now make we observation about the most beautiful of thing who can be insensible of the three quality of the sun viz he splendor heat and colour can any light exceed the sun in brightness and clearness or any fire be more invigorate or consume or any colour have greater power the sunbeam say à certain poet penetrate the debth of the sea andrender the sandy grounds light imperceptible thing sensible what light can effect what this do it be faid that lightening can blind the eye though this be rather cause by its suddennef than its light as for the sun s heat ovid tell we that phéaton be of a ambitious temper im ¬ portune he father to let he drive the chariot of the sun which request be grant and the horse prove too headstrong and he ignorant of the course drive out of the way there by set the earth on fire the gold in the river tagus be see flow along this powerfal light inslame the eastern country as ethiopia lybia in such man¬ ner as to make the inhabitant black as we see they at this day the lake river and founain boil azuay even the fea become fandy valley he who would know more must consult naso himself it be say that the roll and frightful noise of the thunder will melt metak in a instant which be not improbable since the penetrate power have great effect upon they two flint by collusion will produce fire even two piece wood will by friction do the same though in themselves of cold nature in relation to the third quality the poet proceed thus phabus fay he in he light hair and sit in glitter chariot beset with carbuncle gild all thing he shine on with yellowifhi colour what light have such brightness and beautiful colour what saltpetre brimstone or other combustible matter can reach so far and spread from east to west the white moon and sparkling star nay the sudden lightenings themselves be all weak and faint if compare with the absolute beauty and splendor of he lively colour therefore very much wonder that such a ignorant can be find as meet with about five or six year ago even he who set up for great master plainly assert that the sun be blue nay azure blue be there ever harbour more absurd opinion than one which make thè most transcendant brightnef and most penetrate object the weakest since every one know blue to be the weakest of all colour and by which every thing be make to retire what light can be draw from blue do blue body produce green red or yellow yes say momus ablue object will cast yellowishness yellow light blue one and red beautiful green also yellow drapery will give green reflexion blue drapery red one and white black we moreover the light of the sun be well exprest when the main light be whitisn blue blue and the reflexion yellow and warm thus say he we must reason about all colour light by the sun think this the bluest position that can be for in painting the sun and all other object after this manner could there be more ridiculous picture how green yellow blue and spot would it appearbut many be fond of partycolour we shall give here discription of one of this master s picture work as frivolous as he judgment about the sun in this piece he have represent vulcan hammer piece of iron foot long one half whereof be redhot and the other he hold in he hand he have also exhibit venus with the same precaution sit starknaked and unconcern in the midst of the spark now be not these fine thought and worthy of representation do he not seem to saythis iron be not heat by the fire but paint of glow colour è — and indeed he shew it plainly for the pincher which vulcan ought to hold the iron by lie by he on the ground moreover he be foolisn enough to paint fire against a hanging but why do we wonder at that why should he not do it since paint fire can not burn we might suppose he as wise as the man who set piece of ice to dry in the sun that it might not wet he back in carrying home to find such wretch among mean people be truly no wonder but among painter and such as set up for great master it be past my understanding those man who be unacquainted with the true quality of the sun may be excuse but they who know see and be sensible of they and yet through carelessness or solly make such grof blunder be unpardonable artistsl be then advise in thing ye do not rightly understand that ye may be sensible of every thing art can effect be there any thing which we can not immitate with pencil and colour whether heat cold day or night earth air water fire wind thunder frightful apparition sweet sound of voice or instrument sorrow joy bitterness forrowness even invisible thing as the sound of a horn or trumpet but let we now see how these thing can be exhibit be there not abundance of motion posture and pafsion which herein afford we help and which nature herself and daily instance shew uss if we will but take notice of they what then can be want to make we meaning plain and clear to every body do not a uiexpect sound cause sudden emotion thunderclap consternation frightful specter terror and tremble burn rage and contraction of the member sourness pinch the mouth and close the eye bitterness loath contraction of the feature sweetnef placid countenance as for the representation of hot country we know that both man and beast seek there shade and cave for shelter and repose also that it be usual to wear umbrellos and go either naked or dress in thin silk in cold country we find thé contrary for there people repose and recreate in the sun or where he give the most warmth they sit in a hut or house by woodfire and if the country be near the northpole they be cloath in wooll and the skin of bear and and other wild animal thus we see one fort of people seek warmth the other coolness here the sun shine hot the snow abound the hot indian appear almost naked and the laplander and russian hug in partycoloured furs but as these effect be ow to the sun only whose insluence on these country be in proportion to he nearness to or distance from they so we know that the heat or coldness of each climate be there by cause and the sun feel hotter in one place than another since we be treat of the sun we shall also shew how the poetic expreffion describe he be to be understand poësy and painting be sister agree intirely and though fable and fiaction be not think necessary for painter yet they be delighting and useful and we can not be good painter without some aid from poëty we may make use of poetic thought as far as the history whether sacred or profane will admit and as the nature of thing can be there by express how can the morning noon evening and night be more elegantly represent than homer do it in some passage of he work among other at the end of he odyssee where he say all object appear in the moring at the dawn of aurora dark and afterwards the imperceptible grow light distinguisnes and give they naturalcolour thus he as to the

gradually yellow aud stronger as she give way to phaeb we need not say more of the name which the poet assign this great heavenly luminary nature have the same daily in almost all those quality and he who do not consider nature will reap little advantage from my observation chap xiv of the nature of the sun with respect to different country ormerly at leisure hour divert myself withread the description of several eastern and northern country write by linschot olaus magnus archbishop of upsal and other and on one side see the cape of good hope where the sun s great heat be temper by the seabreeze asit be through all india java china and other region of cina writer say that it enjoy the sweetest air and the inhabitant arive at great age and no contagious distemper be hear of amongst they read also of many costly and strange rarity and of the the cocatree yield refresn hiquor and what elfe be worth obferve on the other fide of the world view greenland which find to be exceffive cold and full of high mountain cover with eternal snow the feas abound with whale and the air pierce and rigorous on the comfortable sun s departure amd like the country the people rough and savage as we see in the goth fin and laplander and other bordering nation where cold air and nature have great insluence on the people digesting these thing have fancy to make two sketch of they in one represent accord to the writer palm and cocoatree little water but many hill and for the embellishment some naked black the light sunshine in the other could exhibit little else than firtree wooden hut and drift of ice the people have cloath with beast fkin and some hunt wild bear other busy in drag whale on the ice which they have kill with harpiron in fine circumstance of they manner of live these scratch be lie on my table for further improvement as they occur in my thought when gentleman on make I visit cast he eye on they and though but slightly scratch buy they of I and at the same time bespoke another piece the subject whereof should have from he son then newly arrive from india accordingly the son describe to I certain place in india where he have live generally inhabit by black except the governor himself and some other he instruct I in several particular as well manners as dress and other thing proper to the country all which set down and then make rough sketch of it with pen in he presence in which he faid have rightly take he meaning this be do feh to colour it in hope thereby to get he future favour which do the young gentleman s affair in the mean time call he out of town for three week he father on he return have meeting of some friend and on that occasion send for the picture which be finish and at the same time desire my company the piece be instantly hang up and after the gentleman have little view it he take I by the hand and whisper these word . it be very well do but lforget to tell you one thing of great moment yet you can alter in half a hour s time to be fhort have take the sun too low and also make he fall into the piece sidezbay which occafion long groundesnade whereas should have make he vertical or over head as he most time appear in that country be confound and own my fault for he criticism be juft since the great heat must be exprest by the sun s vertical position here see that after all my pain have fail in the main point for the reason aforefaid the gentlemanjudgment be as right in one point as wrong in the other for he must need be acquainted with the nature of the climate but he saying how eafily the fault might be rectify remind I of the case of apelles and think ne sutor ultra crepida because he there by discover he ignorance for rub out the groundshade would not in the least have better it and to enlighten the figure from on high would be more work than to begin new picture nevertheless he teach I to make my advantage of it in time to come chap xv of the sun s light upon object at rife and set tis unaccountable in many artift who handle a art whofe theory be build on mathematics its practice on experience and the execution on nature thatthey take so little notice of the three point wherein lie they honour especially in the lighting of object in funset for the sun how low soever can not shine on any object under the parallel namely not in the least from underneath be the object if may say so as high as the cloud and yet we see mariy painting where inthe object be by funset more light from underneath than above which be contrary to nature as we may daily experience in walk against the sun how troublesome it be to shade the eye we turn we head sideways or hold a handkerchief before we eye even the hat be no defence and yet the sun never take it underneath this may be plainly evidence by perspective to wit that as the horizon limit we sight and the sun can not with respect to the eye descend lower therefore he can not send he ray upwards but along the ground or parellel must need shine into they even dare to say that werethe brim of you hat ten acre broad and parallel with the horizon it would not cast shade of pin s breadth over you eye nor the sun so much as take the under part of the brim though we be stand on a eminence but to he the better understand let we consider plate x lii where on the foreground tplace figure with board on its head like the americans level with the eyebrow naxt we see a high building with project cornice run towards ghe point of sight and on the other side a high column with figure onit have sucha board on its head as the other now vou may perceive that thie sun do not strike underneath against it but send he ray paraleel imean when he be seht draw then ray from the sun parallel with the board of the forefigure and see how much shade it be eye will have fetch anothe ray from the front or cornice to the sun s center to find how much fhade the projecture will throw on the frize dothe same by the figure on the column then you will perceive that the joint of the stone in the building will be parallel with the sun s ray and that the offcorner of it though lower than the near one will yet be alike with the near one and the frize parellel with the ground if it be object that when we lie out at window the sun be lower than the windowboard we lean on and do not fhine onit answer that we only imagine so for if we rightly observe we shall perceive fmall groundshade of the crofpiece of the window though ever so faint wherefore we be enable to conclude that as long as the sun fhine nay ifbut fingerbreadth above the horizon the ground must receive some light and of consequence aslong as the ground be somewhat light it be impoffible for the sun to shine on any thing from underneath suppose for instance column six foot high light by sunsunset if this column through anv visible shade on the ground the ground must have some light and if so how be it possible that the sun should shine from above and from underneath at the same time andif it be grant that the sun do not light the column on top its groundshade must need be infinite in which case the capital ought just to be light from underneath and the ground of necessity to be without light this be ah undeniable truth though thepoint be alittle handle by writer even seldom heed by master it be also no wonder to see some fail in it the most probable reason for which as think be they ignorance in perspective chap x vi of the application of sunsbine and other light tis a old and root evil and there by become law rather to gratify we fancy and paffion than consult reason most painter verify this in they cnoice and use to represent sunshine say they be pleasant and delight the eye therefore we must always introduce it but this can not be since the va riety of the season and change in all thing visible demonstrate the contrary this light be indeed very agreeable in landscape but very disserviceable within door for how ridiculous in great entertainment would sunshine appear on the table and how could the guest see oneanother or how could the glitter of the plate be express without obscure every thing else what fine piece would that be where the white tablecloth must be mix with black and how agreeable would it look to see the groundshade of the windowframe and square express on the table and floor sunshine be not always proper and yet some will not give themselves time to think whether the subject require it or not as in christ s crucifixion it be improper because the scripture mention the sun to be hide the better to explain my meaning shall exhibit three different light in as many ordonnance relate to the person of we saviour of christ s crucifixion here on mount golgotha be the place of suffer the sun though at noon be obscure by dark cloud behold how the place be light from the right side where be the cross and people receive strong and broad light from the cloud all this appear on the second ground the figure on the foreground shadow by cloud be not so broadly light but unite gradually in force with the other until they come to be alike broadlight about the third ground the sky be darker and full of heavy cloud which as they rise seem to draw little crof towards the sun which be on the right side now we must follow truthas much as possible and nof we fancy or choice here every thing ought to be still and inactive christ be dead do not this furnish sufficient reason for mourn wherefore choose the aforesaid light as best express forrow and yet it benot proper on all occasion as may appear in the two follow ordonnance one of which be strong and broadly light and the other with sunshine sharp and longshade truly piece with these consideration and exhibit the nature of thing and time must need please the curious even the very hearing such reason and observation can make lover know especially if he be instruct by good master in right principle and be somewhat conversant in draw such one may even convince painter if he have particular genius quick apprehension and good memory improve he time read good book and shun such company as prattle much and do little to converse with the fkilful and judicious be very commendable but the contrary injurious reason should always take place and discerning judgnient not to be reject rather do something less and weigh it throughly au gustustsay be on this occasion not amiss festina lente haste zeith ease good thing will endure but those which be so seemingly must decay but my zeal have carry I too far and therefore ishall return to my purpose in the ordonnance of chrittburial the rock on the left side of the piece which open little forward and have dark and deep entrance be the place of christ s burial the funeral rite be perr form within and one or two lamp be see somewhat to light the hollow the body be carry in by three or four man the time be about the evening and thesun do not shine behold the people against the rock almost without groundshade as be light from on high and little forward because of another piece of rock rise up there by the side alike with the former observe the three figure on the ground stand between the two rock those want theforelight must need receive it from behind somewhat further on the third ground which be the common road some people be come close by the tree .. stand on the right side of the piece who on the other side beyond the large rock receive they light from the left side plain proof that be they more distant in the field they would be light from all side my principal remark on the piece be this this bury place belong to joseph of arimathea and lie near the city of jerusalem as the text shew he be there with he people who carry in the corps now my intention be to light this foremost group as strongly as possible and yet without sunshine the light come almost front by reason ofthe side rock which obstruct side light so that they can scarce have any shade other than from behind through the rock or bury place little from some cypress stand on one side of it between the two rock shew that the people come forward must need be light from behind since they be still half in the open air and that those somewhat further off in the road against the side tree ought to be light forward backward ward and from the leaveside where the rook be wvery slow consequently have but little shade on the right side of the tref againsti which theiri groudshade fall the other group and the stoneheap in the field on lower groundshiew to be light from all side and to have no other shade than from below andthe deepest hollow because the sky be settle and without cloud now it be certain that few will relisni so nice a observation since they follow they own fancy without further inquiry yet if any of the circumstance be omit the matter would also be less apparent the chief regards have here be to the light the time or hour the situation of the bury place and the quality of the man who performthe funeral rite not only as to he person and authority but also with respect to he dress together with the manner of the solemnity accord to scripture all which appear plainly as for the stoneheap in the offscape they be bury place jerusalem of which the aforesaid be one we see they raise up and down about small and mean large and stately accord to the condition of those who cause they to bemade as the scripture testify liet we now observe the third ordonnance of christ s resurrection ftagain reprefent here rock before the entrance whereof be sit the young man orangel on the stone of thesepulchre in shine rayment speak to the chree woman andpoint upwards christ arise be surround with raylike thgfe of the sun whereby two of the woman one beholding he with she handover hersey be so strongly and sharply light that they shade by reason of the nearness of the dazzle fall very distinct on the ground forward and on tevery thingelse thereabouts one of these woman as nearest the young man thereby réceive strong reflexion when the third who be step towards the sepulchre be without the reach of eitherlight aud though receive in manner some light from the air yet melt in the broadshade somewhat further on thesecond ground the tree also along the way give broad shade in the offscape beséen jerusalem in rise mist because it be daybreak the heaven abound with thin cloud mostly in the sun s quarter which on the rightside of the piece appearlittle on the horrizon somewhat yellowisni and purple now if lover or master will with due reflexion join he thought with mine and not fear any trouble in the performance s question not but he will by such representation satisfy coartist and merit the name of great master chap xvii of the propertio of the sun and other light in tkeir essential representation andofthe chief time of the day we need not say further that light differ in they kind as have in the preceed chapter suffiiciently shew they nature effect and quality yet to finisn this head we shall here subjoin some particular which could not before have place as for the sun my opinion be that he can not be represent in any picture first because the eye be too weak to behold he and therefore he force can not be express otherwise than by he make all object dark and black secondly because when he shine directly in we face we can not perceive the right shape or colour of thing unless we shade the eye as nature teach for the same reason think we may not represent burn candle torch or other matter give great light unless we also exhibit the object as this light make they appear to we and not as by they colour stir and union they really be for the further from the candle the more faint they become it be therefore folly to maintain that the natural force of candlelight efpecially if the flame be see can be imitate sinceit be past we fkill to give the other work its appearance for when the light of the candle shine in we face the most deep and dark colour even black itself appear neither darker or blacker than thoy would in dark day but we shall afterwards treat more largely of these lighta and therefore now proceed to say that those who love to paint sunshine may observe that it be proper for sacrifice combat bacchanal dancing sport of herdsmen and sundry other jovial occurrence and history which require great bustle but very improper and obstruct in council pleading entertainment academy weddingceremony and other such circumstance but cloudlight give a uncommon decorum and naturalness in solemn affair fuch as aslembly of magistrate pleading and other business of authority and consequence the third of the light of which we have speak the torch or candle be proper for mournful occafion for die person burial and such fike efpeciaky in the open air the sun appear agreeable and delightful in the open field when through thick bush and tree he ray here and there light the grounds and the people be see repose or divert in the shade but he act against nature who exhibit tender and beautiful virgin bafk in sunshiny field stare at the sun and talk and beholding each other with as little concern as if it be but candie or starlight since he himself would leave they company and retire to shade to prevent any mistake of which kind let we describe the chief time of the day doybreak this firstbear time of the day favour the enterprize of great general in besieg or storm town no time more proper for it by the example of joshiua in take jericho this rule though not without exception have be observe by all nation of which could give many instance the battle of pompey against casar begin at that time it be also the proper time for hunt as in the representation of diana cephalus adonis or any such subject judicious master always chuse the hour of the day which best agree with they story this time be of singular advantage for the half tint it give exhibit all thing in they natural colour whence arise a uncommon agreeableness and decorum the morning this time principally rejoice nature even inanimate thing be sensible of it the glitter light take the top of high mountain and cause both in building and landscape great shade appear very delightful this light at break out give uncommon sweetnef when the object shine in the water as also certain freshness mix with vapour which bind the part of thing so well together as entirely to please the eye of the know at this time the heathen offer they sacrifice and we read in the book of mose that the child of lfrael have not only they morning oblation but also worship the golden calf at that time the jez retain those custom to this day as also do the ancient christians who often baptize in the morning as be likewise christ in jordan the persian moreover honour the morning by they offering wherefore we ought to have due regard to the time of the day on all such occasion and take especial care that the light on the principal object and place accord to poussin s conduct in picture of christ restoring the blind to fight wherein the greatest and strongest light be entirely spread over we saviour the light between morning and noon this light be not very fit for object if it be not break by some accident of rain storm or tempest such time may be proper for mournful occafion such as the last judgment and we savioursuffer when as say in the last chapter the sun be darken which look frightful and cause a expressible amazement wherefore fine and pleasant weather would on such occafion look ridiculous noon at this time the sun darting he glitter ray shine in full splendor wherefore desire those who use this season to think that nature effect by the force of this light what can not be represent since we often fail in we utmost attempt for that purpose whereby it happen that in endeavour to make thing come forward forward we often use such force of light on the foreground as far exceed that of the sun as in the case of drapery of fiery colour or the like certainly a unaccountable way of proceed nevertheless the sun s light may be hide behind mountain building this hour give rest to human labour the scripture tell we that christ tired with he journey sit to rest on the well which give the woman of samaria occafion to hear he wonderful prediction he disciple also weary sit down near he he who endeavour truly to represent the nature of thing must especially observe the time and hour proper to they the afternoon asthis season be most liable to diversity of weather by means of driving cloud which occafion many overcast it be very proper in the representation of bacchanal and licentious action but these be not always fix to that time the evening labour cease at this time it give liberty for all sort of pastime as dancing walk if you would represent the march home of a army or herdman drive they cattle out of the field this time be the most proper for they this light frequently change its colour by the interposition of rise vapour which it draw but do notwithstanding most time enlarge the superficy of object when the shade do not receive the reflexion of other object they ought to partake of the light this season be quite different from the morning yet no less agreeable by its small glitter light if we keep the general light somewhat dusky which create great mass or part especially when the colour be somewhat disperse by judicious master at noon the sun s light must proceed from on high give short groundshade but in a evening he light must be low and cause long groundshade this morning be like the evening and with the moonlight agree chap xviii of the moon and she representation question not but many of my position and observation in this point will be censure as heterodox for be contrary to both ancient and modern practice nevertheless shall not fear to enforce they that discreet artist may enquire whether they be found on reason or not especially see they be not new invention but correction of old mistake as think shall prove suppose then that it be grof error to represent the moon lessthan the life because how distant soever she be we nevertheless see she like the sun always retain she natural bigness and if this be grant the contrary must be unnatural and therefore forbidden toa painter who be the imitator of true nature .. have mind to paint moonshine would wlthout injury to nature imanage at as have before say would represent the sun that be to exhibit she fhine but not she body for the light be of greater moment in picture thanthebodio of either the sun moon or candle lighting my object there by either from behind sideways or forward and as well in figure as landscape somewhat darker than the daylight that it may appear true moonlight and not sunshine which it very much affect by its sudden light and sharp groundshade make the blue sky here and there with some glitter star and to maké it still look more natural we may if the subject permit introduce up and doun torch or other light burn pile of wood offering or other fire as occasion require and tbereby make the light stronger and the colour russet and more yellow yet the shade not to be so sharp as those of the moon this would in my opinion have fine effect especially if the say accidental light be mostly order in dark place but we ought principally to observe that in the whole there must be see more darknef than light and that no colour appear so beautiful as those of the sky in reference to the moon unlefs they be red yellow and such other as be peculiar to burn light as we have shew in the first chapter of the fourth book for light red and yellow become dark the moon s brightness contrarily make dark blue and sea green appear lighter but black keep it be post wherefore little light red and as little dark blue ought to be see in the picture by such disposition we gain two advantage natural light a untcommon variety in the colour if any one find any difficulty herein he may please to know that he be no more oblige to exhibit the moon than the sun in he piece because the former take its course round the heaven as well as the latter and may therefore be place as the elegance of the figure and bywork require since both illuminate the earth and its object forward backward and fideway as to quality in three particular the moon be so like the sun that there be no difference between they as she always throw she ray parallel as well as he all that be light by she be broad and sharp the shade on the ground be plain and conform with the object but the reflexion be not so strong as in sunshine because the moonlight be weaker than the sunby reason of the oppofite nature of those two luminary the one be warm and the other cold and as the moon receive she light from the sun she can therefore not have so much power to impart it to the earth nor the object light by she appear so distinct to the eye again as the sun often alter he colour by means of the vapour which he exhale so we find the same in the moon who by the same means become also more pale or yellow in proportion to the vapour about she or the airrarity or density can it be doubt whether such piece of moonlight without the appearance of she body be such when the darkness broadness and sharpness of the groundshade and the palenefs of the colour be well observe all which conjunctively express evening or night if it be question whether this be the former practice say have no business to enquire into that since we ought not to accommodate the art to fancy but we sense to the art it be to as little purpose purpose to consider whatbe do but rather what may or ought to be do accord to the dictate of right reason in short it be impossible when the three afbresaid quality be well observe in piece it should fail of represent very natural moonlight as my position run counter to old custom and therefore not so easy to apprehension have endeavour to explain myself by the three example in plate x liii in the first stiew the moon in she natural bigness yet without the piece because she would atherwise come too near the horizon and cause too long and disagreeable groundshade in the second sne be exhibitafter the old way and in the third shew only starry sky with the strong light of moon who as in the first example be without the picture if any one think that the moon s body give strong glitter elegance and life to piece say the sparkling light of the star do the same especially if we make they as large as they appear to we but not in perspectiveway as being between heaven and earth like the moon however we need not represent they all but the chief only such as the chariot the triangle the serpent the north and evening star and such as make know figure all which as have nofigural be but only the shine of very small light may be eafily express by small point we may also make the moon though without the piece appear in the water and cause a agreeable reflexion in the wave furge and by chuse such sidelight we have the advantage of reprefent all thing mast beaatifal neithermore norlessthan in sunshine or common light ii must subjoinanother important consideration which be that as the moon s light be sometimes obstruct by high object such as rock palace tree hill so fome part mustineed be dark in which the reflexionst of so weak light have no power to enlighten or fetch out the object or bodyin they though ever sonear for tiist reafon painter oughttoavoid such accident and not to iatroduc thenp unlefs through necessity to create aharmony or force and to place tham mostlyt forward or in the offscape against the sky for set they between both can not but make disageeable spot unlefs it be break by somer wacer wherein reffexion of same star or other light of the air appear and into such choice oflandscapeor visto you may introduce whitemarbleimage huilding light by work and lightcoloured stuff which all together look agreeable and asthe nightvapour be more dense then those of the day so the distan object become more suddenly dark and undistinguishable forget nat that in windy weather themoon as well as the northstar be encompass with yellow ring if any person be not yet fully satisfied let he please to weigh the follow paspable reason the sun moon and star can not diminish because we can nerthe approach nearer nor goi further from theybut all sublunary object can by we recess or appraach lessen or magnisy and to prove this take glaf of thesize vou intend you picture place it before window and draw on it the prospect with the moon as it then appear to the eye which do you will seesee how large she ought to be paint now ifyou approach with this glass some thousand step nigher towards the sun or moon they will not appear bigger on or through the glass but have the same magnitude whence arise the falsity of those representation which diminish the sun moon or other meteor as well as the figure conclude then that the picture exhibit nature contrary to what she ought to be be liable to censure and that we ought to seek truth by ratiocination and then wave old custom and prejudice to believe we own eye shall further illustrate this matter in the chapter shew what be mean by table and of the use of magnifying and diminish glass and of the difference between large and small warm and weak painting to which we refer the curious artist chap xix of the effect of artificial light as of torch lamp candle or fire ave in the most plain and concise manner treat of the effect of the sun moon and starlight we shall on the same foot speak also of the auxillary light which necessity for the ease of mankind have contrive and art bring to perfection ithink it not amiss to shew here in the first place the force and property of these particular light in such manner as conceive they that of flambeaux or torch be at night the most powerful and beautiful have two quality to wit of affright and rejoice its light be very proper for bacchanal entertainment play and other jovful meeting and on the contrary frightful in sorcery apparition of ghost and suchlike nocturnal and unexpected accident the lamp be melancholy faint and gloomy and therefore proper for burial prison near fick and die person and on other mournful occafion this light be most agreeable withindoor and in cave grotto or frightful and unfrequent place of small extent the nature of this light and its effect on colour be the same as those of the sun with respect to its falsifying the colour but the light and reflexion be not so strong for which reason the artist be often at stand in the use of they arise mostly from he slighting this light as matter not worth he observation in reference to shade they be not much unlike those of the sun as well in broadnef as sharpnef yet with this difference that the sunlight fall more uniform on object as he be more distant from they and because in the evening but especially at night the vapour be darker and more dense than those of the day whence it follow that all object deprive of the lamplight disappear and by reason of its nearness can be light but in part to confirm this we shall exhibit mathematical instance in plate x liv point forthe centre of the light from which all the ray flow draw under it candlestick of certain height as four foot above the grouud then sketch three or four column go off further and further from the say point of light iet thesebe eight foot high next set one foot of the compass on the say point and extend the other so as to touch the extremity of the first pillar sweep segment of circle on the shaft do the same with the other pillar now you will perceive that the first pillar be least touch but receive the strongest light and that above and beneath the touch the light fall weaker and weaker moreover that the furthest column be most touch by means of the greater sweep of the compass and therefore it will be light allmost all over but also most weak whence it be plain that object light by such light be never light intirely and uniform and be they touch and light alike it would be faint and dark that we should perceive nothing distinctly either in colour or ontline more than in weak moonshine if any want further information how lapply this to practice shall now freely impart it first sketch my ordonnance on blue or dark draw paper then imake my plan to shew the place of the figure and other object which islightly scratch next assign point for my light either high or low as occasion require on this point set one foot of the compass and with the other touch circlewise with a extent equal to each object s distance from the say point all the object wherever it happen by this means lfind the part which as nearest the light ought to have the strongest light and consequently the diminution of the light and colour shew itself in proportion as it go off from the draw circle as for the reflexion they be in the same case with all light the brightest largest and strongest give the strongest and the purer the light the more yellow appear the colour both in the light and reflexion contrarily the fouler and more vaporous the light the more russet seem the colour candle be yellowish the light of lamp be russet flambeaux or torch be more red artist who delight in represent such light ought to regard the three sollow useful precept to keep most light together to take special care in the melting and lighting of they outline to observe the naturalnef of the several light whether candle lamp or torch it must also be note that the space between the eye and the light as likewise the first object or sigure if it come before the light ought to be tne darkest but if it be behind the light it become weaker both in light and shade occasion by the vapour which as before have be say appear more dense in the evening the nightlight more affect they and enlighten they add to this that the mainlight be temper with light yellow russet or red the diminution and breaking of those colour ought to be find by black mean by black and the proper colour wherewith the object be shade and more or less weak in proportion to they distance for the farémoft darkness and nearest to the light be more warm than the hinder and furthermost which in pro¬ portion to its distance become more blue yet much more in the open air than within door because the vapour of the air be more subtile thanthose of confine light which be make with lampoil rosin or the like emit foul smoak bnt as to the foremost object must by means of confine light withindoor need be subject to much shade whereby they often maintain but smalllight on they extremety it will be find that such outward light appear more or less strong that the object light straight forward accord as the stuff whereon it fall be either rough or smooth as for the reflexion with the light shine through thin fold observe the same management as prescribe for sunshine touch those part but in break the colour let I subjoin that the foremost darkness must be the greatest and therefore less falsify by the light than those whdch be more distant thecolour therefore keen cleaner and be less foul and still less in the open air than within door be even not afraid to add a easy method for find the diminution of the tint on object accord to they distance not from the point of sight but from the candle torch or lamp cut strip of paper or vellum as long as from the center of the light to the furthest corner of the piece let it be finger and half broad at bottom and cut away to point at top than paint the point with such colour as you give you light yellowish or russet diminish it gradually in proportion to its go off from the light next with pin fix the say point in the center of the light so as to move it about at pleasure to all the object near to or distant from the light then divide this strip into degrade foot small at the point light end and from thence gradually larger by which mean the strip will shew without trouble the right tint to temper for the object go into the picture towards the point of sight you may make another strip the reverse of the former to wit light at the bottom and diminisning towards the top or point to be fix on the point of sight if you would use any more help for the diminution of the colour and less troublesome try the follow method have in my ordonnance exactly design the figure after the life paint it like common lightpiece without break the colour more than perspective require the light take as from candle or other matter proceed from point within the piece whether within door or in the open air after which take thin glaze vellow of the same tint give to my light and scumble it neatly and thin over both light and snade this yellow must not be too dark because my main heighten be take only from common light wherefore asphaltum yellow lake and dragon s blood would be so warm and sensible as to take away the mistness inseperable from nightpiece unlefs it be before paint accordingly to theno small trouble of the artist now as glaze thing commonly abate of they neatness you may if it be necessary retouch the main light as well in the face as other part and there by fetch out they force again theadvantage arise from this methodbe that there be no kind of nightlight whether of lamp or other oil pitch brimstone eandle or torch but it may be represent with the same trouble because it depend only on the temper the lglaz eoleur the best iof which in my opinion be gumbooge light pink or yellow lake mix with little vermillion think these very good method because sometimes in nightpiece especially in great bustle we use twe three and more particular burn matter for light and by this means we obtain sure method for fetch out those light and fire not onlyat night but also in the day time in the evening nay in sunshine where we often meet with flambeaux torch burn altar or pile of ewood but ilet I not proposelthefe precept as law but example to exercise the artist s curiosity and for he proficiency wherein wiffi my labour may be of service chap xx necessary hint in the use of perspective have be long consider point which in ty opinion be very remarkable and yet have never beeni settle though think it may be do it relate to the execution of historib either within or without doorand landscape embellish with figure my thought be that as perspective afsign certain distance for view picture with respect to its magnitude or smallness or large pièce with large figure and other object go off to wit on the second andthird grounds those object ought to be as neatly finish as those on the foreground provide they keep they faintness cause by the interpose air thisposition tthink be found on certain and natural principle but must prevlously suppose that when we say piece be well finish it must be understand that the whole be so and not part only if we begin inquiry we ought to push tham asfar as poffible to enable we to say such pièce be aftfully execute nay so perfect that nothing be want for that can nôt be affirm when the fore groundbe finish and well paint and the second andthird grounds but slightly touch grant that we sometimes see piece with small figure though loosely handle account finer and more artful than large picture labour and highlyfinisnied yet it must be allow that more work be necessary in large finish piece than small one loofely handle the very word finish and loosely imply it my opinion be that if we be not want in trouble and time as artfulpiece may be produce as what have be hitherto do yet only by those whounderstand art and its rule in theory and practice and though it seëm difficult to attempt thing new we must not therefore be discouragefor what great thing have not be experiment and perform what do not aexandere have he fear danger and trouble he would never have go the length he do he have mind to do it this create resolution and that finish he hope but to return to we subject let wesuppose that picture ten foot high with figure as big as the life ought to be view at ten foot distance and that smaller one five foot high with figure half as big as the life must have five foot distance and thus the smaller tne nearer accord to perspective now the question be which of those three piece ought to be most finish many will cerrainly saythe last but my opinion be that each of the three piece inust be paint equally neat because each have its determinate distance with respect to its bigness again there be another such piece ten foot high but divide into three grounds whereon be place the same figure as in the three former to wit those as big as the life on the foreground those half as big on the second and the last on the third ground the question now be which of these three grounds ought so be most finish be all in one picture the judge will contrary to what they before assert say the first and that the hindermost must not be so neat and finished since they can never relisn that the figure on the second and third grounds ought to be paint as neat and elaborate as those on the foreground for say theywho would perceive it at ten foot distance nay who ever see such painting or do it but the case be not whether there have be such picture but whether they ought to be so we be not ignorant that it be the custom to finish small piece the smaller the neater and large one contrarily bold or loose now would fain know the reason why there should be more work in figure of three foot than in one of sixp can it be prove that the small one ought to have fold nay a hair more than in full proportion but what other answer can be make if the custom be not good it would not have prevail nor last so long .. nevertheless as long as we reason thus without foundation and bigot ourselves to common practice and old custom we shall never advance it be not the proper way to go forward and therefore many keep they old station but want to be inform of new thing without which art can not improve variety nourish the mind igrant that man sometimes produce new thing which meet not with public approbation but whence come they either from false grounds and inconsideration or else a immethodical way of explanation to express my thought perspicuoussy have exhibit they as plain as could in plate xlv and question not but you will apprehend my meaning numb have three piece front with they distance of ten five and three foot and a half num be the same in profile with the measure or visual ray which limit thedistance whether great or small be the same position as num where they be all three in one now my original question with respect to numb be which of the three piece ought to be most finish lf any one say the small one because it must be view nearest afk again whether there must be more work in the small than the large one now behold numb where thay be all three in one accord accord to perspective and let the question be which ought to be most finish the foremost or the hindmost you will certainly answer that it shew itself that the figure on the foreground must be more finish than what be furthe off and that there must also be more work in the large asbe nearer but how agree this with what be just now say that the smallest of the three piece ought to be most finish since now you say the largest must be so for example and object be the same and it be already grant that the smaller it be the nearer be the distance asfign and that in the smallest or furthermost when nearest there ought to be as much work as in the foremost and though you will s say that the last figure be fainter than the foremost yet there be not fold less in it than if it be quite forward and as big as the life iurge further when highly finisn figure in full proportion after the life must sit at least as near as the model be high to perceive even the most minute part of it now ifl would make another figure half as big also after the life to place it on my second ground how must then set the model ought to keep the same sitting or must remove further from it à this last be never do for if we be we should instead of paintingroom want westminsterhall in order to model a offscape figure after the life but supposing it be so must then fit so far off that may see it more naturally it be certain that should not see the half of it and though it may be say to this that what can not be see in the life ought not to make it look natural to come into picture yet pray observe that supposing make in the offscape figure of foot and half high and the subject require it to be hold thread to which hang medal of the bigness of half guinea the question be whether must expref the medal but not the thread again be to express window without the glaze or lead¬ work or door without hinge or keyhole what would those thing be take for if these do not appear medal drop out of the hand a open window and sereen instead of door from all which premise linfer that if thing be practicable and have any bigness they ought to be express in the little and as may say even to thread the distance make they natural and if well paint and the diminution be exactly observe accord to the remoteness of the object whether these observation will pass current lknow not yet every man have the liberty to use or let they alone as he pleafes ch ap x xi of the different colour in great and small piece ryhss proposition be consequence of the preceed andto be intelligible shall shew my thought by the follow example in plate x lvi there be gallery twelve foot high and twentyfive foot long divide into three pannel each sive foot wide and ten foot high the two outward pannel be cloath from top to bottom and the middle one but half way from the top downward and under it be a handsome seat the three cloths be tobe paint by three several master suppose with landscape all have like horizon but different point of sight one master embellisnhe work with figure either fable or history another introduce architecture and imagery accord to he gusto andthe third adorn he with cattie or what else he thinksfit the question be now in order to produce general decorum ggree with na¬ ture whether thes e master otght not to be concur inthey work withrespect to perspective force and deminution certainly they ought for the light must in all the three picture fall alike either from the leave right before or behind the air must be the same since they all ought to appear as one landscape see through three opening as two door and window but now another question arise whether the figure in all three ought to be as big as the life à this will be agree to with respect to those onthe foreground but how then will it be in the middle picture which be but half the size osthe two other how shall figure be introduce there in full proportion for half foot of ground or five foot be too much difference now if the master who be to make the middle as the smallest piece paint it as strong and warmas he be able nay as face in full proportion of rémbrant iit would be intirely against nature and the rule of art but to return to we example suppose the offscape either in small or large piece tobe one and the same even be the one as small as the palm of the hand and the other ten yard high the reason and exampleswhereof have sufficiently shew in the last chapter and shall further enforce in its place in tiat treat of what be to be understand byfa paint table whether landscape historv portraiture we know but before leave this subject must stillstart another difficulty that large painting be often copy in little and the contrary now if for instance all that be large in the original be lessen in proportion in the copy how can they look alike as in the design with the two door be exhibit in bogh which be large cloud and in the other small one and all that be in the offscape scem more distant in the one than the other if the offscape in the small picture be that of the great one by what can you proveit since the object which in the greatest distance in the small piece be hardly visible appear in the great one so large and distinct to which answer that every thing appear in the one be and remain in the other always the same but so much nearer and this be evident for be there any thing in the world which how remote soevever cannot be still remoter it have be formerly sad that every thing on earth be subject to the law of perspective except the fun moonandstar andwhat else be see in the firmament with respect to they form as forthe cloud they be moveable body and therefore must be consider as earthly object lessen andenlarge accord to they distance height and lowness all these thing say can go off and approach be distant and near besides there be s difference betwen copy and a original as well in the form as use say in the formy because because theone ought tobe view afar off and the other near moreover it never happen that the copy be hang by the original but the fellow to it chap x xii of the difference of force in large and small painting and the effect of magnifying and diminisbing glass eewo be better understand we shall begin with the air and take these two point for grant namely that all dark object in proportion as they go off become on they light part lighter and lighter and the light one contrarily darker and darker how clear soever the weather yet less in sunshine as éxperience sufficiently shew now ifit be afk whether the colour of the object do not there by also loose its nature and purity it can loose but little and only in shade which break by the other side of the light be gradually transform into the blue of it in proportion as the object go off or to speak better until uniting with the offscape they at last disappear consider also the difference between small painting in the open air and those within door in reference to the go off and the colour we say first that the air without be the most clear and bright light in the absence of sunshine and though a apartment must need be light from without yet it will be less in force and brightnef and therefore the object more darkish both in light and shade secondly the object can not so visibly grow faint in they go off because by the smallnef of the distance few or no vapour be perceptible thirdly the shade be not subject to any alteration or mixture but retain they natuzal quality because there be no other light within door than what come through the window and this have not power enough to cause any reflexion save some little near the window nor give any colour so that by the darkishness the object whether portrait figure flower retain they natural colour intirely as well in shade as light wherefore since the beauty and purity of the colour appear best by the serenity and brightnef ofthe air they must contrarily abate in they effect and force by means of the darkness ishall here propose small instance for explanation let good master paint any thing as portrait landscape figure or cattle in oil as small and neat as miniaturepainter and let both these master chuse they subject most beautiful and natural now view the two painting together and you will find that the one differ as much fromthe other as withindoorlight do from the open air it be therefore unnatural and against the rule to use that warmth and strength of colour in order to force small and distant object out of they proper place or to make the window sly towards we instead of go off from we we ought moreover to know that thing paint in little can never never be take for the truth fince it be undeniable that the life appear therein no otherwise than at distance viz through door window or other opening whether within or without door wherefore they ought to be paint in such manner that when hang up they may not appear like apainted board cloth or flat but natural window or door through which the life be really see which can not be effect by the force of warm shade or hot colour but by the retire and tender one break by the interpose air accord as the weather be more or less clear or misty and this without exception of any ordonnance whether landscape architecture history experience will confirin the truth if you view you picture through piece of sine gause somewhat bluisn for then you will find the light of you object gradually grow weaker in proportion to they distance without loose the beauty of they colour it will even give piece certain softness and sweetness and great decorum you may make the same experiment with another piece of gause of grey colour in imitation of foggy weather and it will not only darken the light of the object but also foul and muddle it and make the painting look cold and disagreeable have shew that the use of the greatest force of shade in small painting be unnatural and against art as well in within as withoutdoor representation we shall now speak of the contrary to wit piece with large object in order to shew what therein without prejudice we think the most natural it be constant maxim that the life see near be in greatnef force and colour superior to what be distant the one be nature itself and the other seemingly so for figure in full proportion be like we who view they in every particular of force aspect and colour except motion which be grant it may be easily apprehend if we will submit to reason that there be vast difference between large and small ordonnance of figure in fuil proportion and those half as big with respect to the interpose air the only true cause of thing be more or less faint and they go off as well in within as withoutdoor representation let we then rightly observe in what manner such large object ought to appear that they may be natural and artful but previously consider two thing what handling be the most natural for they execution as for the light ithink the common best and much more proper than sunshinc and though some who set up for the buono gusto be continually talk of painting broad it be neverthelefs great error as we have often say always and without difference to use that manner since it be not proper in common chamber light especially in figure as big as the life which ought to be in all respects like the spectator even so much that if paint on board and cut away they should not be take for painting but the life itself to give they broad shade but dubious and melt one to the end that they may rise and round not black like spagnolet nor grey yellow or russet like rembrant john lieven and many other ltalian dutch and flemiss painter who without difference bring warmth as they call it into the shade to such degree as to fire they only to cause force let this be duly weigh lest the colour of the natural and perfect life be neglect in my opinion it be best to make the shade of the same nature as the stuff exhibit in all object whether nudity drapery wood stone either red yellow blue or green the most proper colour as well in light as shade as to the force ishould not be sparing either of white or black though many have pratend that we must not use white good painter will attempt any thing you must not suffer yourself to be sway by this or that manner follow nature and you content art away then with drudgery and muddle handle you work boldly yet not with rembrant and lieven to let the colour run down the cloth but lay they smooth and even that you object may seem round and relieved only by art not by daub let the agreement be so general that in truth it may be say the figure be large strongly paint and boldly handle people nowday think that painting have attain such perfection as not to admit of further improvement since the beautiful and great manner the bon goût and hot colour be at this time finely perform in france italy the netherlands and other country where art flourish but we do not find nowday wit who endeavour to distinguisn themselves among the know by new invention we have several of they some time since of whom ishall name but two rembrant and john lieven whose manner be not intirely to be reject especially that of the former as well for its naturalness as uncommon force yet we see very few follow he and these like he sell short at last notwithstanding some be and still be who asfert that rembrant be able to do every thing which art and pencil could effect and that he surpass all artist even to this day be there ever say they painter who come so near nature in force of colour by he beautiful light agreeable harmony strange and uncommon thought have such extraordinary talent in what could he be deficient and be not that enough to charm all the world though he have not practise manner which be in use long before but desire these man may know that my opinion herein be quite different from theirs though must own have formerly singular inelination for rem¬ brant s manner for as soon as begin to be sensible of the infallible rule of art find myself under necessity of renouncing my mistake and quit he as be¬ ing found only on loose whim and uncertain grounds without president and now methink can not any where better than here shew the effect of magnifying and diminish glass and the various opinion touch they many imagine that painting in little and the life see through diminishglase be one and the same and that the small life see through magifyglaf and large picture appear alike but these man be much mistaken and as wide from truth as the east be from the west the glaf ground hollow or concave shew nearobject in they force beauty and warmth with diminution and the glaf ground rife or convex contrarily exhibit faint and distant object in full proportion dull and break now let any reasonable man view the two piece the small one warm and strong and the large faint and weak and determine which of the m be most like the the life or nature my opinion be against both they be like man drest in woman s cloath and the contrary for one be too strong and the other too weak but admit these man to be in the right and we be to side with they we should by this they position and application of it discover they wrong notion since they make the large strong and the small even as strong as the large by which and the aforsaid effect of the two glass the mistake sufficiently appear and artist be advertise of it ch ap x xiii a enquiry into the difference between large landscape ornament with small figure and small one with large with respect to the air the day be suppose clear in both to be short and intelligible we premise that in landscape the air be of govern that all the piece contain whether offscape water field tree must from it receive they decorum and naturalness and at all time of the day whether morning noon or evening nay at night also for as the air alter all the object light by it do the same if the day be bright and the air clear all thing appear so if it be evening they be dusky and at night dark the master who have regard to this essential point must need succeed and be think artful and why because he have in that part simply follow nature as a infallible guide yet he ought to be certain in lighting the object accord to they several nature and to observe with I whether there be difference between large opening without embellishment and the contrary with respect to the air by the air be mean the superior part which in clear day be commonly call the blue of the sky we say that the two unlike object in landscape to wit one ornament and the other plain ought in order to look natural to be alike clear and neither lighter nor darker ifthey both exhibit the same hour of the day and if one be of darker blue than the other it be mistake and unjustifiable for one of they must need be contrary to truth now it may be here object accord to the old way of think that master of he art may for decency s sake freely correct and alter nature when sne be obstruct butl answer in few word that in that case nature ought to command and art obey what can be the purpose to paint in landscape the blue of the sky two or three foot above the horizon as dark as if it be evening when all the object in the piece be light with the utmost brightness and force either sideways or front although the sun be set even the shade lighter than the upper air consider how such representation must look in the eye of the know ¬ ing and whether it be otherwise than dayoccurrence or stageplay represent in the evening what advantage would accrue if évery body have true knowledge and judgment in the art if we do not shew they art what love can it gain he who know art be very sensible of what it aim at wherefore lover of truth ought undertake thing out of they way not that they should not be able to perform they but on a apprehension of fall from good into bad manner fince experience shew that each supposeshis own manner the best think have find out method for those accustom to large and strong thing to fit they for the small and weak the cloth you design to paint on ought to be primed with light grey ground for the large work and with dark and warm ground for the small so that have no other pattern whether figure or landscape than warm and strong one you may temper you colour accordingly and get rid of you old custom herein pallet of the same colour be also necessary that the colour temper on it may produce in painting the same force or weakness and to shew that this method be of greater moment than some may presently imagine shall relate what once happen to myself certain gentleman have he hallceiling line with five cloths primed with pearlcolour and be afterwards desirous of have something paint on they propose my do it whereupon make design to he like and have four cloths send home to I the middle one large and square and three smaller round one but in lieu of the fifth which be get rotten by dampnef new one be send to I not primed with light ground like the rest but of brown colour after have deadcoloured the work and view it together iperceive that the shade in the last cloth be much browner and warmer than in the ether and though in finish endeavour as much as posfible to help it and bring it like the rest yet something remain in the shade of another nature which some person judge to be better than those of the other cloths those especially who be implicitly addict to the warm manner without consider in general whether it be proper or not thus find that the ground of cloth may often mislead we and put we beside the mark either in nearness or distance but know the reason of it if it happen again the fault be we own and thus we may insensibly and without compulsion paf from large thing into the small and from the small into the large we shall further observe on what occasion the aforesaid means may be make use of to advantage in painting light landscape in painting hall room in nightpiece apparition and candlelight and as well in little as in full proportion for these three particular design we may prepare the grounds of the cloths thus that for the landscape ought to be primed with pearl colour that for a apartment with umber that for apparition or candlelight with ologa s earth or umber and black the first more or less bluish accord to the quantity of fky the second somewhat brighter and more warm accord as you intend to exhibit either common light or sunshine and the third accord as it have little or much light depth or approach smallness or largness yet the larger the more black we think those colour befide the tint very useful and nenecessary not without reason because they have affinity to the nature of the subject subject the first to the blue of the szy the second to the reflexion and the third to the shade have often madeit question whether it be worth while to mention these particular because betensible some may think they trifling as willingly own they seem to be but on better confideration of the matter and how many thing be neglect which either offer of themselves or seem trivial though of absolute use my suspicion abate with this consolation that how minute soever my thought may be shall be satisfied if they any way tend to the advantage and improvement of art and instruction in it wherefore reassuming the subject say that the cloth may be prepare thus the colour be ground up stiff with fat oil ought to be mix very thin with turnpentine and the cloth paint over with soft tool in this manner the sky blue and the ground gray or green more or less dark as you ordonnance and design require now if it be afk how we must proceed in case of rise object as tree house or other thing come against the offscape and above the horizon and which fill up great part of it answer that my meaning be not to provide such paint cloths without previously know what we be to paint upon they for we must first sketch we thought on paper and then conclude how much or little sky or ground must be paint blue or green yellow or black in those grounds we have no occasion for fine and costly colour common one will serve if they have good body and cover well for the blue take indigo and white for the ground umber and white or lampblack and light oaker for architecture and other stonework umber brown oaker . the ground thus lay and be dry have three desirable quality it be fit for work be even and dull wherefore the colour how thin soever take at sirst which smooth or glossy ground will not admit without much trouble it be durable by its relation to the tint and colour paint on it which hold they perfect beauty and force which they éan not be when the ground be of another colour or tint such as white upon black light blue on dark yellow or red in time appear more and more through though ever so fatly paint it be expeditious for he who have ready hand and quick pencil and desire to paint up he defign at once which otherwise can not be do without deadcolour this method have still further advantage then some may perhaps imagine it be particularly useful in ceilingpiece not only in areal representation but also bassrelief of one colour whether white grey violet or yellowish judge now whether the trouble of prepare such cloth be not small when compare with the great advantage arise from it as proof of it have observe of the great bartholet that when he be to paint portrait with purple or black drapery he lay in the drapery flat with fingle dark purple or black without any fold and on finish only heigktened and shade it and thus work up the piece at once chap x xiv of the light withindoor this light ought to be rank among the daylight as take its rise and government from thence this commonly call chamberlight we divide into three fort the first enter through door window and other opening and proceed from the air there by cause the second which be occasion by reflexion as from wall ground or other object the third subsist in itself as proceed from candle or torch the light have different nature those of the open air be clean onthelight part of object and do not alter they more than in the open air cause the light to be broad and the shade dark the second falls more or lef pure on object accord to the colour and nature of the grounds and wall they shade be dim and disappearing and only the deepest shade visible and strong the room in general both above and below be there by light as well by the force and effect of the wall within as by the ground without of the groundshade we shall say nothing here as have in another place treat of they and they force and diminution the candle light we have also in particular chapter sufficiently shew how so manage as likewise sunshine which last we think as we have often say very improper to be represent in roommany have think very improperly of those light take in perverse manner the liberty which horrace allow to poetsand painter and pretend to help the defect of nature doit in a extravagant manner make no scruple to break down whole wall of room to let beautiful light on they object as strongly as in the open air they even go such length that though they have door and window they give every thing they proper groundshade except windowframe crofspiece and pier as if wall be not solid body as well as man table chair or other furniture imagine they may do so that nothing mave obstruct the figure but in my opinion it be better to take away the cause of such a evil than to spoil the property of thing by represent it in painting a apartment we ought well to consider the architecture to aid it and give it proper division and shew door for passage as for the window whether many or few it must appear by the object and by the groundshade of the crofspiece and pier and that plain in sunshine but dubious without it and in order to make this last point clear which in this chapter we chiefly aim at shall in the two example in plate xlviii plainly express my sentiment the first exhibit two different light fall in through two different window the one proceeding from the clear air and the other by reason of near building before before the window somewhat break little or no air be see above that building between the window be large pier or blank wall mark those window with the letter anb and the blank wall with and then observe how the shade which the pier cgife on the ground be cut on both side by the light fall in through the window and and how acute it terminate and how the light be weaken by that of moreover what fhort touch of light give when that of go far into the room as also that the figure receive the light from be dusky and have fhort groundshade and the other figure contrarily receive its light from be lignter and its light broader and give longer groundfhade observe further that the nearer the figure be to the light or window the purer and more plain be they groundshade when contrarily the column place against the pier give double ground shade the greater overcoming the less the second example shew the same thing accord to the condition of the light which be alter and come in from behind the third and fourth example in plate x lix shew the same thing in landscape for the same observation prevail in both with respect to light and shade as to the colour in the open air and they alteration have say enough of they in proper chapter think it great heedlessness in many painter who in give they withindoor object sidelight do not mind whether they stand on the near or offside of the window let in the light nor consider that the light come in through narrow opening spread and by reason of interpof vapour in proportion to the force of the light there must need fall proportional weak or strong shade on the ground great general epaminonda whereon no observation of light be neglect all thing have they natural effect which make the piece look so charming tyro must not think it irksome to mind so many observation in matter of consequence which when once well apprehend in they principle nothing but carelefsness will afterwards make they slightendeavour then to fix the principle and knowledge in you memory by the help of judgment and all thing will certainly have natural and easy issue chap x xv of the applicagion of light to the different species of history with table a ordonnance of all the light that we may not be think to keep any thing back from the artist which may be of service to he judge it necessary to subjoin this chapter to . the light though we have so largely treat of they nature quality force and effect draw draw and outline how fine soever be not agreeable before they be shade and when this be do as nature and art require it exalt the former and give a additional lustre to nature for sober light suit not with bustling figure with respect to withindoor representation because it abate the elegance and art of the other as in the murder of casar in the senatehouse or the death of cato but let I not be hereby suppose to overthrow my former asfertion that sunshine be not proper within door since on such occasion as those there must be find such medium in the light as there be in the colour between the more and lef beautiful and as we have shew to be between sunshine and common light again this light would be very improper in salutation of elizabeth and mary or the story of stratonica or that of the queen of sheba these require more tender soft and sweet light and therefore common one if this be not observe good outline may be spoiled as when fhade should happen to fall on therise part or groundshade pass over they be we to make a history wherein both paffion the sedate and stir should meet require consequently a opposition in the light we ought to place the act figure forward on the first ground as have the predominancy and to adapt the light to they as much as possible accordingly story now occur to I wherein the three principal paffion must meet in one composition mean that of ahasuerus esther and haman esther shew supplicate and meek posture and countenance the king discover wrath and paffion and haman astonishment and fright now in order to cast well the light on those figure accord to my apprehension would dopose esther in the greatest light somewhat in profile the king in the strongest mean where it fall most and have its chief effect and encrease it by the force of colour but haman would place fitting on the other side of the table in dim light the rather to sereen he from the king s wrath and as it be feast or banquet prepare by esther where every thing be royal and magnificient think the common light here the most proper because the sequel of the story and the king s rage be but accidental we shall conclude this book with the follow ordonnance or table of the light here the beautiful and darting aurora be dissipating the foggy vapour of the gastly night by she agreeable daybreak that the moft perfect production of rich and liberal nature may appear in they true quality form colour and full lustre fhie descend from on high holding

you see here the bright morning by its pure ray surpass all former light but the sun by he fiery force gain the laurel gild all that he beam can touch whereby we perceive the weakness of the silver moon not able to distinguish object and make they apparent we exhibit here at moderate distance on the right side of the piece four round pedestals of equal magnitude with they plinth and moulding run toward the point of sight on the first as be the morning be see bright star give short groundshade end in point on the second appear the sun in full lustre give long and broad groundshade sharp and plain like the object the third have the moon s presence which producelike groundshade and the fourth whereon iz light torch cause by this light long and en large groundshade the art of painting book

reprefent tree river and grounds the place open a agreeable country enrich with wood river and hill chap of landscape in general tis constant maxim that varietythe soulrefindelight and the chief viand of she window s sight varietyis the soul of mirth sting of pleasure and the sauce of life it be so gratifying that without it we think ourselves slave and by constant return we wish to live for ever without it we covet death because the soul as pent up in dungeon call for enlargement but he be much out of the way who hourly want variety since any excess be both ridiculous and hurtful as well well to thé agent as the patient he who propose à livelihood from art be not to please himfelf only because he happinef or unhappinefs depend not on himself but other accord as he work plexse or displeaie and as every creauture have particular like and when in company they be not to be satisfied with one fort of food but with variety so judicious artist should strenuously endeavour to qualify himfelf for every person s taste like a expert apothecary who store he ffiop with all proper medicine for the general good and there by get money let this suffice to hint that landscapepainter must not be wedded to one choice either too sticr and extravagant or too repose and melancholy because it would please but one set of man and he advantage would therefore arise but from few whereas variety will allure both fort and he fame be the greater ithoughtit proper to premifethis as a advice to many let we now ere we come to the effence of this branch of painting consider that landscape be the most delightful object in the art and have very powerful quality with respect to sight when by sweet harmony of colour and elegant management it divert and please the eye what can be more satisfactory than to travel the world without go out of door and in moment to jurney out of asia into africa and from thence back to america even into the elysian field to view all the winder without danger or inconveniency from fun or frost what be more beceptable than shady grove open park clear water rock fountain high mountain and deep misty vally all these we can see at once and how relieve must the fight be to the most melancholy temper these circumstance be of glorious entertaining and useful let we consider what conftitute fine landscape it confist principally in a orderly dispofition of light against darkness whence arise the good harmony which insensibly deceive the fight in such sort that though it be flat cloth yet it exhibit natural prospective opening even nature itself landscape require two quality to make it delightful disposition colour the disposition be a artful bring together of irregular object which nevertheless feem not to be against nature or impossible the colour be conjunction of proper colour in the aforesaid object becording to they situation and quality agree with the nature of the air in such manner as to repose and pleafe the eye and yet all these quality can not alone produce perfect landscape unless good choice precede which confist in join together variety of object viz wood with visto wherein the eye may lose itself rock river and waterfalls green field delightful to the eye herein lie the stref of landscape and painting be very like nature with respect to thing inanimate not to mention many other as the embelliffment which give it the utmost perfection however this variety confist not only in the difference or irregularity of the object az tree hill fountaine and the like but in the diversity of each of they for instance bend and strait tree large and small hill wring and plain fountain cottage and palacb green and russet land the same diversitybe to be observe in colour accord to thé season of the year that lover may not be cloy by produce with the cockoo always the same thing as stir and motion crock and misshapen body of tree wave branch barren grounds blue mountain or beast bird hunting and the like or contrarily always repose and quietnef strait stem clip tree level grounds intirely green standing water and the same light colour and nature we have formerly say that table or picture hang up and view at determinate distance appear as the life withoutdoor of which the frame shew only the thickness of the sill wherein it be put or wall against which it hang the question be now whether such paint opening can be natural and deceive without six point of sight and a horizon equal with the eye of the spectator and whether it be the same to place they higher or lower and further whethe the thickness of the frame be sufficient to snew the thickness of the wall withoutcontinue it upon the cloth say positivelynoand that such a opening can not be natural much less deceive if one of those requisite be want which prove thus take chair and sit at the window with you eye just level with the sill and then you will observe that the horizon or greatest distance parting the sky and earth will as may say approach towards it and be parellel with you fight and that therefore you can see nothing but sky then arise and you will perceive rhe horizon also rise and that you eye be always level with it discover here and there object on the ground now consider the insufficieney of you picture when its point of sight do not agree with you eye and how nature join to you imagine art be pervert you deceit make apparent and you intention spoiled it be therefore evident that the picture in whichthe point of sight be place must determine you distance and that the eye ought never to leave the horizon but be always level with it if the eye be lower than the point of sight all the object must need seem to tumble forward and the foreground to sink if you be above the point of fight the foreground rise and all the object be tumble backward how then can this seem natural and deceive wherefore there be no other way than to hang the picture in certain place and six distance whence it be to be view without alteration as for the frame it be necessary to shew the thickness of it on the cloth in order to know at once the distance from whence you ought to view it because its angular ray be direct to the point of sight be not insensible that this position may seem strange to some who will object that they never observe any such thing in houssin titian bril or francesco mola or other good master but the old saying shall plead for I example be better than precept for they endeavour to follow the mistake but not the virtue of those excellent master be sure that have those great master think of these obfervation they would not have reject they do you want demonstration that every good master approve of what say and follow it shew I but one picture draw or print of theirs exhibit a inward visto out of a hall or chamber wherein they have forget to express the thickness of the frame or wall since otherwise they must depart from the naturalness and we would say that instead of a offdistance they have represent picture or tapestry therefore fore conclude that if nature require this in picture it be still more necessary when we would have the picture take for nature itself in order to deceive even master but some even think if arive in the art to they height shall be satisfied in the méantime art despairs of attain great lustre by further improvement but to reassume we former position my opinion be that what have be say ought to be regard when we meet with any thing in hall chamber gallery and the like whether in nich above or in chimney or on other occasion and the main point be to place well the horizon accord as the piece stand high or low my usual practice be to make the thickness of wall plainly appear in my painting and would always have do it but on painting on time for lover of quality be oblige to alter it for he pleafure on furmise do it to save work not for the good of it affirm that the painting be there by dock and too much incumber but the child must have name he imagine that the alteration make the work look larger here let it not be think that my piece be wholly take up with the ordonnance and the thicknef afterwards paint upon it because that would be great folly first squar out the thicknef and then adapt my design thereto as be more convenient than afterwards to paint the thickness over it and there by dock too much of the work now to give the studious artist right notion as think how to compose good landscape after a easy manner let he he consider the nature of he subject what country he be to represent what season of the year what month and what hour of the day whether the subject require sun or moonshine clear or misty rain or windy weather have fix these point let he proceed to seek proper material bring they together agreeable to he general design and dispose the object in they proper place each accord to its nature and quality next let he place the point of sight in the middle of the piece higher or lower as he would have less or more sky or ground consider whether the ground be to be level or not and thus to order the figure equal with the eye to discover directly whether the painting be see through a high window in low ground or from low ground to a high for it be commonly know that if thing be see from a height the figure ought to be under the horizon and when view from low place they must rise above the horizon have do this let he chuse proper light fall in either from before behind or afide to light the object accordingly and then to dispose the principal object if possible and the subject permit in the best place in the middle of the piece at least from off the edge of it of diver paffion if the matter require it mean if the landscape be mix with history one ought to predominate and surpaf the rest in greatnef beauty and elegance fill always the greatest part of the piece with it whether by means of tree or building the bywork must be suitable to it the better explain the matter if the subject be wood it ought to be adorn with woodgod guide or term tomb seat for repose woodnymph and many other thinga proper to it if à river it may be handle in the same manner with the addition of rivergod naiad or swim waternymph fishermen swan and other such ornament if field be the chief object it may be fet off with shepherd and shepherdses cowherd bacchanal and other rock and cave require the same management with this caution that the eye be take with the principal object only without ather regard to the bywork than as aid and incident for in fuch conduct lie the beauty and good ¬ ness of landscape as to the ornament of modern landscape such as of the famous everdingen pynakker ruysdaal moucheron and other who follow the modern manner they do not call for the aforesaid embellishment as have other sufficient matter viz cottage fishermen carrier waggon and such daily rural occurrence which be as proper to it as the antique for the decoration alone in my opinion make landscape either antique or modern unless we exhibit modern and know place wherein the antique would be very improper as breugel bril and hans bol have do without distinction between the lowest life and what be better for nature be in she object now as she be thoufand year ago wood field mountain and water be always the same and therefore nature be modern that be imperfect but she be antique and perfect when we judiciousty adorn she with uncommon and magnificent building tomb and other remains of anti quity which in conjunction with the ornament abovemention compose a antique landscape but when modern prospect on the rhine be deck with antique figure and story it must look ridiculous since cottage and civil and military architecture will evidently discover the prudent folly of the master though otherwise excellent in both manners chap ii of the light form and group of object in landfcape et we now proceed further in consider the principal quality and pro perty requisite in fine landscape these in my opinion consist in good disposition of the irregular object as welk with respect to they matter fhape and form as they colour in the number and group they in good ordering of the light by well difpose the irregular object we produce life and motion the object confist of crook straltwry high and how and by the colour we effect the fame when one thing be faint and weak another melting this strong that hard the the group consist in join those irregular object as of two body on two different grounds that on the foreground ought to be smaller than the other on the second thus if sit figure come torward stand one must be place behind it and on the third ground décumbent figure on the fourth climb one and beyond it stand figure again tree rock building cattle and other thing occure in landscape may be dopose in the same manner so far as concern the irregularity of object which in they matter and colour shall shew in the follow example see plate isuppose then in piece five grounds with the officape of which the fourth bethe largest on the foreground place vase of dark porphiry number the second ground fountain number on the third ground a hedge number on the fourth ground statue number and the fifth be low offscape number thus much may suffice as to grounds go off be¬ hind each other the same disposition ought to be observe on single or level ground as for the light its principal management lie in oppose brownness and darkness to middle and greater light but when two light be to set off each other the colour must effect this as for instance when light figure be to come off against light offscape the former must certainly be of darkisn colour as have no shade and then it will produce good effect for the chief management lie in place warmcoloured object against light faint and weak offscape contrarily light and faint colour against dark and warm grounds the foremost and strongest object against the deepest lointain and the object further off against nearer part of the offscape and thus light object against dark and the contrary the artist also ought to observe that two light must never be above each other unlefs one be visibly different from the other in force either in colour or tint lest one seem to run into the other which at distance would be preposterous union moreover part of the lointain should always be break and the eye on one side or the other keep nearer either by means of wood rock building or other object part of the horizon also should always be see or for want of it some level object such as front wall colonade or the like this will produce satisfaction to the eye and elegance in the piece no one will deny that unequal number be the most perfect accord to the demonstration both of philosopher and mathematician this inequality also observe and follow in my disposition of figure thus first place one figure on the foreground then three on the second two on the third and four on the fourth ground and then again one and so forth and thus as well on single level ground as where they happen one behind ano ¬ the these unequal number in the group be certainly not of the least moment in landscape as to the colour mention before it be to be especially note that the colour which be predominant and have the chief place in the piece must no where else be see than with little part mean of less beauty quantity and dignity chap iii of the byornament in landscape be usual for landscapepainter to have particular inclination for one choice one affect wild and desolate prospect another repose and soft one and third northern or frigid view sun and moonshine waterfalls downs watry and woody prospect and the reason be because most people by strange impulse seem rather to covet the gift of nature than the heavenly which afford what be whole and most perfect in word they seek only part though all be to be get this proceed from youth and ignorance want fundamental knowledge and therefore not judge what be most beautiful and profitable nay what they themselves be fit for but it be most unaccountable that many landscape painter be not able to embellisn they own work to which some may object that as they have not make it they practice so they be content with handling single prospect well leave any thing else to the owner s disposal sad story that they can not do they work without help whence it be evident of what moment it be for à landscapepainter to embellisn he own work whether the design be he own or borrow since certainly if he be master of he art he must also know what be most suitable in he picture not trifle or figure to no purpose but history fiction or parable take from scripture ovid or asop ornament which will enrich the work but this be seldom do because few have time to spare or love read as for I would rather want print and drawing than book as a historypainter make use of book and description of landscape and beast but be la landscapepainter should provide book of history for what should be the better for exercise one particular part of which be master and neglect other as necessary to be know need not learn what already know but it be impossible to get skill in thing without inquire into they have time for peruse novel why not also for necessary thing be icurious to know the state of the war or desirous of peace for the sake of art of what advantage be the peace if do not qualify myself to meet it as there be few or no painter who have no particular manner so few be qualify for embellishment since every one strife to excel in something and to get name by certain wonderfulness therein either by beautiful colour extravagant drapery broad and funny light or round and dusky one which often spoil work instead of better it these they can not forbear they chief talent lie in they though they frequently have contrary effect when they be to adorn other man s work we must also observe that there be two fort of byornament the necessary and the unnecesfary the necessary be such as appertain to the matter to wit immoveable and fix ornament the unnecessary be the moveable ane viz man beast bird and the like which with rerespect to landscape can not be consider as necessary but only as tend to give the piece life that they may not pall but delight the eye to be more plain in this point we shall consider what painter ought to observe and fhun in the byornament say then that it be very indecent to place woman alone rest near priapus much more in the company of man unless you would exhibit strumpet it be also improper that woman well dress should sit alone by wayfide or in wood or stand prattling with ordinary people it be much more proper to make man sitting and woman pass by than the woman sit and the man pass by or hold discourse unleis he be inquire the way it be also much better that sitting man shew the way than one who be pass along if there be company of man and woman let not the man be idle and the woman loaden and if woman be rest by herself do not assign she greater burthen than she can conveniently carry alone whether bundle trunk or vessel woman of fafhion should never travel alone through wood or valley especially if youthful without the company of at least damsel or child shepherd and shepherdess husbandmen and woman suit well together where there be no sheep shepherd or piper or lass with chaplet of flower be improper because such people be not send into the field to prattle but work it be better to inquire after the shepherd than the sheep countrypeople s children be seldom within door in the summer time but generally abroad in the field with theirparent look for bird nest gather wood or slower dig hole make garland and in other childisn action in mad sacrifice or country feast and merriment no people of fafhiion should appear without good reason for so do or that they be spectator and stand somewhat off aged people especially man should not be see because they take no delight in such recreation it be against nature and reason to assign dolesome place for mirth and fcasting or contrarily one embellish with figure and fountain unless the subject require it by such distinction as these we may know good master he be a happy painter who know how to adjust he byornament to he landscape and this to they there by make both remarkable but he deserve greater commendation if he govern all thing by the landscape the figure or bywork be certainly of no less moment than the landscape itsel yet he may be satisfied if he continually endeavour to make the one as good as the other such a artist be much preferable to other for the frequent use of print or other man s work be not the right method to become master vou rely too much on they not that disapprove of they because they convey fine idca and stir up the mind must even acknowledge that should have be insussicient without they aid but you must get truly sensible what length you may go in the theft not to fall into the common error out of which it be difficult to extricate yourself in treat of the immoveable byornament we must observe that noth ing be more displeasing in landscape than always to see house behind against tlie offscape and on the side nothing but tree and hill or scarce so much as one stone upon another this repetition must needbe disagreeable wherefore it be no wonder that those who be ignorant of architecture avoid it as much as possible but it be furprising to I that many landscapepainter will not be bequaint with that art even rather never desire to exhibit it how beautiful soever than to be at the trouble of learn it or of follow the model of other which be so plentiful and make for such purpose point so easily attainable and give piece so great decorum have be long study the cause of it and can find no other than want of inclination and knowledge of its virtue and value it be out of the way to think that landscape consist only of tree hill and green field without house or if there be building ruin or triumphal arch that then it be no more landscape since no one will take history in landscape for landscape or piece with architecture and some tree for landscape or history but prospect with building landscape set off with a hundred small figure will never paf for figurepiece but without figure or house it be like wilderness or forlorn country infect with the plague and where consequently no house be stand it would indeed be very proper greenland view ch ap of immoveable ornement tomb house he tomb exhibit in landscape require particular notice as give not only good decorum but also probability to the place of they situation that they may not be contradictory to truth and time the most sure method be when you introduce such piece of stonework first to chuse proper place for its standing where it may be most conspicuous to passenger in order to draw they attention wherefore they be make more or less sumptuous and elegant accord to the condition and dignity of the decease or those who cause they to be set up they be commonly place in the field near high road or at the entrance of shady grove or else within it yet in such manner as to be easily approach and see by those who paf by if they be costly and finely adorn with figure and other carve work they be usally fortify against the injury of time some be crowned with arch or else with small pediment and moulding support by column and top with copper vase place between two child turn on pivot and hold iron clapper with which when move by the wind they strike on the copper and create great noise they motion be occasion by a hollowness in they back and this be do they say to drive away devil and evil spirit who as they imagine continually haunt the grave of the dead some of these tomb be encompass with low close wall to fence they against the northwind they be most time place on raise ground or hillock especially in desolate country and we need not question the goodness of they foundation though we often see they in ruin or sunk down fince nothing though ever so strong can resist eat reat time it be not improbable that about such placebe bench for rest and the more to draw the people they sometimes make fountain near they the ash of the decease be commonly reposit in certain urn or box place on the top of the tomb or else in niche near elegantly carve and inscribe with hieroglyphic letter or character those grave or tomb be so adorn with emblem and figure as always to make we sensible whether they be sacred to a heroe philosopher statesman sylvan deity or who else if we may credit the remains and ancient writer it would be too tedious to enumerate all the particular touch these tomb and as those thing serve only for byornament to painter think what have say be sufficient with the addition of what concern they material these be various viz porphiry jasper all sort of marble red black and white also copper and other metal and sometimes ordinary stone we see often a altar near they whereon they use to offer to the memory of the decease of cottage and other byornament cottage and countryhouse be usually low have they greatist conveniency and extent below and as the inhabitant possess but few goods no more then what will supply they necessity they room be but few these dwelling be order disposition or division they sometimes wattle they with weav of reed and rushie clay over the roof be thatch and not much window commonly dark within and sinear without with light colour red white or grey that they may be see at great distance these house have often well or watertrough near they or else fountain or cistern hollow out of tree or make of stone the fountain be mean and artless but near the town they be sumptuous and magnificently adorn with statue and other ornament we also find vase or elegant pot with bassrelief stand on high pedestals above reach to preserve they from damage sometimes they be little decay and break or ruin by time and weather as also by the barbarity of soldier as may be perceive in the fragment of column lie up and down in the road or near they likewise piece of frize with bassrelief and beautiful cornice the remains whereof and they basement be still stand we see also about the place piece of break coloss some half within ground other lie tumblead into morass and in the wood appear stonelion and lioness rest on pedestals and spout water out of they mouth on handrail they use atiently to place sphinx if they meaning do not allude to the secret of science for then they commonly support column pyramid and tomb they use frequently as it be still sometimes the custom to rase heap of stone bearing inscription and character they likewise set up post for guide or figure for the same use especially in wind and crof way where we may often see term term at the end of road or lane to advertise traveller of danger in case morass water or other stoppage should crof the way whence the word term take its origin signify bound or limit those term be like reverse pyramid square with gape head on top generally of copper or other metal have fine decorum and give piece uncommon grandeur if well place and suitably adjust in landscape to conclude this chapter advise the artist not to use these ornament too profusely nor repeat they without some diversity beeause otherwise he will prove cloy to he little honour or advantage chap of beautiful colour in landscape any thing charm the sight think it be the beautiful green of tree how do we long for the lovely spring be any thing more refresh to the eye than the first green of that season spirit and diversion seem then to revive in all creature if real prospect have such effect that of a artful and agreeable landscape have not much less wherein the bright green and other delightful colour shine but though it be not probable that landscape paint intirely green should please more than one in foul and greygreen colour yet we ought not to use verdegrease to fetch out fine green fince though it be the most beautiful yet be not the most pleasing to the eye and moreover very fad and change it be nevertheless to be lament that man who pretend to great skill in painting landscape intirely banish beautiful green out of they work and introduce in its place black yellow and other such colour it be true that plant and herb differ as well in they nature and quality as shape and colour that some be of beautiful green other blue some yellow or russet other grey some of fenny other of watry colour neverthelefs art teach we not to imitate the fad and mean but what be most charming and agreeable in the diversity aforesaid we see the object and the mean and the beautiful and most beautiful if now it be say that the artist ought to exhibit every thing that be beautiful as well as the contrary and that he only ape nature allow it but then he must be a imitator of wellform nature and elegantly paint she most perfect part but by my position that beautiful green be best and most charming in landscape let I not favour the perverse opinion of some that colour can not be too beautiful either in history or landscape though they exceed nature itself of thisi have largely speak in the chapter of the harmony and place of colour for at that rate how can one colour set off another what become of the harmony or conjunction of colour when as in music high tone do not agree with the low how can gold be fet off by gold or pearl by pearl à be be all thing compose of those two precious body richnef would not be apparent the proverb say tenue ornant diademata cunae that be the gold of crown may boast its native worth but meaner object bring its lustre forth many painter have err in this partitular of which shall give one instance certain artist have once paint landscape wherein the first and second grounds and every thing belong to they appear beautiful and natural but on the third ground all be very grey and foui on this last ground he have place man in beautiful ultramarine garment as bright as if he have be on the foreground he be tell that those two thing be unatural and opposit mean foul and muddy green and so beautiful blue garment which be moreover as the man be walk in the sun paint as bright and beautiful in the shade as in the light though the light should have be more break but the main error lay in break the green of the offscape too much and not at all bringing down the beautiful blue vestment though at the same distance this example may suffice to shew that the part ought not to be break or foul so suddenly though we see it do by many in order to make the foremost part look beautiful and strong nature shew no such sudden alteration nor clear weathersuch mistiness in sunshine chap vi of the leaf of tree many painter find the laaf of tree a hard tafk most of they in this point ape the manner of thisor that master without consulting or study the life by which mean they leaf commonly become set and stiff and always of one manner insomuch that we can not distinguisn in they picture the elm from the willow or the oak from the linden nature instruct we to know they fromfar by they different colour as well as by they growth and shape wherefore to proceed regularly and gain emimence in this study you ought exactly to observe the life and the several fort of green and leaf seeat distance whether they be close and massy or thin leave and branch and whether they hang in cluster or uniformly on they bough mind nicely the difference of they colour in they several kind as well while grow as in perfection and decay also the size of they body short or long and whether they grow straight or crook in dry or watry place another difficult point but which cause the greatest decorum be the roundness or relief of the tree good method for effect this be to observe how large the spread of the tree be suppose it thirty or forty foot the upper roundness or nearside must have the strongest light and shade diminish gradually every five or six foot and the extremity to melt into the sky or other bywork though though the light should happen to fall into the piece fromfide for the more the light approach you the stronger it touch and if on that occafion you light and heighten the utmost edge it can add nothing to the relief because the light round off too suddenly and have once paint it too strong you can not help it by glaze without muddle since it will always appear distinct from the other part as well in colour as neatness there be also as great difference between the body of tree as they leave some be more beautiful and painterlike than other these again more strait and sound those differ in colour from other but chief regard be not to place afhi or linden leave on oake body nor those of the willow upon elm for each stem must produce it s own leave though this conduct be not heed by many you ought also not to put young and beautiful leave upon a old stem for the former be like set man s head on monkeycarcass and the latter like patch child s face upon an old and decay man s body we likewise often see in common light landscape the leaf lie very sharp and edgy against the sky whereas nature teach that even the leave of the foremost tree unite with the sky on they extremity and appear dull against it and in the offscape still more dubious ch np vii of the place and fellow of landscape find nothing more disadvantageous and irklome to painter than to wed himself to one manner of reprefentation nature herself and the follow precept will shew the error of it first with respect to the several place where the picture be to be hang for hope noone will argue that piece suit any place and without variety in the manner of master can not judge whether he be true one or how rich he thought be secondly because the artist ought in he ordonnance to comply with the fancy of the proprietor as far as reason and the rule of art and decorum permit as to the first common nature shew he he error do we not behold sunshine and sine weather with greater pleasure and attention after storm and can it have less effect on we sense in picture there be even no country so despicable but in less than nine mile distance it will exhibit new prospect how can it displease painter sometimes to represent stormy weather aud then calm and delightful sunshine since the great unlikeness cause variety and this charm the eye now we see shady grove then wilderness next repose landscape great waterfall huge oak rock and the like object well handle look also very pleasing in room thus we might as may say shew the world in epitome and behold it at one view if painter always follow one manner how often will he expose he weakness and incapacity if it be sunshine what place will he find to suit all he picture can he place they always in the sun in order to shew they naturalnef but grant the work to be place in such light another unhappiness will still attend it for the sunlight will fall into the picture from side and the real sunshine will come upon it front from which premise it be apparent that the common light be not only necesary but always the most advantageous for chamberpiece good painter ought to be prudent in the disposition and choice of he work carefully observe the nature of the place that he art may not disjoin but aid the architecture make he landscape in order to look like nature the furthe they be from the light of the room so much lighter than those which be near it for otherwise they will look but like picture the second confideration which be great addition to ornament respects the fellow or match the picture well and though matchpiece be very well know yet many people entertain wrong notion about they they opinion touch what be necessary in fellowpicture be various but they generally agree that it consist of a uniformity of conception and disposition of object colour and light to which some add that if one landscape be flat country the other ought to be the same if one be rocky the other ought to be so too in short they must be so much alike that on come together the one seem to be a impression of the other in both equal sky equal byornament equal fill nay so very equal that there must not be white speck in the one but the other must have it also my belief be that these nicety be ow to the wilfulness of artist and that in matchingpicture nothing more be requisite than a equal point ofsight and uniformity in the figure when it must hang at like height with the other he who would join the rest of the particular seek the fifth wheel on waggon for why after satisfy my curiosity in vicw solitary wilderness shiould not enjoy the pleasure of pleasant plain or woody landscape in opposition to a agreeable waterview and delightful prospect think the word felloes sufficiently imply that they be two picture of equal size alike frame receive the same light whether they hang above or next each other mostly alike fill with work and the figure of equal magnitude and lessen towards the point of sight and as for the thought or design the more different they be the more agreeable and the better shew the richnef of the master s fancy in word landscape suit best with landscape and architecture with architecture and more be not in my opinion require in wellfellow picturechap viii of the light in landscape although we have largely treat of the light in the precede book yet find myself obligate to say somewhat about it with respect to landscape especially frontlight in piece which face window this point puzzle many painter and not without cause since it be critical proof of they capacity the chief reason of this be that artist will not venture to undertake any thing that be unprecedented and no one have courage enough to set the example they plead main difficulty arise from hence namely that have frontlight they can not make shade on the ground or object but must find they effect go off and force only by the darkest touch as if the driving cloud do not cause large groundshade which daily experience shew they do in the next place these man tacitly confess they ignorance of the force and harmony of colour in chuse dark object against light one and the contrary for place against a offscape of green tree light coloured object such as white rose co¬ lour light and strong yellow and the like you have no need of large shade would you make object against lightcoloured building let they be of dark colour or vase of warm and brown colour and against it lighter object again and against the offscape the foremost work be make strong by the diminution of the tint since all that go back or retire become darker and more dusky as the shade on the contrary grow fainter and weaker the furthe they be off again the grounds themselves can afford we great help one may be light yellow another green another bluishi accord to they quality as we shall further shew as to the figure they may have sufficient and natural sideshade for set they of for those which be on the side of the piece which most go away from the light will receive much more shade than the middle one as also groundshade because they go so much afide from the point of sight and the further the more we conceive also that if any house or other upright work run towards the point of sight be place quite on the side the one high and the other low as here grotto with visto there again something else with rusticate stone or ballustrades and before they water along the extremity of which some vase or figure be stand on pedestals these object say although they have no perfect shade yet with respect to the light would suffice and moreover throw groundshade against each other which would give the whole work great decorum and elegance if it be object that this management would cause too great force on the object without the piece and make it look empty in the middle and the eye of course be draw too much to the side moreover the two corner of the piece would then be too confine answer that if the ordonnance be dispose on such such ground as aforesaid and the colour well choose and order the large light in the middle will be find the strongest and the sidework more close and compact and by order some pedestals with vase here and there against the large and broad shade of the building they would produce fine effect many dare not introduce any groundshade on the foreground in such front light in order to break little that large light and make it go off alledge that the wall cover it and think that no more groundshade can be see on the ground than that of the wall but these man be much mistaken they stand and behold the place but do not consider what be build over they head what high story and what large groundshade those thing ought to cause on the foreground go off which they must imagine to be see without door above the opening of the piece for though it stand against plain wall yet it artfully represent a intire open pannel in the room the light whereof fall directly into it to be the better understand in what mean by object without the piece or outwork add the follow demonstration in plate li in the part place point of sight and draw from it two visual line and now all that be without those line be without the piece and call outwork and may be suppose to represent continue stonework united and join to the wall whereby shade and groundshade fall on the ground and all above it be sky you can as be say shew the height of the house or chimney by groundshade fall into the picture here it may be afk whether the figure in the middle which on this occasion make the principal light ought not to be altogether or always the major part of the m in the snade to which answer that the height or lowness of the house must govern in that point for if it be high the groundshade will be longer if lowroof neither so long nor broad this method so far as it relate to frontpiece be as well found as helpful and though never practise it be however not to be reject but no body will lead the way without sce the example of other and yet every day as we walk in sunshine we may make this observation in nature the sun shev we example enough moreover it be natural in view thing rather to have the sun behind than in we face and yet many represent the sunlight behind in the picture and not one do it front as have no knowledge of the nature and effect of colour nor of make lightnef and darkness against proper portrait and grounds and consequently do not understand due harmony bassrelief painter dare venture to do it and find so much advantage in it as there by best to deceive the eye to they great honour will freely if the artist think he can apprehend I better by a example give he one see plate li aforesaid place then on the right side of the piece row of house run toward the point of sight the first be square with step into the doorway the door be half hide behind the frame of the piece and ornament with two pedestals with sphinx two or three foot over the door be small moulding near this building stand another rise somewhat which support the roof higher the fidewalling whereof be plain and in front be door and window on each side of the entrance stand pillar support the entablature and thereon be compassspandrel next this be see rail run up to another house which be higher tnan the first and lower than the second ten or twelve foot further off stand a high wall runningcrof the piece and in this wall on the left side of the point of sight be large open gateway through which we see the offscape above this gate on the right side appear the top of some large and high tree which sill the sky in the middle of the piece we exhibit a octangular stone and against the frontcant watertrough this stone be about eight or ten foot high and have on top ball on the left side without the piece stand some tree run towards the point of sight now observe the light which as have be intimate falls into the piece front and what groundshade the object give each other and they course with respect to the sun s height he now who understand perspective may easily guef what shade such object will give on the ground how large and long they will be on what they will fall across and run towards the point of sight likewise how much this frontlight will exceed side one in brightness as well as colour all thing parallel with the horizon be intirely light by the sun and contrarily those which be parallel with the visual line be dark and without he reach and so exactly limit that the least projecture even of a inch or strawbreadth will receive light as the example shew as for the setoff or harmony no one will doubt whether it be less to be find in front sunshine than side one for what be want in shade the colour and tint will doubly supply this fort of light how odd soever it may seem to those who never try it neverthelefs afford many beautiful and advantageous accident very pleasing to the eye but must observe that the wider and larger the piece be the more charming it become than in narrow and high one because the more the object approach the point of sight the less shade they give and the further they go off sideways from it the broader be the shade do not propose to say any thing further about the light and they quality but in the course of write something of moment touch they still occur to my thought which think worthy of observation as be so uncommon that doubt whether any instance have be before give of it it be touch the air or common light fall from on high throa opening into round and close temple or any place of retirement rocky repository for the dead suppose the opening as the design will permit now we have formerly shew that common light contrary to that of the sun illuminate the object with widening ray wherefore all thing go away from the center of the round temple have longer and narrower groundshade as the nearer the say center the fhorter even so much as in stand just under or upon that center they give not any groundshade at all cxcept under foot on the contrary it will be find that such object receive stronger light from on high than those which go off sideways and the further they go go off still the lessyet we perceive the contrary in the reffexion from the grounds the more the object approach the center the lighter they be in reflexion be the ground even white or blue red or yellow light or dark as for the course of the groundshade of the obejct let they stand where they will on the aforesaid plan or ground they flow from the center or middle point directly under the light chap ix of landscape in small compass ceffary as general rule for all choice which we shall exemplify in landscape on almost the same basis as that of history to wit that there be difference between landscape in small compass and the contrary and that the former be more artful and troublesome than the latter though have less circumstance to which we shall subjoin the requisite necessary to both in order to make each in its kind equally good together with remarkable touch the byornament as to landscape in general they be as we have shew in the same case as history to wit that large ordonnance in small compass carry more art knowledge and esteem than the contrary because the object require more work and more plain and distinct expression of they quality which in small object in large compass be not so nicely requisite for the nearer we approach the object the more senfibly they become as in history variety of thought and object occur for compose ordonnance either small or large with even a roo figure in palace hall gallery town village in the field and wood plain rock wilderness common road building fountain and staty solitary place with tomb and grotto seaport cascade or waterfalls in order naturally to exhibit therein all sort of occurrence the heroic and pastoral as well as the satyric mournful joyful and merry and though we could order all the aforesaid particular into one piece yet they can not produce such a effect in reference to art as each singly will do it it be certain that thing see from afar as we have formerly observe never satisfy curiofity so well as those which be near whereby they become to we more distinct as well in they existence and form as colour we know that the more the object diminisn and go off from we the more they abate of they littlenef not only in they superficy but also in they outline and sway treebody full of hole and knot appear smooth and even at distance even the crock will seem almost straight and the whole leaf as one maf it be true thatlarge and concise landscape do not give general satisfaction yet we know that a asfembly of few but people of judgment will never break up without do business when contrarily meeting of the vulgar seldom do any thing without confusion it be thefame in music with many voice they they make great noise but never affect the sense like the single voice of afine woman accompany with the basso continuo which intirely charm we make we figh even sometimes shed tear and this be only cause by the force which lie in solo support by the baf by the distinctness of the word sweetly uttered and lastly by they sense or paffion all which be not to be find in great concert because we can not understand the word much less the sense but fix we attention on the general harmony only it be true great performance of mufic will please common sense but a artful solo be for people of judgment the former do in some measure affect the body but the latter touch the soul andleave last impreffion the principal difference between small and great landscape lie in the point of sight in the great in small compass the horizon be commonly somewhat low and in the sniall in large compass high in one be high ground inthe other valley the one be natural representation and the other look like amap the one keep good decorum let it hang ever so high and every thing look upright in the other all thing seem to be tumble and it appear well no longer than while on the easel in great landscape in smallcompass all be see plain and distinct at least one part accord as the choice be in the small in large compass we can perceive nothing perfectlybut the general partly because the great light creat faintness and partly because the piece be view at great distance as hang commoniy above other painting it be even certain maxim that as picture never hang below the eye unless in a auction so landscape with a high horizon must always need be false leave the contrary to one s judgment hiow much more decorum and advantage it have when of such a extent as to be place high or low even up to the ceiling without fear of be hang below the cye when the other must find its comfort under it be set height without hope of ever gain its decorum unless by come casually on the easel again after have shew that great landscape in small compass with low horizon can bear hang above the eye and look become and that small one in large compass because of the high horizon lose its true quality to the determint of the painter we conclude that there be no better method to be use with landscape of large extent in order to make it become and natural than to set as aforesaid the horizon somewhat lower since such piece be always place abovemay say far above the eye but here perhaps difficulty may be start namely that if the horizon be set so low the sky will overpower the principal of the picture but in answer let I afk whether the sky be to be lock on asa useless patch do not the sky most adorn and invigorate landscape and make it look agreeable must we suppose the earth to excel the heavenin magnitude à ay but say they there be nothing to be see in the skybut be beautiful sky such trifle and so easily to be paint be it not more artful to represent thin driving cloud than flat ground here and there a hill or plash of water grass or herb beautiful fky be proof of good master but if it seem two large we have a help forthat make the foreground somewbat large and then tree or two thick or thinleaved will take up enough of the superfluity and break any thing that be obstruct .. likewise building may serve either front or in profile or instead of it pyramid or obelisk these not to be flung into the offscape accord to usual practice but bring on the foreground great and strong let the top of those object advance high in order to fill and thereby as have say in some measure here and there to break the sky but here it may be again object that such large tree would not look fine becaufe they leaf can not be see but be the leaf of tree of more value than the top of beautiful building pyramid or any such uncommon object must these give place and be leave out for the sake of tree would it not look wonderful and be great pity that one in a hundred should lose it be leaf let one two or more bough shoot forth there be enough without they say then that by this mean the sky will be fufficiently fill and the difficulty remove and now the skv be moderate and the greatest force lie in the landscape and byornament the foreground be elegantly embellisn the off scape broad and deep with a extant equal to my wisn and the horizonsuch as need not fear the tumble of the object when speak of place forward great tree elevate building pyramid and large figure for byornament some may possibly say that then the ground go down behind and rise forward fince they can not relisn any thing they be not use to and which require the object to be somewhat more finish and larger than in they common way but although have thus shew the preference of one manner of painting before the other yet ldo not prescribe it as law to be always follow my design be only to illustrate what be fine in the one above theother chap .. of painting room with landscape hthink this point to be of moment and weighty enough to be consider with attention the rather since some painter often happen to see different mannagement with respect to the rule for painting hall parlour and therefore can not resolve on what be most suitable and advantageous for those apartment and when they be to perform something therein so many difficulty arise and they opinion so much vary that they be at stand whether they shall represent picture or painting in the manner of tapestry or nature itself as to the first fort we must be sensible that the picture be all of size and place orderly will be take by the know for abstract painting have no relation to the room accord to the notion of those who be master of good collection be indifferent where they picture hang whether against bare wall or hanging as to the second fort it be certain that painting make in the manner of tapestry will never be take for real tapestry be they border ever so beantiful and elegant and therefore have not the effect which the master purpose the third fort viz to represent nature be certainly the best for what can be want whenthe work be natural artful and proper to the place representation of tapestry be à lame picture and à picture not agree with nature and the place be also deficient wherefore master who paint such be unpardonable because instead of adorning the room and preserve its architectonic order he at once spoil both be once afk whether any certain rule besides the light and point of to be observe throughout asfar as concerned the compartition and ornament and that whether paint or real they must correspond with the door mantlepiece and alcove and the whole work take its proportion from a order that it may look proper and make up one compact body now if wall be to be cover with single picture it must be handle in the manner of a hanging but picture be somewhat more brittle than tapestry and sooner damage by hang so low chair must not be set against it if it get hurt or dent they be not easily repair sarbase be much better and besides the wall be sometimes so long that it can not well be see at one view wherefore when the diftance be too small it be better to divide the wall and to use more than one point of sight if now there be door in the middle or on each side they ought to be leave free though they be without moulding and even with the cloth for the room must have at least one passage but not paint over accord to the practice of some with tree hill or stonework as if it be not there very common error and which no master will justify unless we have greater eye to profit than the general elegance of the work wherefore it be more adviseable to enrich the door or door with sine moulding or ornament if the door happen to come in the middle beautiful frontispiece adorn with carving will look magnificent this in order to save buildingcharge might also be represent on cloth yet some artist who be not use to it will not easily be induce to undertake it but rather so much more landscape though on due consideration and for the sake of decorum and naturalnef they have better call in the assistance of another hand for they help when now there happen to be adoor butnot in the middle it will be proper for obtain regularity to order also one on the other side unless it be even with the wall and the moulding of the surbase run acrofsit in which case you may make something or other on its upper part suit with the landscape such as stone with bass relief either distant or near say you may do so but for my part lshould not much like it wherefore my opinion be that two door be much better than none and though you might nevertheless incline to the last proposal in order thus to have larger piece yet it be inconsistent since the ceiling must have its support accord to its compartment under each summer ought to be something either pilaster or term or else the piece must have circuiar head but room be seldom so order perhaps because some man love to engross all the gain to themselves exclusive of the assistance of other and be some permit to do as they please they would paint over every thing with flower fruit or history a architecturepainter every where moulding they may even in time go such length that could the floor be paint as well as the ceiling ceiling we should see in every stone either flowerpot visto or a history a sometimes we see it in iron chest say then that a artist though the whole work be undertake by he ohly must not introduce more of he particular branch into it than reason and decorum require take the affistance of friend in such part if there be any as he have not study for variety refresh the eye think a hall or room with one fort of picture like shop wherein be sell but one fort of goods to give a instance let we suppose room with sidewall thirty foot long divide into threé pannel and the surbase round the room and the pilaster between the pannel to be either of painting or wood as find it proper and over the chimney propose piece with figure though landscapepainter undertake the whole work but not be able to manage the chimneypiece desire the assistance of figurepainter because generous painter if he expect praise and honour must not so much regard he gain as the decorum of the room cloth of five or six foot more or less in such grand undertake be but triffe let another hand get something by it if it tend but to the ornament of the work order figurepiece over the chimney because it be the principal place of the room for what business can landscape have therethe horizon whereof ought to be without nay much lower than the picture wherefore in so principal plâce nothing would be see but fky we be very senfible that if in such room we represent nature we can not introduce into one pannel morning into the second midday and into the third a evening nor use various country all must have one and the same air we grant that be the room compart into four pannel we could exhibit the four cardinal point or the four seafon provide each piece have particular point of sight as for the difficulty of the left and right light to which the sidepiece must need be subject and the light fall on the wall front from the window we have sufficiently speak of it in tne book of light and shade and now if throughout we see continue or natural landscape the air alike and the leaf of the tree run from one into the other when they be extensive enough imagine the painting must look well and nature and art be fully satisfied if iam not follow by every body be sufficiently honour by do justice to art and the curiom chap xi of ornamental painting withoutdoorfter have treat of roman painting with landscape think this the fittest place to speak of ornamental painting withoutdoor this point be very useful for two reason first because by certain painting adapt to place secondly because we discover what fort of place they be and what use put to it will it will be of service to artist frequently concerned in painting visto foliage and other thing without door in lead they to further thought ithink it most proper to ornament summerhouse which be at the end of walk and usually bench with grotto set off with figure and fountain but shallow and side summer house look best with baf relief of darkisn colour in house of pleasure for drink talk or other amsement suit grotto fountain figure urn and vase the end of gallery become architectonic view and the pier between the window nich with figure and baf relief accord to the thicknef of the wall in gateways have room on each side figure and baf relief be proper as also fine architecture set off with term and other such thing yet on the side and sofitas of window ought to be foliage only but to return to the summerhouse painting we must consider that as the kind be various so there suit to each particular representation as well in design as colour accord to the different light if the building be square and have the opening in the middle and the painting exhibit bass relief the light ought to be front but if it be closeroof the light must come more from below again if this building bedeep or the opening which give it light far from the wall it ought to be light mostly from the reflexion of the ground yet if the opening be wide the light may proceed somewhat from the side but contrarily when the summerhouse be shallow or the opening near and one part of the painting be in the light and the other in shade its own natural reflexion must be see in the shady part that the work may look like real carve baf relief and because no tenderness or pleasantness can be use in it as be in shade ithink the part there ought to be handle somewhat more large and strong mean with few littleness in order to make they come out and for prevent confusion that at further distance the work may look become thus much as to light the colour in this case if well choose and put together add no small lustre of these think the three follow fort the most proper namely freestone blue stone and white marble by reason of the green of the building which cover it and commonly shade the painting and impart to it more or less of they colour which however look lovely and sweet especially upon the white the two other blue and freestone may be use for by work since purple violet or red can not have here proper place by reason of the discordant green produce a inharmonious mixture but if clean light fall on the painting without be shade then the three last name colour appear well as do also fleshcolour and have with the green good effect as be by means of it improve and the green thereby become beautiful and lively especially when place between blue stone ornament which every where unite with the green and keep together but in this management let I be understand to suppose the summerhouse to be wide where what have be say be on each side next the opening without paint on board give little or no shade in the painting ought also be consider its shape whether circular square octangular oval or any other which will best suit there as as for the subjector design they must be govern by the situation of the place flower be sacred to flora the spring to venus fruit to pomona vine to bacchus herb to aesculapius corn to cere music to apollo who be also the parent of the season procreation to priapus and fruitfulness to diana from these head may be draw abundance of matter for the ornament of summerhouse now to be more plain in what have before assert ishall exhibit two example for the one place zephyrus and fhra in the middle of square or round piece as occasion require thesé be both see front mutually embrace in lovely manner he sit on she right side have he left arm about she neck with he right hand hold shewhich rest on he knee and she speak to he very friendly and lovingly almost mouth to mouth she head incline over the right shoulder with she left hand she be take up wreath out of basket of flower she lap sway to the left and he to the right and between they be sit one or two cupid twist garland about flam torch he be almost naked and wing have trumpet lie by he she be airily and finely dress the other example consist of three figure and exhibit flora on the right side pomona on the left and apollo in the middle touch he lyre and sit somewhat above the twoother flora have cornu copiæ full of flower and pomonabe sill with fruit and she hold pruningknife apollo sit front fhra look forward with finger on she mouth and pomona as in furprize toss she head backward and sideways these goddess sit in profile against each other the byornamennt round about consist of child or cupid such design as these especially the former be most proper in flowergarden but where there be most fruit pomona take place here you must observe that order these two compofition for bass relief somewhat more than half rise and light front but when the light come froin side they ought to be very faint or little relieved as we shall further illustrate in the book of statuary treat of the three fort of baf relief in slowergarden suit best distant visto or grove contrarily in walk with tree the ornament should be river seahavens with hill building rock and fuch like as they be not shade by tree but receive pure and open light yet in summerhouse and place for rest which be somewhat shade by the green visto be not proper but rather baf relief consist of one two or three grounds on the courtyard wall between the house and garden suit also bass relief of one or other of the coloured stone aforesaid likewise term urn and vase with green in case no natural one be there or else fountain with they waterfalls against agreen hedge or wall suit well circular hollow with bust in they if also thereabout stand no natural one these bust may be paint of white or light red marble or other light coloured stone the place beforemention be the principal and most common but seldom happen to be together yet if they should the method aforesaid will be of uie and you may enrich you thought by they means since they be lay down as well for hint as example and if you also consult the siné design of le potre vou will never be at stand but the better to aid the conception of young master iwillingly subjoin another ordonnance of my own invention as follow place venus in the middle of the piece sit quite naked between pomona and flora this latter stand on she right side crow she with chaplet of flower and pomona on she left offer she branch of peach which venus receive with she left hand who sit high and almost strait maintain fine air and charming deportment and thus by she triplicity afford a agreeable harmony of beauty smell and taste for here beauty imply sight and if the place be higher than broad you may join apollo to they company somewhat off and fainter sit plave on cloud and thus you may in the most proper manner exhibit the sive sense however apollo be not so absolutely necessary here since venus or beauty also imply harmony but bring in pomona because fruit and flower generally go together for flower grow and appear all the year round as well as the fruit in fummer and autumn there be also fruit which blossom at the same time as the flower do to wit peach apricot almond in phyfical and kitchengarden would place asculapius the son of apollo god of phyfic as the principal of the piece and to whom the garden be sacred stand in the middle between apollo and dia to the one with he quiver at he back sit on he right hand or near he holding scepter top with sun or else slame torch and the other on he left adorn with moon either on she head or in she hand and equip with she bow and arrow asculapius hold staff twine with serpent the moon or earth cause the seed to rot which apollo or the sun by he warming and search influence cause to rise as to phyfical herb three virtue be ascribe to they warming and cool and mixture of both these may be oppositely represent by the aforesaid three person since by aesculapius with he staff twine with serpent be understand prudence in moderate one herb by another and by art to make they work they effect have thus largely handle this point shall confirm it by some figural example respect what have be before say in order to shew what sort of painting and ornament be most proper in such place where we usually represent any thing and which must govern careful master in order to make he design conformablé thereto observe then begin with the first sketch what ishall further say if the proprietor be desirous of have the place paint all round what fort will be the most proper colour or bass relief what obstruction may be there to hinder the naturalness of the work in design at what distance it ought to be see either from without or within since it must be execute boldly or neat accordingly whether the painting be to remain there constantly winter and summer you see then in the first example of plate lii place inclose bys two side wall at the end ofwhich be summerhouse equal to the whole breadth the entrance into it be in the middle and on each side be a opening through which the representation of and the one on the right and the other on the left receive theirlight as the middle piece have it front over the summerhouseand wall appear the top of the hindbuilding now the question be what subject be proper for visto or bass relief green prospect such as woody country or slowergarden would have no good effect in this green summerhouse when see from without where it ought to be view because mixture of green with green afford neither variety nor delight sea haven or court adorn with statue fountain cascade and such like elegancy would appear exceedingly fine view from within for those colour look wellamong the green but see at its proper distance without they will be find to be false and contrary to nature by reason of the top of the house which be behind and rise above they discover general stoppage whence it follow that nothing be more proper for the middle piece than bassrelief . let we now consider what be best for the two sidepiece see from within the one as say receive its light from the left and the other from the right bassrelief can not in my opmnion be decorous there because the eye must not be so closely confine they ought to be visto as not have the inconveniencewhich attend the middle piece to hinder they naturalness the summerhouse he roof in the light therefore fall more advantageous on these two place than the middle one as be without the glare of it wherefore visto must be bestthere and even the fainter and bluer the better as before intimate a haven with shipping court with fountain island with hill streetview of fine building temple and gallery together with blue offscape these bevery delightful object and producebetween the green variety and decorum now we ought to observe that the two piece and though they beceive they light from the place yet if we please may be light otherwise because they be withoutdoor prospect have no communication with thiswithindoor place as th e9 bassrelief have which be confine to it thus much as that to side the same observation be proper for the side and . the second exampl e9 in plate lil aforesaid exhibit garden with parterre also wall in in the middie be gate of lettice work and on each side shallow lettice seat cover over with green note and in the back of each seat be circular representation and over they appear the top of tree as of large orchard mark now let we consider what subject will be most proper for the seat and first the observe the distance whence the work beto be see which be from without on the nearside of the parterre here af in the precede example visto be not proper and because the place be so full of green more green would not look well wherefore half raise basrelief would be best as for the colour we have before prescribe it the sidemay also be adorn as before in the last example observe what object rise behind and above they here on one side be house and on the other green wall . behold now third sketch in plate liii discover walk with tree at the end of which stand the paint object here9 in you have great liberty andmay use you pleafure since the design stand free from any obstruction thisonly be to be note in it that because it be long walk and in nature itselfitself we be oftentime tired with travel such a one we have no occasion to make it longer by perspective and other view but rather stop the walker bysine prospect and invite he to little contemplation and reft that he may afterwards the better go forward wher e9fore we here suppose beautiful imagery fountainlike of white marble place in grotto or niche arched with green and therein paint in full proportion and with all strength cephalus and aurora zephyrus and flora or venus and adonis and such like or you may represent there in rock have several hole discover the sky udmus kill the dragon or diana with she nymph or term or faunus accompany by bacchanal or satyr with they instrument some of whichspout water or else you may exhibit sleep silenus with the nymph egle squecz mulberry on he face all these be proper subject for the place and suitable to the occasion . you may also paint some term on board cut away and place they against . green wall on both fide of the nich window or circular hollow wherein may be set bust or cast as you see in the second example of fuch colour as before mention and which appear lovely among the green thefe term may represent bacchanal satyr god and goddess some naked andother dress accord to the season and place . ch ap xii table or ordonnance of venus and adonis for the embellishment of landscape . hat may conceal nothing from the artist but as much as possiblerouze and enrich they genius have pitch on this subject far the ornament of landscape and though it be common yet question whether itbe ever handle in such manner divide it into three ordonnance . the firft be venus92 make love to he . the second he taking leave of he to go liunting or rather to be kill . and the third she find he dead . the fable be this venus be accord to the poet very much enamourwith the youth adonis notwithstanding he coldness and insensibility and yet he refrain not from kiss and caress she for season which much incensed aiar and raise he jealousy and rage as often as he see the youth in she lapthe first ordonnanse . the place open pleafant and agreeable country store with every thing that can delight the eye wood hill valley river and stonework except househouse and temple iset th e9 point of sight in the middle of the piece . between it and the left side on a hillock place the goddess and she spark attend by the three grace who be to adorn she one of these be twist wreath of flower another be crow she with chaplet of they and the third bebring basket of fruit some cupid be toy about she one especially befitting at she foot blow adonis92 horn at whom he smile when venus withshe arm about he neck with she hand press he against she breast or kiss it . behind the aforesaid hillock against the offscape place some thickleavetree the highest in the middle of the piece and those to the leave somewhat lower and thinner behind they we discover the remains of colonade riseand appear half behind the hillock and run towards the point of sight . on the same side forward set crof low wall which the hillock stem . against this wall which be but three or three foot and a half in rise placee0watergod fitting asleep by he vase and encompass with green and in the corner against the frame of the piece place large willow tree orone and an half and thus half the piece be fill on the right side forward plant knobby mossy body of tree about six or seven foot high and close behind it large and beautiful one fully leay somewhat bevond appear a high square spedestal whereon stand large and elegant vase these object be in line run towards the point of sight make way between it and the hillock which be wide forward and diminish atthe end of the foreground where the second begin and run out into a open field whence to the horizon be seen some faint hill . let we now comeforward again in the right side corner envy kindle the fire of war 92 she9 be fly with break stink pitchtorch in she hand and her head beset with twining serpenit secretly fhew mar the two lover andnow we see the devour god of war a he belly withioneleg over stone lurk behind the pedestal and stare eamnestly between it and ithe green of the tree at the cause of he jealousy nis spear and fhield lie at he foot . once see print of julio romano wherein hehave place mar in the offscape purfue adonis sword in hand which think too obscure and far fetchect . the sense may be tolerabl e9 yet it be against the fable for ovid due not men tion that adonis be kill by mar wath sword but by wild boar through he instigation . in the mean time doubt not but this my fketch and disposition will seemstrange nevertheless if well execute it will certainly appear sine with the pe destal low wall andcolonade since such thing create great decorum and varietyin landscape .the light assign be bright sunshinemy intention her e9 be to represent the month of may or the spring when everything be come forth and blossoming though be very sensible that the green of the tree by the diversity of colour be in the summer more painterlike however this must not be like summer besides the island of cyprus be not likeholland or other cold country where the green come up late for otherwise should not introducebe 0 basket of fruit . now now if it be ask because still set on the large pedestal vase and thatdirectly against the hillock where venus and adanis be with the grace whetherthis would not throw very large groundshade over those figure say it wouldnot because assign the sun meridian altitude moreover do not set the pedestal so near the hillock as to be any obstacle to the sigure the foremost tree because it rise so high can also as little prejudice they its groundshade pass by they over the willow in the corner or at least part of it whichmake the colonade against which it spread fall back though the tree behindthe hillock can sufficiently effect the same since make they either dark green or else in shade and the little leaf hanging over the lover in the light in order thus to have below some darkness for set off the lover my intention be to place that group directly in the sun in onder to have there the principal light . but here may be reprove on supposition that act counter to my own position namely that in sunshine people do not stand talk without shadthey eye which do not deny but let it be consider that the god be not subject to human frailtiaey and therefore they can look against the sun and to solve the difficulty with respect to adonis who be not god make he upper part in shade receive agreeable and strong reflexion from venas and the grace . from whence arise another difficulty namely by what mean this groundshade can fall on he only fince they be sit so close together that venus92 armbe about he neck and one of he hand press she breast and therefore she must need take part of the same shad e9 to which answer that there be means enough by one thing or other to find that shade and as for venus she may be so dispose either little backward or forward as to receive light enough . now that mar and enzy at the stone may not draw the eye too much fromthe principal by make they in the light bring not much sun into thatquarter mean that set the foremost whole stem of the tree and great part of the hindmost with part of mar in groundshade occasion by somethingwithout the piece and to let that shade run on the foreground just to the low wall break the residue here and there somewhat with bush and shrub might also place there priapusterm or other object in order little to fill that corner . we have before say that neither house nor temple must enter the compofition why not they say some as well as the terme to which answer that the fable make no mention of any such object and let I afk who should live inthe house it be not say that adonis though man have any houshiold or thathe worship in temple . this piece may be richly embellish with ten or twelve figure though marand envy be but partly figure some landscapepainter may possibly object against so great number for that those well execute would better become a history than landscape but the answer be easy the figure be small andthe landscape large . we shall now proceed to the colour and action ofthe figure . we we represent venus in she line yet with she upper part and leg almost bare under she on the graf appear part of light red garment . adonis92 garment be greenish blue or dark violet . the two grace stand next to venus be drest in lightcoloured garment of changeable stuff and break colour preserve about that group great mafs of light for which reason chuse such colour as do not cause any unseemlyreflexion in the carnation of venus or adonis she garment who be crowvenus with chaplet be rise colour fecond more forward and with one knee bent be in white and have flower in she hand and the third have the fruit and stand on the left side and somewhat higher on the hillock have a aurora or strawcoloured garment we need not say much about mar and enzy since caesar ripa relate enough touch they nothing be more proper for mar than rusty fillemot or bloodcoloured coat and for envy than black oneas for the motion of venus and adonis they be front in both but their foot more or less turn to the light . adonis on the right side incline he upper part towards venus with he righthand on she breast and he right shoulder come forward he under part are front and he leg extend and he right draw in as if he be about to rise he face front incline little over he shoulder to the child who blowthe horn contrarily venus rest on she right thigh apply in some measure both she knee to he extend leg she face in profile turn towardshe front the sun she breast be also see front she draw back she left elbow in order to press he hand to she breast . on due consideration these two figure will be find to have natural and easycontrast or opposition in motion since have endeavour to give myself fuil satisfaction touch all the action exhibit before set the layman . but must return again to the ordonnance forget to place two child behind the foremost low wall of whom the one be lean over it and with finger on he mouth and head sunk be shew the other the steep rivergod place they there first for decorum92 sake and secondly in order to break in some measure that long and stiff piece of stonework the watergod be of brownisn yellow hue almost as dark as the say stonework and for two reason first for the sake of repose and secondly to prevent maf of lightthere with the child to the detriment of the principal besides further purpose to adorn the pedestal of the vase with bassrelief represent bacchanalor dancing nymph and though it come in shade yet assign it strong reflexion there ought also to be add one or two dog afleep of which the one awake stare back with prick up ear at the sound of the horn . have before say that one of the grace should be dress in white but now cast beautiful blue veil over it as proper to break the strength of the whitepiece thus execute be sufficient for the production of many other especially if we duly consider how many thing be observe in it which by few betake notice of viz the quality of each figure its origin or emblematic signification many fiction be paint from the poet92 description but few people weigh the writer92 meaning though attend with a cxplanation whichhowever however be only general without the addition of the circumstance though wellknow to the writer as the shape dress colour paffion and other remarkable whence we may conclude what must be the case of those man who do not make themselves master of all these thing and how easily they may mistake even pervert the sense of the writer or poet if the fact lay in the spring they bepresent it in summer if in winter morning they exhibit a autumn evening ought the opening to be solitary place or wilderness they will introduce diversion should any person have red drapery as proper to he it be make blue yellow we grant that the fable may be fepresent plain enough and who the character be and what they be do presently conceive but the drift of it be want . it be unnecessary to enlarge on this table or ordonnance further than to observe that mar here signify vengeance adonis the cvinter and venus the spring which be the reason why these two last can not agree . the poet write that there be four who go under the name of venus the first be the daughter of calum and the day the second be bring forth of the froth of the sea be conceive in mother of pearl and conduct to cyprus by the airy zephyr it be she who bear cupid to mercury the third be the daughter of japiter and dione who be wedded to vulcan chief of the cuckold and the fourth be the syrian call astarte who court the love of adonis andto whom solomon erect altar to pleasure he concubine whence we may judge what great disparity there be between these venuse . as for the wild boar it imply the night ignorance impiety filthiness lewdness . the second ordonnance or sequel of the forego story . when adonis be now tired with kiss and flattery or to say better when his forrowful f e2te draw near and the dog scent the boar set up cry he deaf to venus92 intreaty wrest from she embrace and jump up eager for sport . we must previously understand that we be oblige to confine ourselves to two principal point namely the general disposition and the light and though on due consideration it may possibly seem to be choose less advantageous than if it be single piece which willingly allow yet as it now serve to matchanother it therefore require the same light though reverse one might better become it because then should be at greater liberty but even then the dispofition would not be different enough from the former . we have in the book or ordonnance shew that when two piece hang together they ought to have certain conformity especially landscape with smallfigure as if for instance the heavist work be in the one on the right side and the visto on the left in the other or matchpiece it must be contrary and yet notwithstandingthat necessity or rule which however subsist ifind something which giveI greater satisfaction and better express the sense as may appear in the sequel .place as in the precede ordonnance the point of sight in the middle of the . piece and on the right side a eminence ascend by three or four step frontor parallel with the horizon upon it at the end against the offscape represent a open niche almost square and compasshead adornedronboth side with pilater support small but elegant cornice here and there somewhat break aboutthe niche hang festoon of poppy which be fasten to the crown of the niche and be button up on each side they end intwine hang down together .thro 92 this niche have seat before it we discover a agreeable view of wood lawn river road this eminence take up third part of the piece run off steep on the inner side forward against the step which be mostlyin shade by tree without the piece to the corner whereof stand the goddess we place she gill chariot draw by two pidgeon . on the left side betwen the point of sight and the frame of the piece standthree or four great and beautiful tree in row rune from the forepart of the piece and by the hillock towards the point of sight in the corner behind the eminence rise a high and rough rock also run towards the same point makebetween both narrow passage which forward be over run with bush and grass and behind be bare so as to discover through it the offscape and end of the rock .forward in the rock make large craggy hollow into which the water fallwith impetuosity thus much mostly as to the foreground at the end of it run narrow crossing river from the eminence to the back part of the rock along the side whereof ishew plantation of high tree in order to make the offscape which be see through they apear as in valley on the level whereon stand adonis set between two tree white marble basis with broken term and it be trunk lie near it . thus have shew the general defign which quistion not will appear more uncommon and woodlike than the other the third hope to make still more wild than this because the subject require it some may possible think it be to be a agreeable and delightful ordonnance but the sequel will shewit to be otherwise for in this represent the month of august and the sun somewhat darkenand fiery instead of shine brightly the air gloomy and cloudy as if it be going to thunder the wind also bloe and every thing be shake and in motion not one way but as in whirlwind the dust like vapour rise from the ground in some place . perhaps you do not expect this fort of management but on due consideration of the case it will be find both natural and artful . we now proceed to dispose the character . the goddess see the evening approach double she courtship the cold adonis contrarily eager for sport hearing the noise of the dog hastily arise fromthe eminence now all thing be in a hurry venus follow he with intreatie but in vain fate seize and pull he along with she the grace be in confufion one run after he another fearful of the goddess92 swoon and tumbling down the step support she the third sadly shriek and cry liftup she open hand on high the boy be in contention one be hawl adonis away and the other stop he cupid lie throw on the ground other run with the dog before tke wild boar appear in the beforemenfion narrow passage between the eminence and the river set on by gruel rage with pitchtorchnow this ordonnance seem to have much more work than92 the precede andyet if considcre it will be found92otherwise and that in the former the figtres be only more scattier besides in hear thing related they always seem mors to we than in the picture itself . venus exhibit as come down the step as also one of ghe grace whe rune after adonis isince he be slipt out of the goddess92 hand the youth represent run juft in the middle of the piece between the eninenee of the tree threeor four pace beyond the step whereon the goddef stand beseech he intear he be almost half in the groundshade of the eminence for have say that the sun be set the child who attend the dog be entirely shade bythe stonework on the eminence which be so high and large that the body of the last tree do not escape it venus stand with she right foot on the lowermost step and with the leave on th e9 middlemost on the inner corner stoop she under part almost front and she upper part turn siedways towards he pre fing she fold hand with 92 the elbow forward against she body and sinkshe head look from he towards heaven place one of the grace by she sideas come down embrace the goddess about the waift with fear and concerns and with amazement look to the left after adonis the other virgin who run after he be now with one knee on the ground withshe left hand shewhe the goddess and with she right hand hold skift ofhis coat so that she be most see from behind the third have as be say she hand stretch on high and she face be swell by the violence of she outery adonis as in great haste advance he right leg turn he breast to the right tothe light he hold spear in he right hand high close to he side which boy be withhold with all his strength for which another angrily strike he with he bow adonislook downr ward with he face front at the virgin who be at he foot point withhe left hand which be foreshorten at the wood by which anm fate be pullhe thither she be fly and have rudder of fhip on she shoulder hertrightshoulder and right breast come forward she other part be foreshorten andshe face turn backward before he represent cupid also fly and pulling he towards the wood by the string of the horn which swing by he side . this boy be see quite from behind with he foot flung out and hold he bow in he right hand with which he be threaten another who be tumble down andly also foreshorten with he head forward and 92 foot towards adonis he be allin shade except he head and the hand with which he scratch ithe torch lie . near he extinguished . slappet of venus92 red garment come about she right arm and swing behiad over she left leg the chaplet of iflower fall from she head down shebackfate be dress in black withbe 0 small92 sly veil overit . . behind the broken term be ise the arm of mar viz he armour helmet shield sword and spear lie oa the ground in shade now although mar donot appear in he own shape but in that tof the boar in which he be metamorphase yet we need not wonder at it bedause we must not suppose that as he was god he enter into it stoekine and fho some may possibly afk whetherhe could not do it in he full habbliment and say he might but then must ask again how we should know it the dress of god and man have no sensation eithergood or bad they be even of no ocher signification than to make the person know for be they subject to the paffion arife from heator cold thoy would also share the punishment of the body as the head hand do . yet it may be very reasonably afk here in case we be to represent tho canicrous aglaura metamorphase by mercury into touchstone whether she gar ment should not be quite blacke0 and answer that nothing but she bodv should be so for otherwise my affertion fall to the ground though have say that the dress make the person know nevertheless shall in this point furthe explain myself . king lyncus approach the bed of he sleeping guest triptolemus with intention to slay he cere appear at the very instant and take the weapon fromthe king at the same time transform he into lynx beast like tyger for violate the law of hospitality this story would represent thus tho king be not there the beast make take to flight shake from himi aboug the floor the purple garment and crown this think most agreeable to nature and probability add to this another instance . juno say the poet in wrathful jealousy beat the poor calisto so much thatshe be metamf 4 rphase into fhebear now how be this to be represent in order to know what she be man or woman would represent the frightedbear as take to flight not cloath but drag she garment behind her along the ground here the bow there the quiver of arrow strap and other ornamentyet in what mean manner have see the king lyncus represent by testo.he stand with the dagger in he hand cloath and crowned have for legs the frightful paw of bear . thus ihave affirm that cloath serve god and man only for distinction which bring to my remembrance print of poussin confirm what have say . it exhibit the elysian field with the happy soul at rest and youth or eternal spring dancing and strew flower here we see hyacinthus narcissus crocus adonis ajax and many other in sit posture as when live whence we may easily perceive how difficult it would be to know they without they partir cular badge of distinction as the spear horn fountain helmet chaplet of rose and how impossible it be poussin so excellent and learn man to make sja be 6 know see he there represent he in the same rage or despair to to wit stab himself as when he be before troy great mistake in my opinion with respect to probability should rather have leave it out as also the chamberpot or cistern wherein nartissus be view himself .can hardly believe so strange design to be of poussin himself since ajax beplage in so cruel posture among the happy soul man who be felo de se rather deserve hell why may not sispphus ixion prometheus or tautalus whp be doom tohellish92 punishment be of they company lt be true that ajax act only against himself on account of the arm of achille to which he have . claim and the other offend the god one steal the fire froin heaven anothen have the impudence to trepan the goddess juno to he lust by a ambush . testa have in my opinion in many particular exhibit the same representation better and more intelligible than poussin as be much larger and more pleasant and painterlike but yet he run counter to the probability of that place of rest as we may perceive in the two figure of boy and girl where he betake some flower out of she lap and she in return be ready to scratch out he . eye be a old quarrel revive now in fact neither hatred quarrel or jealousy nothing but repose and peace should appear there . but methink hear some say that derogate from the worth of those twogreat man by thus exposing they mistake and that it be easier to find fault than to make thorough composition which perfectly own nevertheless my intention be not in anywise to build reputation on they error since it will appear throughout this work that be no kinder to my own mistake than to those of other and this with view of shew artist way for avoid such common defect and of make they more careful to mind probability in all part . here let we make comparison between a architect and painter goodarchitect ought first exactly to know what ground be most proper for he purpose in building temple palace as whether it be firmor marshy andto which quarter he must order he front and then to proceed towork if painter intend to represent courtship or military exercise offer or anything else he will also look for proper place whereim to lay the subject the architect make plan of he court with all its appertunance of temple with the choir altar and other particular of fortification with its bastion raveline rendezvous painter likewise exhibit the elysian field or the garden of flora for caness temple for divine service court withthe king and he retinue or forest for hunt now if person enter tho temple during divine service withsword in he hand or be stab himself in the elysian held among the happy soul in order to give he soul second reniove would you not conclude those thing to he very improper for such place and fitter for troy afk whether the sacred temple and field be notthere by profanee0 and be dog to be hunt in the palacecourt or place of rendezvous would it not be ridisulousbe 0 ajax never enter the elysian field before he soul92 separation yet here he stab himself againhave he another soul to depart from he let we now proceed to the description division and consideration of the third and last ordonnance . the goddess of love perceive all she endeavour to be fruitless and growing impatient for adonis s 92 return take she chariot draw by two swan anddrive swiftly towards the wood in order to seek he leave she grace behind as useless at this juncture as we shall further explain at the end of this ordonnance cupid follow she shriek the unhappy youth bit by the wild boar in he groin lie gasping against lafge oak where at last venus find he inhe blood wherefore step from she chariot like frantic sne bewailhi abhor she godhead and eursing thecruel tyranny which prescribe law to heaven and earth in the mean time adonis expire and he wave soul betake by mereury and carry to the elysian field this fable represent thus .adonis be lie on he left side foreshorten with he neck against the trunk of large oak and he right breast and shoulder upwards he left arm extended and the right close to he body hold the spear which be partly under he he head hang almost on he left arm little foreright with the rightcheck upwards he foot be turn towards the left corner of the piece forward he left knee rest on fmall rise or stone be half draw up an hunthorn lie at he foot the dog at he head on the left side howl andyelp e9upid on he right side stoops down and look at venus shriek atthe same time open adonis92 garment in order to shew the bloody wound to hemother who affright startback and raise she hand towards heaven . cupid 92 back be by the goddess partly in the groundshade he breast be foreshorten he foot close and knee somewhat bent holding torch in he righthand veuus as have be say raise she hand on high put out she right leg and draw back she left foot on cloud which behind she run up to the right under the chariot she upper part incline over the say left foot her chin is92 sunk iato she breast and thus she behold the wound she breast beforeshorten and she right hip be front behind the aforesaid oak againstwhich adonis be lie the chariot be see in profile on some wave cloud alike with the horizon which about venus descend gradually lighter and lighter to , underneath she foot the chariot though gill yet keep dark by cloud beelegaatly wring with child festoon and foliage behind on top be large star and the chariot partly hide by the body of the oak forward between the middle and the left corner standstone about threc foot square with the broken trunk of term the residue whereof as the head and part of the body lie on the ground among thebushies and shrub this stone stand somewhat obliquely with the left corner towards the left side of the piece close to which . side rise a high tree and little further another quite overgrown five or sixfoot high behind the stone among the shrub thistle and thorn the boar attempt to fly lie wounded in blood and dirt on its foreleg with its mouthwide open on the second ground on the right side go atropo with her sciffor in she hand and distaff on she fhoulder be almost of the middle hide . behind the groundand in shade except she

brown hair this subject require more cypref and myrtle than other sort of tree .the ground forward from the right side to beyond the stone be marshy . do not introduce the gracehere92as in the precede ordonnance becausethey be improper for they must not attend venus on forrowful occasion as ha ac ving quite different use and mean as we shall here observe and the rather since in the former

gratify zheir defire and to givea handle for axercife in fketch such another . have choofe for this purpose the fable ofdryope and will adapt it as muchas possible to the ornament of landscape make it withoutdoor prospect . the story accord to ovid be this dryope insensible of the sorrowful difitster that be to befall she on certam time take awalk bye0 lake encompaffwithmyrtle with intent to make

plant with myrtle and encompass by abrook inthe middle of the piece place as the principal tthe tree loto full of red blossomand thickty leave from this tree dryope break off the sprig make it to . shake and move so violently that the trunk of it by that meanbecome distortand wind on92 the left side iplace the raffi dryope of beautiful air andblack hair have she son amphisus about the middle in she left arm she advance with she left fo f 4t towards the tveer little draw back the right her upper part fallhack still more in she right hand lift up sne hold the bloodysprig at which she stare in confusion she left thigh come forward she upper per part sway to the leave she broast iscahriost front directly against the light she face in profile more or less turn back and she foot be by this time fix inthe ground we see the child92 hinder part and it be head be set off against her breast she sister on theright side of the tree stand over against she represent with light hair and in the iutmost concern wring she clasp handagainst she left cheek she head turn to the right hang over she right shoulder she breaff heave and she under part draw quite back she knee be bend she right foot flung out and the left draw back as if she be faint away . she be about fourteen or fixteen year of age the nymph who support dryope be place between she and the tree hold she back with she left hand and withshe right uncover the leg and shew to the sister at whom she look thatthe foot have already take root another nymph who be take the child has she left side front yet she back part be mostly visible she be on she knee the left forward the other quite draw back push with she foot against water vessel which at the brink of the water she overturn third on the rightside come run quite astonished with lap full of flower she point withshe left hand towards the other and look to the leave at she companion fittingon the bank of the river which partly run between the tree towards the point of fight the one arise and look forward with amazement and make it known to the other sitting towards the water who therefore support herself on she left hand turn she upper part to the right in order to look back they have mostly chaplet either on they head or lie by they . thus much as to the disposition and action of the moveable byornament which consist of virgin each be contrast accord to she paffion we now proceed to the immoveable ornament .. on the left side on rise ground between the the tree place large fronting priapa term without arm or leg mostly in the snade against the offscape which strongly throw off the foremost group on the right side forward half in the water set square large rough stone whereon lie garment or veil andparcel of leave and flower in the pannel of this stone be carve fatality in baf relief behind it and between the nymph with the flower place on the ground basket of chaplet . as for the season it be lay between summer and winter in the ripen autumna and in sine weather for the time of year the light be side one little front . the sun may be put in or leave out as every one please because it be not mantion or insist on in the fable . shall next proceed to describe the further circumstance of this ordonnance since without shew the light and darkness harmony and colour it be imperfectand not fike aature it must be grant that the harmony and shadow oftentime shew themselves and that tne light be sufficiently apparent to he who understand perspective but whether there may not occur still something beyond the common guess and judgment very much question as for the colour theymust need be express since without it it be impossible to know or penetrate mine or any other painter92 thought .thereforeitfietefore aflign dryope as the principal character ablue sattin garment one flappet whereof go over she right shoulder and come under she girdle and the dther be in she left hand with which shehold the naked child about the middle when the remainder with a under flap tuck in the girdie under she left breast cover all she other part down to the foot except the left leg and foot which beroot in the ground she under garment as likewise the open sleeve about her left arm be yellowish white with green reflexion she garment next the leftleg be open the foremost nymph be almost naked have no other cover than sine white small scarf about she middle the dress of dryope and lole be intermixe with gold in order to make difference between they and the nymph . the nymph who be naked 92 from the middle dref in dark green gown gathered at the navel and fasten by girdle lole have a airy garment closesleeve of bright rose colour girt with broad girdle of dark violet embroider with gold and under it flower coat open below and give freedom tothe leg stone forward be greyish and the vessel dark red .the ground next the water be grassy and thus variegate the whole fore ground the nymph who on the right side of the second ground come run have afgreenisn breast garment loose and untied witho fbt sleeve and fasten but on one shoulder the left breast and leg be bare the other sitting further behind on the edge of the river leave quite naked she companion have small green scarf .. the stone priapus be dark gray inclinable to violetas for the light think that the major part ought principally to fall on dryope and the two nymph next she and on what else belong to that group . the residue may be little and mostly foreign light either from behind before or sideways yet in such sort as that the cause thereof and the snade as by whatand from whence may plainly appear gtherwise they will be but loose fancy without foundation . some may possibly question whether hereby the light will answer my purpose because assign dryope ablue garment over yellowish white one judge not without seem reason yet without know my intention that the contrarywould look more decorous namely the light over the dark because the greatest and strongest maf of light fall on she middle part to wit belly and leg the naked child would be more beautifully set off if she breast or upper part . be dark than against the yellowissi white this with respect to the light willingly allow but not as to the colour for designedly make the garment blue in order to make the naked nymph beautiful and yer with intention that thatpart might keep strong and broad light for this reason have choose stufffor itaccordingly it be brown that sattin have gloss and almost the same force as gold or silver ffuff the red garment of lole as be beautiful andlight colour will wbe sufficiently yet too much set off against the dark ground but the blue have here on account of the great maf more power though havemore light about it for the red be but small spot have as much as possible consider th e9 probability ofthis representation and the harmony in the dispofition of the eolour assign each figure its particular and proper emblematic colour not only in the drapery but also in the nudity give one fair and ten ac der another more brownish sxin and so forth each figurehave likewise its particular characteristic the head of the waternymph be adorn with white bellflower that of the woodnymph with wild plant and that of she who comes run forward with fieldflower if it be wonder that make mention of sattin since we rarely hear it be in use among the ancient say the observation be just with respect to statuary but not as to painter because have met with several old picture wherein have see sattin represent but how long that stuff have be know to the world92 can not tell nor shall enquire in the mean time it must be allow to be beautiful and elegant stuff as be also the changeable silk though in less degree and more proper for young people . if any difficulty arise from my introduce into this story priapusterm sincethere 92 neither god man faunus or satyr in the whole piece nor the least sign of any indecent action iwill give he my reason which be that the poet relate the first cause of the disaster befall this unhappy woman afcribe it to the tree loto because when woman and priapus could not satisfy he lust withshe he in revenge transform she into that tree bear she name lay curse on those who violate it and still retain that vindictive humour wherefore place he here as the first promoter of the accident . insist largely on these fable or ordonnance to give handle for further inquiry into they for ovid be not full and particular in all he fable and we be oblige to fetchbe 0 great deal from ather author he give we no right idea of the tree loto stranger to these country nor mention what sort of leaf it have or its virtue or whether it be of moist or dry nature or where it grow most plentifully wherefore as far as havemeet with they ishall produce the testimony of some author about this tree together with the emblematic sense and explanation they assign very proper part of knowledge for landscape painter whose inclination lead hini to something uncommon and desire to paf for learn among the curious and know . have find in general that the leave be round which at the rise sunopen and as he go down close and at night double wherefore when we introduce no sunshine they must be represent double or shut . as for the misterious sense we must know that the agyptian pay more honour to this tree than any other on belief that it be mediator between . heavenly and earthly thing it be moreover use to represent the sun92 rise andset especially with the addition of child sit on it by which they signifythe morning vapour which the sun92 approach dispel and because it opens and shut its leave with the sun92 rise and set it be sacred to apollo as tree peculiar to he and out of respect shew its leave to he only . the rough or hairy loto be also much venerate by the roman who offerthe vestal lock of hair to it ab as they do those of young man to apolle or to he son asculapius . the gree e8 sacrifice they hair in the same manner92to the river of they country as have certain relation to this treewhich they imagine have such intercourse with the god that they make it they seat and therefore it be plant in morass . ialblichus testify that these tree require much moisture whence the ancientinfer the first cause of procreation therefore call the ocean the father of all creature and observe the round leave round stem and round fruit they would by this mofl perfect figure intimate the perfection of the highest deity especially when child be represent sit on atree which ovid likewise allude to in this fable when as mo . pope have render it he say now from my branch arm this infant bear let some kind nurse supply mother92 care yet to he mother let he oft be lead sport inher shade and in she shade be feedwe shall now proceed to second table or ordonnance relate to dryope . the story be this as soon as andr e6mon be advertise of the sorrowful accidentwhich have happen to he wife dryope he hast to the place in company withhe father but they arrive too late to have any speech with she before the metamorphase rough bark have now seize she body and member insomuch thatshe be only to be know from other tree by she shape and soft voice her arm make two branch abound with leave besides she head attire covered with green both the father and son hang about

consist of hill and water and because represent a evening the air be full of vapour and dark cloud and the tree by reason of the wind be in agitation . now as this piece be the fellow of the former all thing should of right be equally full of work but because this ordonnance have the greater variety as exhibit some man have be necessitate to depart ltttle from the original disposition since what be introduce into the other must need be see here as we have largely treat in the zist chap of ordonnance wherefore placedryope front with both she arm lift up and pretty near each other hef head

believe it will not seem odd to the know that introduce so much high ground and water about so small spot of low land because the poet lay the fact in lake for which reason and in order naturally to shew it exhibit thatcorner with the way crescentlike as be but part of the lake . the question be now whether painter may not take some liberty for decotum92 sake answer he may so far as not to take away the property of the subject for what the writer lay down must paf for law whetefore we may wellconclude that ovid do not say any thing without reason some may possiblythink could have make more delightful choice but it may be observe thatthis fact be of contrary nature seek not for pleasure in the midst of sorrow which here be my principal scope as may appear by what follow . in the path on the right side represent some bacchanal and satyr trooping toward the hill among they one be carry priapusterm on he shoulder with large vessel in he other hand and follow by tyger and panthers as for

breast pa ac rallel with the horizon because the ground rise forward and be level with the boat have largely handle the aforesaid three ordonnance to shew that landscapepainter want not matter for ornament they work with history or fable pro per to the landscape these thing be also of use to historypainter for represent richness of matter in poor occurrence wherefore to be copious andfurther instructive shall handle one fable more as also design of my own and then for the conclusion of landscape make comparison between what is painter and unpainter like the latter whereof be by ignorant commonly callthe contrary . 97chap xiv table or ordonnance of erifichton and the emblem of satyr punishment both serve for the embellisbment of landscape . vid relate that erifichton avery vile man be by the goddess cere . whom he have highly offend by cut down a exceed high oaktree consecrate to she punish with insatiate hunger insomuch that for want of food he be oblige to sell heown daughter see plate lvi.represent this in delightful landscape or withoutdoor prospect the light come from the right side and the point of sight be in the middle on tlie left side exhibit stately building with beautiful frontispiece of the dorick order ascend by three step run towards the point of sight beyond the step place a handrail four foot in rise run from the house by the point of sight in the return of it stand vase on the right side beriver with wooden bridge over it by the waterside appear part of townwall which the water walh and run round the residue be a offscape here and there plantwith tree next the handrail pl e2ce the hungry erisichton who with he cap in he left hand be tumble he tell money into it with he right hand his daughter mestre stand behind he near the step and the merchant step upshew she the door with he right hand wherein he have bag half full of money money at the fame time hold she with he leave by flappet of she garment . lean hunger behind between she and she father92 right side push she forward . with both hand this be the main of the subject . the merchant look proudly and gravely at the daughter be dress in violetcoloured garment reach just below the knee it be girt about hia middle he have fillet about he head and he be loosely stockine and shoe becording to the spartan custom he be see mostly from behind rest with his right foot on the upper step and draw up the leave from off the middle one . the daughter stand on she right leg with she left foot just on the lower step . little draw back she under part be almost front more or less from the light shesway she upper part to the right wishfully look at she father whoin she be unwilling to ieave with sorrow and tear fhie seem to move the merchant92 pity and to follow he against she will she have a handkerchief in she righthand with which up at the left ear sne seem to wipe she face support the .elbow of that arm with she other hand she garment be pale yellow with green reffexion and be slovenly gather under the breast and tie with ribbon hang in tatter below the calf of she leg she be barefoot have beautiful mein yet be somewhat thin she hair be light twist with small blue ribbon . erifichton stand quite stoop with bent knee he garment tie about the middte with rope be fillemot and reach behind to the calf of he leg beso open on the side as to discover he bare hip and leg he left shoulder be also naked he hair and beard grey and he be lean and swarthy he stick stand againstthe handrail as for hunger ovid describe he thus with frightful hair eye sunk in mnouth and lip livid tooth yellow and slimy and thick skin docover the bone and entrail he be see almost to the middle above the back of erisichton the pillar of the frontispiece be grey the house and step freestone and the pavement the door be of large blue ftone and from thence down to the river the ground be plain in the front of the house be carve two cornua copi e6 .the vase be of reddisn stone on the left side of it behind the handrail rife . great spread tree in full verdure which give large shade against the house the stem of it be encompass with ivy and other green which take away the light of the offscapebetweenit and the vase together with the sharpness of the handrail against which the daughter be brightly set off with decorum against the wing of the house without the handrail vine at the door wait young servant quite forward in the left corner stand watchful dog tie with chain and barking . in this representation have have a eye to three principal circumstance indigency necessary of life and opportunity indigency seek relief where it be to be have if not in town elsewhere wherefore represent necessity in both fatherand daughter come for relief to the substantial man92 country seat who live in plenty the further circumstance as the bridge town and horn of plenty explain themselves . i do not place lean hunger near erisichton contrary to what ihave formerly say namely that when pafsion can be expreff in the person himself we have no need of a emblematic figure to make it knowhunger be place here for tworeason reason first because want can not be perfectly express here in its full force through present intermixture with something else as the happiness of havefind the means whereby to relieve it to wit the money secondly because erifichton be not so naked that he consume body accord to the poet can be shew as occasion require . the reason of my put in the dog be not only for the enrichment of the doposition but also to shew that he who possess much wealth should likewise watch it moreover it be usual for the country people but chiefly man of substance to keep those creature as well for pleasure as use . this fable be seldom see in painting or exhibit in print otherwise than in ovid92 metamorphase and that in so simple manner that without the explanation under it it be scarce intelligible for what can be infer from a oldmeagre man92 receive purse of money from gentleman with young woman appear between they how can the inequality between rich and povertybe conspicuous when they as like in dress as if they be brother and sister andthis in landscape or the middle of afield where be neither house nor other token of they habitation the conclusion of story be not all that be necessary to be red we ought to know the origin the fact and sequel of it first it be necessary to know the man and who erisichton and he daughter be to express this naturally in they personand dress secondly we should know by whom they be punish and inwhat manner and lastly by whom and by what mean make easy after full all they circumstance most naturally such as the place after which the enrichment and diminution will follow of themselves we may at least conceive that they who will not study the point can not go such length as to perform so small story as this much less one of greater dignity in natural and ju dicious manner . ishall now agreeable to my promise in the conclusion of the last chapter give another embellish example in a emblem of my own invention for the sake of those who will not inure themselves to historian or poet nor confine they free andrich thought to such restriction . sweet repose disturb by lewdness a emblem . here be see three young nymph of diana92 train tired with hont reposing in the shade of the tree little off from the road and near foamy water whichsome fauni and satyr espy they be resolve to have some sport with they .wherefore acquaint they affociate with the matter they silently advancedtowards the place in abody bring with they one of the largest priapus termis they have together with two panthers vessel of wine and some grape being arrive and see the nymph almost naked and fast asleep they plant beforethe place the aforesaid hideous scarecrow and then softly ftole they huntequipage as quiver arrow bows and hang they on its genitals fastening they with the strap which they buckle they moreover deck its head withand adorning they with vizor not stop here they seize as many of the virgin garment as they could and toss they upon the high limb of a adjoin tree and to prevent the nymph climb up in order to regain theytie the two panthers under the tree and after have set down the wine andgrape pleased with the project they covertly retire to peep place to wait the issue on the nymph awake each of the gang have bring with he his instrument as the double hautboy cymbal tabor timbrel wherewith because it be evening and they might sleep too long to beat up they quarter . but the plot soon miscarried through a unexpected accident for another nymph who be possibly seek for she company happen to arrive at the place andsee the panthers lie under the tree and think they be wild shot atthey and kill one the satyr see this come out of they lurkhole andpursue she but she escape by flight they then conclude they have waitlong enough and observe that it grow late and that the aforesaid little bustle make the nymph begin to stir they in full body of satyr fauni bacchanal even all the tribe of bacchus set up with they instrument so loud noise that the nymph start up on sudden and full of fright look for they cloath but be now thoroughly awake the term present before they with they hunting equipage hanging about it this sight but especially that of they cloath on the tree much surprized they and put they to the blush not know what course to take in the exigence not one durst approach the block in order to take she weapon the vile crew all this while keep perdue laugh at they unobserve the distress nymph perceive no body near they run to and for consider how to get they cloath again but on they approach to the tree the panther arise make so great noise that they know not whether to run cries and lamentation here be useless they above a hundred time invoke the aid of diana yet in vain the eldest name cleobis at last take courage and wend up to the term with intention to get the veil from it to cover carile who be toked sayahl why be we such fool to be thus scared and only by wooden black why be we afhamed somebody have certainly be here but now the coast be clear be resolve to throw it down come sister andboldly give a help hand .97 but she have no sooner utter these word but all the gang appear mock scoffing and hoot any one may determine who be on that overture most dash and concerned little satyr shot at the term and take the quiver from it shew the nymph the unseemly member with a hearty laughter this but especially when other scoffer shew theythe cloath on the tree highly provoke they to take to flight be not adviseable one push they this way another that way during this game noise of cornet be hear which suddenly put a end to the laughter each make off leave all thing as they stand the term of priapus fall to the ground and the panther at the tree endeavour to get loose now diana appear attend by she train of nymph who shoot they arrow at the lewd crew the dog at the same time tear the panther to piece the fearful nymph appearmuch afhamed and prostrate themselves at the foot of the goddess to whom theythey relate they misfortune and the affront put upon they by the gang of satyr shew she at the same time the term the vizor they cloath on the tree and what else be do in despite to they the goddess to shew her resentment give immediate order to pursue the rioter and would not enlighten the night till she have revenge the insolence some accordingly make towardsthe wood other to the brook and the residue take the field in little time part of they be make captive for of the three who pursue the nymph for shoot the panther one be catch in the net and five other together with bacchanal be hawl before diana in iron whom she sentence to be tie twoand two together by the foot and whip by the three affront nymph with thorn and holmleave so severely as almost to kill they three other fhe judge to be hang by they tail on the limb of tree with they head just touching the ground not yet appease she cause he who be take in the net to be therein plunge into the water by two or three nymph till he be just expiring and the water come out of he mouth the bacchanal must see all this on whom be bestow a hunt knife wherewith if she think fit to release the delinquent to cut off they tail which after much reluctance she be at last prevail upon to do and then ty they hand behind they dia to say go now and shew vourselves to the rest of you wanton gang and tell they thatthus will punish all those who dar es to mock the chaste diana and she retinue . be not this now though feign story matter sufficient to furnisn manylandscape the landscapepainter ought to observe here representation of different paffion bashifulness in the nymph wanton joy in the saytr severityand resentment in the goddess and distress in the insolent . you see here the allur pleasure of commit crime and the bashfulnessand distress of those who suffer the evil but at the same time the grievous consequence and punishment attend wickednef and insolence in fine the sweetand punishment of evil and the reward and unexpected relief of virtue . can it be deny that such representation in landscape will not generallyplease surely it be not impossible to make other such design on wnich occafion hope it will not be tiresome to the reader if now shew what be understood by the word painterlike as very necessary point for landscape painter . chap xv of the word painterlike there be scarce any thing in the world which be not liable to good or bad construction and judgment alone chuse in all thing medium out ofthese two contrarity which be certainly the most beautiful and best this be an especial truth in the art of painting which have such power as to affect peopletwo different way first by virtuous and agreeable representation and in the aext place by those which be mean mishapen and contemptible both equallyefficaciousefficacious in contrariety . the former recreate and charm judicious eye andthe latter be its aversion . it be therefore indisputable that the painterlike or most beautiful choice imply nothing else than what be worthy to be paint and that the most mean or what be not beautiful least deserve that honour as for instance suppose there be bring before I basket of ripe unripe androtten fruit mix together must have my judgment chuse the most relish or those which appear most beautiful to the eye and reject the rest . landscape adorn with sound and straight grow tree round body andfinely leave spacious and even grounds with gentle up and downs clear andstill river delightful visto well order colour and a agreeable blue sxy with some small driving cloud also elegant fountain magnificent house andpalace dispose accord to the rule of architecture and richly ornament likewise wellshape people agreeable in they action and each colouredand drapery accord to he quality together with cow sheep and other wellfeed cattle all these say may claim the title of painterlike but piece with deform tree widely branch and leave and disorderly spreadfrom east towards west crook body old and rent full of knot and hollownefs also rug grounds without road or way sharp hill and monstrous mountain sill the offscape rough or ruin building with .they part lieup and down in confusion likewise muddy brook gloomy sky aboundwith heavy cloud the field furnish with lean cattle and vagabond of gypsy such piece say be not to be call fine landscape can any one without reason asfert he to be painterlike object who appear ase0 lame and dirtybeggar cloath in rag splayfoot bound about the head with nasty clout have skin as yellow as back pudding kill vermin or in fine anyfuch paltry figure would you not rather conclude suchthing to be the jest of painter e0for my part ibefieve that the difference between the fine and the ugly be too great not to make distinction between they iam well pleased that some callthe work of bamboccio brouwer and moller and the landscape of brueghel bril bloemart savry berchem and such master painterlike but oppose to they raphael correggio poussin le brun and in landscape albani genouille on this occasion shall before conclude alsoconsider the word designerlike word which be as much pervert as the other for instance crook trees abound with knot and hollowness rug clod of earth burst and sharp rock human body robustly and roughly muscle in michael angelo s 92 manner face large feature long nose wide mouth hollowe eye like tefta92 theseobject we have extol for designerlike though as absurdly and improperly as the master therefore be very imprudent who encourage theydisciple to seck and draw in so troublesome way after such object as tend to nothingelse than learn they to make outline do they nor ehuse roundaboutway to bring they into the right path nay how many die in the purfuit who have they take the other way might easily have get throught wherefore fore it be more adviseable to draw after the beautiful and sedate fimplicity andgreatness of raphael poussin and other excellent mafter than after any of thoseother paltry and misshapen object this must be agree thar if the bad anddeform be painter or designerlike the beautiful be not so the case admit of ii no alteration and consequently the worst must be best and the best worst . both be good there be no room for choice and you may at that rate mingle beauty with deformity joy with sorrow ripenness with unripeness god with beggar but since beauty be attract and deformity offensive this certainly betrue painterlike which suppose the bestand most agreeable object which alone ought to be call of and seek for . yet there be occasion wherein both must be observe either that the storyrequire it or that by means of deformity we be to set off what be beautiful and make it predominate but theu the painter who understand beauty may more easily abate than the other exal himself above he knowledge and capacity .wheresore conclude that beautiful nature be the best choice and the most painterlike . shall now for the benefit of such artist as be not rich in invention give compendious description of variety of object in fictitious view . chap xvi of painterlike beauty in the open air . he dav be almost shut in and the agreeable western sun give long andcharming groundshade when purpose to divert myself with walk not without reflect how many fine observablebe overlook which if handlead accord to rule would be of service carlessnef often proceed fromtoo superficial and groundless method of study which will not permit the thought to six on thing of most importance . where nothing bewant which could tend to the repose of the mind everything be beautiful and orderly blind chance have no hand in thiscouldplainly perceive withwhat ardour and pleasure nature and art have mutually bestow they benefit upon it the road or passage be so neat and level thatin walk you hardly seem to touch the ground sweet and refresh windreign there which so allay the sun92 heat as to make it indifferent whetheryou sit in it or in the shade the richleave tree as beautiful in they stem as they green move almost insenfibly when the young and tender sprout as yet but thinly leave careff by the mild and gentle air seem to rejoice the silver leave by sweet motion glitter like medal the sky be fine blue lose gradually in thin air towardsthe horizon the small cloud not violentlydrive this way and that move slowly and quietly till they get out of sight the white white swan beheld themselves in the clear brook freely wind and turning without feel whether with or against the stream . in this delightful region find very beautiful fountain the bason of whichbe of white marble furnish towards the road with rocky bowl and scollops to receive the water the figure stand upon it be most elegantly choose round it stand low and close may tree against the green whereof the white marble be magnificiently yet modestlyset off cause thus pleasing mixture in its shade . from thence take to the right hand along level and broad way on both side face with parapet of freestone whereon stand forward two large vase of fleshcoloured marble in shape and ornament like those in the farnese garden wide on top and without coverbut instead of a iphigenia the faint carvingconsist of dancing woman these vase have wonderful fine sweep the figures be ordefly dispose and in all part alike and moderately fill with work andbecause the bas relief arise solittle the whole appear as yet fresh and undamage . the parapet be build after the doricorder and its pannel be adorn with foliage and branchwork twine with reed . the end of it let I into wide sandy road on the left side border with gentle flow river and on the right with sine and large tree along the brink of this river be plant only grey and whitisn willow not all alike streight andlarge but some lean over the water other close branch and leave otheragain thin and young discover the glitter of the water on the right side where the road run high stand as say large and heavy tree of various kind such as oak afn lime wild olive pine cypress some with straight stem round top sway branch and fine green between which some tender sucker with they small and upright stalk and airy leave afford a inexpresfibleelegant variety the brown cypress lade with they fruit add no small lustre to the green of the other tree to my great delight under these tree grew some wild simple and various kind of large and small leave plant intermixwith thistle and thorn in a agreeable and most painterlike manner these under growth but especially the graf on the side be in many place dust bythe road which by they union cause charming decorum . at proper distance along both side of the road be place for the ease of traveller some low freestone feat in the form of long and narrow architrave support by two square pillar . go on come to crossway where find term or guide set up here not to gowrong iwas at 92 stand which way to take in this doubt recollect that those guide have commonly they face towards the way stranger and traveller ought to go this term be down tothe lower belley like man yet verymusculous and the head resemble that of saytr and guard with two large crook ram92 horn it stand in gap between some large tree half fhadewith leave and ivy it seem to he make of marble but very much bedripaud foul with green liquor little from it see on white marble plinth decumbent statue of naked nymph rest with she elbow on vase sheddingwater water which flow down the plinth below the way which be there little rocky run into the river this figure be very agreeable wonder at first fince it stand not far from and lower than the term that yet it be much cleaner think that in such place it could not well maintain its beauty and whiteness but my wonder cease on perceive that there be no high tree over it but thatit have free air another reason be that be so low as to be reach over possibly some draftsman have be at the place and wipe it clean on such conjecture ltank some water out of the vase into my hand and rub part of the shoulder which confirm my suspicion for discover that some part bealready become smooth and glossy by be handle and rub . stepbe 0 little further see another sight as fine as the former say fine with respect to art it be a ancient tomb or sepulcher of light red marble intermixe with dark grey and white eye and vein with lid or cover of lapis lazuli this tomb be support by four white marble sphinx without wing rest on large black marble plinth which through its dustiness seem to be lightisn grey the ground under it be rug yet level for three or four feet round the plinth .this work be generally encompass with sand extend to the seashore which it face and ten or twelve step further the sea be seen foam in the middle of the belly of the tomb be round bassrelief within compartment of oak leave it exhibit fly eagle with thunder in its bill whence conjecture it might be phaeton92 grave and the rather becausethere stand near the corner three very old and large cypress of which the hindmost be as yet whole and sound but the forward one by weather or otherwise so damage that one have lose it be top and the other be on one side half unbranched and bare behind this tomb stand large pedestal of greyishblue ftone on which have formerly as it seem be set a urn now flung down and lie near it half bury in the ground it be somewhat break and domage could make but little of the carving upon it since that be underneath and the ear or handle of the urn lay upwards wherefore in order to see what it be begin to clear the ground away from it but have hardly dug foot deep before perceive piece of chariot and half wheel in the shape of star this thought must be the chariot of the sun as be not much unlike it . this work thus seem old and yet the tomb with all it be ornament as new as if just set up think it must have owed its preservation to some heavenly influence be so entertained with view it on all side that be wholly taken up with it without reflect that as fortune favour I92otight to hasten to other thing of consequence before it grow too late yet resolve though stay all night not to leave the delicious place before have exactly design in my pocketbook every thing remarkable in it then go ten or twelve stepforward from it in order to have full view of every thing thereaboutsand sit down there open perfect ordonnance for on see the treebehindand on one side of the decumbent nymph and on the other side aeasy afcent with small cottage in low ground behind it could not but observe how elegant and become all the bywork keep themselves the tree behind the tomb appear . appear dark and there by flung it off strong and brightly the object on each side appear faint further on discover small bridge and in the offscape some hill all which presently sketch and shade mark for shortness of time with letter or figure the colour of the stone and their tint together with the lightnef and darknef of one object against another andalso against the sky . have do with this and walk further on the right hand come to very large and weighty bridge of one arch which have a exceed great span end in the crown in point this opening discover a even plain reaching almost to the horizon with cottage and house here and there in villagelike manner they be not meanly boarded and plaister like ours but regularly build with stone though plain and without ornament this bridge come from behind the tree on the right hand and preserve communication over the road with a high and large rock on the sea shore it be possibly pla ac ced here for the sake of dry passage to the other side in case of flood . go under this arch find myself in the open field near another sort of common building which at distance could not perceive on account of some intervene tree these be herdsmen habitation and build with mean material yet in fine manner with respect to art some stand on groundsill other go up two or three step but the generality of they have they entranceeven with the ground some have square door with circular window overthey or else round frame stick instead of bassrelief with ram ox or goatscull cut in white stone accord to the condition of the inhabitant the lower window be in form like the door and diameter and half higher than wide or else twice the breadth in height the upper window of such as had two story or small garret be mostly round some but singlestory had compasshead doorway and over they long octangular window and ifany smaller over they they be square the roof be generally flattisn and tile for bring off the water forward some in my opinion much excell other in grace have over the door way small balcony with compassdoor into they and the window on each side square and equally high andover they round one again on each side of the aforesaid door or entrance be make in the wall square vent hole like nich contracting inwardly and crossbarred with iron the pediment be doric or lonic and of whitishstone the lower story grev and the rest freestone some be paint lightreddishi other white freestone or grey some door have pillar or seat on eachside some house see also join with wall wherein be round hole . here and there appear large gate as of neathouse one be open andseem to be like place cover in most of the window have wooden shutter which hinge on top and keep open by stick those house to secure theyfrom the overslow of the river run in the neighbourhood stand much abovethe level of the way in fine omit no remarkable relate to these country people manner of dwelling . somewhat further and without this village come up to round temple have lofty and elegant frontispiece it waa ascend by flight of ten or twelve twelve step with freestone ballustrade on each side adorn with two sphinx face each other which be head with cap and body with house or covering after the antique manner landing on these step come up to portico front with eight column entablature and pediment of the lonic order the pediment have fine intire bafrelief not much rise the column were continue round the temple two and92two together rest plinth and basement . over they ornament run gallerv divide into part by pedestals whereon stand fine statue one answer each pillar behind the ballustrade of the gallery run up pilaster of the corinthian order two and two together and between they large window finely wring accord to that order as be the frize and cornice with grave foliage modillion on this arise a open dome inclose with close ballustrade cover in with compassroof whereon be set sun .though be not mych conversant with architecture yet perceive veryregular disposition in this building which among these adjoin also orderlyand beautiful loftily and magnificently distinguished itself appear like precious stone set in enamel though neither have other ornament than simply thoseof the order the contiguous house be low and extensive with high chimbehind these stand nie or tower yield in my opinion fine decorum .close plantation of tree mostly pine and cypress which add no small lustre to all this stonework on each side of the beforemention step be fountain or square bason adorn with two pretty large lioness couch on pedestalsand spout water . thus faricied see this glorious lofty and especially painterlike sight when we come to treat of architecture and the choice of beautywithin door shall be at the trouble of step into this temple todescribe its inward wonder . oh how comfortable be the shore after tempestl what defference bethere between lovely sunshine and gloomy night between fresh and livelyyouth and stale old age love solace in garden of pleasure and beautiful palace but envy lurk in desolate wilderness among the rubbisn of thingwhich it deface abandon then true and young artist vour blind zeal beauty do not triumph nor be here attend with what be deform spoiled foul or break but take up with thing simple or less beautiful without defect . wherefore think that these two kind of beauty differ as much as the verdant and delightful summer and the dry and barren winter who in build forpleasure would make patch or in make garden fill it with halfrottentree he must be a unaccountable man who seek delight in desolate willderness be it not then evident that those man have vicious taste who endeavour to fetch beauty out of deformity princef sufficiently shine among her lady by she state and costly attire without set off she lustre by comparisonwith swineherd when we meet with fine marble statue be they not preserve with care from ill usage and the injury of time through the latter sparefor nothing gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed se6pe cadendo . but probability ought to be observe in all thing that we need not inquire what be modern or ancient without be therefore break or over foul since stone much handle will become sinooth yet without damage and why shouldman be make judge of what be beautiful and fine who come from foreign and wild country and never see beauty in oppofition to true beauty let we now represent the other sort and leave the point to the determination of the judicious . chap xvii of thing deform and break falsely callpainterlike .hang the scene we shall now consider what be also though unjustly call painterlike and this in a imaginary way like the preced . in walking see large gate the door whereof be break to piece by an huge oak blow down against it creep through it find myself as in strange country so very rug desolate and rocky without path or road thatknow not where to walk the ground be no where so even as to reston heresee the fragment of column yet lie so obliquely that could not sit on it near it lay piece of frize and cornice with a end stick up and not much further be another stone pretty level but in morass abound withvermin nevertheless endeavour to get upon this last stone and then with my cloak under I lay myself down upon it which have no sooner do but somebody call 97hark ye go from it you lie in my way . not dream any person could be here suddenly look back in surprize and sawa young man sit on a hillock who as he say be draw after the stone lay on but on recollection he again call out that if would stay therebut half quarter of a hour fhould do he great favour this consentto not without afk he what he be go to do with such paltry fragment answer ee they be the finest thing in the world to introduce into our piece when have such fine parcel as that piece of column and this water before I with the addition of stump of tree and small dark offscape behind it they together immediately compose perfect ordonnance oh youcan not imagine how extraordinary and full of variety these object be this bethe finest place on earth for curious artist all be painterlike every thing lies so loose pretty and wild that few good master would refuse come hither to design these wonder and nothing but the present high wind hinder they behere now 92upon this prattle view he from top to toe he sit all in a heap with board in he lap and small inkhorn and magnifying or spectacleglaf in his hand on he head he have nightcapalmost down to he eye with he left leg over he hat poffibly to save it from the wind small light come from between the tree shone on he lap poor man think how feelingly you can talka of what be painterlike and what satisfaction you must find in those thing ifthere be any more artist of you stamp this must be the place to find they in . the truth be the more view he and hear he talk the more blame myown judgment for not discover such beauty as he do now perceive he have do go towards he to see he work but before could come up to hiin he have pack up he awl and be go another way behind the tree near the place where he have be sit find another spark who stand anddraw after small rivulet full of big and little clod of earth and pebble whichhe neatly design on draw paper aud mark with they different colour . he whole portfolio be full of suchlike painterlike trumpery such as muddywater decay and break stone piece of wood barren shrub and bushie rough grounds toads snake afk he what branch he make he study he answer that be have not yet practise any but hope if he could get allthose thing and perform they well to become good landscapepainter ee for say he those object be so uncommon that the best master give themselves the trouble to seek they but continue he can not but wonder that some search here and in other place and can scarce find piece to they go fbt nay often return without do any thing when on the contrary discover thousand thing both delightful and useful whenever cast my eye be to design every thing meet with should have work for many year look there sayhe yonder be one of that tribe pry about have not yet see he sit downany where think within myself that it be strange any man should run about in a error in so wild and desolate place . go on icame tobe 0 large and hideous rock split through and have one part hang forward full of sharp angles open hollow and cut overrun hereand there with mof and barren shrub on the right side be deep morassyvalley go off very steep and on the left appear a inaccessible ruinbuilding like a heap of stone swarming with adder snake and other venemous creature behind I the ground be so uneven full of up and downs and pathlef that think it impossible to get from the place on the point of return back isaw man creep on allfour out of one of the hole or hollowof the rock and there by clear passage for I this man tell I what will notderful thing be to be see on the other side but be scarce creep half through before hear frightful thunderclap which shook the wh f4 le rock wherefore redoubling my speed and be get through find that the top of the rock be tumble over the right side which make I suddenly retire fromthence fearful that another part might fall apon I what also raise my averfion be the sight of tomb crushied to piece and almost sunk into the ground and nearit lie piece of large trunk of white marble could perceive bythe base that it have be term and be curious to know what might be hide behind it igot on the tomb and see through the tree downwards frightful pool therefore take to the leave where think the ground was more level three or four stepsfrom thence sawa white paper fluttering before I along the ground and after it ablue one somewhat larger both which ran after and take up the blue paper appear to be draw after the aforesaid tomb when intire and stand which make I judge that he must have be good master who have thus improve it in the draught possibly think he be hereabouts my conjecture be not groundless for step little further find the poor wretchlie under large oak which have be thunderstrike the stem be cleft from top to bottom and large limb lay across the man92 body he portfolio lay near he empty of all he drawing this sight affrighted I and approach near hear he sigh he perceive I call outpresently for help clear the limb from off he body as well as could whereby and after much pain he disengaged himselfrom the leave he be to my wonder no where hurt save little in he left hand yet of no consequence . ireturn he he papers and afk he whether he have see the tomb in the condition wherein it be draw he answer he have when go to shew it to I he in amazement start back on find it in ruin oh say he dothis lie also tumble down and my draw scarce finishedl we then wend together further up towards the left and regain most of he papers he tell I that he companion have leave he and run away on the approach of the storm which induce I to think he be the person who come creep on allfour through the aforesaid hole . on we come down we find many already draw after the broken tree under which the good man have lain with the utmost application . it be they unanimous opinion never to have see tree more painterhe shew they he draw andthis talk surprise we both . like . say that the tomb be the only object he find intire thereabouts andthis be demolish there be nothing leave to please he but thisthey scoff at and answer he that such thing might easily be made out of one92 head or find in print . in short it be great diversion to I to see one as hotly clamber upone place and another creep through some hole for the sake of designthe rock and tomb tuinble down as if they be go after treasure . take leave of this person pursucd my way but be oblige for the sake of ruinous fountain the vase moulding and other ornamentwhereof lay across and stop the way to take to the right hand on the remains adorn with baf relief find not one intire figure everything be excessively moulder foul and overrun with wild plant andshrub it be bason lay awry with corner sunk into the ground break . and full of earth or mud boy who have be sit there come andafk I whether could not tell he which part of this heap of stonebe the most painterlike92te have be long make choice say he of something good out of it but the number confound I the part beall so broken that can not find so much as whole hand or foot have shew I he draw pitch upon this among they with muchado believe verily there be not such another undamaged bit in the whole ruin though of little consequence it be plinth with the right leg and foot of apollo want the great toe he say that he with eight other have be draw every thing after the heap except this fragment the foot of which be not accord to they fancy break enough comfort he with say that he have pick out the very best thing of all when he own that he have make the choice through the persuasion of another who be now go away to whom the leg by means of the sandal and strap be not unknown this boy think ought to be set in right way and he simplicity pleased I . turn then to the right hand as have say come into dismal place which by the largeness of the pavement and arch work supportby great pillar seem formerly to have be palace . it be here so lonesome and gastly that be seize with cold swcat wherefore mend my pace in order to get out of it and be get to the other side and ten or twelve pace from it find myself again atthe lake beforemention near which lay shattered tomb with the corpse half tumble out the head and one arm rest on large root of tree lie near it the lid be almost sly off and just on the totter and snake from underneath be creep into the tomb sight frightful enough . the sun now on the point of setting dart he refulgent ray between some heavy cloud the sky be moreover dark blue and on the horizon yellowishi stripe which along through the tree strongly glitter in myeye see grave man carefully design this sky in colour in passing by say to he ee sir you have meet with fine sight that be true stalian fky yes say he be very sensible of it . step further hear another thunderclap and the tempest increase which oblige he to pack up he tool and go off and make I resolve to be at home before night . now leave it to the judgment of the know and judicious lover to determine which of my two representation be to be account painterlike have sufficiently express my sentiment touch they . but itbe to b e9 lament that tyro in they youthful ardour be infectwith this poison and make to believe that in thunder and stormy weather they must run abroad to design such mischance and defect of nature at the hazard of they health and life though not able to chuse outof they the most beautiful for want of judgment to know what begood and by some addition to supply defect these thing be the pastime of great master but the chief study of the less know .. be therefore docible artift not so intent in gain you embellisnean have they by vrote sueh elde eh lidin prieehpildi inten doube than bring ye to certainty . in order then to qualify the judgment to make good choice recourse may always be have to the remains of those great master raphael poussin and many other to enlighten we by imitate they illustrious example . the end of the sixth book . he ara of taentng . book vi. of portraiture . embl e9 m touch the handling portrait . nature with she many breast be in sitting posture near she stand child lift she garment off she shoulder on her other side standtruth hold mirrour before she wherein she view herself down to the middle and be seemingly surprisedat it on the frame of this glass be see gill pallet andpencil trazh have book and palm branch in she hand . chap of portrait in general . since we meet with no presidence in the art nor pretend to insist on ceremony we shall treat of thing as they occur to us and as clearly and profitably as possible . but first give I leave to say that have often wonder how any man can prefer slavery to liberty and by depart from the essence of the artsubject of portraiture . subject himself to all the defect of nature speak of such great master as van dik lely lan loo the old and young bakker and other who though possess of great talent in the art postpone what be noble and beautiful for whatbe nore ordinary and common the truth be and we have see that sooner bythis mean than other man have obtain the honour of gold medal and chain nay the liberty of prescribe law to prince stare they in the face draw they picture and many other privileges whereby they have acquiregreat rich what a unheardof reward do not apelles receive when alexander give he he dear campaspe in order to save the life of that great artist by satisfvinghis love inslame by draw the picture of that beauty when consider these thing be surprised that all painter do not give in wholy to pertraiture since nowday money be prefer to learn lucre to virtue andhonour dispense to man in proportion to they rich but leave this subject we will proceed thoroughly to consider every thing relate to that branch of the art . as in music and sing good ear be requisite so in portraiture it be impossibleto excel without good eyc such a one mean as be govern by sedate andsober sensation and not by selflove or passion next be require regular design contain a exact proportion or division of the part not only of the face but of the whole body that the sitter may be know by he picture which may be most agreeably do by mixing the fafhion with what be painterlike as the great lely do and which be call the painterlike or antique manner but by the ignorant commonality the roman manner . next we must be thoroughly judicious in the graceful choice of the light andthe place where the person be to sit that the face may appear to the best advantageand then the body be to be dispose to the most natural and becoming posture . the next business and which give it the greatest lustre be the colour thateach person and he part may have they proper colour and such as appear inhe daily converse not such as proceed from extraordinary emotion let the artist beware of inelining to any particular manner like some whose work bethereby better know to be theirs than the friend of the sitter know the picture to be he . as for the choice of light in order to apply it most advantageously for the be ac nefit of either sex it be certainly matter of great moment since the fair sex commonly partake of more delicacy and grace than man so they must have light as beautiful and agreeable as they person . but ere we proceed further it will not be improper to look into the origin of portrait in order thereby to shewthe aim of those who cause themselves to be draw and the profit which master get thereby .the ancient use to cause those from whom the commonweal have receiveextraordinary benefit either in war or civil affair or for imminence in religion to be represent in marble or metal or in picture that the sight of they bythose honour might be spur to posterity to emulate the same virtue thishonour honour be first begin with they deity afterwards it be pay to heroes andof consequence to philosopher orator religious man and other not only to but nowperpetuate they virtue but also to embalm they name and memory . it go further person of any condition whatsoever have he but as much money as the painter afk must sit for he picture this be great abuse and sprung from as laudable cause . in nobleman indeed it be very commendable custom because be descended from great family the lustre of these ought to shine to encourage they successor to keep up they glory and to prevent sully it by unworthy action . as fore0 general or admiral who have die in the bed of honour gratitude think oblige we to raise monument to he glory and to animate brave souls in future time to immitate he virtue but what be this to the vulgar pride only spur they to it the rich do it that they child may boast of it the master of numerous family do it that the world may know he be father he who have fire magazine of the enemy must be draw with this great betion though perhaps tnere be no body to hinder he have citizen92 wife but a only babe he be draw at half year old at ten year old he sit again and for the last time in he twentyfifth year in order to shew she tender folly and then she stand wonder how man can so alter in that time be not thisweighty reason reproveable custom if painter do not gain by it but again portrait be allowable when lover be absent from he mistress that theymay send each other they picture to cherisn and increase they love man and wife so part may do the same . but to return to the original matter must warn the artist not to give in too much to what be common or humour ignorant people so much as not to beserve to themselves some liberty of do what they think proper for the sake of reputation surely this can not be strange advice for master who prefer moneybefore art have no more dangerous rock to split on since the ignorant multi ac tude usually insist to be draw accord to they own whim one say92toe0good master97te draw I thus or thus let I have one hand on my breast and the other on table 92 another must have flower in he hand or flowerpot must be by he another must have dog or other creature in he lap another will have he face turn this or that way and some who would be drawn in the roman manner must be set off by globe or clock on table whether such ornament be proper or not on mention the roman manner find thatit signify loose airy undress somewhat savouring of the mode but in no wiseagree with the ancient roman habit . but many other inconveniences attend portraiture as first the ignorance of those who sit for some of they have no right notion of they own mein andshape often refer the judgment of fine portrait to the eye of achild or servant and what they say monsieur and madam believe either to its praise or docommendation .second inconveniency arise from wedded inclination which any one have to fuch and such object judge as they like or dislike not only of picture but even the life itself for though they may be afraid to pass sentence one0 fine historyhiftory or landscape yet portrait must not escape they as think it within the reach of they capacity . thirdly we nnd many artist never pleased with other mens work but being full of themselves despise every thing they see though as good as they own andthis perhaps on no better bottom than pique against the artist92 conversation talk dress or money or else because of he greater fame and yet if ten person happen to applaud fine picture of this eyesore master they will at thatjuncture chime in with they to sereen they prejudice and on the contrary if but single person afterwards find fault they immediately turn the table againstten other again if apiece of they friend be bring on the carpet though never so faulty they will applaud and justify it at any rate though against their own conviction of conscience but this partial and prejudice humour be most prevailent in those who know least . fourth set of man be those who be always of a unealy temper dislike they own but applaud every thing other man do these indeed be not so noxiousas the former because they only hurt themselves whereas the other hurt every body . fifthly there be prejudice set of man who find no taste but in easv andgrave air and posture other in stir and hurry one other in violent one some think that women drapery ought to be loose and soft other willhave they of velvet or fattin or else partycoloured this think that dark or brown ground beft set off figure anether chuse landscape or green curtain right or wrong be thecolour beautifully choose the picture smell of they be they break they seem muddy and foui how can portait please so many opinion it be not like a history full of figure where we can introduce va riety of sedate and stir action more or less beautiful colour loose or set drapery dark or light grounds because this be but single figure . we businef then must be to find way between soylla and charybdis to enablethe artist to paint good portrait for he who make due reffexion on every thing can prepare himself to overcome the aforesaid difficulty . chap ii of the defect in the face and other part . he defect which be see in nature or in simple life be threefold . natural one . accidental one . useful one . the natural one be wry face fquint eye wry mouth nose . the accidental one be loss of a eye cut on the cheek or other part of the face pit of the small pox and the like . the92 usual one be those habitsitowhich we aecustom gurselve fromwe in ac faney to wit contraction of the eye and mouth or closing or gape of the latter or draw it in somewhat to this or that side upwards or downward . as forotherbodily infirmity how many have wry neck hunch back bandyleg wither or short arm or one shorter than the other dead or lame handor finger among these some be unavoidable and other may be either left out or handsomely hide the necessary one ought to be secn because theyhelp the likeness such as wry face squint eye low forehead thin andfatness wry neck too short or too long nose wrinkle between the eyeruddiness onpaleness of the cheek or lip pimple or wart about the mouth and such like among those which may be hide or leave out count blindeye wound wen mole pit of small pox too many pimple red blue oghairy spot as also habital usage such ashanging lip pinching or drawingsof the mouth and eye . ithink also that the common and useful dress of person be great addition telikenefs for no sooner be the dress alter but the look do the same andshew itselfeither more or lef pleasing and agreeable and there by the person become more tor lef know to obviate which advise the artist above all thing to get first true likeness of the face and paint it to the sitter92 satisfaction andthen he may freely manage all the rest as he think fit and there by get honour and commendation since the life itself in such dress can not any more alter . the painter should likewise discover andknow as much as possible the nature and temper of the person sit and in what circumstance lie he favourite pleasure that he may when sit be entertained with talk pleasing to he andhe air there by keep steady and serene and he posture natural and easy avoidevery thing tend towards sorrow or frightful relation for these be apt to rufflethe mind and so to discompose the face that it can not easily be get right again but if the sitter himself do by he talk difcover he own bend the painter ought to humour it to the last whether ifbe jocose or moderate without exaggerationor diminution yet with such variety as not to prove tiresome and make the face alter . he who can not thusmanage and furnish outa discourse will be the longer ere he hit the likeness some will even sit three or four time and each time withdifferent air and be they to sit ten time fancy something new would still offer .another hindrance may be that paintingroom be often hang with such sinuttybut picture as frequently put virgin to the bluss or alter they countenance . though for improvement fine picture be necessary to be always in view yet in paintingeroom there ought not to hang the wanton picture of mar and venus casch by vukan or dina92 bathing though do by van dyk or joseph andpotiphar 92 wife for though these may hang in corner yet when the eye hag once catch they it will retain they because theirideas make continal iinpreffion on ithe mind even against its will and therefore the bare remembrance of such thing must put young and chaste virgin to the blush must it aot create longinglonging to see picture of two beggarboy fall greedily on ripe fruit the one eagerly biting piece of fresh melon and the other bunch of grape with the juice fall down he chin on he naked breast the room then should be hung with every thing modest as fine landscape and flowerpiece which will amuse the sight without disturbing or tire the mind or alter the countenance fine portrait will also animatebe 0 sitter to keep he serene and make he emulous of they air large lookglais may be likewise of service if so hang thatthe sitter can see himself in it for there by discover any disagreeableness in his look he will correct himself in order to have as good a air as he desire and by such method as these painter may become great . we will now proceed to consider how many mistake some painter commit in relation to the first observation of natural defect these endeavour to they utmost power to express punctually the deformity and defect of face without scruple to wit blind or squint eye or the like though they know that it be an enemy to grace and on no other ground than false belief that it create greater likeness but who love to be reproach with he defect when they can be artwhat would become of grace which teach that painterfully hide should make as beautiful choice as possible which these blemisn obscure think therefore that we can not lay too great stref on what concern the make position and turn of face that the eye be not offend with blemisn or deformity or the posture look disagreeable . how monstrous be the picture of certain admiral who seem to stab himselfwith he staff of command and have defective eye turn directly to the light because accord to the saying he be best know by it would notmore pro file view have suite he better or to have flung the side with the blind eye into fhade would it not be ridiculous to paint the duke of luxemburgh in profile to represent he the better and that he hunchback might be the more vifible forno other reason than that most people know he have one nature abhor deformity and we can not behold it without aversion and quick turn of the eye from it squinteye person can not see himself in the glasswithout inward trouble especially one of the fair sex who in other respects tolerably handsome can not bear to see a instance of she deformity in another but will basfifully look off or down to the ground how much worie then mustit look in picture the life may be sometimes see on a handsome side whichin a ill choose picture we can never expect whence it be natural for one who has blemish or defect in a eye or cheek always to turn the best side to the lightin short we do not desire to do any thing walk stand fit talk but with become air have we fore eye we hide they under we hat or if lame hip we endeavour to walk briskly have we fome humour or pimple in cheek we either hide they with patch or paint the other side like it have we bad tooth we keep the mouth shut ora lame hand and hide it not under we coat or in we pocket if nature act so how can such defect please in picture such flattery then as be agreeable to art be not only aflowable but commendable especially when the sitter be so dispose in posture that the painter himfelf can not perceive it . alke any one wha wear piece of black silk over a hollow eye whether he defire to be draun from that fide believe not aperson with wooden leg carenot that the deformity should appear in picture such a one ought to be drawn in half length only but if the heroe insist upon the introduce such leg on supposition that be a honour to have lose limb in he country service the painter must then comply with he defire or else contrive it lie on table cover with red velvet if he desire it after the antique manner it must be contrive in bas relief wherein the occasion of it may be represent or it may hang near he on wall with its buckle and strap as be do in hunt equi ac page or else it may be place among the ornament of architecture to be more in view but what praise or advantage will a artist get by this when judiciousmaster see the picture he may perhaps plead in excuse that the sitter wouldhave it of this indeed can not argue against because we usually say to whom we employ do as would have you right or wrong we have a instance of gentleman who be draw in little and compare the smallness of the eyes with he own afk the painter whether he have such however in compliance and for he pleasure he desire that one eye at least might be as big as his own the other to remain as it be sad case miserable subjection for though we can not compell other to be of we opinion yet pity those who must fubmit to incongruity but not to dishearten the artist too much we will proceed to chap iii the observable in portrait particularly that ofwoman .elfconceit and selflove seem nathral to all but especially to the female sex who whether they picture be draw on they own account or thro92the desire of other imagine they deserve such homage nor stop it here foralthough they may possess tolerable share of beauty yet that be not satisfactoryenough they must be flatter and they picture paint in the most beautiful light and unhappy be the painter who abate but half drachm of such beauty . for these reason the master beoblige to have principal regard to light andcolour but to the light chiefly since it be well know that nothing give greater offence to ignorant people than shade and still more when they be strong andbroad they believe they speak to the purpose in object well how can it be possible that my neck and cheek should have such large shade when idaily consult my glass and find my skin all of colour and white and92then the painterbe blame but be not such reason weak and absurd since ifa man how tenacious soever meet another who by long absence and alteration of dress be get out of he memory he will naturally turn he tothe light in order to know he and he feature this conduct have be wonderfully observe by barocci inhis he pictureof mary pay visit t elizabrth twhen big withchild inwhich by he methodof place the figure and the ataegtion of the face we seem tot hear they talk look earnestly at each other . think those master have make the best choice who have choose frontlighto and there by keep . they colour most natural and beautiful since thiglight be certainly most advantageous whether the picture hangagainst wall or whereelse . but here seem toarise . difficulty since we formerly say that we ought to fix certain place and the point of sight and distance and to dispose the light so as it can fall on that place towhich the answer be easy porfrait have no fixplace as we shall further shew in another chapter as also how far andon what . occasion we mustconfine ourselves to that rule . the best way to settle thispoint be to follow those who have choose theylight almost front and as before say such colour as naturally appear to the eye besides good choice since think the case of place portrait the bethesame as that of curious china which whether it stand high or low shewitselfevery where beautiful my reason for this be that object which have such . frontlight have a exceed fine effect and great relief when they come against dark ground and still finer when the light fall on they somewhat from on high if thasitter and some accident do not hinder it in whigh case reason and we eye must bestdirect we viewjbut this fineness in asposture paintlean over a hatch or out at window and what great decorum thetouch and shade about the most relieved part cause in such a object as leonardo do vinci have well observe . of the accident which just now speak off shall mention two or three some person may be toa long and sharpmose or too hollowrey for such low light be most proper but where it be otherwise a high light in this manner judicious master ought to help the defect of 92nature without add to or ta king any thing from they yet to the sorrowof impartial master the contraty . be too much see for as have say that historypainter chuse and follow whatthey have the greatest inclination for so it be with many portraitpainter their work be better know by they particular manner than the sitter by he picture . permit I here to make comparison between those two great master titian and van dyk with respect to the judgment have hear make on they work . of the latter it be say that in the delign grace and choice of portraitfigure he be the most skilful nevertheless have see many of titian 92 who in mostmens opinion have the greater reputation which scem to I incomparable though less agrecable here my position about the particular choice of master take effect again because think that the defect in agreeableness be peculiar to titian92 country and limit he choice and therefore he be the lef culpabl e9 when on the contrary we region prefer what be gay and elegant before the .majestic and grave and likeness be the chief object both of the sitter and the .artist every thing else be look on as by work and ornament poor judgment methink of people of sense for if portrait have not besides likeness an agrceable disposition the little knowledge of the master will presently appear . it be true that we meet with many odd face in the life especially among vulgar gar and clovnisn people yet fay that be they ever so rude agrecablenessshould be observe in they picture by agreeableness understand the dispofition of posture in general as when the face have a advantageous turn more or lef totthe light up or down in order to create handsome shade and to shun unbecoming one for every face require particular observation one a high light another low one this sidelight that a almost front one speak not yet of many other requifite such as the sway of the neck shoulderor breaft or of proper background all which consideration be essential to fine portraft as well in refpect tothe naturaluess and colour ae0s to the motion but ef the light and backgrounds we shall say more in the next chapter andnow return to we comparifon some think that van dyk s 92 painting be but watercolour compare with titian92 whose picture have so much force in colouring fight and fhade that those of the other can not stand in competition withthey nay that he colour be inimitable and whereby that of van dyk appear faint and weak ridiculous opinion indeed however that van dyk andjitian differ much in colour allow but neverthelefs think that we neednot run to the italian to prove it since if the stress lay in strong colour only rembrant need not give way to trtian but whence arise the mistake most man chime in with thofe simple judge who approve no history landscape or portrait that be not paint in the jralian manner my opinion be that the whole of the matter laefe more in the difference of climate than in the handlings of the master for let a englifhman92 picture hang near a stalian92 bothhandle with equal fkill and each represent accord to he hue and nature there will appear great difference between they the sweetn softness of the englihman will charm as much on onc hand as the strong and glow colout of the italian on the other on which of these two picture have the master bestow the most pain be not both praiseworthy as have each express the character natural to he figure but not to go abroad for comparison with respect to particular clime our own netherland afford difference enough two brother of the same parent are bear in the same town and hour one of they be bring up to the sword andendure all the fatigue of war and the incommodity of hailx snow wind rain sun smoak of saltpetre whereby he complexion be alter and becomes swarthy the other brother contrarily be educated in saloon sine apartmentand tender conversation by which mean time can not so much affect he each sit for he picture toe0 feparate and good master now these two pictur eg being bring together will the painter be censure for the difference of tint and feature or will it be object that nature have not be rightly follow or thatthe picture be not like a impartial judge will determine that both be good and natural and that each master have duly mix art with nature . have discover great oversight in some artist which be that when the face be finish they have no further regard to the life but choose posture atpleafure out of drawing or print without consider whether it suite the person and whether the dress be proper to the condition and countenance of the sitter nay whether the head match the hody certainly great heedlessness forfor if body must be add what more proper than the life itself and though many disrethe layman be good and helpful yet it be not equal to the life . gard this thinking they have do enough in hit the face but all the whilethey be preposterousty join a airy drapery to sedate and grave head and grave and stiff dress to merry face but further the hand be entirely neglected if pair of fine one can be get of some other master these be make use of without regard to the life which may perhaps have short thick and coarse hand how can these thing agree be it not almost the same as to dress flora 97 we have the with the drapery of vesta and vesta with flora92 artist say print of van dyk lely kneller and other for fine example and as lely has follow van dyk in graceful action and drapery so we have liberty to immitate he and other which willingly agree but then we ought to do it on the same foot as he do in he posture he have not merely and without alteration follow van dyk and still less without judgment as may be see in his of . two celebrate picture of nell gzuynn and thethe one wanton and buxom lady he have so represent and the other be widow and more sedate appear more modest . by this rule we must walk in the use of those great master but if thing be do without make distinction of person and they condition the artist willwork to he dishonour he who steal thus may indeed callthe work he own without reproach none will object as michael angelo do once to painter who practise it to excesswhat will become of you picture at doomsaay when the part shall return to they ozen whole see you work be make up of steal piecee0moreover in this theft we ought well to observe how master best applyevery thing with respect to youth and age as well in posture as drapery andbyornament what suit a alderman or heroe merchant or citizen nobleman or plebean hereby we shall discover the aim of the great master in thus manage these particular and learn to immitate they beauty in sweet and agreeable manner . chap iv of the choice of light drapery and grounds in portraitand of the point of sight . the precede chapter we have lay down as rule that frontlight bethe best to be choose and the most beautiful especially in the fair sex andthink it the more necessary when the face itself be also choose in front becausethen the greatest force will fall directly upon the most rise or relieved part but shall now subjoin that since the life however we dispose it either from or near the light front or in profile yet support itself though the light be not advantageously choose which portrait can not do we therefore must need in order to make it appear as it ought to be accommodate the light to the dispo ac sition of the face for instance when the face turn somewhat sideways the lightmust be adapt to it when it be quite in profile sidelight will be best becausecause then great maf of light remain together to wit in the forehead noseand cheek which be not break by any groundshade but united by the roundness which shew we how to represent rise nature and cause becoming relief . we see that many without difference be the figure in full proportion or in little give the touch under the nose so black and dark that it seem as if black beetle be proceed thence whereas it be certain and nature teach it that when the light fall strong on the nose the nostril and they groundshadecan never appear so black and yet some think they have do great feat in using force and strength and will do it even in fair and tender face and no bigger than the palm of the hand although the deepest black should not have force enough to shade the other object ofe0 darker colour such as hair cloak or other garment by which sort of management the face seem to jump out of the frame and to desert the wig hair and garment we must not so understand when we teach that the face must have the main light we mean only that allought to keep due order that it may look natural each colour of the bywork ought accord to its lightness or darkness to have its moderate shade and dark touch as the matter it consist of be either solid or thin and transpa ac rent and in proportion as the object lessen so must the force of they colourdiminish as shall be further illustrate inthe follow chapter to which for brevity we refer we see a excellent example of this management in the fa mous netscher92 artful portrait wherein he have judicioussy handle the darkest shade and mainlighttouch accord to the natural force of the colour .for the better understanding of further observable have find it proper to mention some other particular concern the disposition of light accord to occasion consist in light against dark and the contrary and though everything thereby become relieved and be set off yet that be not sufficient for the place of colour against each other on suitable grounds and contrast in the object whether moveable or immoveable be of great consequence and decorum and although we have handle these thing at large in the book of colour yetwe find it necessary to recapitulate they here with respect to portrait and the retire grounds or visto behind they . observe then whether fair and beautiful face will become light grey or lightifh blue ground and whether warm complexion and strong colour against glow or yellowisn ground will please the eye speak of the face not the drapery though both together make portrait but let the fair and beautiful face of woman be place against warm ground and then the light part will not only be there by flung off and look more agreeable but the shade will also be soften and appear more tender for it be unnatural to force fair and tender virgin who shew little or no motion out of she seem apartmentas some by they glow shade and reflexion have endeavour to do whereby they face on the shade side look as if light candle stand behindthey which penetrate they skin this be as unnatural in the open air as within door . this example of woman be enough to prove the contrary conduct with respect to man92 face accord to the aforesaid rule touch the disposition and place of colour on suitable grounds namely that the strong ought to be paint against the weak and the weak against the glow and strong wherein be also comprehend light against dark and dark against light . whence it be evident that backgrounds contribute very much to the charming grace of object nay dare say that the decorum mostly depend thereon and though many imagine that dark or black ground always become portrait yet it be no rule since as before have be say each individual colour of the object require particular background besides if such thing be to be take for rule the art would smell too much of a handicraft for darkcolour against dark ground can have no good effect and that of white or pale against it will be too hard therefore medium must be judicioussy observe in both that one colour may suit with the other in the drapery the conduct bethe same one person best become light and another dark cloath blue suitone and red yellow or green another the artist must then take care not to force nature but help she as much as posfible and represent she always most beautiful . if any one would know my reason for think that many error arise in thispart of the art it be that the colour of the naked receive more or less or too much force by the bycolour of grounds and backornament it fare withthey as it be say of the camelion who change he colour as often as he be pla ac ced by different colour though this be occasion by he elegant and shinescale when contrarily the human skin be dull and not shine however we shall find that he who paint portrait twice and each time on contraryground yet with the same temperament of colour will perceive very great nay incredible difference as have on several occasion experiment in the life to wit that when some virgin be in room hang with yellow they looked sickly and grey notwithstanding they fresh colour but contrarily be in room hang with violet they colour shew themselves very beautiful whence it appear that the alteration be oftentime occasion by the adjacent object . let he who doubt this make trial of it in portrait by lay ground with watercolour on paper and after the face be cut out place it against the picture instead of background but think there be convenient way of preventing the aforesaid alteration namely by fix against the wall behind the sitter garment cloth or something else of the same colour or near it whichwe chuse for we background thus we may be sure of hit the right colour and make the painting look agreeable . in order to represent a extensive background and chiesly in small picture be it a apartment or landscape some shadiness should be contrive between the figure and the distance as column curtain body of tree vase theseobject be in shade or of dark colour the light fall on the offworkwill not prejudice either the face or drapery though both be light but on the contrary the figure as receive the foremost and greatest light will there by be relieved and look more agreeable . as for the drapery fince they confift of different and various colour each of particular nature and littie agree with the colour of the face they alsorequire eache0 particular ground beft suit and uniting with it to the end that though differ among themselves they may have perfect harmony witheach other so that the eye be not take alone with the face or the drapery ornament or bywork but by this sweet conjunction insenfibly conduct all over the picture . it will not be improper to treat also about easiness and sedateness in posture oppose to stir and bustle and the contrary namely that the picture of gentlewoman of repute who in grave and sedate manner turn towards that of she husband hang near it get great decorum by move and stir hindwork whether by means of wave tree or cross architecture of ftone or wood or any thing else that the master think will best contrast or oppose the sedate posture of he principal figure and because these be thing of consequence and may not be plainly apprehend by every one shall explain myfelf by example in plate lvii touch the elegance and harmony of backgrounds with the figure . in no reprefent beautiful face against the light of the ground andthe drapery which be white or of light colour against the dark of it theseoppofition thus meet produce sweet mixture above and below a agreeablerelief or rise of the under part of the body whereas be it otherwise the face as but small part of the body would look too fharp and disagreeable and the under part of the body would have no force . in no be the portrait of man of more warm and swarthy complexion we see the reverse of the former because he colour and that of he dress are of different nature yet the ground be very ornamental and each set off the no shew man with drunken face of red purple and violet and somewhat brown and darkisn which be set off by white marble or light stone ground and give it fine air . in no be a example of the contrast in offwork with the drapery of the figure shew the opposition of moveable object with fix one for herein be see round and cross fold against straight and parallel offwork and in no appear the reverse where the fold hang straight and mostly dovnward and the offwork crof they . no give we a example of the oppose action and posture of body in twofellowportrait for the man be on the woman92 right side turn he face sideways towards she he body be front receive the light from the right side . in ne we see the contrary in the woman92 posture she face be foreright and she body sway sideways towards the man she also be light from the right side . the figure number and represent also yet in different manner the contrast in the motion for the woman stand on the right side of the man has have sedate motion and set and hanging shoulder but the man contrarily bein active motion and no shew proper method to exhibit great extent or seemingly such in small piece for the figure stand in strong light the byornament viz.curtain vase pillar and walling be in shade and the offscape or hindwork belight again but somewhat break by reason of its distance . to conclude this chapter ishall say something of the place of portrait and of they point of sight . as to the former it be certain that when we see any paint figure or object inplace where the life can be expect as stand on the ground lean overbalcony or ballustrade or out at window it deceive the eye and by being see unaware cause sometimes pleasing mistake as it frighten and surpriseother when they meet with it unexpectedly at such place as aforesaid andwhere there be likelihood for it if we be thus misl by representation of nature how great must the master be who do it the know esteem he ignorant cry he up if this be the case we ought to endeavour to follow nature and likelihood and principally to observe the rule of perspective for who candoubt that stand sit or move figure artfully paint and place as aforesaid will not have the same effect as the life itself hence it follow that low horizon or point of sight be the best and most . natural in portrait and will most deceive the sense if the light and distance with respect to the place where the picture be to be set be well observe otherwise the effect will be contrary to what we expect . this conduct be chiesly necessary in portrait hang high for be so muchabove the eye they must need have low horizon but as portrait be moveable how natural and like soever they be and well handle if they hang not in . proper place they will not have good effect hence the mischief attend they . be that by continually change they place they can not always be paintto certain height and distance and consequently baffle we rule difficultywhich the greatest master must struggle with and this branch of the art is liable to . have now shew that low horizon and point ofsight be best and most totural as supply in some measure this inconveniency how much must theymistake who always chuse anhigh horizon they be on level with the sitter and yet place the horizon manyfeet higher nay they think those who do otherwise act against nature and art some will have two point of sight in one piece one for the figure another for the ornament one level with the eye and the other for the offscape one hand higher or lower at pleasure or about three or four finger breadth above the middle although these be inexcusable error yetthink it vain to attempt they redress but hope the judicious artist will weigh what ihave say and endeavour to avoid they . chap of portrait in little . there be many thing as have formerly shew which if we will have they transport the sense by they natural representation we must always exhibit in they natural proportion and force of colour but in portrait it beotherwise for this may as well be do in little as in full proportion providethe diminution be well observe and besides it have some relation to historical management we could say the same of little flower compare with greatone for if it be coloured in proportion to its distance and diminution itwouldbe in the same case with portrait in little but it be nevertheless certain that in festoon garland flowerpot in nich group of flower serve for ornament of chamber little slower be of small account nay never see wove or embroider in any stuff whence some may be induce to think that portrait in little as big as the palm92 of the hand have as little property in square against the wall especially when it receive its light from without the frame andbe handle with as much force as the life itself which with respect to force ial low nevertheless small portrait may in order to make it look more natural be more easily help than small flower place against door window or other flat which in my opinion can in no wise be make good but small portrait may as shall prove in what follow in order to which the artist must previouslyconsider . first how much the life in proportion diminish and consequently how faint it must be . secondly that the picture can not receive it be light from without the frame as be too far from it . here perhaps it may be afk whether portrait of lady or gentleman lean out at window in the manner of old mieris mezzu vonder neer andother would not be good and natural say yes but then the window must also go back for as it would be difficult to represent itsgo back fromthe frame since no object whether ceilingor sloor be between they in order to create distance and make the picture fall back something may be intro duce in full proportion to shew the depth and distance accord to the difference to be see in the follow instance in plate lviii . in no we see common fault in the figure lean on aframe in this therebe no other way to make the figure go baek than by take away the frame and although no shew itself within the frame yet it would be to no purpose do we not assign sufficient large breadth or thickness to the frame for in such case we must not regard a hand92 breadth of cloth whereon to repiresent something in full proportion as a orange flute book yet no shew good method and in my judgment the best and most natural . remember : remember amongst the painting of certain lover to have see one of doctor with a urinal in he hand thrust he arm out at window so that the shade of it and the glitter of the water plainly appear on the sill of the window .next the window maidservant be see stand at the door speak to woman in the street with child in she arin some other figure appear in the front of the picture see to the shoulder only as if stand in the street on the sill of the window be lie bottom of blue worst stick with needle also pair of sciffor piece of dark blue cloth and thimble all in full pro ac portion to be short this picture be by a artist with the owner92 leave sentence to be dock in order to which he draw square chalkline round the window which contain the doctor and cut away all the rest round about it hit here a head there a arm without sparing any body but the doctor who be instantly put into smaller frame thus the piece be half cut away and for noother reason as the artist pretend than that the doctor alone was sufficient to satisfy the eye the rest be superfluous wretch fate for so good alpicture but some painter will keep the old road because it be difficult to correct root evil they do as the old woman do who be exhort inshe last sickness to embrace the true faith answer can she would follow the steps of she forefather be they all go to the devil it be with portrait in little which have nothing of nature but the feature and look like puppet whereas there be wellknow method to make it appear as big as the life nay to move and speak as may say but be slighted the figure seem immoveable dumb and little and therefore unnatural . on this foot imean to shew that all thing may be naturally representin little except moonlight which baffle all we fkill . now if it be afk whether too nice a expression of part in small portrait would not be superfluous and unnatural with respect to distance and whether lessfinish would not be better say no provide it be not so strong and warm as the life for the figure not be exhibit in open field it can not have so much mistiness and vapour about it and therefore the neat pencil can not be obstructive especially if manage with sxill as the principal part well touch and the tender and melt smallness in the broad part the same so that at the proper distance the one be see more and the other less . here may arise another question whether such picture be not of the same nature with what be see through prospectiveglass since every thing appear so plain elaborate and neate0 but answer that they be not nor can becausethe glaf exhibit the life without the interpofition or mistiness or vapour andwith strong and warm shade which overcome its smallness . have often wonder at such small painting because they seem as if was look in nuremb lookglass or through prospective since they appearnot like the life but little moving puppet . now another difficulty be that since such painting can not accord to our position be make good without the addition of some byornament as imagery inwhole or half figure vinebranch about the frame or something lie on it in order to fling they off it would be hard for those who can only paint whole or half half length figure and aim at nothing else than to become master therein whereas he who be better verse may by due observance of what have be say easilyovercome the beforemention difficulty . chap vi of the application of requisite with respect to the different condition of person . will not be foreign to we main design to put the artist in mind of the appli ac cation and right use of such material as may enrich portrait and make itlook the more noble this be so great point in portraiture that when wellknow we need never be atbe 0 stand through the mishape or defect we often meet with in the disposition of portrait and which sometimes must not be hide since we have often mean enough for obviat they with seem reason andwithout fore nature as long and narrow face may be help by hood or other headdress thick and too round face by the contrary figure too lonesome may be embellish with pillar pedestal slowerpot table and suchthing as be proper to it which serve nor only for ornament and grandeur but also to express the sitter92 lustre and virtue but care must be take that the figure of the sitter as the principal object of the piece sill up the major part of it eitherby spread sway of the posture or by the addition of some proper bywork by which mean it will have good effect . since it be certainthat the vice as well as virtue have two powerful quality and though contrary to each other yet both tend to good purpose nay wickperson may by virtuous example be rescue from evil and virtuous person through bad example lead into error and ruin but virtue be join to virtue fear no evil contrarily the evil will make we avoid evil so pictureshould create a ardour for virtue and especially those of religious and good person since this as we have say in chap give the first rise to they representation in order to perpetuate they memory as well as they virtue and glorious action . to come then the better to this excellent point let we by noble bywork make they with they person in conspicuous manner wherefore shall lay downsome example though draw from heathen story . among the heathen some be so virtuously endow that they need not yieldto christanity itself lucretia and penelope in chastity cato in steadiness and courage and many other whom we shall for brevity omit to pass to the sketchchamber or other apartment and a example of chaste virgin shall be that of lucretia it be say to she honour that she be descend of noble family and so virtuously educated that she delighted only in that now whether we represent represent she living or dead in that character we may adorn she apartment with sine tapestry statue and picture in the picture the history of penelope at work the fable of cronis and neprune some modest emblem of god all relate to chastity and honour it statue or houschold goods be necessary let they be pallas diana hymen and especially vesta she bed may be ornament with chastity and stedfastness and on she couch may be see some cupid lightingeach other torch or play with palmbranch and oliveleave the apartment may be here and there furnissied with gold and silver vase cup and other houseplate wring with virtuous signification but herein care must be taken not to introduce any thing foreign to the matter or against history which ought to be consult . the handling this example may sufficiently usher in the method of treatother such as of julius casar augustus marcus aurelius crasus solon seneca and contrarily the story of sardanapalus semiramis faustina phalaris . as for cruel prince or tyrant either in he court apartment or other place even in he revel each require its proper embellishinent the apartmentmay be adorn with painting of all sort of punishiment and cruelty drawn from the blackest part of history together with those who cause they to be inflict if it be nero let all or some of the cruelty of he bloody reign be paint and he quality with emblem in marble bas relicf he statue be deity or household god as mar and mege 6 ra he himself may be represent on pedestal with thunder in he hand the world under he foot and the roman senatorbow and kneel before he fetter like slave he drinking equipage may be ornament with noxious animal as ferpent adder and the like he chair or seat with tyger lyon and dragon wring in silver gold and ivory hethrone may be support by jupiter juno neptune and pluto the floor curiouslyand richly inlaid with celestial sphere of lapis lazuli and the meteor andconstellation wring in bright gold the censer may smoak in all corner of the apartment but chiesly about he statue if the scene lie in he dining room the household god may be see throw down in all corner especially the simulacrum of roma with its head break off and lie near it jupiter apollo and vesta be principal in this companv in fine every thing that can denote wickman or monster art must exhibit the same character should also appear in the action look and dress of he retinue or guard for we usually say et like master like man . but not to dwell too long with prince we shall also speak of other character and shew what suit they . with burgomaster suit the statue of justice and in painting or hanging some emblem of it represent the reward of the good and punishment of the bad the fasce or rod and be be the true take of consul or burgomaster . with senator agree the statue of policy or government and in painting or hanging some representation of the law besides prudence and care for the state . with secretary the statue of harpocrate and in tapestry or bas relief the story of alexander shut hephestien92 mouth with92 sealring also the emblem of fidelity or goose with stone in its bill . with with director governor of the eastidia company the figure or statue of it to wit a heroine with scollop of mother of pearl on she head in the nature of a helmet and thereon coral branch breast ornament of scale pearl andcoral about she neck bulkin on she leg withtwo dolphin conjoin head to head adorn with se9 a shell two large thell oh she shoulderbe 0 trident in her hand and she cloath long mantle landscape behind she of a indian propect with palm and cocoatree some figureof black and elephant92tooththis figure also suit a admiral or commander at sea when sea fight be introduce instead of landscape .withe divine agree the statue of truth represent in christianlike manner or else this same emblem in one of he hand and he other on he breast besides tapestry baf relief or painting and some christian emblem of the true faith and representatinn of the old and new testament and in the offscape temple . with philosopher celestial globe the statue of nature and representationof the four element . general should have white staff in he hand and the figure of mar in niche if landscape be see trophy may be reared with victory sit on it he may have hercule fore0 statue . with a sea insurer suit arion on dolphin and in picturebe 0 seahaven with ship under sail making towards be on the shore the nigure of forlune and over the cargoe castor and pollux . with steersman suit the figure of precaution besides compass and in picture the four cardinal point . with a engineer the figure of industry besides map of militaryarchitecture . with a orator or speaker the figure of elequence or mercury without his purse and besides he roll of papers in the offscape person mount on stone and surround with a attentive audience . with virtuous young man the figure of virtue and on wall horace92 emblem of the young man in the stadium or course or else the young hercule standing between virtue and vice . some thingsare also proper to woman to betoken they virtue and quality . as by a imminent woman for reputationthe statue of honour and by it some emblem of fidelity especially oeconomy or family government and some medals relate thereto .with widow agree well the figure of humility or emblem tend towards . as also perseverance . it with young and sober virgin suit the figure of neatness a embroiderframe and its furniture besides emblem relate to it among which that ofbusiness shun idlenef pride and gluttony have principal place . chap vii of the sait of colour in draperiex . he92 suit of colour inportrait can ffme now before wee0 matten of as great ionsequence as the former and deserve no less attention . many think though without ground that deep red best become redfaceperson deep yellow fallow one and all pale colour pale one and what bestrange black and dark colour swarthy persou but this must be rediculousand without reason if we confider what strange erdonnance thefe people wouldmake truly if the art be so there would be no difficulty in finding agreeablenef and every one would be able to dispose it as it obght to be and if thisbe becomingness variety would be no art nay the fafhiion itself whichalter four time year with respect to colour would not be allow every body to wear as in fpring green in summer yellow in autumn red and in winter fillemot yellow or fallowface person durst not wear red or redface one green but enongh of this let we now return to what sober art dictate . begin with the head and it be hair say that deep or strong colour suchas deep red deep yellow deep blue best fit person who have brown hair . those who have fair hair beft become half or weak colour such as purple lightblue violet green and rosecolour .yellowhair person best become violet blue and whitissi yellow as masticot and92 such like these be the chief colour which know but here we must observe that the lighter the hair the more weak the drapery and the darker the hair the stronger the dref . he be prudent master who well know how to express in he picture the different naturez and complexion of people and to distinguish person full of fpirit and fire from the meek and deadheart the sickly and weak from the healthyand strong as to whom we may use drapery of the follow colour with the red or firey fuit best drapery of half or break colour with little red in they the pale suit no yellow or other pale colour the fallow the same but white bevery agreeable brown complexion become not dark or strong but white andall light colour the black love white above any colour and think no dressbetter beconse they than light coloured one and not without reason for would not black man with black or dark cloath be frightful to look at andhow ridiculous it be for pale virgin to dress in all sort of light and pa efecolour in order to look less pale and that one who be red wear nothing bat red for the same re e2son hereby mstead ofhid small fault the mafter would commit greater and yet this be the common notion but if may give my opinion red and fiery face person dress in red seem to I like red paint statue and pale look person in light or yellow dress as sick or dead wherefore if we would be artful we must manage otherwise to wit that those whom we wouldwould represent healthy or fickly ought to appear such by contrary colour as lively colour for sick or unhealthy person and weak and faintonesfora healthyperson yet let I not be here misunderstood say not this as positive jlaw without exception but as a hint to tyro the more experienced know whatthe art teach for she be not deficient but as the drapery sometimes overrule so we can manage the naked accordingly for instancc red drapery require middle carnation between pale and red so also it ought to be with pale tcolour when say the decorum consist in a opposition it must be understand tghat oppofition have its degree which we ought to know and use accord to tghe different occafion and 92 the groundsagainst which they happen to come but in general term the naked must always seem to be of distinct nature from the drapery . ich ap viiiof the fnitation of great master in painting portrait . and of copy they picture in general . re twe leave the subject of portraiture tthink tliis head necessary to be treat of and therefore shall shew how far and in what mannery we may engage in it and subjoin somewhat of copy picture in the same bigness as rwell as in diff e8rent flze . find that this imitation of master be less observe in they design and ordonnance than in the colour light and shade this be certainly principal point tin aepicture because there can be no decorum without it nay we find some work of smadll master in this particular tolerably successful though theyknow rmot how they getthe ikrmwledge it happen mostly by chance they are oharm with92 some fineand take colour in this or that great master these theyuse atrandom in they own production either forward or in thedepth middlea side hand iftthey happen to be pace against proper ground or be set off byany aid bycolour the work hit right in satisfy both the eye and rules of art but if these fine colour happen to suit the grounds then all be wrong andthe artist at stand .. to explain this point we shall be more particular and clear it by example though lthink ihave already in this hook speak largely enough of it in treatof backgrounds and the harmony of colour in portrait certain artist havesee very beautiful white and green lace on young lady 92 gown paint by great master he must by all means imitate it but be afk whether he had take due notice of the groundcolour of the gown phe answer no how then oan this finetand became lace have good effect in hiswork unless by chance the roafon of swhich be think thateither throughsshame orepride or both the fartist takes92 something from great master for instance what he use in the lointain the other that it may not be know bring forward and what he have represent iin the open air the other contrive in dark rogm poor method of concealment since by right application the theft wquld be lawfull but it be such mens misfortune to be in this particular mostiout of the way when they think theydo best for want the great master 92 wit judgment and apprehension theyhave no true notion of he conduct and therefore be easily msle like asop92ravan cxpose to censuresince it be a undoubted truth that we can perform nothing but what passthrough think and of which cither by fee or hearing we get a idea therefore must the painting drawing and fine print of old master give an handle to thought and practice for he who never see lion can never paint hewell unless by the help of draught or model as be the case of certam westphalian who represent daniel in the lion92 den and have never see lion he paint hog instead of lion and write underneath these should be lion be this fable or truth it however teach we that we can not represent any thing whereof we have no idea nay if we have see the object and make no sketches or model of they we shall never exhibit they naturally since memory be but the repofitory of knowlege and thought from which they draw the thing which judgment esteem useful and servigeable . be of opinion that two great advantage arise from copy great masterwork the one be that therein we see many defect of simple nature correct bythey skill and judgment ande9 he other that by this mean we accustom ourselves to rectify those defect when we have nature before afb truly two point of great importance . but alas be a artist consider in he natural inclnation otherwise than child which advancing in age follow its impulsebe 0 if he perform one praiseworthy act how many error will he contrarily commitp but when this bent beconduct by reason and art the perception of the mind will then as through clear channel flow pure and undefiled which lead I in some measure to con ac fess that art and practice have great advantage and be more to be set by than all we receive from nature which be often defective in desire perfection in single object but she be perfect in she performance and object in general and in that sense art be oblige to followshe wherefore with the philosopher must say of artist natura incipit ar dirigit experientia docet . that be nature point out the way which art improve and settle practice make picture move . hence we may easily perceive what we should do to cure this great defect of tke misuse of other mens work but that may be the better understand ishall insist on further means for do it if then it happen that the artist meet withany thing which be very take and he be desirous to make it he own whether fine colour drapery stone let he take note in he pocketbook of the ground ground bycolour and other incident as what there be about such or such colour and against what ground and whether it be strong or weak and of what colour the object be and wherherjthe warm or weak colour be in the distance or forward disagreeing or not as in the chapter of the harmony of colour be shewed we must also consider whether thelight come from open air or fall into room through glass window as be more largely teach in the book of lightand shade and which repeatihere becquse think facepainter fr e8quently act contrarily in see afaint y eat sine drapery represent withoutdoor which with the same tint they exhibit in a open air . the like heedless mistake we see in the copy of manydisciple and young master after old or modern painting for not observe whether in lessenthey copy which they generally do they should not also abate the strength of colour and tint they colour as well in light as shade be as strong as the original the same error they commit in painting great copy after small original but this ill conduct be ow chiefly to master when they set they pu pil to copy in different size in not admonisning they of it but rather desirethat they shall imitate every thing as exactly as possible think in fact it be against the rule of art it be therefore certain that picture with figure of landscape suppose it as big as the life to be copy third less in size tint inthe copy must need be third fainter than the original and the more it lessenin size the fainter the tint or else it can not be good if this conduct be of such moment in copy picture of how much greater consequence must it be when portraitpainter diminisn the life or paint portrait in full proportion from small one with respect to the weaken ro strengthen of colour . although it be commendable to follow great master in general yet it be fault to dwell upon some of they particular as a ornament urn vase term without strive at something new we think that what they have do be enough for we practice but this be weakness since art and nature have such fund of object and we time for learn and living be long enough and by consultingwithin ourselves we may spur pur genius . other commit the same fault by contray impulse for so violent be they inclination to some particular great master in he object colour that theythink it lose time to employ they thought on the work of any other good artist and be thus wedded to he they wishi drudge and plod to be like he as wellin error as perfection by this means and by punctual imitation of blunderand mistake it sometimes happen that the copy and the original be not to be distinguisned both be so wounderfully like each other nay they own pro duction be take for copy for tyro of good ability may at first use heself to good manner of design which he ought to be master of before he take to painting and to understand this well before he proceed to ordonnance and then if he have thorough knowledge of the latter he will paint goodpicture yet it be often see tnat he work be but take for that of pupil nayworse than copy and what be still lef it be not like he own manner or handling and why such artist be advanced thus far endeavour to producetheir they gun invention no longer minding grounds and rule but ftrive onlyat novelty care little for painting or defign well whence they work are oftentime indifferently design poorly handle and coloured but well ordered 92 arise only from neglect of they master s 92 instruction and what they knowand a itch for what they still want to know whereby they be often shipwrecked between both pernicious effect of the bent of we youth which can not be remedy otherwise than by return to original principle and they put inuse for as by ae8xcess in loading weight upon weight on weak and unsettle though welllay foundation the whole building may tumble even the foundation may dance so must we practice always have a eye to theory that the custom which as we say be second nature in goodnef as well as badness may gain firi foot on we and be we furest guide . the art of paintingviii. book of archetecture . chap of archite9cture in general . after have handlad sol many diffegent part of the art we meet also with architecure a art full of noble performance and fine usezbut we purpose be not to insist on all its advantage or give system of it since such work would be too tedious and call for homer or virgil92 eloquence and have be copioussy handle by several learn pen we shall treat noffurther of it than what concern painter leavethe rest to architect . a ingenious history painter if he would be universal must need understand architecture and statuarry because he will otherwise be at nonplus in something he ought even to be as know as a architect and how to order goodbuilding though it be a architect92 daily practice and 92 ghat but part of the painter92 .it be certain that the human body be in its symmetry proportion majestyand grace the most perfect pi e9ce of work in the creation architecture be no less perfc e9t in its mf4peration it have even preduce ghe first wonder of the world andthereby obtay the laurel and palm of fame .writer say that babylonian be the first and after they the agyptian greekand roman who bring it to perfection until in the emperor augustus92 time it arrivearrive at itshighest pitch but sunk afterwards by the irruption and barbarityof the goth vandal hun and longobard who burn and destroy allbefore they true proof that nothing in the world be permanent andstable but to come to we purpose we must 92 premise that the word architecture simply signify draught or design after which building be carryup and construct and comprehend the five follow order namely the tuscan doric lonic roman and corinthian accord to which all building be regulate whether palace tomple townhouse triumphal arch bagnio theatre towngate gallery tomb and other magpificent building round or square or both speak of they outward construction . the word order be of large extent but in architecture be as vitruvius define it join of different proportionate and symmetric part as pedestal column andjtheir ornament in such manner as to compose perfect order and body . as for the entablature over column to wit architrave frize and cornice which for they richnef have get the name of ornament they may as little as the order themselves be gither mix among one another or change from one order to another .careful painter will not only distinguisn one sort from another fromcornice to base but will also take care not to put a lonic moulding on doric pedestal corinthian on tuscan roman cornice on a lonie9frize . further it be certain that the order do not promiscuoussy suit all sortof building but ought so to be apply respect they part and ornament which also differ in general from each other as to have a harmony and agreement with the whole building with respect to they situation and quality . these order must be enrich in they several kind to fhiew suitabledecorum especially the capital except the tuscan which iithroughout plain and simple . the doric order excell in its triglyph and metope the jonic in its valure medillion the roman in the elegance of cornice and beautyof capital with they volute and oakleave and the corixthiaa by its moulding of victorious olive leave and itsexcelleat and agreeable capital . the metope in the doric frize imay beenrich accord tothe qualityand use of building whether temple townhouse honourary arch or courtfor priest . in the first suit best carve challice book wase mitre in the second the coat of arm of the republic or chief man in the governt ment also the ray and thunder of jupiter tie together or the caduce staff of mercury twine with serpent as denote peacein the third various arma and trophy take from the enemy or allfort of mufical and warlike instrument as usual in triumph and army huddleed together and in the last suit best carve oxscull adorn with garland betoken sacrificewhich the ancient make to they deity oftentime the utensil of those offeringbe introduce to wit altar vase three leg kettle vinegarcup censer candtestick bason dishie hammer axe knife . among the work of the ancient we see in the frize of the lonic roman andcrinthian order especially in the two last some foliage of cak lcave whichhave fine effect when twine with shrub and vine branch intersperse with rose and other flower sometimes be introduce vizards with play children and run animal also festoon of fruit leave and various kind of the most beautiful and agreeable flower these tie together look nobly especially when judicioussy place but enough of this he wno would know more sort of frizal ornament must consult the work of the ancient in which he will find . they though the beforemention be the principal and most in use . although the ancient teach that the front of building which be the partmost in view ought to be more adorn than the flank and rear yet some modern master have misunderstood this and apprehend as if in those part the ornament could not be too many nay they have crowded the moulding of the architrave frize and cornice and of the pedestals under column with smallcarving in such manner that it rather cause confusion than ornament as appear by they work but when use in moderation and between tbe principal ornament part be leave plain and blank it cause grandeur and decorum .something be also to be remark about pediment and keystone pedimentor top of front like the forehead of man snew the principal aspect of building especially when they spandrell or face be agreeably enrich by good master with history sacrifice arm or the like in marble accord to the quality of the fabric .sometimes also be put over pediment trophy coat of arm or shield which if well cut and place have noble effect . as for keystone of arch over gate and nich these may be en rich in the tuscan order with wild beast and between head of cyclop or giant . inthe doric order with lion head or hercule with he lion s 92 skin over his head . in the lonic order with tame beast or head of pallas or amazon with their head attire . there be lurge collection of they in langley92 ancient masonry lately publish . in the roman order with head of demigod as ronnda jilik casar andsuch heroes and richly wring . chap ii of the rise of the ornament column and their pedestals . ave speak in the former chapter of the decoration of the order we shall now in brief manner treat of the rife and divifion of the column with they ornament and pedestals . the ornament or entablature of the tuscau column rise one mod fble andseveneight part of module by module be mean throughout the order the pillar diameter next above the base the column with its base and capital rise seven module and half and the pedestal one module seven eight thisbe agree the entablature and pedestal be each one fourth of the column92rise the base under the column and gapital over it bein each in rise half module the lessen or diminution of the shaft ofthe column at the neck under the capital be one fourth of module and it begin below at one fourth of the colum no92 rise .the entablature of the doric column rise twomodule and one eight the co ac lumn with its base and capital be eight module and half and the pedestal two module and two fifteenth this be fix the entablature be one fourth and the pedestal throe and three fourthof the colum no92 nise the base and canpital be each as in the tuscan half module the diminution at the neck of the shaft be one fifth of module and begin below at three part one fourth of the entablature of the lonic column rise one module and three fourth the column with its base and capital be eight module and three fourth and the pedestal twe module and half this settle the entablature be one fifth andthe pedestal three part and half of the column92 rise but if the frize be carve the entablature be four part and half of the column92 rise and in the follow order the same the capital with its volute be little more than half module and the base be just half module and in the follow orderthe same the diminution at neck be one sixth of module and begin below at three part and half of the colum no92 rise divide into twelve part as aforesay . the entablature of the roman column rise one module and twelve twentieth part of module the column with its base and capital be nine module andthree fourth the pedestal rise three module which lay down the entablature be one fifth and the pedestal three part and one fourth of the colum no92rise rise the capital rise one fnodule and one flxth the base as before the diminution at neck be one seventh of module and begin below at the rise of three part and one fourth of the column divide as aforesaid .the entablature of the gorinthian column rise two module the column withits base and capital be ten module in rise the pedestal three module and one third after which the entablature be one fifth and the pedestal one third of the column92 rise the capital rise one module and one sixth the base as before the diminution at neck be one eight of module and begin below at one third of the colum no92 rise .the breadth of the tuscan and doric pedestals ought always to be equal withthe plinth or basis of they column and though the plinth in the three other order project more at they bottom by reason of they sweep they pedestalsmust neverthelefs be alike perpendicular with the upper point of they plinth . let I here six the height of statue on pedestal place next column since many mistake in it in right proportion it ought not to rise higher than two third of the column but then the column should not be too high or too low but stand on base only which be frequently continue through the building as for pedestals they serve only to raise column and augment its ornament we ought also for elegance to take care that the figure and its pedeftal be proportionate to each other because if the latter be too great or too small the figure would become too small or monftrous . in fine as all the part of building ought to answer in proportionate doposition so should the figure whether carve or paint be neither too big or little wherefore they must be govern by the height ef the place where they be to stand . chap iii of the property ofbe 0 bailding and observationthereon.we must believe accord to the evidence of writer and the tradition of tra veller that the italian have the best taste as well for architectur e9 as painting and though it be certain that germany france england holland and othet country have produce fine architect yet at this time they be not comparableto the italian whose manner which be the antique be now follow by the most polite nation the old taste be know by the name of the gothic as certain writer affirm fay ee that the gothic manner of building of the ancient german which at that time give law to all other nation be quite abolishied by the italian nay he cry ont what magnificent and choice wonder do we not see in proud ltaly lofty rome especially where it seem as if nature and ant havemutually agree to establisn they throne and exert they power in order to make this famous city the mistress of the world and the beauty of the universe st. peter 92 church the vatican the rotunda and many other structure servethe whole world for example and without which architecture be but confusedmass draw yearly thousand of people and young artist thither to improve themselves by they for the service of they own country so that the finest andnewest thing which we see in those country lately build and still go forward be design in the italian gusto wherefore it be to they that those fine pile the stadthouse at amsterdam the new lutheran church and diver other structure as well without as within the town do owe they origin and beauty . we be then much indebt to those great artist vitruvius serlio philibert de s orme palladio cataneo leo baptista santoritio vignola scamozzi and manyother who have enlighten the world with they work and writings andthink that no one can be good architect who have not study those author the french acknowledge that they great improvement in this art be ow to the work and precept of those excellent master . we shall now speak of intire building so far as they serve for ornament in painting the goodness of building spring not merely from the aforesaid rise breadth or depth of the order but from a apposite conjunction or bringing together of different proportionate part into a exquisite body which by reason of its excellent form whether in height or breadth appear to the judgment of the know both admirable and beautiful especially when sitly adapted to the quality of the owner and have general conveniency with respect to causein its particular part building require firm foundation large and convenient staircase spacious entrange a elegant division ofdoor window and other opening a mandsome frontispiece thesekkilfully work and judiciously dispose must need produce sine effect . thus much for the outward face of building . if any object that decorum consist more in inward contrivance let I suppose stranger to come into town and pass through the street he were ask what he think of the building what answer would he make e0would he not say they be either fine or mean or would he saymust first see the in side and whethen the foundation be firm the apartment well dispose and well light and whether the underground office be goodthis would be ridiculous it be true a house must have these property but itbe idle to think that therefore wa be 9 can not judge of the building by the outfide only as if the person who beable to give design for fabric can not also compartit be inside let it be afk then wherein consist good division within whe the it be science which painter know not whether there must be fix number of hall and apartment of determinate form length rise and breadth and what those must be whether there must be one two or more stack of stair whether each room must have one chimney or two andwhether the floor must be wooden or stone or whether palace be for its largeness more beautiful than common or citizen92 house but wave other mens opinion we shall proceed in we purpose so far as eoncern painter in these country and no further we judgment be that the best proportion inbuilding be one third higher in rise than breadth especially if it be cover in with compassroof and its appertunance but if flatroof third wider than high and to be command by single order rising from bottom to top it would be improper to adorn they with statue bassrelief festoon for such heavy and close structure without weight andmoreover open on top be proper for a amphitheatre but not for temple or palace speak with respect to custom and decorum which must allways go tothe since nothing be beautiful without its natural quality the case be as woman in man92 habit and the contrary or watervase adorn with an olivebranch and thunder or a oilvessel with triton and dolphin . in painting good building there must appear besides the architecture perspective and colour a orderly disposition produce elegance otherwise itbe of no worth orderly disposition consist in so join the part that theymutually set off each other in pleasing variety and there by exhibit fine piece of work and a agreeable figure this variety spring from the inequality of opening or window whether oblong square circle or oval the disposition of these opening near and over each other be found on reason as shall be explain by a example . we exhibit inplate lixtemple top with cupola or rather a houseroundroof on each side of the door flight of step descend ballustraded underneath which be vault and over the entrance balcony now beginfrom below we shall shew what figure each opening ought to have in a orderlydisposition the door under the step be square rise somewhat more than its diameter that of the entrance be circular on top and rise one third more than it be diameter that of the balcony also rise one third more than its breadth but besquare or flat on top and then we meet the roof round again now let us dispose it otherwise and make the door below circular the next square the next thus much for door for we find no other than round and no roof appear . round and square one the same method may be take with window when there be two range one above the other the undermost may be oblong andthe uppermost compass but lower if there be another range of window abovethese next the roof they ought to be perfect square s this rule we have taken from the work of the ancient who always give they opening or window more rise in the first story than the second still lessen in the third yet all alike in diameter window should never be lower than about three foot from the floor within if there be window in the basementstory where the walling be thickest and be usually finish with rustic order they must be square and above ei the scheme little round or flat and thus the one snew the other with respect to roundness and squareness ifnow there be compasswindow in the basement and upper story theuppermost should be circular and the undermost oval with they longest diameter parallel with the level of the building because be press by the weight they arch be dilate when contrarily the otherdo not bear any weight but circular window be grow out of use as not admit light so well as the square one . if in the pier between window there be nich and figure in they andover head room for baf relief than the table for ie must be square but circular where it be over square window . as for door over each other isay that if there be over the cornice compaf pediment and on both side ballustrde with figure then the bal oony door ought not to be circular but square and ornamreate with pillaster yet the door of the entrance may be circular we ought even not to set on the balcony ballustrade with figure but ornament it with ball or other low thing the one or other ballustrade must be also diversify for two part alike in two such emminent place have a ill effect wherefore one of they should be close wall parapetway and the face of it may then be enrich with baf relief of figure festoon . think what have say sufficient guide for the other kind of building forthese observation be on all occasion unalterable to painter with respect to agreeable disposition . there be still somewhat behind which though contrary to the dispofition aforesaid must be animadverted it be touch slower garden which if fine must need be regular as well with respect to its general form as its particular division at least the two side ought to be alike whether set off with pot vafe statue or other ornament we be teach indeed that uniformity be stiff andnot painterlike wherefore we thould avoid it as much as posfible but weigh the precept maturely we shall find the fauit to lie in dur misapprehenfion of it questionless thing proceed from rul e9 and order must be regular but that regularity may nevertheless be somewhat hide on occason wherefore though garden be uniform on both side we be under no necesfity of shewall that uniformity one side be sufficient the rest may be handsomely hide or break with tree piece of stone work column or corner of the house but let we not from hence absolutely conclude regular object to be unnecessary in an ordonnance for they sometimes furnisn all the decorum of picture yet if we see but part of they we may conceive the residue . more example of breaking uniformity may be thefe when figure stand on each side of gate or alcove man may be place or sit down before one of theyin order tocreate inequality so also if by means ofbe 0 curtain one of those figurebe shade if baf relief be set on each side of the gate or alcove one ofthemmay partly be cover by the personage to answer we purpose if without door on both side of a entrance there be carve lion or sphinx we may break of one of they head solomon92 throne be adorn with twelve golden hon we need not see they all the fix on one side fhew sufficiently that there must be as many on the other two orthree entire be enough of the rest we may see only part here andthere thus we must always manage in such cafe . chap of the matching of the vario e9 coloured marble as well without as within building with the management of tomb vafa and bacchanalian term . bject havebe 0 fine effect when nature and art be join together by al skilful hand and though all eye be not alike qualified to apprehend the it be beautiful and seek to be through the one person as say understand it and the other do not and forthis reason art have such power that though nature be beautifut in she production yet they would not perfectly please our ege without the help of art . nature produce a infinity of fine stane of various colour and quality but art alone judge of they fitness and orderly looation as to rank and dignity insomuch that though ignorant in art we oan clearly apprehend that it ought to be so and no otherwise . we know that ths white be foft and tender and lovely to the eye the black contrarily be melancholy and disagreeahle we place then the black among the red and upon the red white these three coloured stone be capital and canaot be otherwise dispofe asto th e9 ir natufe and quality without fore nature and zun counter to art . however they rank and application in architectonic use may be these . in the tustan order as undermost black marble . in the doric green . i the janic yehow . in the roman red and . in the coriathian white . if any afk why the ned be not set before the yellow since the red be in its nature daykerrthanthe yellow ianswer that it be because the red and green be opposer in strength coatrarily yellout be proper to green since yellow and blue green . at any time we be oblige to place between two stone of one colour stone of another the follow mixture be mostly in use . between two black marble suit best jasper copper or braf . between two serpentine or green marble stone the same . between two red stone white . between red black or serpentine stone pisan whiteeye marble . between two grey stony freestone or yellowisn white marble . between two dot long veiny stone one that be speckle aad the contrarybetween two jasper yellow or ffestry white marble . 92 marbl e9painter miist observe the conveniency and place for marbling if the plaoe be large or a hall then he may doit with force but in smaller compaf pass he ought to moderate it and keep it faint that the place may not seemthere by lessen or the eye offend if the room be hang with picture he should consult man of experience especially the master who paint they what colour will fit best . about light picture dark marble be best and about dark picture light marble as pisan jaspar or any tend to light yellow but if it be singlecolour such as bass relief then freestone suite best . in bring many sort of coloured marble together we may for instance in frontispiece either single or doublecolonade and pedestrate very agreeblydispose they thus viz plante ix the base and pedestralmoulding may be black little eye the block of square of the piedestal dark red muchdot less vein theplinth of the column and pilaster mey be white the column light red or pisan marble with large whiteeye vein on both sidethe ey to be alike the pilaster also light red moderately eye the capitalwhite the architrave black like the base and moulding of the pedestals the frize may be dark red like the block of square of the pedestals and the cornice black again like the architrave if the frize have raise ornament of foliage child triglyph oxscull they ought to be white if over the cornicebe parapet it may be entirely of another colour and the pedestals and the member of pisan or other crossvein marble and the panel of face of greymarble or white if adorn with bass relief the figure or vase on top also white . this distribution may be double and varied on occasion the frize and co lumn may be white the basis and capitel gold and so may also the ornamentbe to wit triglyph little block and foliage the rest may remain as before . in a hall of red or other marble where the moulding of the ornament are different larger or smaller we may make door frontispiece or alcove of whiteor other marble but if the member continue along the hall 92 the frontispiece or alcove ought to be of the same colour with the room the room may be of one order and the frontspiece alcove and chimney of another thus the room may be lonic and the rest corinthian or roman the pavement of the floor must correspond with the building mean if the room have pillaster the band or bordering marble ty the pavement must run up to they whether the pilaster stand wide or close for they ought to be so lay as to shew every where regularity whatever jet or break the door frontispiece alcove may occasion as prudent gardener dispose he parterre one round another square octangular always contrive such a uniformity as close with the border . in the middle of the hall may be introduce such figure or compartment as bestanswer the general purpose and they may be of what colour you please . in chamber or gallery where the side be unlike we be oblige to part they by some figure come between and yet the band which bind the side must come every where alike if there be column on both fide of the gallery the band must run croff it from one to the other .proceed we now to partycoloured tomb and other stone . on white sphinx lioneff fuit well tomb of serpentine or porphyry andback plinth if no figure orother ornament support at porphyry also lookwell on bracketsof copper or brass the tomb may be of black marble with gravestone or other bluishstope agree well violetcolour stone or porphyry copper or brass note here that the black inust always be undermoft especially when diver sort of colour be place pnone another ja we have shew in the order . great vase and urn be always of the fame stone as they bamef as well in nich as on pedestals ifon pedestals the basis ought to project equal with the block precisely the priapusterans anciently use in the bacchanalia be mostly of wood not very large and point underneath for conveniency of carriage from place to place whither the gang of satyr fauni and bacchanal determine to go .have pitch on place for they stay they fixedit in the ground by means of the point aforesaid these term besonretime paint of brick colour sometimes also white about the mouth and breast they be smear with blue grape . the post or guide call herme be huge and immoveable and of white stone set on rijde heap of stone in order to be conspicuous to traveller at dotance for which realon they be also sometimes place on pedestals or block . chap of the vein and eye in ston eg use in architecture as well without as within and how to dispose they he beauty in painting building consist in a elegant expression of the difference of stone which compose they and this may be effect not onlyby theydivifion but also by they colour especially in outsidework which benot so much heedas the inward and be subject to more inconveniences of rain hail and wind and if stand in damp place they effect in few yearvisibly appear if the stone benot veryhard by the drop of moulding andprojeckure in seyeral part . fountain must be suppose to suffer much and become very mossy by being drop on and so do tomb and igravestone but principally pyramid whichage not set up so much for the sake of they polisn body as for they formand huge bulk wherefore it be no great matter whether the stone of these be of nae fort or colour or not they be often see of many sort of stone some as theyhave be fopnd and other change throughtime yet the cement suffer most by be eat ijn whereby the stone get sloose and must need drop again some stone be more weak and brittle than other and corrod by the air dampnef and dring be break in piece by the pressure of those over they andthuis leave gap and break wherein the rain gather out of which grow weed weed mof and other green sometimes whole branch all iwhieh at the year 92 end decay and become green sap triekling thence downche ftone . we shall here stop little to say fomething toucn abuse . know not hou some can so far relish sloveliness as to spoil not only statue and fine figure but also intire building if they be break or mould e9red piece ruin and other decay stone it would be no damage if ever so much muddle and bedropbut it be very improper to serve intire and fin be 9 figure thus and in place toowhere be neither tree or any thing else to oecanon iti the fame they do in building look as frefh as at first be the spot see on they natural to the stone it would be more proper than all the gutter ufually represent to 92 trickledown they wherefore care must be take before we begin to paint thing suppose to be drop on thatbe 0 difference may appear between nearnef and dotance for as spot in cloath be more visibl be 9 near thanfar off so the faintnef . of remote object must be obferve but let I afk what foulnef of wet anddust can stick to smooth body which rain hail or fnow do no f 4t wasn off butthey may decay and be consume by time especially those face the north we see many inftance of decay in ancient buildwhich suffer afl extremity . ing where be figure so eat un by time that it be hardly discernable whetherthey reprefent man or woman like figure of snow partly dissolvedt by tke sunbeam . speak not here so much against the drop upon and muddle such object . as of the abuse when the cause of such a effect do not appear for withoux probable reason why thing should be thus or thus art become obstinacy . but to return to we subject . it be certainly praiftworthy to take some pain in shew the stone of building and they vein and eye when they be judieisusly and agreeably dispose accord to rule say it be commendable to he who understand perspective . the part of building within which be not so subject zo the tooth af time be not so apt to decay as those witkout the cement ajso jastlonger whichmake they keep elean and intire they joint to seem afmost iivisibie and th e9whole to be as one stone for this reason we must aveidk the miiftkke of som e9painter who vein and eye they work and afterwards divide it intaeftone whereby one vein or eye happen oftentime to run through twubr through e9e stone at once . whence we must conclude it to be what it be meer painting and inot the life : whereas think it the most certain way first to divide che work inte stope and . then to marble and eye they observe chat each stoue have partieilar eye t building have beautifil effect when the architecture be fine and well ornament and this as well in painting as the dife rcerly dispofltion be ope ofthe best raeiafon thereof without which it can not have that vaft agreeublenef . know architect take especial care of che setting 92 the stone of be building in such manner as to blazon its beauty and improverit and92 thereby cregte harmony wherefore he dispose the eyeveiny stone in *he prepereft manner for instance in singlecolonade porticoy 92 the veiny eye must oppose each other slopingstope from out to in contrarye the same method must be observe in92the bdafterand al part that be pair so that the work may appear regular at distance taklag especiadt care that they be eye alike to keep the eye always in balance between thom the ftone for the architrave frize and cornice fhouldhe of choofe that the wein fall perpendicalar in antter to keep the memberdistinct which they would not be be the veinr to fall in with the moulding . ip remain to beobserved in marbling eolumn that the eyevein ought to beceive the strongest light on the relieved and swell part in order to aid the flat of the picture by art wirich nature want nor as be round of herfelf wherefore it would look ill that the most dark of thezeyevein come on the weaker part because it would render the effect you propose abortive . imagine piece of walling divide into three pannel on each side of whichstand two column the two first ought to oppofe each ocher they vem muft either be level or run diagonally against each other outwardly or inwardly the twto other most do the same and so on chap vi.of ruin . hitherto we haye fpoken of th e9 beauty and regularity af intire building wherefore it be proper next to treat of fraginent and ruin equally necessary with the former . thave sometimes wonder howir hapipen that among the paintpr of figureand landscape who make use of building and gtherbrickwork so fow exhibit whole and highly fmish one all they thew be rain break wall and decay stone but feldom itire and perfect ftructure becaufe as take it they will be at no trouble to fearch antiquity for the form and most beantiful part of architecture whereby they might learn to produce something curious supinity proceed from they want of knowledge and ambition to obtain it . although many think that piece of ruin do not requine so great regarde0 a intire building they be much mistaken for the one as well92as the other depend on measure and proportion yet some will go and throw down part of be 0 building and intermix with it some fragmeny of capital piece of frize cornice and the like of a order foreign to the building which though verywrong they salve by suppof that when building be in min no one will havethe curiosity to examin the mibbisn to see whetherzhere be wnong capital frize or cornice and grant such be to be fowad the fault would be nan be 9 fince those . broken part might be bring thither gafually but this belame excuse92to speak the truth icannot apprehend how anyone can be so wilful since no naore hnow ledge and trouble be necefsary to the best than tthe worst thing to the whole than to the half ingh e9 gne we lmust use the footruule and compast as well as in the other if beautiful remain of great building adorn fine landscape andlook look grand how much more one in perfection he then who will take painmay certainly by practice overcome all diffic fblty ifhe have ambition enqughbut let I not be understand to speak against the tostudy the best thing . choice of ruin much less endeavour to hinder any one from the ue of they since be senfible that every man have naturally particular taste for some thing as we have formerly say wherein he may excell .. desire not to discourage painter of ruin or to raise pique against that sort lof object my only drift be to shew that we ought to study the rest of antiquity with care and attention and chiefly to learn the ancient state of old structure in order to know perfectlywhat they be in they best condition . chap vii principal direction for painting the ornament offhall room . in this sort of work we must in the first place have a eye to the regularity and division of the architecture and if that be beautiful not in the least hurt it under pretence of decorum or actpainterelike and if at any time we be oblige to alter this conduct it must nevertheless be in favour of the architecture . that the painting of what kind soever it be must tend to the lustre andmagnificence of the building speak with respect to painting the woodwork whether it be marble or plain . that the ornament to be paint agree with shose of the room and be govern by the same order in architecture . ia that in pannel nich and windom ought to be artfully paint whas you would have appear to be real on nattirally there whether tapestry or prospect af tapestry it must appea to be such if view it must look like view the former by be border and the latter by its sky or sun every wh e9re agreeing with the light of the roomthe master must beware of represent in room chree or more different hour of the day at the same time nor in history unless they be in the mannee of tapestry . he must never inclose white marble bafrelief wigh woodwork as being repugnant to custom and likelihood .lastly fince excess often abate the majesty of fabric the artist92 should avoid many littleness in the division and ornament on such occasion historical fi gure should not exceed three or four foot in height be the paintiug ever so large tapestry figure exceed the life be unjustifiable they look monstrous in fmall room and lessen larger . it be to be wishie that great man and lover who bespeak such work havesome previous knowledge of fuch thing as these at leave that they be inform of they and would asfent to theartist92 opinion in the execution of they finoe it be reasonable that he design if it pleafes be follow . few artist be sollicitous about insideornament either in reference to their elegance and splendor or they uie andeconvenience as be evident in many oldmaster work wherein we generally see too great simplicity all be plain and . mean table bench chair kitchenstuff drinkingvessel and whatbe more oftentime company of old and young people in room with never chair in it and sometimes no more than bare wall and curtain hanging for no purpose orgament and foliage be feldom see in they work and when they be they be so improperly and disjunctively apply that we must conclude they rather to serve for humour than decorum certain sign that such mafter be ignorant hoth of the naturalness needfuluef and application of object . it be oertain that theancient greek and ropaus be not originally so sumptu ac we in they housefurniture as afterwards they come to be and it be as easy to think that there bedifference between the nobility and commonalty as wellin they building and dress as in other zespect the one use plate at he table . the other earthenware or paintwood the one have balrelief statue hanging or tapestryin he house the other be content with bare wall eachaccord to he fancy or ability truly be surprised to think of my first ordonnance and how disjointed my conception be often exhibit royal history in stable or cottage and as often the contrary questionless every mafter of a house furnishies it with what be proper for each apartment whether kitchen chamber stateroom or gallery one apartment have bed or couch andits appertunance chest table and chair another have hanging more or less costly floorcarpet stand sconce lookglass another have bench chimneypiece circular couch fitting the table and other thing proper to the room and thus other apartment . some imagine that chair be not ancieutly in use but man sit on cushion as in the eastern country or else rest on couch when certain person had represent anea and dido in stately hall and she place on low small halfpace cover with carpet with the young ascanius in she lap and anea by her fide and some lady sit here and there on cushion on the floor which was cover with green ganpet be surprised to see large round table stand in corner on side of the painting and this serve up as for a entertainment and yet not chair nearit afk the master why the lady have not chair or bench and whether this circumstance be thus to be find in history he answer that in those time neither chair or bench be know couldhardly forbear laugh but afk he whether the company be to stand to they victual because of the height of the table he begin to see liis error yetin excuse say ee they will make use of the couch which stand vonder against bb this would have be tolerable comeoff have the couch beena the hanging . make for the table but by ill luck the one be square the other round sayno more because would not augment heblush . other .other have make the same mistake as be the case of one who as the reoort go represent abraham92 offering draw he with scymiter or bendsword in he hand and straight scabbard by he side . once make the fame blunder when my inclination for compofition be greaterthan my skill in the story of hercule foin by omphale have feen in design of bartholet that hercule be much bigger than any of the woman wherefore also draw he larger and dref in wornen92 apparel have fleeve closeat hand like sardanapalus amongst he woman in mervan 92 historical chronicfe distaff in he girdle spindte in bis hand and pearl about he neck and in order to shew that they be omphale92 cloath place she by he stark naked . now appeal to any one how well the garment couid fit omphale see it was neither too short or too streight for hercule though half as tall again as fhe but afterwards rectify my conduct . it be plain that such overfight proceed from ignorance or lame instruction and principally in what concern embelfishment say embellissiment of anykind whatsoever whether within or without door for few know the importance of this part of art and the uncommon effect of it . we may from tlie work of old and judicious master here and there borrow some of they thought and use they in proper mamer in we own work . the famous pouffin in he finding of mose shew the nile with watergod and with good reason as we fhall prove in the chapter treat of the authoritypainter have to represent spiritual and manimate being under hyman form but it be ridiculous in my opimon that the same figure with all its adjunct fhould be place on the strand of river and near it narcissux view himself in the water on supposition that if it be but watergod all be well for think the mafter it suit well . it be fine figurebefide if poussin durst do it why may not we but it be against reason indeed be the sphinx andchild leave out it may be passable enough . who set out room of entertainment and it do not shew whether the dinner be over or not by the cloth lay bottle glaffe cistern and all thing in order as before dinner and empty bottle lie in disorder empty difhe dog gnaw bone chair displace tablecloth half turue up and such like after dimer or who can approve in testa92 dip of aehille thetis92 lymg in a open gallery where also be cradle for moveable embellishment it be improper td shew mark anthony and cleopara in they grandeur and luxury without retinue and as in private collation see we know they have such crowd of mufic buffoon juggier andother loofe people about they or can we represent crift lie in the manger attend by joseph and marv and the three king wait on he and that in stable full of beastprovender and on the wall fan and stail hang befides other utenfil of husbandry and yet not countryman or servant to appear or chest box see or square to be see xhether joseph hire the stable or find e2t void of people be another consideration moreover one of the principat figuregure be in fuit of armour and barehead and yet he headpiece be not to be feen . one of my fehowdisciple once paint collation and afk he why he put not knife on the tablee0 he answer that knife be not aatique verywell think be then the bread 92 and meat and threeleg stool wich backstand by antique be not improper though small circumstanee that chamberpot be placeby bedfide when person be in it even be there also at daybreak lamp either burn or extinguished and such like thing whereby we may judge what other circumstance be require . from all which confideration it be plain that judicious master must take particular think about the bywork see it be as bad to leave out somethingghat be needful as to add what be unnecessary . chap viie of the picture proper to various apartment . xvhe nature property and use of picture in general be to keep the sense . by pleaf variety of object as figure landscape in continual einploy and contemplation . they nature havenear affinity with that of the thing they reprefent when those be do by skilful hand and therefore they can when natural thing are want fufly fatify . thein preperty lie in they 92 application to meet place and they can not be displace without hurt nay undloing naturalnef . as for the use oft picture it be in the occasion we have for they and the glao they be to ferve for in order togratify the sense of the ouner theymust be well express and fall in with the architecture in the agreement of the various object wich the ornament of the bulding . ef tkisbe uuintelligible pfhah endeavour to explain myself say then thatit be not sufficient for painter to design work for apartment at random andintroduve therein what fancy he please or best understand for he ought to . aonsider whether it agree with the place and be proper there if therefore he would go on with certainty he must in the first place consult the architecture . und then the three poine follow . the quality or condition of the building the building itself . the aparemene in iti. first let he consider whetlier the owner be prince lord magistrate or ierokaet . secondly whether the building be public as townhouse church palace .. be pr eavete asfar merchant or eitizen . lastly whecher ie be a hall chamber parlotrr kitchin or che like . thus thus far in general 92 but if we bulld galaser for kiag the apartment must be contrive for other use than those for merchant or even townhouse for in thislatter we find many room fitted for purpose oppsite tobe 0 palace as may be seen in that finemodel the stadthouse at amsterdant where architecture have wonderfully dispose all the room to they several use nor be the judgment of the painter or architect less conspictous in the proper place the picture in each apartment for each piec be 9 chiefly sculpture be so order as to allude tg the room whence we know what use the room be put and by the room what the printing stonefigure and bassrelief signify . wherefore it be very necessary to consider the nature of the apartment in order govern we work thereby as first to in the hall belaw fuit well gray bassrelief or else trophy paint on the wall after the life . in a antichamber where people wait for command gray ornament be alsebest sometimes intermix with slower but very sparingly . in a audience or presenceroom should be tapestry or picture with figure as big as the life of magnificent transaction which happen in apartment or palace . in the lady visitroom must be other sort of embellishment such as fruit flower landscape sine thought virtuous representation and the moft cloathed and modest history . in the nursery agree bafrae9 lief and paint emblem or moral wherebythe child may learn good manners and92 inure tender year to virtuous action to these may be add some flower fruit bird and such like . in the kitchin may be see the representation of culinary furnitute huntof deer the picture of some maidorgther servant or dog or cat but thesemust be mostly gray or woodcolour on account of the smoke which otherwise would sully the colour . in the gallery may appear all sort of huntequipage paint on the wallfrom the life . in thet upperroom suit landscape and all kind of beautiful prospect . in the mafter92 bed chamber be proper some beautiful face and naked childiren paint after the life . in the children bedroom nothing must be see but foliage or bragchwork . the study may be adorn with painting in gray marble of learn man philosapher . in the summerhouse be place for the enjoyment of company and entertainment suit nothing better than merry bacchanalian piece sportive herdsmen dancing brook and fountain . we proceed now to the decoration over chimney and on door in each apartment . over the diningroom chimney place comus god of meal accompany by taste and smell and on the door latitia or joy . over the hallchimney may be decorum or authority accompany by pallas or virtue and hono 92 or honour and on the door understandipg over the lady92 visitroom chiinney modesty accompany by obedience and diligence and on tne door fidelity . over the chimney in saloon or meetingroom for youth may be see inventus or youth attend by grace and eloquence and on the door gaudium or joy . over the nursery chimney place education and by it young branch tie to stick and on the door obedience . over the kitchen chimney prudentia of prudence accompany by cere andbacchus and on the door diligence . over the bedchamber chimney quiet and the door security . over the study or closet chimney wisdom or science and on the door harpocrate . on the door of sideroom go out of the hall clemency and vigilance and between they oeconomy . on the pantrydoor abundance . on the cellardoor silenus. on the garret or loftdoor winter . on the gardendoor flora . on the orcharddoor pomona . in the greenhouse between the stove the figure of person who have beena transform into tree and plant as cyparissus myrrha daphne on the door within apollo and on the outside diana . on the stabledoor all sort of stableappertenance as bridle saddle houf stirrup dungfork shovel currycomb . on the privydoor momus laugh . and now that may conceal nothing from the artist shall subjoin the picture proper to be put into chimney which may be various because we benot confine to the fire as be only use during the winterseason the spring summer and autumn afford we large field for fine invention and since the place for three quarter of the year become any thing we sind proper we can eithershut they up or leave they open or contrive in nich all sort of statue or bust bassrelief and other ornament as cistern vasa flowerpot bafket of fruit mufical instrument globe and such like we can have they be open with door or without with one door or two half one and represent visto or propect such as flowergarden public place with fountain street of house grove lane frontispiece pantry winecellar a alcove with couch or li brary and such like in fine we may introduce any thing that be different fromthe furniture of the apartment but care must be take that the painting have natural and high horizon with little or no sky to gain more depth visto of apartment one within another be also not improper but if we represent withoutdoor prospect as aforesaid it be more proper to paint door seemingly to give the roomair and see it often happen that such painting can not have the most advantageous light and be sometimes in shade by the projecture of the chiminey we should contrive the work accordingly and so as not to appear like painting but nature itself . the design proper to such place for the fake of those who be not fertile ininvention may be such as follow .spring flora set out with gay and joyful air have basket of springflower under she left arm with she right hand behind she little lift up her gown she left foot rest on step and she right lift up she breast be somewhat to the light behind in low offscape be see parterre ornament with vase behind she we may place another figure in shade ascend the step in order to sling off the offscape and bring forward the forefigure flora must be proportion to the size of the fire place if not as big as life let she be young damsel and ifthe face be fhade by the chimney make good advantage of the reflexion the same design may be also execute with child . summer pomona with basket of fruit in she lap and in the offscape aorchard and some cupid busily gather fruit and flower . autumn bacchus represent in a entranee or gateway hang round withvinebranch and grape and if you please young satyn by he with cup thisdesign may be also represent with childanteros as youth crowned with laurel stand on threffiold lean on torch or else long arrow point inwardly to library wherein be a astrolabe and globe and against the walle0 lyre hang hegarment fasten92 on eachshoulder bereddish purple he look agreeable and majestic he mouth open as if compliment somebody to come in he stand on the left side against the door which come half in snhade against the offscape so that he be strongly set off he face and underpart be front he breast turn to the light thisdesign either leave or right be equally good and so be thebeforemention cupid be see here sweetly smile have flask on he arm and spaxwaterbottle inhe hand whichhe hold up as if he be say 97rare water by he be a elegant stand or teatable on which another capid be place silversalver withglass and silver sugarbox and spoon behind may be see winccellarlight by candie or lamp we should also discover part of summeror fountain or gallery . in this design we shewserenade by three boy the first drest as punchaello with bagpipe hautboy or flute the second as a harlequin with violin and the third as scaramouch with guitar and all three in they properposture harlequin in setposture stand to the right against post hold the violin of he ear punchaello siet against the other post on the threfhiold hold he flute from he mouth and look forward laugh and shew he tooth . he head fink backward somewhat into hisneck scaramouch be in the middle with heguitar under he arm and he head quite sunk intohis fhoulder he beattentive hold he forefinger to he nose and he leg close behind thesebuffoon we might shew balustrade aver water in shade and on it a ape sitting in the water may be gondola with mafk in they or elsebe 0 street andsuch like . because the breadth of the aforesaid openingcan not be very great you may byshut the door more or less or by place somewhat between it get advantageous shade if the matter require it there ought at most but afigure and half to to be in the light and third in shade the colour will effect the same . such painting should not be inuddle but boldly handle and the light strong . thus iuch for withoutdodr view proceed we now to design for ae9himney : which be close . vase of white marble gold or silver or the belly gold and the neckand foot of lapis lazuli in niche of red marble or porphry and the jaumbs to be of lighter stone hang with festoon of all sort of fine leave interinixewith slower these festoon should be very large lik e9 two arm and spread in order to break the light ground that the middleornament whether white marble silver or gold may have the gre9ater force . the bust of bacchus in white marble erowe9ither with vine leave andbranch and grape or else mulberry with theif green on each side on ground of freestone festoon of whitt and blue grape and between those may be place some proper instrument as cymbal timbrel tabor hautboy andpan92 flute the bust be on pedestal of pisanmarble in niche as before the niche must rise as much as possible that the bust may have its full h e9ight but if the chimney and niche do not admit of figure in full proportion you may make boy of it if you leave out the pedestal you can place the same inthe niche but third less in height under the niche may be faint bassrelief of grey or other marble or else festoon of pine leave intermix with tome beautiful flower . the hust of apollo and on each side some musical instrument either aint as carve or natural under the niche may be square pannel and on at carve torch witha quiver across through garland of laurel among the .some roll of paper with geometric and other fuch figure for these can be better order in bassrelief tnan among those naturally paint . deep niche in which may be see table with a elegant stand or foot of sine wood partly gill on the table china teafurniture as dishie saucer teapot and silver chase teacannister or else coffee equipage as silver coffeepot silver salver with pipe knife some tobacco in paper fine chafing dish with fire and on the ground in the snade some bottle of wine . the table in this design may be put to various use it may be serve with melon or basket of fruit as peach nectarin apricock silberd . on such table may be also musicbook and instrument as lute violin hautboy and on the ground cistern of water with bottle of wine standing upright therein . in this last we may place round bassrelief represent sit child of flefhicolour marble on blue ground blow bubble round it white marble moulding and underneath festoon .chap ix descriptian of several picture adapt to the five order in architecture . ince no manner of describe fine apartment be more proper than this which exhibit thing as if we really see they shall therein give an architectonic view of each order and in as conspicuous manner as myselfconceive it the particular must then be well regard because they be solink together that by overlook small circumstance the whole chain may be break without ever get true idea of the thing .we shall confine the subject to five apartment and describe in each the picture which shew the nature height custom and other property relate tothe order of this building and since the tuscan order either in part or altogether be rough and massy we shall exhibit here the picture of polyphemus and gklatek .polyphemus on the sea shore inflame with the love of the beautiful galateaywho come to divert herself on the pleasant surge of the billow strove to please she withhe sing and music and thereby to gain she favour but she bedeaf to he fuit he roughhewn enormous size and frightful aspect be her aversion wherefore she shun he and deride he address . calm sea be see on tlie second ground to the leave appcare vast high rock hang over the sea almost to the point of sight all rough and overrun with mof and herbage go off to the leave very crag up to it huge stones be pile on each other as step but three time higher from the edge of the water on the lowermost of they sit the monstrous cclop as wild and savage man he skin very swarthy and hairy he head and beard full ofbristly black hair spread over he shoulder and breast he have but one eyebrow and thatas wide as he forehead hang over the eye which accord to homer was as large as fhield place in the middle of he wrinkle forehead he blubberlip turn up towards he broad and flat nose like that of negroe shewhe tooth set like those of see out of he gluttonous jaw with grim jook by he lay he staff whichxlike those of herdsmen be crook at one end and accord to ovid bigger than the mast of ship knapsack or pouch hang athe side he raiment be goatskin sew together which he have shook from offhe shoulder possibly to discover to galatea he conceit fine shape this garment be creamcolour spot with black he 92sat very rudely lean little backagainst the rock he left leg be stretch out towards the water and he right with the foot foreshorten lift up lay over piece of the rock he flure with a hundred pipe he hold in he left hand up at he mouth as if he had be just play he head inclined with he eye to heaven towards cepid who stand near and flatter he he mouth be open as if he be sing andand he right hand upright on he knee seem to beat time it be curious to see the method cunid take in the midst of he play to stick a arrow into polyphemus92 breast without he be sensible of it . cupid be about half as big as the cyclop arm or leg so that though he had elimb up the second step he could scarce reach the cyclop shoulder in order to stroke with he right hand the hair from the giant92 eye when pointwith stretch finger of the same hand towards the sea he laugh stick with the other a arrow in polyphemus92 breast under he lift arm cupid be of beautiful rosy complexion he hair yellowish white quiver tie with red safh hang by he side and he bow lie near hiin .the fair galatea in the mean time sit on large sea shell in the middle of the nearest distance be draw by two dolphin encompass with triton andnereid sounding they shelly trumpet and play on timbrel and other instrument she sit front in the shell and the dolphin which sne guidegently turn to the right she be fohow by other triton bear beautiful naked virgin and crowd of sea monster who gradually uniting with the farthest distance disappear this whole crowd be group in the form of crescent galatea appear to surpass all in beauty . lat first think this might possibly be venus herself because three beautyattend she whom take to be the three grace but she look somewhat younger and not so wanton as venus be usually represent she breast also rose less and she headattire be quite different from venus for she white hair twisted in tress and elegantly flow be here and there stick with white bellflower and the lock in each side tie together on the head in tuft and hanging down both before and behind may plainly appear how gently she glid overthe billow what most char man e9 be that in 92 this great crowd one mightsee the particular sway turning and affection of every figure on be 9 move slowly another swiftly as they beard hair and veil plainly shew some bendbackward as blow other forward almost to the water some be full of foam other swim as evenly as if they move on lookglass so that their glitter be scarce visible in the water this second venus as call she have greenish blue scarf which come over she lap twine about she right leg advancing she naked left leg she set she foot on the scroll of the shell she head little flung back inclined to she right shoulder she breast project andthe right arm stretch cross she body support she reinhand on she nakedknee she countenance be modest and smile she cy somewhat downissi make I think that th e9 sun be too powerful for she but more nearly perceive she be talk to seanymph or nereid who near she chariot lay behind on triton stare towards the shore at polyphemus whither galatea withshe left hand little foreshorten be point the top of the rock be almost shade by cloud which shade run across the piece and set off galatea andhe zetinue the whole group be agrecably light and92 though the light was strong yet the shade near the water be soft and melt by the glitter or reflexion of it which in my opinion be fine piece of conduct behind the rock towards the right side appear beautiful tract of verdant land adornwitfi with variety of &92tree extend crescentway by the point of sight and sdme herd of oxen goat and fheep be graze in the offscape be hill and on the right side town forward on the same side in the corner piece of searock appear whiel galatea and she company seem to avoid . as we have reprefent the person of polyphema and galatea so it will not bo amiss to shew those of the triton and nereid also pausanias describe the tritonthus they upper part from the nagel be humnan but covaer with thin shiarp and rough scale and downwards they body instead of foot end in large split tail they hair long and bluiffi and entangle as if in twist their cy greenisn they ear nofe and mouth like those of man the latter very large and wide they tooth like those of panther they fmger andnail like the outside of a oystershieil or such substance on they breast and belly and undet they ear they have fin like little wing which help they in swim .alexander ob alexandro say that the uereid be shape like beautiful virgindown to the navel but the lower part join together like fisn end in an eel92 tail they head be mostly unveiled they hair dishevel and beset with pearl coral and other sea production . second pictilre .polyphemus from the top of the rock where he sit play view he belovedgalatea bestow she smile on aci be so enrage 92 thereat that full of fury he tore piece from the rock with intention to crush they both which galatea escape by diving into the sea put aci not nimble enough in run was strike with it . this piece be fellow or sequel of the precede the rock be here place on contrary side to the former behind it a island allo in the form of crescent towards the right extend acrof beyond it the sea be see along the horizon the rock on the right side go down in rough step and follow fandy way forward on its leave to the middle

certainly past my understanding it be reality itself and yet itmust be picture for what be too hard for the pencil of judicious master be it what it will it be real nature to I and be satisfied but to proceed in the offscape on the left side some ship appear in storm and two in the middle of the piece ride at anchor and boat landing some people this made I thing that it be ulyss who have design on the eye of the cruel and 92 gluttonous devourer of man it be even sa can perceive they to be greek by their armed gally and whole equipage the92 sea be white withfroth and the wavebeat towards the point of sight the air as in commotion and full of driving cloudwhichicause here and there large ground fhadethe main light fall on polyphemus and the under part of the rock and take in almost the whole shore sorward but the stone which fall on aci be with he under part in shade causeby bit of fide rock which strongly set it off against the light cupid in the mean time above the horison come fly forward turn full of sorrow and cry to the right down where aci lie he left hand be up to one eye and he right wlierein be he bow over he head the shade it from the sun he quiver be reverseand the arrow drop into the sea aci lie on the fore ground with he shoulderbare and he be see little right sideways he hand half cover with sand are wide open as if he be swim he hair be dark and he garment dark green .galatea between he and polyphemus with the rock run acrof the piece she besee right sideways and she face be front the offscape consist of hill boscage beautiful lawn and river be clearly light there appear also some aattle graze asin the former piece under the impendance of the rock andclose to the sea lie red cloth garment in shade undoubtedly leave there by aey which be in my opinion artfully contrive in order to point out the placewhere thisunhappy couple have be sit the shore be covcre with cockleand many other sea production large greenisn coloured tortoise be see making ing froin under aci towards the sea polyphemus92 slute lie by he but the bag still hang by he side the top of the rock be dark against light cloud drivethither the light come from the side of the piece . after have exactly weigh all the circumstance of the two piece be consider whaj the master s 92 principal drift might be and find they to be a example of love or slattery of the sense wantonly affect the body without violence in the person of polyphemus in the first piece and in galatea a easy indifference without any passion for perceive she motion be smooth and her beauty in its perfection she be not attend by any cupid because such as have fin instead of wing usually wait on the nereid be so rejoice at this observation that can not express it . inquire likewise what might be learn from the second picture concludethat the author intend to express the unhappy issue of love in the person of ga latea passion both warm and sudden for the least disorderly affection put the chief member of the body in commotion and disturb the peace of the rest thatof polyphemus be violent cupid be subject to compafsion only as think wherefore he be represent cry possibly to shew childishiness for child commonly laugh or cry about thing which seem strange to they .commentonthe character in the aforesaid picture . polyphemus the sicilian herdsman the most savage and gigantic of all the gclop be accord to homer son of neptune and the nymph thosa the word gyclopsignify have but one eye in the middle of the forehead whereby some wouldimply the thunder and lightening accord to the greck name of he companion bront sterope and pyradmon and other effect of the air round whichthey be always attend in readiness at the command of jupiter the air theysay be place in the middle of heaven as a eye in the head thus the commentator on hefiod in he theogonia deorum origo deliver .hesiod say that galatea daughter of nereus and doris be so name from her whiteness signify parabolically the froth of the sea wherefore this poet afcribe toher white hair and face like milk he say further that some writer would by galatea allude to the sweet water which fall into the sea because nothing besweeter than milk and by polyphemus the air which love the sweet food . the youth aci be call by ovid son of the river faunus and simethis being both young beautiful and well shape . the triton be count by most of the poet son of neptune and amphitrita because the sea say vermander be esteem the mother or producer of manyftrange creature which its element be very inclineable to and the ancient heathen perceive thus somewhat wonderful ascribe to the sea some divinity as they also do to those triton whose help they implore in danger at sea but theywho examine more narrowly into the agyptian hieroglyphic say that the tritonby they amphibious form of be human upwards and dolphinlike dovnward be compair to the two watry virtue saltness and sweetness teach we thatboth good and evil spring from they nature and constitution to wit good fromthe the human nature and nothing but evil from the fifhinefs for ths human form say phurnutus be compare to sweet water which be proper for the aliment of noxiousto the animal of the carth and air and also to plant cause they to die and wither as we read in plutarch of the nature of thing . touch the nereid we find in plato that there be a hundred of they h e9fiod say hfty and give we they name of which glauce cymodoce galatea cyrene drimo deiopeia xantho arethusa phillodoce euridice nes e6e leucothoe spio thalia cydippe pafithea lycorias ligea ephyre opis asie clymene andhalia be the principal they lower part be hsnilike have give the poet occafion to feign that they be very beautiful nymph who accompany their god viz the ocean thetis neptune and nereus and doris they father and mothe and many other who signify the different quality and various effect of the water they be stile mother of the flood because the rainy cloud being exhal from the sea be the origin of flood wherefore on account of the virtue of the earth92 moisture towards the procreation of animal tree fruit flower they be worship by the heathen as the nurse of they .have largely handle the offspring and signification of the character in both harthe aforesaid picture we shall paf to general explication of the latter .mony in music arise from a agreeable mixture of discord and flat sound with concord and sharp one but in love it be otherwise where dissimularity cannot be bring to agree or two heart to join which do not sympathise by an harmony of humour the hideous make of the cyclop be frightful to the beau ac teous galatea who shun he for she dearer aci by pobyphemus in this last storywe learn that those person sue in vain who flatter themselves that they troublesome address gain the affae9ction of those who hate they contrarily aci blesswith the smile of he mistref shew we the danger of exposing ourselves to the resentment of powerful rival from whom at any time we must expect nothingbut death it may also say serve for a example of the power of beauty which so bewitch aci that he could not forbear love though at the expence of he life thus we be bewilder by we own inclination and bring to the place of inevitable misfortune where we be plunge in tear to the weak of we vital strength as in this fable of the young and amorous aci when galaiea transform he into fountain . opposite to these poetic picture see two other treat of love but differently as be the sacred story of samson and delilah the sense of the first bethis third table or picture . samson rest on delilahis lap he hair be cut off whilst he sleyt and the philistine lie in wait to seize hehere samson be sit near the center of the painting on carpet which coverthe floor and reach over three circular step before couch whereon sit delilah with he head in she lap she right foot rest on small footstool agaiastwhich he be lean with

shade be see the statue of venus on pedestal misteriouslyrepresent astaroth next it stand commander of the philistine with staff inhe hand he somewhat thrust out he head and if mistake not thene be more people behind he lose in the snade on the right side of the step close to the foremost column stand censor the smoak whereof ascend up the column the apartment be hang round with dark tapestry of

swarthy hue with black hair and beard and hairy breast he drapery be dark purple which fasten . with girdle about he body buckle on he side and gather about the waist ceme down between he leg cover the right thigh the flap of it finely folded lie sideways on the carpet the old woman92 head be bound with yellowish cloth and she garment violet or blue with streight sleeve tie under her breast and over she hip the young man with the scifsor be in short greensleeve coat the boy next he the same but somewhat more ordinary the haig of each islight and tie behind with white ribbon the soldier with

helmet be plain and of copper have ab dagger byhe fide and dark bufkin and sandal with string to the calve of the leg the person behind he have also a helmet in the form of dragon92 head he body be

the table be eover with sine red stuff hang down on each side . the floor carpet be dark and variegate like turkey work . the light of the piece proceed from the leavee0 little front as if from afingle window whereby the middle group and step receive the broadest light the soldier with the rope before the step be more light on fide the statue stand in the shade receive reflex light from the floor the commander of the philistine take little light on he shoulder the young man lade with the bag of money be with the table next to he in shade but the other bearer receive the light directly on he raise naked breast . second table or picture . after samson s 92 hair be cut off and he tie hand and foot he awake andfind himself thus wretchedly trap by delilak arise full of wrath strikeand pulh all away from he as well as he be able but be at last overpowerand seize . here in he fury he stand inithe midile of the giece turn with he left to the light and straddling hii feav elbow rise with the hand and arm down behind he head he right hand come forward with the elbow pull back by quite rope by one of the philistine he right leg advance and the leave fallsback back yield to the weight of he heavy body which bend backward two person lie at he foot either knock or kick down and the third lie on the right side against balustrade with one hand on the floor and catch hold of the pedestal with the other he head droop he spit a bundance of blood . on the left side of samson littie forward stand the commander of the philistiner punch he in the breast with he left fist and with the right

and check be swell behindsamson another stoop soldier be pull rope fasten to he right foot the aforesaid balustrade on the right side backward run towards the point of fight and the door be in the middle of it through which rufhi in three or four man shout and armed with truncheon stave and other weapon of whom the foremost with staffor half pike seem to strike with all he might at the reelsamson they fury be very great on this occasion . little to the leave behind samson and close to the couch delilah be see embrace the statue of venus and look back with astonishment she be somewhat high on the step which run crof the piece just beyond she the old willman be either ffn down or fall and with one leg little up shew she tokedness by reason of she garment somewhat turn up she have one hand on the sloor and the other come forward in the corner forward hang part of large curtain which cover part of the table whereon lie the money the two vouth mention in the former come run in fright endeavour to hide themselves between the table and wall the one be already half behind it and . the other be look back with he head between he hand . somson92 drapery lie half on the step and the refidue be under he foot togetherwith some weapon as half pike and headepiece of the slain the commander of the philistine have vestment reach belbw the knee and loose draperyabout he arm about he head be allight grey fillet fasten behind with goldribbon the main light take samson and the part about he delilab be in reflect light and deep in the piece . these two picture be not inferior to the two former in pafflon the ordonnance light and colour surprise I and induce I to think see the veryaction and lise itself be persuade that if iknew not that it be samson and . delilah must have guessedat by they make face and motion and what be most wonderful the fact and drift could not only be naturally see but also . it be cause and what the issue would be whether good or bad in the first pi e8ce . could easily perceive that samson be to be betrayed and if do not know it the circumstance oft he hair cut off money tell and rope at hand would make I surmise it yet this could not be do without bloodsh as in the fecond piece wlicre he be seize and ropedlike a ox for the sacrifice who if the firstblow fail rouse push down and trample under foot all that he meet with till at length tired he be master and thus lead back to the altar again just so it appear to Itruly we see few fuch piece so efficaciously express every thing as the apartient by work and incident be so proper so needful to explain the matter that the omiffion of any of they would have make the ordonnance imperfect what a effect have the statue of venus in point out the lasciviousness of this heathenisn woman do not the naughty old woman with the key in her hand plainly shew that she be in she own house not in that of samson or the commander of the philistine or of what use would the money on the table be af we see not by the bearer that it be not samson 92 for he be asleep and the money now bring in but if on such a occasion the running of the bearer and the noise of the money be think improper as discover the plot say there be no impropriety in it fince it be posfible to run barefoot over marblefloor without any noise and to set down bag of money without rattling allhere be husfi no body speak for every one know he business .. in the second piece delilad make to the statue for protection why do she yet she can nflee and why in such fear after samson be bereft of he strength not be easy she be toss between hope and fear and she anxiety make she catch . hold of any thing she meet with and as long as samson be present she retain her trouble the commander s 92 paffionate motion be think very proper for the dead body lie about he he would not have expose himself to the danger of approach samson have he not be securely tie now rush from he lurking place he fall boldly on samson possibly not so much to shew he own valour . as to spirit the other for he fook not at samson but at the soldier the oldwoman92 lie tumble down be not improper as be feebleleg and full of fcar and although she have noshare inthe action yet it be not repugnant to the story if only for delilah92 sake and for the same reason she be flung into shade . she garment turn up can be no great scandal to a ill woman . let we now confider both the picture but chiesly the signification of samson s 92hair and the love of delilah . we read briefly in scripture raany thing touch the hair of samson of whichhe be very careful because whilst it grow it become longer and thicker whereby he gain greater strength for break the rope witn which he be at any time bound but be cut off he strength forsook he and he whole body . be subject to weakness . by the person of samson the nazarean we understand man ehose by heavenand devote to its service for the mei of that order take as have say especialcare of they hair which give they virtue adorning the head the understanding which the more it encrease the more courageous we become against assault of we enemy by enemy endeavour to bind we we understand . h fbman inclination and the fire of concupiscence when now through frailty we be seduce by this delilah those corrupt affection whereby the lust of steepoverpowerwe and we slumber in she lap right reason become useless and we cease todo good thus we be shorn by the wile of woman that be by meansof voluptuousness we be deaf to the impulse of the spirit and then of course lie apen to we enemy both to scorn and crush we92 forworldly affair be so affect thatthat they have no sooner get the mastery but we find ourselves cross eitherby covetousnef love ratrid jealousy or other disquiet but return weselve or awake we become sensible of we folly and92 through contrition gra dually recover we hair and there by we strength and then die to sin we at once overcome both ourselves and we enemy . the hair cnt off also imply the weakness of the faculty of the soul or spirit or even death itself . euripide testify that alcestus could not die before mercury come from heaven to cut off he hair minos likewise could not overcome king nijus unless he fatal hair be cut off by he daughter and dido say virgil could not die beforejuno who pity she long agony and linger death send lris to release the soul from corporeal tie by cut off she white hair and offer it to pluto . these two last hisforical picture differ from the two precede in this thatthey be not mix with poetic figure as cupid or love mage 6 ra or rage and such like to help the expreffion of the paffion or meaning fince it be certain that real truth could not be discerned from fiction by mixture of both . and although the statue of venus inthis matter of fact seem to be of that nature yet it be nothing to the mean point but ferve only to shew that the plaoe was heathenifh and where probably such figure be common among that people .of the picture in the second story build after the doric order .after view this apartment which could not enough admire ascended the second story into another of more elegant architecture after the boric order this room be not so long bute0 little higher than the former and metthere with the follow picture . the valiant hercule after have perform many wonderful exploit not able longer to resist the indignation of juno he stepmother through smarting rage burn himself occasion by the poisone shirt of nessus which deianira had send he out of jealousy that he love lole daughter of euritus king of oecalia .jupiter much concerned at this carry he 92to heaven in triumphant chariot and place he among the star in the number of the god . this prospect be wild woody and mountainous in the middle of the piece little to the right near the point of fight be see alarge pile of rough wood lve crossway not as chop but rent afunder have root and branch . the upper wood be small and the under very large lie parallel with the piece . here the unhappy heroe the scourge of monster be lie extend over his lion92 fkin with he head to the right and foot to the left side turn somewhat backward and he breast lean over he face little rife and bendforward forward be see in profile from the right92 side discover resignation unattenedwith pain he left arm be quite raise with the hand behind under he head the other arm lay out little forward on the wood with the hand half shut andthe inside towards the body he right knee be wholly draw up with the foot inelining towards it the other leg be represent hang off as if he wouldlift himself somewhat higher philoctete before the wood little to the right kneel on he left knee support he bent body on he elbow and right knee . he look downwards hold before he face part of he garment as if he be weep and with toech in he left hand set fire to the wood in themidctle of the piece behind the pile on the second ground be see trumphal chariot finely adorn with carving and gild and child with garland of palm the foremost wheel like star appear sideways half behind the groundand the horse turn to the right almost front get somewhat higher . mercury be see entire tohis leave foot which be hide behind the ground on which foot lean back he support himself he advanced with he rightleg forward the burn pile with he right hand behind he wherewith he draw in the rein as if he be go to stop look back he be accost ju piter ride on the air and point at hercule with he left hand quite open and be 0 little foreshorten jupiter 92 upper part come forward with he leg foreshorten towards mercury point upwards with he right hand and scepter cross he bedy and in he left holding thethunder against he thigh behind the chariot above hercule to the right side the ground rise up hilly behind the horse be see high pine tree and eypress and some break stem and behind mernezy be other somewhat lower and further on the left side up to the horizon appear the sea and not far in it rock almost in the form of a affright man which judge to bethe unhappy servant lychas whowas flung into the sea by his master92 fury on thebeforemention rocky hilk stape smoak altar andnext it aburn firepan and the glub of herzule in the pannel of the altar be . carve ae9 agle with open wing and ithe thander in its bill sirring on fostoon of oak leave in the front of the piece on the leftside lay verv large body of a old tree tore up by the root and the hole in the ground thereby make be still apparent the root abound with fibre and the other end came forward to the middie of the piece where it go into the frame here and . there lay some may branch and stone throvn off they bafe on the ground by philoctete lay hercules92 ivory bow and quiver adorn with gold and of fize bigger than ordinary the strap be enrich with gold buckle on thisquiver be small inlaid or chase figure represent atrapo the last of the fatal . sister with she sciffor . this piece be strongly light from the right side little front thehill and altar anc hind part of the chariot be mostly in the shade of the tree the fore part of the horse and the upper part of mercury half wayhe thigh be in the light and the rest downwards with part of the ground be in shade jupiter place very high almost to the frame receive the light behind he head shoulder and arm and the rest of he body be in shade againstthe light sxy the tree behind the horse be pretty dark . philoctete .philoctete son of paan be array in sattin coat of armour of bright strawcolour the strap be gold embroidery on greenisn blue ground he .uppergarment hanging behind he and tuck up about the middle in the girdle between it and the hilt of he sword be crimson also embroider withgold as be likewise he bufkin he hair be fair and shortcurl he had little beard he helmet and halfpike lay by he the helmet be see little . inwardly and elegantly wring with gold and silver large white feather hang from it carelesly on the ground . the naked body on the pile of wood appear very beautiful the breast somewhat heave receive strong light the muscling of the stomach and ribs be well express but on the arm and leg faintly the toe of the right foot which have yet some motion fhrunk inwardly he eye be die and the balls draw towards the corner the mouth somewhat open seem either to send forth sigh or fetch breath or utter for the last time some moving word which raise the utmost sorrow in philoctete and melt he into tear as think mercury be almost naked have only small green filk scarf about he wherein stick he cauduceus . the horse be wing and the head of one appear but that of the other be behind mercury . this piece be particularly remarkable for the death of the heroe and donot lil agree with what we have before in this work observe touch the condition of man in very hot summer questionlef the poison not only workbe body outwardly but inflame and consume he very intrail for this reason also think he must die he breath be misty and he mouth gaped after coolnef he eyelid stiff and heavy through inward heat he could hardlykeep open he sight smothered by the steam and its motion retarded by the slackness of the optical nerve draw towards the utmost corner the sweat break out and he shine with wetnef chiefly about the breast over whichwave thin damp like the fume of boiling water which make he outline unite with the ground in this part it be that the unhappy heroe have the most feeling and where the blood leaviag the member and seek for shelter was retire to the heart he breast be swell and as he fetch breath heaveand set he belly be fall in and the rib be prominent he upper partto the navel be of warm and fiery colour yet fresh and beautiful as bealso he face he lip be not as yet dead nor pale but he hand and foot almost burn black he eyebrow appear draw somewhat upwards as one who though sleepy strife to keep awake the arm and leg be bare pale and shrunk as partake of death but the finger knuckle knee and toe be violet heighten with yellow about the rib and belly be see some red and violet spot of the poison and he line shove underneath at the navel hang in rag the major part whereof be under he body and thigh and partlystain with blood thus the illustrious heroe thunder to the wick lay in jupiter very much move cast he eye downwards fideway on the pi agony . tiful body and spake to mercury who look up at the celestial ruler with concern as if he be say ee look father he be expir no people w eare see thereabouts except those before mention nor any satyr or woodgod . it be certain that if any have be there hercule frighted they away in his rage the sorrow of philoctete be in my opinion inexpressible and the artist therefore with reason have cover he face but why paan92 son should be with hercule without servant could not apprehend but fancied it be because the painter think it unnecessary this bosomfriend alone sufficiently explain the matter second reason might be because the poet mention nothing of it andlastly because the matter clear itself so well that any addition would alter it and instead of a unexpected act make it rather appear as premeditate funeral solemnity whence we may well infer that the pile be not prepare for he but that he himself make it on sudden as the poet relate . this artful piece be remarkable for these three thing naturally and plainlyexpress to wit the fact itself what precede and what follow the begin of the tragedy be when have receive the poisone shirt of nessus by lychas he offer it at the altar to jupiter he father the sequel of he rage appear by that unhappy wretch92 be cast into the sea and metamorphose into rock after which he burn himself and he succeed triumph be shewn by the chariot whichjupiter send he for he deification renascitur ex funere phaenix . the conclusion to be make from the person of nessus deianira and lychas may be these . we learn from the centaur how dangerous the gift of enemy be the cause of the great heroe92 death in deianria we discover she imprudent and indisereet pafsion and the effect of she jealousy which make she the instrument of herhusband92 death and in lychas we observe the miserable reward of he service and that the misfortune of servant be sometimes by the great construe as to render obedience and disobedience equally culpable . over the door opposite to the former piece be see another in a octagon equal to the width to the door which take at first to be gap in the wall because it be little darkishi but approach find it thus . second picture . amphitryo be with alcmena in she bedchamber have before he go to bed lay the two child sphiclus and hercule in he shield under pavillion intowhich juno full of spite and rage cast two serpent in order to devour the two innocent especially hercule who squeeze they to death and flung they at amphitryo92 foot .forward on the left side one step high be see the two child lie inthe shield encompass with balustrade run from the forepart of the piecetowards the point of sight and which take up two third of the piece amphitryo at the children s 92 cry leap out of bed with a undrawn sword in he hand come to see what be the matter and have one foot on the step he meet withthe young hercule look at he with smile and grasp with both hand one of the serpent which he squeeze to death the other lie already at his foot amaze at this amphitryo start back the other child bawl out lay half tumble out of the shield with pillow and part of the cloath on the floor .behind hercule and beyond the shield hang the theban prince92 purple mantleover two halfpike which stick up slanting from the wall and be tie togethe over they little backward the baulk juno be see mount upward encompass with dark cloud with she scepter by she side in she left hand and with the other lift up seem to threaten with she fist and lookdown frow at the child somewhat further beyond the balustarde in the middle of the piece rise four or five step fetch in by a handrail reach ac ing quite crof the piece behind they at the further ene in the middle of the piece be large and deep compassniche or alcove have curtain draw upand fasten on each side with two ring herein stand the bed the apartment be eight foot high and hang with tapestry and over they as far as couldperceive the wall be divide into pannel wherein be some faint bassrelief represent warlike act on the left side of the alcove in the corner be round pedestal or half column whereon stand burn lamp alcmena muchconcerned stand somewhat stoop on the step look earnestly about with small torch in she hand which sne hold up high rest the other on the pedetal of the handrail and hold part of she white garment which buttonunder she chin and trail behind she hair be tie up in white cloth the hindwork be see by the torch in dim light except . the corner wherein the lamp stand which with the door adorn with fine foliage shew somewhat stronger from juno proceed some light ray darting on the child and thereabout this light be not like that of candle but of the day or thunder itmostly fall on the under part of the child in the shield he upper part and head with somewhat of the pillow tumble out be in the shade he turn in the shieldhe upper part one way and he under one another which be foreshortenamphitryo92 upper part almost to the middle be in the shade of the cloud receive strong reflexion from the child and the floor stand ponder how mlemena come by the light torch but on narrow inspection find large goldeandlestick stand near she by the other pedestal and wonder why alceus92.son have not take it yet on further consideration conclude that through hurryand fear he overlook it as usual on such occasion which alcmena perceive she probably jump out of bed and seize it such be this picture theie three light be finely and distinctly observe the lamp which be distant gave white or pale light but somewhat foggy the flame of the torch be almost to the wick cover by the cloud under juno which as far as could apprehend be a artful slight of the master in order to render the foremost light the brighter and stronger and to avoid the necessity of make the whole piece dark which otherwise he must have do for the sake of naturalness . juno have diadem and light blue garment she headattire be wild and her lock fly about like serpent . the poet mention that hercule be represent by the ancient as a example of all virtue as well of the body as the soul squeeze serpent to death withhe hand even in he cradle by which they give we to understand that man sitted for heroism ought from he infancy to shun pleasure and mortify carnal affection . now think to go out of the apartment to see what be further remarkable look up higher perceive another picture against the cover ciel cupola wise wherefore stopy to see it and examine whether it have any relation to the piece before mention find it to be the deisication of the aforesaid great heroe welcome by jupiter and the whole train of god and goddess . jupiter sit in the middle high on he eagle hercule crowned with laurel be see below directly under he stand with one hand by he side andhave a olivebranch in the other he stand front down to halfway the thigh in the forepart of the chariot which be on cloud the pole of it rose up little to the right side accord to the course of the horse which mercury was guide to the left side upwards sway again to the middle and with the chariot make semicircle so that the wing horse be see mostly from underneath they breast front and head towards the right mercury hold the rein in withhe right hand close to he mouth the chariot be surround with many cupid have garland and branch mercuary look towards the right at jupiter who with he scepter direct he to circle of twelve glitter star in the firmament which enlighten some small cloud in that quarter the whole celestial bodysit on wave cloud exult and clapping they hand the sun shine bright . be surprised that none have they badge of distinction except jupiter ridingon he eagle and hold the thunder and mercury with he caduceus in he hand and wing on he foot but on consideration that the god be well know to eachother direct my eye to hercule and observe that he be without he club and lion92 kkin which induce I to think they be burn with he body neverthelefs hisfrizzed hair and beard and fine mein convinced I that it couldbe no body but hercule in fine examine all the god and goddess one after another and begin to know they all to the very least apollo by he radiant air and beautiful body diana by she black hair and brown complexion bacchus by he jolly cheek and member asculapius by he long tress hair and beard venut by ber squab member and amorous look momus by he foolish countenance and so forth each have he propercolour venus92 garment be red diana92 blue bacchus92 purple ceres92 ftrawcolour monna92 green and yellow whichso distinguiffied they as to leave no room for doubt but juno and lris appearnot in they company because suppose the former could not bear the affront of see hercule thus honour examine further into the ornament of the apargment and perceive they be so orderly and well adapt to the subject as to raise wonder on both fide of the room range eight column of pisan marble crosscut into band pretty wide from one another on each side cf the door and in each corner one and between these two other stand close together with they architrave frize and cornice and thereon parapet with pannel fromwhich spring the cove of the ciel in the middle whereof be this last mantion piece in a oval compartment of oakleave and acron the metope inthe frize be adorn with foliage of the same fort of leave and in the pannels of the parapet be festoon with crown of laurel hang at they between . the two first and last column appear other festoon in oblong pannel and under each club and lion92 skin those feftoon be compose of palm branch withwith they fruit on both side of the door between it and the first column stand palmtree whose branch reach up to the cove project veryelegantly over the beforemention picture those palmtree with the frizal ornament be bronz the architrave and cornice of serpentine stone andthe frize like the column pisan marble on each side of the door between the two first column be large bassrelief of plain light and yellow marble . the one represent hercule asleep surround by the troop of pigmy the other shew he awake and hide they in he lion s 92 skin from this first proof of he valour he afterwards get the name of hercule primogenitus on the other side of the apartment opposite to this last hercule be see spinby omphale and in the other pannel on that side he shooting nessus round the cielpiece be twelve small circular pannel join together with wreathof palmleave these exhibit in faint bassrelief of fretwork the labour of hercule between they and the piece appear some lion head . before we proceed in we relation let we shew what the heathen understand by the deification of hercule . hercule the glory of valiant man shew we by he deification that those whoattempt that honour in they lifetime as anthony with he cleopatra do or strive to obtain it by intreate and cajoling the people as most of the persian kingand romulus do mistake the right method whereas hercules 92 whole life be ofken up in freeing the world from monster and tyrant and no divine honourbe pay he until after he death for eternity which he obtain only by death teach that true virtue will not be flatter in this life as aleander proved to those who be beforehand for call he god by shew they the blood which issue from he wound in the same manner as from other mortal . how powerful and virtuous soever man may be as long as he draw breath he can not call himself happy as be no more exempt fxom the tooth of bitingenvy than hercule be in he lifetime the heathen worship he as god accord to they superstition belive also that though alk soul be immortal yet those of valiant man pursue virtue attain a higher pitch of honour andpartake of the deity they even affign he in heaven hebe the goddess of youth for confort on account of he strength which be find only in youth . thus in aftertime the philosopher and poet empedocle vainly in immitation of hercule who make he frind philoctete swear never to reveal the place where he burnt himself nor what be become of he in order to induce the people to think he be take up into heaven throw himself into mount ama but he iron slipper be cast out with the fiery stone discover the case andthe truthbut to return to we relation . in go out of the apartment see on the pavement sphara mundi or terrestrial globe curiously inlaid divide on each side with compartment and cut with elegant band of costly marble and jasper which run to the center eachstone shew monster run off from the globe and such as hercule in he . lifetime have deliver the world from . could not satisfy myself with the fight of this work . but have at last see allthing here by fide pair of stair land on paffage

shade and he back front the light dog run before lookback at he accord to the custom of those creature beyond the capitol part of wall with its architrave and large compasshead gateway run to ward the point of sight this wall extend from thence crof through the piece by the point of sight to the leave fide and be divide by rusticate doric pilaster into square wherein be small nich out of this gate just below the wall some cattle as oxen cow goat and sheep be come with shepherd who atthe noise be look back this shepherd and cattle come in at the gate make I believe he come from the market because it be behind the capitol . over the wall appear several fine palacelike building as also column whereon be place she wolf with the two child romule and remus abovethe angle of this wall on the

especiallyin the middle and on the left side of the point of sight behind the house . the roman in those day except people of the first rank wear little or no va riety in the colour of they cloath they be mostly white or else light grey wooll for this reason as conjecture the designer of thefe picture have made the principal person to excel for perceive that the people be mostly in grey or

take infinite delight in see how naturally the occurrence be express and that nothing be supersluoussy intreduce though the story do not make mention of all the person who be bring into this representation . think it be truly of great moment that the principal part of story be well express and herein good master have work enough to give each person he due paffion to the end the matter must speak for itself but it become still more excellent by the addition of all other necessary circumstance though not to be found in the historiant after such manner that both appear natural . on

then be secure for the murder of he sister and accord to law fentenced to be put to death yet in consideration of he heroic action pardon on condition that he father pay as fine certain sum of money into the public treafury the picture as remember be thus second picture . at the capitol justice or the roman law sit in raise chair with the scale inshe left and polebe in she right hand in one scale

the example of charonda who to enforce he law stab himself in full senate for have act contrary to it and under lycurgus that of seleucus when for he son92 sake who by law have forfeit he eye he cause one of he own to be put out so strict be the ancient roman in support of they law over the throne hang two table contain the roman law write in greek letter of gold . this unexpected event much rejoice I wherefore full of desire go to third picture in order to observe on what basis so great work be build andfind it as follow . jullus hostilius choose by the roman people for they third king on account of he great ability and merit invade the alban territory though stout people andbear much sway in ltaly these weaken by many battle at last agree . with the roman toend the dispute by combat between three brother on each side those of the roman be name horatii and of the albans curatii the fight be glorious yet doubtful but at last fortunate for the roman for one of the horat after have lose he two brother mistrusting he strength againstthree such brave enemy add policy to he courage and by a artful sleight slew the three curatii one after another and thus get the victory . third picture . here appear the place of combat fence in on the right side be see the general of the roman force and on the other at distance he of the albans both sit somewhat high with they bage of distinction in the middle of the piece horatius be represent turn tail to the last of the curatii but return he run he pursuer through the breast whereupon he fall backward . the second little from thence be on he knee with he face to the ground and all bloody bear up little on he elbow he lay about the middle of the fence against post whereon stand the figure of fate or fortune in copper . just beyond this post lay the third stretch out on he back92 and at the end of the pail be see the two dead horatii over the valiant heroe victoryshew herself with the left hand crow he with laurel and with the right holdinghold out cap and staff to the chief of the roman who thereupon joyfullycome down from he seat with the acclamation and clapping of the people . opposite stand the chief of the contrary party astonished and turn he back in order to go away the people withdraw in tumult at the sound of the romqu trumpet leave the fieldbadge in the place on the right side behind the roman appear part of the townwall and on the other behind the albans up to the wall the field full of tent on low ground over the roman arbiter or umpire be see romulus and romus cut in large stone the fieldbadge of the albans be dragon or harpy in the offscape appear the tiber and the alp always cover with snow . thus be the plan of this artful piece which think no less wonderfulthan the other in force and disposition as well as naturalness every thing was exactly observe the paffion and motion so well express the place so piainlyapparent the quality of the bywork so proper and the light shade colour so advantageoussy distribute that could scarce believe it picture . could not but admire the three remarkable division of this story as first the beginning happen without the town secondly the sequel see within the town and lastly the end of the story or what be tranlact in the capitol without any thing of moment intervene from whence painter could make picture speak with respect to the different matter which opportunely offers to the thought and execution of judicious master . as the sense of the story be very particular so the three picture be as excellent from first to last in the first we perceive the lucky chance of arm or the valour of the heroe where by he gain the repute of deliverer of his country in the second we consider he as murtherer or the accident as bloody triumph and he elate with he success and in the third we see him malefactor condemned to be put to death or one who have transgress the law . truly those three event may serve for instructive example to all man dowe not see in they the common course of the world and that too great successand prosperity make many man proud and insolent and what do not their blind pafsion lead they to certainly unthankfulnefs to heaven be the prelude to many disaster and error lead they into the greatest danger however all thing be govern by providence . the middle of the ciel have large oval piece wherein providence be in the greatest depth represent sit on globe drest in gold stuff with her head crowned and about it twelve glitter star have in she right hand sceptre with a eye on top on she breast sun and on she knee holdinglook glass with she left hand she look be full of majesty and authority she point downwards at roma who sit little to the left side on cloud attend by religion valour and concord long life healih and prospezily come gently wave down towards she long life be beautful virgin in she prime with flame of fire on she head and serpent with the tail inits mouth in she hand health be asculapius holding staff about whichtwine serpent prosperity appear naked vouth crowned with laurel withcornucopiae full of fruit under he arm retigion or piety be drest like vestal vestal hold in she right hand cup emit slame and look upat providence valour be represent like a hercule with he club and lion92skin concord look somewhat more compose than piety have in she arm bundle of rod which cupid tie with red ribbon roma drest in white or light blue under purple robe embroider with gold hold in she righthand pike and in the left laurel branch on she head she have a helmet and buskin on she leg . now we ought to weigh the meaning of these thing providence be to be consider as the chy ruler of worldlv affair debase and raif empireas she pleafes the three gift of long life health and prosperity be bleffingflow from she the corporeal virtue be the effect of might whenee theyproceed the first be religion the second valour and the third concord these establish roma in she power and increase it in relation to art let we observe with what ingenuity and uncommonnef the master have executethose picture say uncommonness since never see they handle by anyother after such manner first providence be in the greatest depth and accord to guef thrice as big as the life the three gift which sne senddown be somewhat lower be not half so big and the undermost to wit roma and the character accompany she be still smaller yet somewhat larger than the lifeprovidence have no bound always maintain she uncontrol power without diminution and though the three gift which slow from she be but small part yet with respect to the undermost figure they be much bigger andkeep among they they own form as reign over they the three otheron the undermost cloud be but corporeal virtue be therefore much smaller than the preceed and appear with less majesty nevertheless roma excel and shew herself bigger intimate thereby she growth and improvement she sitting on cloud imply in my opinion she rise above all other power of the world . this would be monstrous design if art with respect to perspective benot duly observe but by this means the piece look so perfect that judge it could not otherwise be good for the undermost group as quite low be very strong the middlemost accord to its distance somewhat fainter and the uppermost very faint and almost imperceptible . this emblem bear mysterious interpretation and may in general be apply to all the government in the world provide the figure of roma be alter and another substitute as thing require instead of asculapius we may represent health by the figure of woman and in the place of hercule the fame take for valour a heroine hold a oake branch in she right hand with lion on she fhield . in treat formerly of this sort of fable we have call they emblematical carry mystic sense whether they be mundane or spiritual however as distinction between boch and to shew that this be mundane and historical we must observe that it be not intermix with any emblematic figure whichhave spiritual sense except those of asculapius and hercule which thereforein this work reject as unfit and onlyproper for poetic and fabulous subject ject as if instead of roma be introduce troja or age which be dominion no where now subsist but in the poetic writings we find that this emblem like its subject be not only mundane and heathenisn as the storyof horatius prove but that therein be also exprest the force or mysterious sense by those heathenisn figure . now if it be afk why this ciel piece do not allude to the person of horatius as that in the tenth chapter to hercule my opinion be that the conclusion of the story so far as it respects he be contain in the second picture for here we can not expect any deification nor do the god interfere in the matter they regard only those who be reckone in they number such as aeneas hercule memnon and other of godly race . ch ap xiii the fable of calisto adapt to the corinthian order in the upperstory . be delighted to relate here in four piece the wonderfully embellishstory of calisto and she deification as not unworthy in my judgment to adorn so fine a apartment as this last which be of the crinthian order andvery magnificent as well with respect to the extraordinary thought as their artful turn the conclusion whereof render this work most perfect . the first piece be as follow . calisto tired with hunt go to repose in the shade of the tree jupiter enamour with she come to delude she in the shape of diana and gratifyhe paffion notwithstanding all she effort to the contrary . there on the right side of the piece on a eminence the innocent creature be sit under the tree not at rest but full of concern shame and dread melt into tear with she hand on the edge of fountain she tress half loose hang carelesly over she naked shoulder she chaste bosom be above half bare and she leg uncover to unseemliness sufficiently shew she sorrowful fate jupiter the author of it be see little off next the middle of the piece above the horizon not as disguise or pretend diana but the chief of the god shine with majesty with he diadem on he head and inhe purple robe not as thunderer with lightning and tempest but onlyattend by he eagle the cruel and degenerate lover seem to deride her forrow have he left hand up at he breast as if he mean that he have got he will wherefore penetrate the cloud he advanced through the air forsake the miserable woman the unmerciful incendiary cpid be extinguishinghis torch in the fountain look at jupiter who with he pointsceptre command he to do so diana be see in the offscape in valley with she retinpe of nymph the landscape be delightful and woody hereand there appear some river god behind calisto among the tree stand term of priapus in shade attentively view the aforesaid three figure andreflect to myself how well they act they part clearly open the matter even to th e9 very term which though it might be place there accidentally yetsecond the unhappy calisto bemoan she misfortune and full of shame and fear and discard by she mistress be seek shelter in solitude yet the jealous juno spy and find she there . on the left side of the piece appear the superior goddess of heaven glitter coif with peacock92 feather instead of diadem or royal head ornament and seem to turn about as she be step on eloud in or der to go upwards she be dress in she blue garment and hold she sceptre in she right hand on the right hip charge hellish rage or revenge whichattend and be at she back to punisn the innocent calisto and lift upshe left arm and the finger streight up she with severe and envious look reproach the oppress creature with lie with she confort revenge was beat with serpent and adder besides she smoak pitchtorch the miserable calisto who now have no more of she former shape except she cloath which fall prey to the hellisn fury there lay the quiver here the bow yonder the girdle as conceive it be she bear who shook off those cloath and be take to flight be now metamorpose into so frightful monster by the immoveable jealousy of juno she in she flight look up to heaven feem by she bellow to move jupiter to piety this landscape be also dark wood fill here and there with sleep rivergod among the tree appear some wild beast run about and lion in bottom on the right side near rock drink at river up and down arise some palm and other tree .after this piece another present the subject whereof be this . arca son of the delude and now metamorphose calisto be fifteen year of age when accord to he custom go hunt he meet with frightful snebear which come towards he not to hurt he as he think but if poffible to make herself know to he vet ignorant that she be he mother stoutly prepared to shoot she .jupiter from heaven see this in pity hindred the matricide . third picture . here on the right side of the piece arca appear gently step forth frombehind some tree and put a arrow into he bow in order to shoot his mother unknown to he in that shape but mercury sly down suddenly withhold he arm at whom he therefore look back the celestial messengerstare behind at the shebear which be on the second ground intimate withhe staff in he left hand that she should take to flight which she seem to do fhie stand upright with she underpart towards he and the upper turn to the leave sway towards the road the way she take be apparent beginfrom she foot like dust or thin vapour alter by degree into cloud whichrun wind about she and at last mix with the air wherein jupiter appear yet very faint and almost imperceptible in the cloud by he on he right sicle but somewhat lower and more forward sit the three fatal sister of whom clothe cotho be spin the thread lachest wind it on the reel and atropo ready to cut it which jupiter observe lay he left hand on the scifsor hold up his sceptre in the other with he mouth little open she surprised at this turntowards he arca stand astride with he breast project behind he on and near stone lay some game as a hind fox hare together with garment which judge to be he low against the say stone lay rivergod withhe vase this landscape be woody like the other the she bear about the middle of the piece appear in the shade against the light offscape on the leave side on the second ground or at the extremity of the first be ruin tomb with some cypress and behind on further ground arise large rock .after this be curious to view diligently the cielpiece as the concllusion of this artful work and find it thus jupiter affect with the sorrowful fate of calisto do notwithstanding juno 92.hatred glorify she with the radiant brightness of the northstar which among the constelation be name the great bear and be follow by the little bear into . which she son arca be transform . fourth picture . underneath in the piece the youth be see fly upwards pursue he mothe with bow and arrow and support by some cupid he appear backward without any foreshortening with he right arm with the arrow extendand the other with the bow behind have quiver by he fide jupiter somewhat above he on the right side sit on cloud and largefize be witha erect sceptre shew he the zodiac wherein particular bright star appearedt very ghitter the bear be see rife little beyond the say star lookback upwards and be encompass with great shine light in the shape of star which enlighten the whole piece she hind paw rest on the cloud which beside she from jupiter off to the left fide rose under she quite on the left side sit juno on the rainbow look envioussy at arta she lean shehead on she left hand with the elbow on the rainbow and lay half turn to theright she under part incline towards arca and the upper fromhim she right arm and sceptre cross she body at she foot on the cloud lay some watergod and goddess as subdirector of the cloud and dew behind she stand shepeacock with its tail so spread as seemingly to serve for diadem lris appearedt look upwards behind she with a hand over she eye to shade they from thebeam of the star diana and apollo sit behind she juno and those sitting beneath she be shade by the driving cloud above diana apollo and otner look smill jupiter appear directly in the light of equal height with thejuno belittle lower and the rivergod and arca beneath she he be . bear.youth of small size receive he light from the star above . thus the work conclude with the deification of the unhappy calisto second . time metamorphose it would be troublesome to rslate all the particular of it and . and needlef to the know wherefore ishall only subjoin the general dispofi ac tion ofthe light and shade part japiter and arca be strongly . light againstthe blue of the sky on the right side juno contrarily on the left side where the star be dark the foremost watergod under juno receive little light from above hold he hand over he eye . animadver sion . this fable clearly stew how beautiful body be pollute by uncleannef for in fhort time after calisto be deliver of she son arca juno transform she as punishment of she unchastity into shebear beast so deform as to be reckone among monster the aforesaid evil have such direful effect that the fruit or child of unlawful love mortally hate they guilty parent foibeautystain with unchastity be of no account in the eye of the virtuous and what before create wonder be now mark of infamy ovid in a elegant and artful manner assign calisto notable place in the northern hemisphere and shew ju no 92 intreate thetis that those star accord to the belief of the heathen might never refresn themselves in the sea in order to pourtray wonderfully she eternal shame as surpass the other capital star and have such station near the northern pole that as this pole or point of the axis be above we horizon thisstar whatever course it take can never be out of we sight and therefore her crime be as little out of we memory . but more christianlike inference may be that the pollute soul abhor her crime by true repentance gain most glorious and shine aspect besides fix station in the heaven set a example to other like mary mugdalen whofe crime through repentance be not only expiat but by a incorruptable glory intirely blot out . the truth of this story take off the poetic mafk be that arca son of jupiterand the nymph calisto teach the arcadian who pretend to be the most ancient people of the earth nay older than the moon as plurarch intimate in he gzd roman question boast to be sprung from the earth and therefore make great account of the oak and beechtree and they fruit after king pelasgus have teach they to make it they food which before be only herb and root to till the ground and sow corn which knowledge he learn of triprolemus son of cre and afterwards to make bread of it also how to weave wooll clothsfor cover they body likewise inure they to many civility in acknowledgnent of which benefaction and in honour to he they name they countryarcadia which before be call pelasgia as pausanias in he arcadia testify . ch ap xiv description of the inward view of the temple of apollo . we hhave before in treat of painterlike beauty describe the outside of this temple we shall now accord to promise shew the inside of it step into the portico see over the door of the entrance carve lyre whence infer that this edisice be sacred to apollo go into it was transport with the sight of all the fine thing so artfully work and of such rich material . in the middle stand the figure of the god on high pedestal at the four angles of this pedestal sit the four season each hold a horn sill with the particular fruit and flower of the scason all these be of beautiful plain white marble the figure of apollo be naked crowned with laurel and hold sceptre in its hand .the floor be inlaid with variety of costly stone in the form of terrestrial globe in the center whereof stand the aforesaid figure . the archwork be azure blue but could not certainly perceive it to be mofaic it be adorn with the seven planet and other constelation all in gold .near the window between the two pilaster be nich sill with figure each represent one of the month of the ycar they have the form of young man and be cut in whitish marble . the whole building consist also of marble but not so fine as that of the figure for here and there under the nich in the moulding and about the window it be veiny in basement run round the temple be carve continue bass relief the figure ofit be about four foot high and of fine white stone the other inside division be the same as we have already describe it to be without the undermost part be compose of the lonic order the middlemost of the roman and the upper of the corinthian . over the sirst cornice appear term instead of pilaster these represent the hour and with they head support the cupola they be inthe shape of young virgin to the number of twentyfour it would be tedious to describe they and they badge of distinction singly and the rather since caesar ripa have so handsomely do it . next take notice of the orderly disposition and proportion which be ju dicioussy observe throughout the building for apollo92 figure be as guess eight foot high and those about he seven foot and a half the young man represent the month be seven foot and the term for the hour six or six andhalf this proportion not only seem so large but the imagine height reallyappear to I to be such without abatement for distance as see from underneath reflect on this neatness ithought it strange for people of sense nay great great master to agree that large window should come over small one or giant be set above young child and how such thing should look become . the undermost baf relief consist of smaller figure than those in the upper work not without reason for the walling wherein they stand as well as that figurework bear throughout the building nevertheless he who duly consider the matter and such sight will soon alter he opinion for since apollo or the sun be the largest of all create thing and the chief of the universe observe by the heathen by he quality among irrational creature as the father of the four season he be the biggest and principal figure the four season bring forth byhe be somewhat less and the month inferior to they in bigness to which the hour must give way again because twentyfour of they make but one natural day we ought also to observe that the four season be of more composecountenance the month reprefent young man still grow and the hour shew nimble virgin . be not this division very elegant with respect to architecture since every thing keep its relation and property good architect employ he thought about all those particular object in the compartion ofhall and apartment accordto which good master ought to accommodate himself in the painting of building . th ari of paintingbook ix. of the painting of cieling or plafond . chap of cielpainting in general . among all the part of painting none be so difficult as that of than a upright piece on wall or over chimney this be ow to ignorance and a indifference in some people what they cielingbe daub with so as they be but quickly finish dazzle the eye and cost little formerly they be content with foliage slightly paint for save expence and that in place of consequence only whereas now accordto the present state of the painter and time they can have other thing for the same price and the painter make no great matter of it they lay hold of the opportunity cause the whole ciel to be sill with history and emblem whether they be suitable or not . we sce that all thing from small beginnings improve and at last come to perfection through the industry of judicious artist even so it be in painting for remember to have se ebn many cieling with figure landscape seafight battle without any foreshortening as if paint on a upright wall and otherwhich be represent from underneath more or less and yet withojf foreshortening as also some which foreshorten but have no point of sight whenceit be evident that without regard to perspective such piece can not possibly be bring to the aforesaid perfection now for order sake let we examine into the name of this branch . the word plafond be french and signify flat or level superficy fit to be cover with board or cloth whereon to paint or plaister such representation or ornament as we think proper consist mostly of history with fly figure sky with bird flower and many other thing but the true sense of the word plafond import ciel of hall apartment temple or gallery even all that hang over head and be parellel with the ground such piece be called opticat because they must be view from a assign distance without which they ainavoidably appear misshapen as we shall hereafter shew . in the matter itself we ought to consider the nature of plafond or cielpainting and wherein it differ from wall painting as first in the foreshortening of the object and secondly in the colour speak with respect to the objectcontain in one and the other such as building balustrade figure and other thing occur in ordonnance all which in a hanging picture retain their perfect height and breadth shortening in thickness only whereas in plafond or cieling neither height measure nor proportion be to be observe in word every thing foresshortens except the bafis and the cap or top what be round remain so and what be square keep its angles whether in the middle in profile high or low as for the colour they doubtless must also differ much from thoseof hanging picture for they ought to appear more beautiful not only in the light but affo in the fhade mean in clear light as we may eafily apprehend .we ought moreover to know that by means of optic or practical perspective we can make crook thing look strait hollow or rise one flat and even andcause they outwardly to appear what they really be not as the famous niceron and other have plainly demonstrate wherefore we need not wonder that so few painter excel in this branch of the art since they be little conversant withthe practical part of perspective though without it it be impossible to execute good cielpiece it be certain that many painter be rash enough to undertake such piece of work and sometimes they happen to perform good thing for laboriousness and daily practice often contribute much nevertneless they do not inquire whether they method be the shortest or longest commonly chuse thatwhich first offer drudge witheut certainty and lead by meer chance . chap ii of the usual difficulty in cielpainting . irst we be at great stand because we can not use the life either in the nudity or flv drapery though they be the principal object . secondly because we can not without great trouble find the true and certain place of the figure we introduce for which reason they must mostly be done by guess . thirdly because we can not duly view the work as long as it be on the easel . whence lastly it follow that the master be always in pain for the effect of the painting in be fix in its place . these difficulty be not little vexatious even to one who understand his business for it be otherwise with those who make more use of they hand than careful than other paint as many cieling as you please as long as you do not believe that there be grounds and rule for it and remain in this ignorance you will never surmount the aforesaid difficulty the most skilful master be often at loss in this part of painting let we then in the first place learn perspective andwhat it shew we since there by only we may arrive at this laudable study whichotherwise be impossible . chap iii of foresborten object in cieling . vt beobvious that the offscape in common picture be the part which retires or go off from we leffen and grow faint and that the horizon be a utmost distance limiting we sight .contrary in cieling we offscape and boundary of sight be the firmament or starry sky whereby object the higher they be lessen the more even to insensibility not only in they proportion and neatness but also in they colour . here we ought to observe that all object of what shape or form soever keepthey due breadth provide they be parallel withthe horizon for instance placc square stone so as to be view directly against it or figure in the same manner . here you see that the top and bottom in plate lxi we exhibit square body of the say stone keep they square and that the upper and under corner of it fall perpendicularly from the point of sight moreover that however the say square be turn thetop and body always make right angle and consequently the hindermost extremity be parallel with the foremost it be the same with figure of other object . place for instance man on one or other side of the piece stand upright and the point of sight in the middle let he be in profile and have bothhe shoulder of equal height and you will then perceive that the shoulder fromone to the other keep to they full breath and they figure its full thickness fromtop to toe thus we see evidently that there be no other foreshortening than inthe length or to say better in the height and the more the figure or other object rise and approach the point of sight the shorter and more misshapenthey become because in they breadth they retain they measure and proportion as before have be say this be principal rule and ought alivays to be observe . as for building bosse9 give full precept touch they in the latter part of he book of perspective vet have room to say that when we would place column over column for gallery we ought to draw rise line through their center from the basis or ground to the point of sight even through each balister and thus find the due proportion of they height as well as the breadth by the help of gradation line . this with respect to proportion must likewise be observe in design figureand other object as shall hereafter shew by example . this fort of painting be not only the most artful but also the most difficult as have before say because although we understand the rule and practice of it it appear nevertheless disagrecable and deform which no one can bebe 0 judge of but the master himself unless it be put up in its proper place and see at the due distance . chap iv of the size of ciel figure . he figure which we paint in cieling ought not to exceed the common size of man to wit six foot and a half when they be so low as to be even with the ciel but be higher and sit on cloud or fly theymust lessen and go off as perspective teach yet we may represent the deityas big aswe pleafe provide they be not paint with more strength than other figure it even sometimes happen that when they almost vanisn out of sight they have yet human bigness . eun shine be the most proper and agreeable in spiritual representation . as for the glory of each deity in particular they keep it when they appear to man but when they be represent in heaven it be mixture of many smaller pro ducing one great fhine to do this artfully be not matter of the least consequence and he be great master who instead of dark thick and heavy cloudlike woolsack place he figure on thin transparent and almost inseniible va pour . it will not be improper in this chapter to mention something of fly figures in the air . though the air be seldom without wind and this may always be somewhat perceive it be nevertheless not advisable to make it appear in cieling because if the wind be stir the sigure sly before it would seem to be motionless and contrarily those which be sit or stand shew as much violence as the sly one for this reason no wind must come into the piece but what the havelocity of each sigure cause that we may plainly see by what motion the draperie be sling as also the place the figure be go to or return from one gently wave and the other nimble and swift . the different stuff be very proper to this on such occasion and they verymuch conduce to express the matter as the ressexion of ruffle silk for wavefigures figure and which be gently descend thin and sleazy silk for swift and downfly figure and the most pliant or thick silk or stuff for sit lie or standing one the secret and importance of fine stir ciel piece lie chieslyherein. as for the making of the coloured stuff of fly figure because they can not be put on the layman and therefore not paint after the life we can not lay down any rule about they nothing but good conception and natural judgment join to continual practice and observation can bring the artist to perfori it we must use these means and be perfect in they observe whatstuff be most proper to the occasion as we have before intimate . we ought also to take dare that the thin stuff be warm and transparent againstthat the fly figure never seem to be upright as if stand much less to be standing but always sit kneel lie or sly unless in the case of peo ac ple suppose to be on cieling or gallery who then be either stand staning or kneel as the subject require . let I say that we ought sometimes to make some addition to the disposition of the general and particular object but with as much caution as possible thatthe inability of the artist and the deficiency of the work may not appear . chap method for view cielpiece on the easel as if on the ciel . have already observe the difficulty arise in cieling with respect to the use of the life and in lay down rule subservient to it now have my sight should certainly find out some but since this be impracticablewithout figural demonstration and can not possibly verbally do it ishall nevertheless shew some method which though they may seem trifling have always be of service to I and of little trouble in they use .after sketch my ordonnance upon paper fix it against low ciel then take look glass and sit under it with ease exactly considerevery thing observe what be want in it and thus mark and correctfault as much as possibly could next draw each figure whether nakedor cloath after the life in such manner as shall hereafter be shew then dcadcoloured my piece with such light as think proper after this take the look glaf again and hold it over my head in order to view commodiouslythe piece stand behind I incline little backward on the easel as if it were against the ciel and casting my eye every where first on the general design and then on the particular part this exame repeat till by several correction find that have bring the piece to my fancy here be mindful not to take too near distance to the end the glaf may take in the whole piece for for which reason sometimes get with the look glass on chair or table andhave my pallet and pencil in readiness and bring my piece into such forwardness finish it without further look back . will now for the service of those who may find it useful and necessary also treat chap vi of design after the life for the use of cieling painter . the must not flatter ourselves that ciel painting can be perform without good knowledge in proportion since as have be say we can not conveniently make use of the life for how great soever you skill may be you will find difficulty enough though the life be before you to bring it on the eloth nevertheless to shew that it may be do and that have often use the life ishall for the service of those who be not sparing of pain lay down mymanner of do it . after have set the model whether of man or woman on a high place becording to my sketch sit down on the floor with my back against the scaffold with lookglass between my leg which move and turn about so long till the model appear in it in such manner as want accord to my point of sight and then design it on draw paper as correct as possible paintafter this design without any trouble . as for the dress manage they in the same manner casting the garment on the layman accord to my sketch mean without sly which be thing impossible and depend only on imagination then place the layman thus drsed on a high tressel and sit down against it in the manner aforesaid and made design of the dress if it be fly or lie figure make shift with packthread wire or such like means as well as could sparing for no trouble when the matter be important and have mind to do something fine .use the same method in design after all sort of plaister as face vase urn ornament capital festoon of flower in order to have they from underneath thus master the greatest difficulty occur in this study . however do not this before my cloth be in readiness for it that might not mistake since notwithstanding all we care in some thing especially upright standing object we may easily be deceive . as to the preparation of the cloths for we design as likewise the deadcolouring in order to sinish and there by refresn we memory shall now treat of they .first six the point of sight either within or without the piece as my place of standing direct then strike with chalk thread from the say point as many line over my piece as find necessary to serve all my upright standing object viz baluster column pilaster figure which suppose to be perpendicular pendicular also strike some diagonal or slope line from that side of the piecewhence the light come either right or leave parallel and equidistant from eachother these put I in mind how high or low the light fall on my object ifthey run parallel with the base the object be light entirely from the side if oblique or sloping as before be say they lighten little front and if theyfall from on high from the point of sight the light come directly front as bevisible in the example numb in plate lxii .tthink myself oblige here to propose to the artist small practice of myown invention and in my opinion of little trouble but certain great advantage tociel painter fince we find that although there be certain rule yet theycan not be put in use without the greatest trouble application and loss of time unless aid by some practice or other or by some artful instrument like astronomy which how demonstrative soever have its globe and astrolabe architecture its plan and level geometry the oval triangle square and compass eg mathematics algebra but to return to my invention . first mould some wax puppet as we have shew in thef4th chapter of orwire some long other short whereon to stick the puppet and keep theyfrom bend whether they be make stand lie sly or sit thisbe do take a oblong wooden trough line with tin of what bigness pleafe into the corner put some pin or serew to fasten cover of woodor tin fitting the trough and make full of little hole wherein to stick the aforefaid wire puppet and so as they may turn easily then ifill the trough withclay or knead bran and thus my machine be in readiness now when imake use of it stick my puppet bend and turn accord to my design on the wire and through the hole into the clay where would have they one high another low one stoop forward another lean back as the subject require which will then stand immoveable . my scheme be in this forwardness lean the whole machine back on ta ble be the light leave or right and then slightly design the figure in the manner have shew with the line can give the machine such light as desire either from afide front or from on high common sunshine or candlelight . now for perfect this sketch and conveniently painting after it set my layman with such dress as each figure require in the manner before lay . down and then my cloth be ready proceed to painting . invent this machine in the vear and put it in use for about five yearwith great advantage and with such exact reflexion that afterwards have no furthe occasion for it though never use more than three or at most four puppet . now the curious artist must also know what observation lmade in the use of the machine . first as plate lxiii fhiew put one puppet come directly down quite extend namely with the head and foot both on line and then observeserve that there be not the least foreshortening all the part have they full length . second puppet set upright stand in profile on one side of the point of sight and find it foreshorten in all its part . third set sty upwards from behind forward and perceive that the member foreshorten somewhat more than those of the first and somewhat lessthan those of the second .fourth place sit with its upper part upright the thigh parallel andthe leg like the upper part and observe that when it be quite in profile the upper part and leg foreshorten and the thigh keep it be full length as it also do when in al front position . have make firm impression of these thing in my thought ihad no furthe occasion for that method .we shall now say something chap vii of the colour of sly figure . herein we must observe that in cielpainting it be the same as in landscape first we rub in the greatest light of the fky then all partabout it next the highest and most faint object and then the lower and more near one and in case balustrade be represent it must be the last the reason of this ihave shew in treat of the deadcolour of history and landscape .moreover as in fine landscape the sky principally govern all thing andwithout it no proper distance can be give to the picture so it be the same in cielpiece with figure sly through the air for it be impossible to make object rise unless they have some communication with the air nor be it enough for object go off higher and further from we to be paint fainter and fainter as in draw or print but the colour must also be shew and as the air be colour so must the object partake of it imean in they shade for if the air be blue yellow or red the shade ought likewise to have mixture of blue yellow or red . as to the light of the object we must observe that of what colour soever itbe it break and grow darker as it go off even be the air as may sav snowwhite it break by distance or air interpose the red become violet the yellow greenisn and the violet blue as the object go off from we and approach the air they be darken white become darker pale yellow the same and so on in other colour . something still remain to be remark with respect to object in the air viz . that since the air communicate light from all part the broad shade can not possibly be so dark as in landscape or other part but contrarily the dark touch will be so much the stronger all that be in shade ought to be lighter andsee more plain yet somewhat ley than in the light it must be likewise know thatthat round object have no furface especially on the shade side that be to say the outline against the sky ought to unite and vanisn not quite scumble away but make somewhat lighter on the edge as we have clearly demonstrate by the example of globular body book chap imply that such work in the air differ from other to wit that the object against the sky be more roundand go off . chap viii general observation in painting the cieling of hall gallery . he first and principal observation on these occasion be that the quality andregularity of the architecture be firmly preserve in all its part . the second observation concern the grandeur of the architecture as bethe main matter painting in this case be only to be consider as a aid to accomplish it with less charge wherefore such care must be take that the painter92 design do not mar those of the architect but that both unite in such manner as to induce the eye to take every thing for truth itself . by the first observation that the architecture ought to preserve its regularity we give to understand that the structure of the room must chiefly be regardby the painter in he ciel piece so as not to be hurt by make opening wherethey ought not to be for it be not allowable to make they every where as big or little as we please the ciel must remain ciel all that be without the painting as the summer ought to have they proper thickness and be last for instance let we suppose the ciel divide into three pannel line with cloth one next to the window the second in the middle over the chimney and the third to be next the wall that in the middle be between two summer one foot in andthe two side one lie almost flush with the under part of those summer nowif the two side cloths be like the middle one adorn with sky and the thicknefof the summer which be one foot not paint on the cloth the ciel on thoseside be so much weaken or at least seem to be so and be heavier in the middle contrary to architecture whereas to make it look natural and accordto order the ponderosity must in this case be on the side and the middle part lightest that it may not seem to be fall on we head moreover we ought to observe that there must be but one opening and that in the middle sincethere be but one point of sight and but one place of stand to view the work to advantage as for painting the thickness of the summer only faid it to rectisy mistake often commit when ciel be make all over open and instead of cover nothing be leave but grate which can not be justified somethink it may paf for lantern but they be mistaken for lantern rise and ciel lie flat moreover the whole cie can not serve for lantern because of the the window in front the principal or middle piece must predominate and of consequence be open and the other close mean not to have any sky or livingcreature but bassrelief foliage compartment or flower all of such colour as suit with the apartinent this judge to be the first and principal care and study of good cielpainter before he set about the work for in the division of ciel it be as with diamond the largest and most valuable be set in the middle and round it the less and less . as to the second observation that the art of painting be aid to architecture and enrich it at less expence the point be plain wherefore shall proceed to shew the reason why the one may spoil the other . in painting division it often happen that the summer have not proper restto lie on especially when the ciel be cover all over and the summer hide with single cloth and leave to the judgment of a ignorant painter who then without consideration divide it into three four six eight or more pannel andthese part by paint summer which do not bear on any thing now to prevent this vou must let each summer rest on discharger pilaster or cartouche as architecture teach for instance be you to divide the two pannelnext the window and wall each into two part in order to have four pannel this would be improper and against architecture because of the flatness over the window unless it be compasshead and then it would not do without cartouche . if it be afk whether the division be painter92 business say it be so far as he understand architecture otherwise more proper for a architect at least itas to the work where the painting may disorder or be contrary to architecture it lie in the design when they do not suit the building nor perfectlybear on foundation or have they proper weight by the foundation of the painting mean the apartment and by the weight of the design that what the painter intend to exhibit in he ciel piece be not too heavy and seem to press down the under part the better to clear my meaning will suppose roomto be twenty foot square now if second depth or upper room be to be represent the pier column door and window thereof must need accord with those of the under room and bear upon they and in the next place the course of order ought exactly to be observe as architecture teach that be to say the heaviest must be undermost first the tuscan next the doric then the jonic next the romon and lastly the corinthian and so upwards lighter and lighter which lthink be seldom observe and the reason be because the figure be sometime represent bigger than the life which necessitate the artist to proportion he by work accordingly a unpardonable error and not at any rate to be justify but ishall say more of this on another occasion and now pursue we purpose in cieling principal point be that the work rise and that its force unite with the life that be that the object in the lower part be not paint stronger than the fix work as compartment bass relief and other ornament which not be foreshorten receive they light through the window now it may be afk whether in case we be to represent a apartment above with the same light light as below the force of light and shade must not be the same and say itought not because of the great difference between they as we may easily suppose in two column set over each other receive they lighr from one front the one from the undermost and the other from the uppermost window here the upper base must have no more force than the under capital for be it otherwise it would seem to be nearer it would also not rise and consequently overpower the life it be here as in fine landscape where the foreground have the greatest force and the second and third be lef and fainter in proportion as theygo off it be the same with sly figure for the light weaken by they rise and the shade become as well as in room by the surround air weaker and fainter but the touch and shade keep they force . we have observe what be necessary to the stability and regularity of the bechitecture with respect to painting so that both may seem to be one body as we shall exemplify by the follow fable out of ovid propose here as painter like simile . salmacis and hermaphroditus two accomplish and agreeable young people introduce represent architecture and painting salmacis meeting hermaphroditus and imagine she happiness lay in the possession of so beautiful a object fall in love with he but find repulse she invoke the aid of the god and there by obtain she earnest suit the young man not daring to resist the will of heaven give up the cause and be by mercury whom we must observe here to be optic join to she and thus of two body be make one furthe application be needless since the simile sufficiently explain itself . now to continue we subject the follow observation be at the beginning of the work chiesly necessary . first the condition of th e9 place . secondly the quality office and inclination of the owner and what subjectbe proper thereto whether history fable . thirdly the disposition of the subject . fourthly how the subject be to be divide . first by the condition of the place mean the light of the room and in what manner it take the ciel also into how many pannel the architect have divide the ciel and which be the principal that we may adapt we thoughtthereto in the disposition of the reprefentation as well as in the execution of they .secondly by the quality of the owner we must understand whether he be divine or lawyer philosopher or artisan and whether he incline to spiritual or moral general or particular representation that be such as relate to he or he family in particular or generally to any one who may live in the house after he decease accord to which information we ought to chuse subject suitable . thirdly how the subject ought to be dispose namely what must be placeabove in the air wherein as be say lie the soul of roompainting and what below as touch the body of it this we divide into spiritual and moral spiritual all that be govern by heaven and moral every thing that be directed by we judgment . fourthly how the subject be to be divide here the principal piece in the middle must shew eitherthe cause or rise of the story or the effect of it the next to it must exhibit the matter itself and that further off a appendix to or inference from it but to make this point plainer shall give a example . in the middle pannel place solomon before the ark of the covenant praying to god for wisdom and on each side represent surround with glory the gift which god bestow on he as wisdom and rich flow down and inthe lesser pannel exhibit in baf relief the corporeal virtue on this footwe may handle any thing or subject whatsoever and by have due regard to the aforesaid four particular and well execute they such representation will certainly please every one even envy itself . hence we may sufficiently perceive how orderly we must manage whereforeit be no wonder that so few excel in ciel painting though it have rule as wellas other study but if these be not duly observe we can not gain the point he that set up for good master must shew that he understand he art . if be afk whether think corregio cortona vovet and other who perform wonder in this branch have always so punctually follow the rule and so nicely regard all the observation here lay down accord to my apprehension answer that it would have be better if they have do it or elsewhat say must as have shew in forego chapter be ow to the ma ac chine with puppet which make use of for four or five year and afterwardslay aside for we ought first to have thorough knowledge of thing and then demonstrate it but be further of opinion that have the great master perfectly know the prescribe rule we should not find such great mistake inthey work as some now think there be nevertheless it be most certain thatnone be qualified for this judgment but those who have make it they practice for he who understand the rule and retain they in memory can always judge whether they be observe or not though not able to do it himself yet theywho work only by guess and know nothing of grounds and rule be more unpardonable than those who be acquainted with they and do not use they though both blameworthy the one for he carelessness and neglect of learning and the other for he knowledge and neglect of use it . be very sensible that some will make little account of many thing by I deliver as necessary but be in no pain for that if can but give satisfaction to curious reader . must own that in my juvenile year daub some cieling but never flattered myself that understand the art so as ought because be then ig norant that there be any certain grounds and rule nevertheless afterwards attain they by sometimes hear other discourse about they and by the rule of perspective and by my own indefatigable application to so noble study insomuch that at last could sketch large and grand composition with more certainty and less trouble than formerly little one must on this occasion relate what course take . have in my room little jutty closet and when be to make a ordonnance pin my paper against the upper part of it and have candle in in one hand and crayon inthe other lay myself on my back and scratchmy thought on the paper this find to be good method for preventmistake mean in the sketch now for the painting it also do it againstthe ciel yet not after such slight scratch for have make my sketch take out of the print of vovet and other such action and posture as be pro per alter they either in the face hand or fold of drapery more or less by guess as well as could thus make shift yet all be do against the ciel whereby you may judge what trouble have as well in find thingas afterwards in execute they which really be double work but when better inform sit commodiously at my easel he who proceed with certaintyhave great advantage above other . chap ix method for draw foresborten building figure tree after the life . ince it commonly happen on nature92 deny she favourable affistance that we have recourse to we wit for means to supply the defect it be even my case in ciel painting after have give myself much trouble to no purpose and take useless pain in order to design every thing after the life lat last find out the follow method which have make I full amend it be veryprofitable in all place with low horizon as you will perceive in the use . suppose then for instance that be to make design of the stadthouse at amsterdam it be no matter if it be thrice its present height and this without look up chuse station or distance of eight foot more or less from the building as occasion require then take convex look glass of about foot diameter to be buy at the nuremb toyshop and place it against the inside of my drawboard or portfolio contrive it in such manner that it may either stand upright or lean back accord as would see thing either from beneath or higher thus approach with the open portfolio and myback towards the object till the building tree appear as would have it and then design it from the look glass on blue or white paper . this method be very convenient for draw all sort of large work in narrow place or street even view of twenty or thirty house it be also useful to landicape painter in they country view they may take whole tract of land with town and village water wood hill and sea from east to west without move cither head or eye it be likewise proper for those who be ignorant of perspective . we must here also shew method for represent all sort of foreshortenflatface ordonnance whether picture hanging or baf relief against wall cieling or any where else either stand hanging or lie and that with certainty accord to perspective these be thing which painter ofteen meet with in exhibit room gallery garden and other place and the method for for do it though not attend with difficulty yet sometimes puzzle thosewho neglect it . have therefore choose the example in plate lxiv which be the foundation of all foreshortenings as well of apartment as cieling and the performance be as follow have make the scheme of room in perspective divide the height and width of the side wall where would have hanging or representation of picture into certain number of diminish foot fetch the crofs line from the point of sight and the perpendicular from the plan or scale . now in this example we perceive four principal foreshortenings for bethe ciel side wall the floor do loose picture hanging forward allfour proceeding after one and the same manner from the point of sight as the middle part shew which be divide into square to say more would be useless and tedious to those who be in the least conversant with this art . chap of the harmony and union of colour in ciel piece . lthough in the chapter touch the deity and they quality we shall treat of the colour proper to they we must on this occasion say something previous and shew how the colour ought to be place and handl in order to create perfect harmony . you must not herein by any means be know by flar strong and glittering colour be of opinion that on this occasion nothing suit better than the union of the colour because it be agreeable to the eye cause fine relief and contain something uncommon even supernatural and when pretend here that in ciel piece you ought to use tender and weak colour even bethey mostly fetch from white do not contradict my asfertion in former chapter to wit that particular colour be assign to the deity accord to the nature and meaning of each as red purple yellow blue green and even to be know by they without they usual token of distinction as phabus withsun diana with the moon mercury with he caduceus cere with she ear of corn jupiter with the eagle juno with the peacock momus with he fool92 cap and bauble they who can give they piece such a exprefsion are principally commendable andthe painting must look well neverthelessdo not hereby confine the lightness and darkness of the colour whether theydiffer little or much from each other or whether they ought to be almost all white or light since the colourmay be beautiful be they ever so light . even be ciel piece to consist only of white and black light and shade it would have no less decorum nor be less valuable think it in this case to be much like print which though consist only of white and black has yet its harmony and decorum when light and shade be well dispose against eacheach other and still more with the addition of proper colour and those thinlyand transparently manage whereby it get the property of picture . as the principal goodnef of ciel piece lie in a artful disposition of the figure above each other so it be of no lef consequence that the colour be well adapt thereto .will now give a instance in two piece differ from each other in lightundermost depth strongly set off in colour against the second which be little dark and the third be light against the dark blue of the sky in the latterwhich think the best on account of decorum the uppermost group be dark against light blue sky and the undermost by the force of light set off againstthe uppermost even be we thus to dispose three or more grounds or groupover each other it would look very decorous and each deity would neverthelesskeep its proper colour yet less in force in proportion to the distance for when the uppermost group be set off against the light sky it cause wonderful gooff and the reason proceed from the sky92 seem to be infinitely higher whichcontrariwise can not be effect . if it be object that supposing one of the principal figure in the uppermost group ought accord to its dignity and the reason lay down in the suit of colour to have white dref and therefore the aforesaid position will be overthrow ldeny it for it will be help by dispose some dark cloud behind which will preserve that garment in its force and make it have pleaf harbehind each other we have more largely handle this point and shew its truthand decorum for dark against light can not advance with so much force as the light may against the dark because the light have greater strength in itself however to put a end to point of so great latitude which by discourse can not be fully demonstrate shall conclude it with the great junius who in he thirdbook of the art of painting say ee thus we see that artist in they work ereate shade or depth to the endthat the part to come out may approach with more force and seem to meet the eye of the beholder even without the picture let two parallel line say longinusk be draw upon cloth with light and dark colour the brightnef of the light will soonest strike the eye and seem to be nearest and little furthe quote johanne grammaticus he say ee lf we paint board with whiteand black the white will always seem to be nearer and the black further off . therefore 92 92 continue the same author in he observation on this point ee the painter also make use of blackisn or darkishbrown colour when they be to represent the deep hollow of well cistern ditch bottomless pit or the like . but when on the contrary they will make any thing come out as the breastof woman a hand hold out or the foot of leap or run horse they lay on both the side sufficient shade of black and brown colour in order thatthese part may by the neighbour darkness be flung off from the picture with lively force . chap x i of the deity in sacred and profane history and fable and first of the difference between facr and profane representation . ave do with treat of ciel piece think it improper to aend this book and make new one of the follow chapter becausethe matter have such connexion that we can scarce think of the one without fall presently on the other . it be certain that in common picture the deity ghost demigod angel virtue and other power may likewise be introduce nay be even inseparableadjunct but into ciel piece where the upper part be the sky they must of necessity come because the major part of such representation relate either to they person quality or virtue . now duly to execute this representation of the deity the artist ought chieflyto be acquainted with the sacred and profane story as well as with the poetical fiction that he may learn from they the particular occcurrence and pro perty peculiar to each person and rank of the deity or upper power and represent they accordingly for although imagination must in this point lend great assistance yet it be not safe for every man to rely eatirely thereon lest he should be deceive like the man whose neighbour dream that in certain place be hide great treafure and awake and go thither find it bydig and carry it home he on this good luck lay himself down on an heap of poppy in hope of the fame happinef but after long sleep he awake without any advantageous intimation from he dream contrarily findhe pocket pick and thus at once be bereft of he hope and the money he before have in possession this simile be too plain to need nearer application . judicious master must certainly be well exercise in the knowledge of the true condition of the thing he be to handle that he may not be think a ignorant for the truth can not be hide with respect to the inventor wherefore you ought to take heed of mixing this truth with salse thing especiallyin sacred story or spiritual representation since there be so great contrarietybetween they that they can not be join unless to shew the disagreement say they can not possibly be join in order to express single meaning but willrather serve to confound weaken and mistake it except they be separately dopose the spiritual above in heaven and the worldly below on the earth . speak with respect to emblem for there be great disparity between pallas andthe wisdom of god since the latter can not be attribute to any person and much less represent on the earth the same may be say of janus and providence . the heavenly and civil justice be also very unlike we must therefore note that the whole lconology or science of the heathenisn figure though formerlyaccount heavenly have now no relation to the soul but to the moral virtue and merit of men. let we then enquire with reverence what be chriftian emblem and what profane or heathenisn use in spiritual representation nothing but what be pure and heavenly and in the worldlv all that be proper to they in order to gain the esteem both of religious and worldly person . passage in scripture mention the driving lucifer and he companion out of heaven whence we may plainly conclude that those monster afterwards fall to the share of the heathen as no longer pertain tothe faint but we do not find after that time any more such unruly spirit be expel heaven wherefore we benot allow to represent more such iiistance but in the case of man see to battle the true faith thing may be accompany and represent with heathenisn emblem because as be faid the heathen give themselves up to the devil the better by that mean to express they error and shew the truth thus also drivethey out of heaven . it be upon occasion likewise not improper or disagreeing with the phariseor hypocrite but have greater weight in fictitious story or parable nor can we without offence introduce other emblem than christianlike when theyonly tend to incite to salvation in which case we may represent angel or spirit to keep those hypocrite out of heaven . in true profane history as the roman grecian and other this managementwould be improper but we may lawfully use hieroglyphic and other character of which there be a infinity for instance by religious person white garment or a offering cup by cruel one tyger92 skin or dragon either on he helmet or shield it would be preposterous to place vestal virgin by numa pompilius in order to shew he religiousness or achiile by alexander to express he valour or a hercule by milo and still more ridiculous to set a herrule by hercule to pourtray strength or fool by momas to exhibit solly it would fay be veryridiculous to explain ovid by emblem sce he give we nothing but emblem . this would be scek light with light or enlightening darkness with dark cloud we want not another sun for express the92 sun92 light but these representation and by work must only tend to the exhibit invisible thing by visible object . the more noble and lofty the thing we be to represent the more valuableought to be the emblem we chuse for they for instance in express the toture and quality of the deity we use young and chaste virginitye0 state in allage account the most rare and valuable but in represent the paffion of man we make use of beast or else inaniinate character and object for being of lower rank than the deity they must also bear lesser object . if now it should be object because represent eternity by serpent and the purity of the deity by lamb that this be contradictory to my own position believe with respect to the former that any person will be of my mind on fair consultation of the most ancient heathenisn representation of it and as to the latter scripture and chiesly the revelation of st . jjohin in niany passage exhibit the person of christ in the form of lamb and as the lamb of god nowsince all this have a hieroglyphic meaning why shouldnot be allow to fetchmy emblematical thought from so pure and rich fountain of wisdom thus deport myself withrespect to other fuch object which represent some quality of the doity bur those of later inxention endeavour in 92this cafe to avoid a as possible . moreover scripture in many place deliver itself in hieroglyphic term compare anger to bear bereft of its cub meeknef to lamb innocence to dove subtilty to serpent . chap xii disquisition touch the representation of the trinity . tany will think this fubject beyond the reach of what we have hitherto handle and inconsistent with art but be of contrary opinion for tenderheart artist have on account of the many difference among christians reason to be in concern for this point since so many occurrence offer in scripture where the aliighty be either act in some form about mankind or bepass by as glory to make he presence know . the greatest part of christendom holland england and part of germauy excepted allow with one accord the representation of the person in the trinity as first god the father in the fhiape of a old man with long grey beard andhair secondly jesus christ as he appear in he humanity and thirdly god the holy ghost in the shape of dove in which shape he descend on jesas cbrist at the time of he baptism . now if accord to the letter of scripture be to represent adam and eve find it necessary to exhibit the creator of the world and maker of adam in vifible shape fince it be write that he make adam of the dust of the ground and breathe into he the breath of lifenow he who be to make something or breathe into something must humanly speak have both hand and mouth . as scripture also commonly shew we a apprehenfive quality ofthe almighty why should be more culpable for represent he under the same than under that of triangle surround with glory and contain some hebrew lettere0yet we divine be of opinion that this last be allowable but not the former . be not then the one figure as well as the othere0 or do the jewifh character or the inanimate shape of triangle make any alteration besides thefe reason do not picture tend as well to inftruction as welldigest speech wherein the orator in order to be understand be oblige to use figural way of expreffion by parable or as writing wherein we find the same method for understanding it since the aim of both be by the perception of the hearer to make they difcourse have a impreffion on they mind even the writing contain the matter do it not confist of letterfigure which by certain method of uaderstanding we comprehend for it be not the matter itself . think that the learn world and artist represent the first person of the trinity rather in the shape of man than of any other creature on good reason for we learn from scripture that god create and make man in he own image and from the aucient father that man be a epitome of all that god create who be therefore call the little world fome even call man the masterpiece of god we ought therefore if we will take some likeness from the creature to express the almighty by the most perfect idea to be find in order to exhibit he perfection and thus to make the copy in the best manner like the original and the more as scripture in feveral92 place make mention of the head eye ear mouth lip armis foot hand and other member of god which thingmust not be understand in carnal and literal sense accord to the opinion of some ignorant people who imagine god inhe nature to be like man thathe sit in heaven on throne accord to passage in isaiah the heaven bemy throne and the earth be my footstool and asin another place the same pro phet say ee see the lord sit on a high throne and lift up but infigural and spiritual sense think then that painter have no nearer expreffion in suchrepresentation where god himself be act than to exhibit he figure in an human shape as best agree with those likeness we paint he aged in order to shew he majesty and wisdom which be more to be find in old age than youth and with sceptre and globe and circle of star about he head to shew he omnipotence both in heaven and on earth but roman catholicsdaily make addition . ifthe scripture represent he godly person under mysterious sense why maynot the artist be allow to do the same do we not read in the revelation what be . mention of god in a human shape be it not plain enough or must it be object that this description be apocryphal but grant it the relation nevertheless be not account heathenish any doubt which might arise from it donot affect the point with r e9spect to shape in an f4ther place we find that the highpriest hide himself that he might not behold the lord but the lord putfinger on he eye till he be past by how can represent that paffage with out body or be it no fact the prophet isaiah say ee behold the name of the fire now to make this know to person who can not read and be deaf be itnot more easy to do it by representation than by sign be we to make only mouth send forth flame lave this so proper for such nian92 apprehension as whole figure moreover be not mouth likeness and figure as well as whole image what then be they pretend who allow one part of the crime and not the whole lf it be crime let it be intirely forbidden and if good or at least sufferable intirely allow and perform nevertheless we must nothow before these thing mnch less worship they but the true god only who be thereby mean can we observe facrifice otherwise lave not that mysteriousrepresentation or in better term figural demonstration when it be say can the facrifice be burn upon the altar and the child of god be bowing before it pray beseech and give thanks in all submission scripture scripture in several place speak of the appear of god to man eitherreally by the ministry of angel or in vision by dream or by extafy therebe so sine description of god under the shape of a old man in the seventh chapter of daniel that no artist can better represent it the same scripture also mention several appearance of angel in human shape for which reason the church in the second council of nice make no difficulty in allow artist to doit and chiefly painter to represent god the father as kind loving old man and the angel in a human shape . it seem also that painter have the privilege to paint and represent inanimate thing as live accord to the idea which scripture afford he and the spectator must not be offend when in some picture he find sacred subjectattend with poetical fiction for they better explanation on supposition the latter be impious be not the psalm of david solomon s 92 song the book of job and the revelation of st . john the divine all deliver under poetic figure not to speak of the parable besides mention in scripture .painter therefore be not blameworthy for bring in something that beheathenisn in order to clear the matter and especially if the fact happen in an heathenisn country thus the great raphael in he passage of the child of lsrael over jordan have represent the river under a human shape violently turning the water back towards its source . as scripture often lay down such and the like thing under some figural description it give painter full liberty to do the same fince in order to accommodate itself to the weak apprehenfion of man it usually deliver many of the greatest mystery under figure and parable as it speak of the river in psalm xeviii also make no scruple in he picture of the finding of mose to exhibit the river nile by a human figure but there be calumniator in he time as well as as there be now he be charge with atheism for mixing truth with lie and have no more regard for either than to treat they alike yet if we look nearer into this matter we shall be convinced that the learn painter be not in the least tincture with atheism do it not happen in heathenisnagypt be not pharaoh92 daughter present do she believe the truth which was only manifest to israel certainly she do not since therefore the fact lay ina heathenisn country and be do in the presence of but two hebrezo woman the other be ethnick this great artist have not trespass either against the christian faith or against the art . and although at the first view wellgrounded objection may be that with thing which relate to religion no false god or deity worship by the heathen ought to be mix and that it be sufficient for painter to represent river in its natural course and not in a human forin yet the objection be easily aswer for scripture reprefent the water and the noise of river under an human form as in psalm xeviii where it be faid that they clap they handand be joyful moreover the agyptian never worship the river but the crocodile live in they and isis under the shape of cow as ovid and other writer testisy . since then scripture make use of allegorical speech painter may also exhibit he subject under symbolical and perceptible likeness in order to be the more intelligible to the spectator without fear that he work will mislead faithful christians or strengthen heathenisn superstition for painter who have no other language to express himself by but figure ought to make use of they if he would be understand .ruben who of all the painter handle those symbolical figure in the most agreeable and learn manner as we may particularly observe in the cardinal infant92 entry into anizverp and in the painting of the luxemburgh gallery betax by some with mixing in those compofition truth with fiction but how easily be this judgment to be refute by shew the use that judicious artist make thereof for fiction be here not at all mingle with truth but only tendto make truth clear to sight and apprehension and thus more plainly to express it by the fictitious character and emblem . pray observe in he birth of the french king lewis xiii how that excellent artist have exhibit castor with a artful sway on distant cloud siton he wing horse and opposite to he apollo who in he radiant chariot bedrive upwards in order to shew that this prince be happily bear in the morning hereby it be evident that this ingenious master have no thought of represent deitic as deity but only to denote by castor as account an happy constellation the king92 fortunate birth and by apollo the time of the day which be in the morning appear by he chariot92 mounting up from the horizon . but further to clear my thought touch the representation of god the father shall before end this chapter subjoin the follow observation . the prophet ezekiel in he first chapter mention that he see the almightyfrom the appearance of he loin even upwards and from the appearance of his loin even downwards as it be the appearance of fire and it have brightnessround about wherefore by this and other instance of scripture we suppose that this sacred figure ought never to be represent without glitter or gloryfrom head to foot even in such manner that bigger or less accord to the place occafion and decorum and spread around gradually thinner and fainter like clear and transparent vapour it at last insensibly unite with the bywork and disappear . now to reduce this to painting we ought first to design the figure of the almighty whether sit or stand in heaven or on carth in the most perfect form and countenance yet much bigger than any heavenly or earthlycreature this you must colour with single tint or ground little darker than the glorv and afterwards heighten with light then with large brush soften the figure so that neither its outline nor any edginess or sharpness of the partof the face hand or foot which ought to be touch very gentle and faint be perceive just as if it be view through silk gause steam glaf or thin mist in short like thing see in camera obscura observe that the figure do not receive any light either from on high or from afide or from behind but in front only and about the most relievede part although the whole piece piece have another light it must moreover have no other shade than in the deepest cavity and those very faint . we have before cursorily shew why we represeat the almighty as venerable old man and shall now further insist on the point though without reference to all the paffage in scripture which might serve we purpose in daniel chap vii it be write the hair of he head be like pure wool and he garment white as snow the reason whereof say gregorius nazianzenus be to shew thereby as by a infallible take he clean and undefiled be whereforethe wise euscherus be also of opinion that for the same reason the choir andmultitude of angel be represent in white other compare it to the human shapc and would thercby allude to infinite duration since nothing be so eternal as the godhead which remark here because some scrupulous person be of opinion that we ought not to represent god the father in such shape actorned with white garment and grey hair . and on this account all nation have by a universal consent think proper to perform divine service in white garment and ornament the white have alsobe at all time appropriate to the holy service wherefore the poet persius say he be worship in white . but what be persius92 say to we since the raiment of jesus christ when he manifest he glory to he disciple appear as white as snow cicero lib say the white look best in all stuff but especially in the wave one in order to exhibit what be holy and godly . it be therefore necessary to represent the almighty in white garment however it be not improper to make it look more natural that you keep it little yellowisn as light by sun or like the glory which surround the figure . but in all this painter must be very discreet and not abuse the licence allow he by scripture and the consent of the father or by he art pervert the sacred truth or slight they . chap xiii of the glory proper to angel and heathenish deity . vave shew in what manner and on what term accord to myljudgment to represent the almighty let we now inquire how the angel in they power ought to be exhibit .gregorius nazianzenus say that the true property of the angel when they appear in bodily shape be to have bright glory and glitter garment we sind the angel thus describe in mait xxviii in mark x viin act many other place of scripture . this glitter light of the angel ought therefore by all means to be observein most of they appearance as for instance in those to abraham and in the deliverliver lot out of sodom where they smote the lustful people with blindnef for it be ceitain they have something more than human since abraham salute theyas lord it be not likely that this honour proceed from they costly dress jewel and other precious thing about they but from some heavenly or uncommon addition .further proof of this glory of the angel be the sore press of the sodomiteupon lot and they not covet either he or he daughter or any other strangerprobably live among they but only these two young man to be bring out in order to know they and perhaps because of they more than human form andcharming brightnef if now this glory have shone too strong they would have ac perceive some deity and forbore they wickedness for it can not be imagine that any man should daringly and knowingly strive against the almighty . but before we proceed further imust here deliver my opinion touch the person of jesus christ which be that in he humanity and before he resurrection he ought to be represent without the least shine or glory since he be made in the likeness of man and would be like he bretfiren in all thing except sin as scripture testify but after he resurrection he should be shew with gloryas we read he appear to he disciple on mount tabor and in other place as have then put off he humanity in its principal purpose now to proceed . we have further instance of the appearance of angel as in those who came to manoah gideon and tobit and he who smote the people of jerusalem for dovid92 sin of the first scripture exprefsly say that he foretel mannoah the birth of samson ascend in the flame of the altar possibly in a augmentation of glory uniting with the slame of the offering by which doublebrightnef the parent of samson be strengthen in they faith and hope of the birth to come . if this glory now be paint too strong and like lightning it blind we mortal eve and thus the patriarch abraham could have view it no more than the prophet and leader of lsfrael mose when god appear to he and pass beforethe blind heathen have glimmerings of this truth for when semele presumptuously defire that jupiter might once embrace she in the same majesty as he do juno in heaven and insist on it notwithstanding he dissuasion to the contrary she be on the requeft grant intirely consume by the attend gloryof the god insomuch that with difficulty he save the child he have by shewhence it be plain that the glory even in exhibit the heathenisn deity ought to be observe since in they appearance to man either by night or day to bless or punisn they they retain tneir full force glory and majesty andthis be weigh they must also be represent glitter beautiful in aspect and shape and in raiment of a elegant colour as much as possible and the nature and use of the picture will permit as we haye before hint in the handling of colour in ciel piece . but when the deity appear among man as man then they ought to be like they and not eafily distinguishable otherwise than by they mein as for instance in the story of jupiter with calisto apollo with dophne jupiter with lycaon mercurymercury with argus and the like in such case and that they might the better play they part they transform themselves intirely into man and be perfectlylike they lay aside all godlike glory and shape as if accord to the opi ac nion of the heathen they mean that there can be no union of the divine with human nature . as to the motion of the heathenisn deity many represent they appear in active posture as walk run and other motion but it be as contraryto my own opinion as that of the great bishop of hippo heliodorus this learnman and great searcher into heathenisn antiquity will not allow they to go or walk when see in they majesty but only to wave or seem in some measure to walk yet glide like fhip move gently along by the wind without perceptible motion they ought always to be set out with thin cloud of whichsuch as be nearest they receive greater and stronger light . chap xiv of the representation of angel and heathenisb genii . yhe almighty in the beginning create a infinite number of angel or heavenly spirit who in scripture be distinguished by name as seraphin cherubin throne power archangel angel . the first as be nearest to the glory of the almighty be always representyoung and harmless and with six wing accord to lsaiah ch vi.the second be exhibit only for the sake of motion and to denote the efficacy of eternal happiness which they undefiled purity and childish form give to understand .the third who continually attend god92 justice as dionysius arcopagita st .paul92 disciple write be somewhat older and more fullgrow and of an agreeable sway and motion cause by they appearance no fear or fright but joy and gladness in people92 mind .the fourth be appoint to execute divine vengeance in the punishment of fin and wickedness of these one be so strong that with the almighty 92 permission he smote in the camp of the assyrian man king xix cron .x xxii isaiah x xxvii these be represent bigger than the former have stern countenance and violent motion be seldom or ever naked but in coat of armour and with flam sword or thunder in they hand or else shield on theiz arm with the name of god glitter thereon by they unexpected appearance they cause not only fear and fright in the wick but continual remorse without repentance . the fifth manage great and courtly affair asguardian lead man to the knowledge of god they be of perfect form and modest countenance . the the last protect we from all hurt and be particularly ordain to excite us to virtue and dissuade we from evil act x ii these accord to dionysius as be the eldest in the lowest choir or hierarchy be represent of large size majestic and quick in motion . there be still another kind call evil spirit or damone or devil plato call they cacode6mone or know and crafty these afflict the wick andinduce they to all manner of sin as blasphemy unchasteness gluttony drunkenness lie defraud murder they shape be various even as .many as there be sin and although they endeavour sometimes to mislead men under beautiful appearance yet they be always represent by some takewhereby to know they either on they head back hand or foot such as fin bat wing vulture or eagle claw bear paw dragon tail also holding light torch pitchfork purse murdering weapon crown fetter yoke serpent and adder and with flame issue out of they mouth in word any thing that betoken evil .as to the angel beforemention who in all age have be representwith wing scripture allow we the liberty so to exhibit they for the almighty himself shew mose the pattern of the ark of the covenant and the cherubin in this manner upon it can any example be more perfect than he more instance in scripture may be find in the prophecy of daniel ch ix vi rev iv ezekiel . have thus far treat of the representation of angel we shall now shew the opinion of the heathen not ill agree with the same meaning .plutarch tell we that the ancient roman have also they tutelar guardian bythey stile genii or birthgod but they be not represent as angel or sitting upon cloud or with wing or glory but as wellshape young man between sixteen and twenty year of age and without beard have long light hair compose countenance and easy motion and dog92 skin over they upper part . the reason of this cloath be as chrysippus say that they as good spirit attend we from we nativity be guardian of we action in reprove vice and reveng transgrefsion as often as we prefer brutality before humanity which the genii abhor pursue and barking at we in order to awake the conscience of which opinion be censorinus and several other whom he quote add that these spirit watch so narrowly that they never leave we incitewe to virtue in proportion as we forsake vice and covet felicity but why needwe these example we saviour affirm that the angel have charge over we to conduct and preserve we as we have before say wherefore the heathen bythis emblem have also rightly stile they genii guardian . censorinus likewise testify that the ancient consider they genii as god of procreation either that as we have say they take care of we or be bearwith we for which reason they believe there be as many genii as man andthat each have he own or else that there be twice as many and that each man have good one and a evil one the former persuade to virtue and the latter to vice agreeable to what christians say of they guardian angel and the devil this last not fail to afflict mankind though not bear with we as the heathenbelieve of they genii hence it be that some represent the genii in the shape of serpent other as child or young man or else as greyhead old man conformable to the philosopher cebe in he hieroglyphical table . zoroaster and the ancient philosopher have make distinction between the animal consecrate to the good and evil genii accord to they dog fowl and the tortoise be proper to the good and water animal peculiar to the evil .the ancient often exhibit the genii crowned with garland of horehound the leave whereof much resemble those of the vine or else with chaplet of diver fort of flower as tibullus in certain place say ee the genius be adornwith beautiful chaplet of flower when he name and festival be celebrate to he honour each person worship he genius without know it in celebrating his birthday and those of prince be especially keep by every body with great splendor wherefore he who falsly swore by the genius of he prince which was account very great oath be a immediate delinquent . since as be say the ancient have two kind of genii good one and an evil one accord to the socratic euclid as censorinus relate we shall now consider how the evil be represent . do not find the ancient have any statue or resemblance of they but we read as writer testify that they appear to many .plutarch appianus florus and other report that as bruius one night according to he custom have betaken himself with light to he apartment for meditation he see before he the likeness of man but very frightful black and cloathin wolf92 skin who be afk who he be answer be thy evil genius brutus valerius maximus also write that the evil genius appear to cassius of the curse tribe of marcus antonius little besore caesar cause he to be behead this genius appear as large black man about fifty or sixty yearof age have long hair and dirty matt beard and be cover with wolf 92skin down half way the thigh . the temesian formerly inhabitant of abruzzo country in iraly have also very evil genius of black colour and frighful look and cloath in wolf92skin do that people much damage as paufanias and suida testify . chap xv of sacred emblem . the defign of wellcompose sacred emblem be principally to edify andto incite to virtue represent it to we as look glass not so much for the regulation of we body as we soul and by such means to bring we to happiness . these emblem be either general or particular general when they suit any person whatsoever and particular when they relate the one only when their subject subject be piety or virtue learn liberty peace of mind and such like theybe general and applicable to every person who possess or endeavour to polsef those quality but when particular person be they subject as the virgin mary a apostle or other virtuous man who excel in some particular gift in such case they be particular or singular we ought therefore in the former fort to observe that the main matter be spiritual and in the latter corporal the one exhibit learn itself and the other learn man or philosopher one shew peace and the other peaceable man one represent piety and the other pious man the one be the matter itself and the other he who possess it however judicious master will make distinction between spiritual and corporal virtue between natural inclination and heavenlygift the corporal as strength prudence equity and the like proceed from we or in better term be peculiar to we walk stand and act with we and the spiritual and heavenly and which consequently have no relation withthe body be as without we wherefore they must be represent either sitor lie on cloud and the nearer they approach beatitude the more glittering nimble faint and wave they be to be exhibit . be of opinion that we ought to adapt particular sort of stuff to the aforevirtue and quality accord to they rank and dignity as to cloaththe earthly in stuff and cloth and in thick silk and those still higher in gause scarf or else to let they remain naked . we must further remark on the last of these that the character call the quality of god imean figural character such as the eye imply dominion the circle serpent eternity the sun glory and such like ought always to appear in the uppermost glory as pertain to the deity and be representby lovely wave child yet let it be observe that those thing only respect the blessing of heaven for when the almighty be provoke and be to inflict punishiment we must introduce other quality such as he wrath justice also represent by angel with thunder siery sword scale but theseought to be stronger and like young man as we find it in scripture in the story of lot where they strike the sodomite with blindness and in that of senzacherib where a angel of the lord in one night smote so many thousand and more such case . shall illustrate what have before say by further example in such manner as apprehend the point and for that purpose have choose a uncommon subject to serve for particular emblem and stately monument of she majesty mary stuart late queen of great britain france and ireland princess of orange . here tomb be stand on the left side of the piece on basement whereon be carve the rivergod of the thame in the middle of the piece on the second ground princess be sit in grandeur on throne represent englans with its proper badge she lean she head on she left hand and with het right open the royal robe of the decease which be line with ermin and witlthe sceptre and crown lie in she lap whereon she cast forrowful look she becover with black gause weed which darken the glitter of the seat and coat of arm policy on she left side quite deject be beholding the tomb becompany by sorrow on the other side appear the protestant church languish support by hope who point at the tomb whereon stand large beautiful antique vase out of which be grow rosetwig have but one bud whereon providence sit on cloud dispense some moisture out of small crystal phial and with she sceptre point upwards at the celestial light to which wisdom piety and stedfastnef be see fly support or rathercarry beautiful young virgin along with they this virgin be drest inwhite and crowned with rose have bright star over she head she handbe crof she breast and she be look upwards with joyful countenance . on high appear god92 love or tendernef wait for she with open arm have in its lap pelican feed its young with its own blood the other character of divine happinef beforemention be also see and especiallyheavenly or perfect joy or harmony represent by spirit sing and playon instrument on the vase be medal wherein be carve phoenix arise outof its afhy under it on black table be write in gold letter either in latin or englissi tdie in orderto live the tomb be hang with festoon of cypress intermix with rose on the right side of the tomb standfate have in the left hand rise close to the vase and in the right pair of scissors as if she have cut off the rose with they on the left side of the tomb stand nature dejectedly hold handkerchief before she eye and with the leave hand at she breast envy to the right forward be take to flight bitinga heart and look either at providence or at the beatified soul ascend . about the throne stand scotland france and lreland in mourn . second examplehere we may represent majesty on raise throne sit in full splendor clemency and authority stand behind she and hold over she head crown top with glitter star on she side may sit religion and on step below policy take shelter under she garment quiet plenty and success by land and sea may be place as come in and on the other side peace becompany by art and science above in a open heaven fit providencepour down divine bless over the throne on cloud should be wisdom religiousness and stedfastnet . this majesty may be here the subject of this emblem and if it have no particular character suit any kingdom power or commonwealth in oristendom but if it have any arm device or motto as sufficit unus or flowerdeluce for france plus ultra for spain ho ni soit qui malypense for england then this majesty ought to be like that which it be to represent . it would not be improper to see the glory fill with divine love or kindnefs as beforemention and prosperity flow from it fright and fear taking to flight and envy fraud and heresy under majesty 92 foot .the active virtue represent by figure which hold the crown over manjesty 92 head and those sit on cloud . third example . the subject of this shall be innocence murder . here innocence be prostrate murder by rage impiety she lie near an extinguished altar stretch out on the ground cloath in clean white garment betoken a upright undefiled heart the cruel executioner forciblytear she innocent child from she breast and at the same time the brutish murderer be step from the eminence whereon he sit in order to go off he bestain with innocent blood and sheathing he bloody sword trample under foot pelican with its young rage attend he and fire they with her torch be look back in great consternation at heaven which dart manythunder at she there divine justice be descend with scale in one handand thunder in the other piety bow before she at the altar be pray . and shew she the innocent corpse whereupon she double she speed to execute revenge now see the wrath of god express not with bright sunbeam . from on high but with fiery and bloody one . here justice or divine wrath have flam red garment or veil impietybe cloath in rusty coppercoloured drapery the executioner who misus . the child have cruel aspect and be reddish over innocence little angel be . ascend to heaven with bright star to which long ray seem to proceed out of she mouth he have palmbranch in he hand to fignify she happiness . the follow be fhort sketch of the action . the head of the corpse lie on the middle of the piece on the foreground little up as if there be still some life leave behind the altar piety kneelthe second ground be with she upper part directly over the point of sight andshe foot somewhat foreshorten towards the right side from whence sne become on the left side on the same ground little more forward impietyand rage take to flight rage be halfshade by dark cloud over which heaven open the foreground have right light but justice receiveshe light from behind on the left side of the piece be dark offscape .now as the former emblem represent the reward of virtue so this represent the punishment of evil in that appear the love of god in this his wrath . thus be my thought a these subject not presume to have handle they . with the utmost accuracy be far from give they out as perfect emblem since that be the work of great judgment vast knowledge and mature consideration nevertheless rough as the plan be it be sufficient for explain my sentiment .sentiment and as we always stick either more or less to art and hardly keepso much within thebound of curiosity as not to take some liberty in the doposition of thing so have represent he who be take away the child as an cxccutioner naked he hair tie with cloth and with dagger lie by he and impiousitess as prince with bloody diadem about he head and staff in his hand though these figure ought rather to be woman moreover the execur tioner might have be leave out . chap x vi of the penate lare and cupid . ncient historics relate that most nation which live under law andpolicy especially the hebrew greek and romanbut mostly these last fad certain figure of gold silver copper or wood which they stile dii pe nate in engiisa housholdgod these they keep as holy and take such particulat care of that in case they happen to be lose either through carlessness violence or other accident they think it forebod some imminent disaster or bad luck to befall they and accordingly believe when any such be at hand that those god be either remove or vanish . the historian tim e6us write that they be represent like two beautiful young man in warlike dress each with javelin in he hand and by or near they an earthe9n firepan over which lay two long iron bar crofs way turn at the ends like the hazel wand which augure hold in they hand at the time of officiating . cicero treat of the penate say they be certain god bring forth inthe house of particular man and worship in the most conceal and private place of they and in this sense demophoon and terence spake when they say they would go home and hide they household god before they betook to their business and calling . in scripture also we have the teraphim or household god which rachel stole from she father laban when he go to sheer he sheep as the rabbi eliezer inthe chapter of he discourse largely treat speak of laban and the prepare of the teraphim . we have before say that the penate be in great esteem among the roman which dionysius halicarnassus affirin say they be worship at rome under the shape of two sit young man in very ancient and warlike dress andhave javelin in they hand with this subscription dii penate as we find itstill in ancient medal nigidius be of opinion that they be apollo and neptune and the rather as by apollo be mean heat and dring and by neptune cold andmoistness judge the worship to owe its origin to these cffect wherefore virgil in the eighth book of he aneid stile they the great god mean the pe nate other think that jupiter and juno be signisy by they because their chief chief businef be to give man help and asfistance and therefore they both derive from the latin word juvare signify to help or assist other again imagine they to be castor and pollux because they with the penate or household god be also accord to the ancient poet and historian in very great esteem andthe raman worshiyy asfign they the first place in they temple . it will here be proper to deduce something touch these god from antiquity the better to illustrate the point . we read that when the daughter of pallante be marry to dardanus she bring in dower the gift which pallas have make she present of be a oblong shield drop from heaven which she stile palladium and the figure of the penate or great god afterwards on rebellion break out in peloponnesus where dardanus and he wife live he with many of the arcadian fleed from thence take shipping for samothracia where in consideration of those gift bring as portion he build temple institute private solemnity for they religiousworship keep they srom the common people in vault under the ground . and soon after on he departure for asia take they with he and place they in dardania so call from he name he son llus be employ in buildingllium or troy transplant those god thither aeneas afterwards have savethey out of the slame of that city carry they to italy place they in the cityof lavinium ascaniushis son remove they to the city of alba where he dedicate large and magnificent temple to they honour but they say the god of themselves without human assistance return the next night to taviniam thoughthe gate be fast and the townwall and roof of the temple find intire andwithout any breach which miracle very much surprising ascanius he send to livinium six hundred man call curatore of whom egestus be chief to guardthe god at last be carry to rome they remain without any alteration and the roman people commit to they the care and protection of they city and grow empire place they in imitation of cardanus that they might not be steal either by fraud or violence in vault or temple under ground wherein after consecration they offer sacrifice to they not allow any person to spit in this temple because the god like vesta be worship with fire . they be represent as young man and sit with javelin in they hand to signify they be adore as maintainer and protector for the sitting hieroglyphically express stedfastness in what we design to do the javelin imply thatthey preserve from harm and disaster and the youthfulness denote the increase of the lare be much like the penate at least in the guard and care of city . they also be say to have hide or keep themselves secret in the house as well as the penate which tibullus affirm say that they have not only the care of particular house but also of the whole town . the ancient use to place dog to watch they idol call lare as be . creature kind and fawn on the family and fierce and frightf ul to stranger . they have the same opinionof they lare or houshold god commit to they the intire care and safeguard of they family for this reason say plutarch the roman represent they as brisk young man dress in dogskin ovid affirm affrin they be sonietime exhibit in short garment gather up on the leftshoulder and come down under the right in order to be more sree and loose inthey motion because say he they business be like that of the genii mantion before to inquire narrowly into mens action for the punishment of the wick the philosopher jamblichus relate that they be often worship on the road and have froin time to timne offering of wine and frankincense . we shall now treat of the shape of child distinguishing they into heavenlyand earthly . poussin exhibit they too squab and full for fly and those of raphael are gencrally chiesly in the border of the history of psyche too hard and masculous wherefore to find good form we must keep medium between both but cupid ought not to be represent so heavy as earthly child yet as young as you please the earthly contrarily must have understanding in order to handle something and they body to be enlarge accord to what they be to do or carry but in represent cupid who be to deliver message think it beproper to give he age and bulk enough to do the business punctually and the better to express truth and nature as to they wing they must not be make in proportion to the weight of they body like bird for they body wave of theyselve and the bigness of the wing often create deformity unless they be to represent fame when they ought to be larger . as to the love or cupid themselves they accord to my apprehension differ as much in size as action the one be by the poet call capid and the other anteros the former create love and desire for voluptiousness and the latter lead to virtue art and science they have both like beautiful andagreeable aspect accord to they age cupid be represent about six or eight year old and quite naked armed with bow and arrow and sometimes holdburn torch anteros contrarily have purple garment with bare armand leg only crown of laurel about he head burn torch in he hand sandal on he foot and he be about twelve or fourteen year of age cupid be wildand frolicksome anteros sedate and contemplative . there be another less kind of cupid somewhat younger and more simple than the former . these increase love incite the pleasure of voluptuousness or more stronger delude the sense to they in order to shew they simplicity are ascribe childish and idle action such as dancing skip about run roll fly sling apple at each other they must not have quiver bows arrow or torch but basket of fruit and flower or chaple ts looking glass or any thing tend to the pleafure of venus .alexander propertius philoftratus claudianus silius stalicus apulcius and others relate that the different love and cupid do not only respect the charm andservice of venus but also imply the desire and tendency of the heart since all man do not affect the same object but each chuse for himself . we represent cupid or love in the form of little child because it be sottisn to betake to venerv for the action and speech of those in love be as imperfect as those of little child as virgil shew in didoshe begin to speak and stop in the middle of she talk he be exhibit with wing to signifyfignify the inconstancy of lover who change with every wind as we see in dido who be to put to death the person whom fhe before so dearly love . he have arrow in he hand because they be also very light and do not always hitthe mark as we have say of lover who be whimsical and fickle when theycan not gratify they wishie and as the arrow be sharp and pierce so the sins of concupiscence no less wound the conscience the arrow be likewise an emblem of love which like thunder seize the heart for many have experiment the sorrowful isfue of be captivate by the amorous glance of beautiful woman and through they fiery paffion be lead into great trouble for which reason cupid be sometimes represent with thunder in he hand . chap xvii devotional action of nation . of all the perfection of human nature religion be the most excellent andmost universal wherefore all nation partake of it in they manner of liv ac ing and service and as reason principally distinguishes man from beast so we any where see that the use of it bind man to some religious duty as attending human understanding and accord to jamblichus platonic sectary excite it by natural desire andpropensity to do good and shun evil to whichsome allude by the celestial fire in the fable of prometheus with which he animate the first man there by signify that as the soul be govern by religion so we action must chiefly tend to implore bless on they and we eye andhand be lift up to heaven know that all good proceed from the invisiblegiver of all thing and we ought thankfully to receive it to he honour andglory we shall therefore in order to be both delightful and useful shew fromantiquity how and in what manner diver nation not enlighten by the gospel have dedicated they worship under fiction and fable to the invisible being and begin with the egyptian . the custom of these people be when any person pray to the god thathe must as the most decent action do it stand and with lift up hand which posture be also strictly observe by the roman in they religious worship as martial and horace testify virgil likewise shewe that stand with handlift up signify worship when he introduce anchise at the miraculous sight of julus92 head encompass with shine light and yet he hair unhurt by the flame joyfully turn he eye to heaven and lift he hand in prayer to jupiter and in confirmation of the acceptablenefs thereof loud thunder was soon after hear and star appear in the heaven when dark which like torch with long clear tail descend towards the house glid along and at last hide in the wood of mount lda leave behind long stripe which emit sulgodphurous vapour and smoke whereupon anchise stand up invoke the andand sacred star philo say that the erect standing posture denote a humble heart wholly devote itself to heaven author unanimoussy agree that the ancient offer they sacrifice vow and prayer to jupiter in standing posture but to the goddess op in sit one signify thereby that she be the mothe of the earth eythagoras enjoin those who pray to do it sit yet plutarch say that numa pompilius be the author of that custom there by teach that vow and prayer ought to be certain and constant . as tothe posture of pray stand st . paul seem to exhort thereto in his epistle we find likewise in the old testament that the priest do in their prayer stretch out they hand to heaven in the book of judge chap vii . we read that in gideon92 army the man who bow down on they knee to drink be by god92 command send away but those who drank stand putthey hand to they mouth be choose and defeat the midianite in exod . chap x vii it be write that as long as mose hold up he hand amalek be docomfit which as adamantius say signify that he offer up to god his action and enterprize not like creep animal who cleave to the earth but as direct he heart and thought to heaven on which grounds and examples the council of nice ordain prayer to be make stand . adoration say pliny not only consist in lift up the hand to heaven but also in they be open inside upwards as if we give they to kif they who adore and supplicate say hieronymus be use to kiss the hand wherefore the hebreze judge this manner of kiss to be very reverential and strictly observeit cicero and catullus also confirm the signification of lift up or stretch outboth the hand to heaven tertullian speak of pray for the preservation and prosperity of the emperor say thus the christians barehead lift upthey hand with they eye to heaven in take of innocence signify thereby that they have no occasion to be afhamed but heartily pray for they emperor .the tuscan likewise in they prayer use such posture or stretch out the hand and in adoring they god especially jupiter lift up they hand to heaven of which virgil also make mention in he fourth aneid where he describe jarba among the statue and altar of the god lift up he hand to heaven humbly and earnestly imploring jupiter we read further that in the olympic game anciently celebrate at smyrna ridiculous and ignorant actor was reprove by the sophist polemon for he awkward motion with hand reverse because when he be to say oh jupiter / he turn he hand downwards and insay oh earth he look up to heaven but these perverse gesture pro ceed from ancient custom be still see among the romishi clergy who as often as they pronounce the word god or lord give the bless to the congregation and in pray for the prosperity of the people stretch out they hand on high . in the medal of gordiauus pius we see small figure with the arm thus extendand the hand open with motto allud to the matter pietas august but to return to the ancient agyplian they use to represent the deity in a hieroglyphic manner by circle andagrecable thereto the philosopher pythagora enjoin turn round in the adoration of the god alcinous say also that he gather from the greek writings thatthat they have a ancient custom of run round the altar when they offer sacrifice beginning from the leave to the right side accord to the zodiac andthen run from right to leave plutarch think this be do in imitation of the heavenly motion in they continual rotation which mortal ought to follow though other pretend that thereby be mean the continual change and insta bility of human action as for the continual motion and turn of the body in prayer we find it to have be the custom of diver nation and in this sense the poet propertius in he first book accost he mistress 97ecl have often turnround before you door aud offer up to you my soul and my prayer there be passage in suetonius when he speak of the ancestor of vitellius can he have say he particular address for flattery and be the first who command divine worfhip to be pay to caius casar and no person durst after his return from syria appear in he presence without be cover and turn seshould turn several time round in prayer to heaven and afterwards sit down there by intimate that in worldly affair mertal must expect nothing but ine constancy and continual change which they ought to bear with patience and besolution add to this what pliny say that the manner of turn round in prayer be from the leave to the right hand in imitation of the earth which bewe that as camillus in prayer turn round accord to the roman custom he suddenly fall by which accident the people much addict to superstition marcellus be at war with the transalpine gaul and come to town call capide in order to charge they he horse affright by the shout of the enemy wend backward wherefore to encourage he man he turn he round as if he were adoring the sun accord to the roman custom before battle and thus coverthe accident without the people perceive it . we shall now for the reader92 greater satisfaction treat of piety and what relate to it . the ancient chiefly esteem the altar as a hieroglyphic of piety offer be suppose medium between heavenly and human thing they pretendcan e9it to be mediator or messenget accordingly virgil in he aneid theytouch the altar and call the fire upon it and the god to witnef urge further that fire unite with material part and always rise upwards frombelow as know all we earthly action and impart they to the heavenlyspirit hence we see that the manners of offer sacrifice be not without some foundation in reason because the law of nature be always purely observe . and since the world have be enlighten with the truth fire be customarilyuse in divine service and no facrifice be think acceptable without it indeed if earthly creature can any way reconcile we to heaven nothing have greater affinity with the fire as it light and clear every thing wherefore they think that they may represent the genii and angel even the dity itself by it . as as to the altar and piety we see in the medal of the emperor alius with open hand which as before observe signify worship and by ita altar with these letter pietas in one of hadrianus augustus be the samefigure between stork and a altar adorn with groundivy with this inscription pietas aug in one of diva augusta faustina appear woman lifting up she garment with the left hand and lay the offering on the burnaltar with the other have the word pietas in the medal of lucilla we see figure stand behind the altar with cup in its hand as ready to offer withthe word pietas in that of antoninus be the figure of piety open the right hand as take of adoration and withthe leave ready to put the sacrifice on the altar with the same inscription in the gold medal of alius caesar the right hand of the figure be in the same action and the left hold gift alsp inscribe pietas .we offer prayer and supplication either in make vow or receive fa vour in consequence of they hence proceed the various inscription on Idal which neverthelefs do all allude to piety whether in pray for help or return thanks accordingly we find in the medal of jalia pia aug . willman tuck up she garment on the leftside and offer with the right withthis inscription vota publica but in one of hadrianus be two figure one like the emperor and the other hold in the left hand palmsprig andwith the right offer he cup have this motto adventuti augusti . in one of domitian be burn altar inscribe princep juventutis . the altar be anciently as they be nowday place of safety and pro tection wherefore priamus in virgil have lose all hope of preservation take sanctuary at the altar of which he wife have say this altar shall protect we all cicero speak of the actor roscius say we run into he house as to a altar and ovid in he triftib say the altar only be leave I in my misfortune . the athenian have particular altar dedicated to mercy and compafsion as we gather from the poet papinius and lactantius grammaticus and from apfinis in he rhetoric plutarch treat of superstition call the altar abominable xe ac zophon in he second book of the state of greece take vesta for a emblem of refuge to the altar when theramene say he have hear the thing he take . to vesta for refuge pollux call vesta the altar of offer especially that at the prytaneum where the everlast fire be keep dionysius harlicarnassus say . that romulus build temple in honour of vesta and as memorial of he hav ac ing divide the roman people into thirty ward suetonius write almost the same in the life of tiberius . in fine the altar be set up for facrifice and prayer to obtain divine favour and bless though few have determine which of the various sacrifice was best and most approve by the ancient who offer to the almighty only in spirit * the place in athen where the judge and magistrate sit and where those who have done any confiderable service to the commonwealth be maintain at the public charge . spirit and understanding without utter word wherefore the megyptian honour the crocodile as have no tongue apply it to the divine silencethey praise the spirit and soul of the ever bless and offer to heavenlything material one suchas have some affinity with they viz fire to the sun but to the evil spirit or devil they bring offering that they might not hurt or obstruct they or that they uncleanness might not pollute the sacrifice or the savour of the meat the agyptiansf always think it abominable to expiate with the blood of animal and therefore offer only prayer and frankincense the king of the ptolemaic line enjoin they sacrifice to serapis andsaturn to whom they build temple without they town wherein to offer beastas usual though in aftertime accord to the inhuman custom of busiris on he usurp the country and place bordering on the nile they offer men. but of offering we shall treat further in the follow chapter . chap xviii of the different offering of nation and their rite . as from highest antiquity down to these time different regards have beena have for many person and place and the knowledge thereof much conoern a artist so he ought diligently to inquire into the ancient manners and custom relate thereto both in general and with respect to particular country .scripture inform we that the athenian be very religious wherefore theyas well as the roman lestthey should forget deity would rather set up a altar to a unknown god and make offering thereon than be any way negligent inthe duty of worship from which altar st . paul take occasion to preach so powerful sermon touch christ and he gospel as thereby to bring over manysoul to christanity . we must conclude that so many altar require many priest who be as different in dref as the god and manner of offer those of jupiier not at alllike priapus 92 nor diana92 those of bacchus as we shall shew in the sequel . the great laver of the jew evidence that they priest observe perfect cl e9anliness in they worship even the almighty himself order mose to put offheshoe when he appear to he in the burn bush and that any man or beast who touch the mount or its border so long as he be present should be shoot or stone . it be not probable that the heathen be so nice in thispoint nevertheless the present custom induce we to believe that they ancestor no less observe thisdecencydecenev in they worship since to this day even christians be not allow to enter the mosque of the mahometans through of all infidel they be the least observer of religious ceremony . think it not amiss to deride the agyptian in particular for pay divinehonour to sonie beast because most nation especially the greek who excelin wisdom and knowledge as likewise the strict roman be infect with the same superstition . marcrobius write that king janus be the first who introduce and establishin ltaly the offering to the god and that he himself be afterwards worshipas such even so much that the ancient roman never sacrifice before they had invoke he as the inventor and protector of the offering for they believe he always fat at the gate of heaven and that the prayer of mortal could not reachthe god if he deny they entrance nay he must even lend they a hand to go forward because prayer which homer call woman be lame and cripple . the most ancient nation who bring offering of which the agyotians were doubtless the principal do not make use of beast but herb flower tree andplant as likewise perfume they therefore who anciently live on beast92 fleshdo it as report for want of fruit and this on a opinion of pythagora who forbid the eating of meat or blood as judge that the soul have its residencetherein although eusebius relate the ancient divine maintain that no beast even no meal honey fruit or flower ought to be offer for say he god know they who fear he and favourably accept the poorest leaf they lay on the altar regard they heart and inclination and not what they offer with their hand . it be certain that in old time detestable custom prevail among almost allnation of butcher man for victim as we learn from credible author was practise to diana taurica and not only the ancient soyrhian but also the agyptian and roman be infect with this cruelty the former offer such victimin honour to juno and the latter to jupiter call latialis whom they esteemthe protector of the latin sicinnius dentatus or the toothe as be so bear very famous for martial exploit be the first among the roman who sacrificeman to mar athanasius relate that diver other nation after they return from conquest have custom of divide they prisoner into hundred and thatone out of each as the unlucky lot fall be sacrifice to mar varro also testifie that the wander trojan on they arrival at last in staly offer accordto the oracle one man in ten to pluio and saturn anaeas as virgil inform we choose eight young gallant out of the prisoner he take of the enemy to sacrifice they to the god of hell for the sake of pallas decease diodorus siculus mention that the people of carthage sacrifice to a idol of metal represent sciurn hold out its arm bent young man as burntoffer by consume theyalive in the flame of red hot oven place under this figure which offeringbe long retain among those people till at last have they in abhorrence they putbe 0 live deer to the same usc yet some time after the death of alezanderthe great on be visit with the plague and the town closely besieg and reduce to famine by agathocle king of sicily they accord to the common causetom tom of nation have recourse to they imagine tutelargod prayer and old superstition believe that saturn provoke by the change of offer whichthey ancestor with great devotion appropriate to he have as punshment cause this disaster and irreparable damage to befall they which opinion so influence on the mind of the citizen that they barbaroussy in one day offer twohundred other say three hundred youth of noble birth to that idol as a attonement the same writer add that the phaenician exceed all other nationin that unnatural practice insomuch that in frantic extravagance and to appease the imagine wrath of the idol saturn they sacrifice they own cnild and afterwards abating that cruelty they make use of those of other man whom they secretly buy or stealfor this abominable purpose but plutarch thatgelon king of sicily have vanquish the carthaginian in the battle of hymera force they to promise never more to offer either the own or other mens children in such manner quintius currius testify that this cruel custom prevail among the people of zyre till the destruction of that city and accord to st . augustin the ancient gaul inhabitant of france as now call and several other nation be defile with this abomination heliogabalus one of the greatest and most extravagant tyrant who ever sit on the roman throne cause all staly to be search for beautiful and noble youth whose parent be still alive barbaroussy and to the greater sorrow of they family to offer they as victim the jew be also not without reason much censure by aypion julian the apostate and other for have sacrifice man to idol abhor the crueltv of jephthah chief of the gileadite in deliver up he daughter for burntoffer thisdetestable superstition be not only prevalent among the heathen but also among the king of judad the ruler of god92 choose people in make they children paf through the fire offer they up to moloch as we read of ahaz and manasseh king x vi and x x i and as josephus de antig lib say after the manner of the canaanite cambysis king of persia and alexander the great after he by public and universal law prohibit they subject these abominable offering yet not be long observe the emperor hadrianus under severe penalty intirely supprest they hercule first abolish the killing of man for sacrifice to suturn offeringhim so many burn light in they stead and there by reformthe inhuman custom this he do on he return from spain and assign for reason that the greek word oos which the oracle of dodone have make use of for the institution of that solemnity signify light as well as man and that therefore they be to offer to plutobe 6 bake figure of clay and burn torch of candle instead of man for which cause they on the festival of saturn callsaturnalia make present to one another of little figure and burn waxcandle . but lycurgus the lacedemonian legislator ordain that pig should be use for victim instead of I n. the image of dianna mention before which lphigenia and orest had bring bound up in bundle of willowbranch from chersonesus tauricia now call grim be worship by the lacedemonian with great reverence . theythey anciently offer it to man who be choose by casting the lot this cruel custom lycurgus alter thus they lead youth to the altar of the idol and whipethey so long till accord to they institution and the will of the oracle it was sprinkle with human blood and this be do to encourage young people not to fear the cut and wound they might receive from the enemy in battle .pltarch also relate that anciently when the plague have make sad havock at lacedemon the people be inform by the oracle that the infection wouldcease if they offer yearly some noble virgin the lacedemonian obey at last it happen that the lot fall on helena who be lead for sacrifice an eagle descend and snatch the weapon out of the priest92 hand carry it over field where he drop on heifer aristide in he book of the italian state mention the same accident formerly happen at rome to valeria lnperca . the head say hesychius bishop of ferusalem as have of all that be create treason be call understanding and have plant its seat in the heart god also formerly command that the head and liver and all that belong to it shouldbe burntoffer tohim for from the heart and the liver come forth the springand motion of we carnal appetite and in this sense st . paul bless he conigregation say ee the peace of god which pass all understanding keepvour heart and mind the prophet lsaiah say likewise can the wholehead be fick and the whole heart faint from the sole of the foot even unto the hcad there be no soundness in it be herodotus write that the stythian worshipp92 diver god but do not erectteither temple altar or image other than to mar altho they manner of sacrifice be one and the same to all they god and which think not improper to mention here the victim be bring to the appoint place with its foreleg tie the priest follow strike it on the head which cause it to sink they thereupon invoke the god to whom it be to be offer then he threw rope about its neck and strangle it and pull the skin and flesn from the bone heiput the same if they have no wood on the bone with other burnmixture in order to boil it and if they want the no e6cessary kettle they put the flesh into the skin again and thus broil it on the fire this be do the priest offer the victim to the god they intend but among all they victims the horse be the chief which therefore they dedicated to mar whose temple when damage and decay by rain dampness and bad climate they retrieve in the follow manner they gather many branch twig and chip of tree piling they into arge square heap make perpendicular on three side and slopinig on the fourth so as conveniently to step on in the middle of this heap they lay large knife not unlike the present persian or turkissi scymitar which they imagine to be the true image of mar whom they worship and honour with they offering . that the horse be anciently first sacrifice to mar the history of the greckand roman plainly evince the annal of the lattertestify thatthey usedtooffery earlytohim in the campus martius on the of december a horse which have win the prize in the race there by bescech the god to favour they warlike enterprizewith success pausanias report that jyndarus father of helena who be ravished by paris and carry to troy have determine the utmost revenge asfembleall the grecian prince in conjunction with she consort menelaus vow by the facrifice of a horse to revenge by sword the affront put upon he and he fa mily some also pretend that the aforesaid festival keep on the of december have be celebrate on the of october and that the name of october was give to the horse appoint for those purpose on which occasion great contest one time arise at rome about the sacrifice horse92 head some insisting to have it on the capitol and other on tower of the city call manillia . the solemnity of this rite be perform in the follow manner on the of october they lead fine horse deck with garland of green intermixed with flower and loave of bread through the street and quarter of the town and be arrive at the campus martius they there kill and offer he to mar for obtain prosperity and fruitfulness this be do to beseech the god to prevent ruinous war in which the cavalry cause the greatest damage and destruction to the product of the field for it would be absurd to think that the roman who pretend to be descend from the trojan should offer the horse to mar after the greek manner and in conformity to the intention of jyndarus in order to be revenge of they ancestor wherefore it be only for the reason aforesaid the lacedemonian as festus affirm have also custom . of offer horse yearly on mount taygetus burn he to afhy for the wind to scatter into all they town village and district and pausanias mention that the macedonian sacrifice on the same mount a horse to the sun in imitation of the persian xenophon asfert the same in he memoir when he relate that they make curio present of a horse for that purpose know it was the custom of the persian to honour the sun with such victim he say further that the sarmatans breed horse for sacrifice and sustenance the salenrine likewise offer horse and afterwards burnt they in honour to jupiter the people of rhode offer to the sun chariot with four beautiful horse whichthey drive into the sea to be swallow up by the wave believe the sun ran round the world equip in that manner we read in the heroic poem of philostralus that in order to overcome they enemy they be oblige to offer to the sun white foal who have never know the bridle or spur this be do bythe advice of palamedes to buoy up and animate the greek who at the siege of troy be strike with fright and fear at the sight of sudden eclipse whichthen happen . origine intimate that the offer bullock before the tabernacle according to the ancient jewoissi rite signify that we must subdue all pride and haughtiness and by calf the have overcome the weakness of the flesn . the baeotian have custom of sacrifice to neptune bullock call withthey mucyte or bellow because he noise have some affinity with that of the billow when violently agitate by the wind the bullock which the priestselect for that deity ought to have dark or black hair thereby to signify the dark depth of the water wherefore many think that the eagle be call by the latin aquilla from the word aqua as have dark and blackisn colour for the same reason the seagod be usually represent with brown complexion bluish hair and garment and with full chest and broad shoulder like bullock to the taurii ludi or bullsolemnity in use among the ancient roman they be not institute by they in honour to neptune but for the infernal god whom they believe be thereby move to compassion when under tarquinus superbus the city be afffict with plague which carry offabundance of woman with child and the people impute the misfortune to the eat the flesn of black bullock . the sacrifice which the ronan censor use to offer every fifth year for their purification and call solitaurilia confist of boar ram and bull .the offering bullock as we gather from history be generally especially among the roman take of victory gain over the enemy accordly juvenal say they lead to the capitol large black bullock mark with chalk . but here it must be observe that the lacedemonian in some fort imitate the ro ac man in several of they sacrifice of that nature for when the latter get victoryby slaughter and take the enemy prisoner they offer bullock but when without bloodshed sheep the lacedemonian contrarily sacrifice bullock on obtain victory without cruelty or bloodshed and cock when it be get in the open field in pitch battle prefer enterprize performed with reason and conduct to those effect by main force . we read likewife that anciently especially among the roman the bullock be so much regard that it be as capital to kill one as to murder citizen .wherefore erichthaeus reign at athen order that at the yearly festival wherein bullock be sacrifiice the popa or priest whose duty require heto furnisn the cattle and cut they throat when knock down should after the solemnity be over and in maintainance of the law forsake the town first leave the be at the foot of the altar .the thessalian be enjoin by the oracle of apollo at dodone to offer sacrifice yearly on the tomb of achille and to furnish the necessary from they owncountry namely two tame bull one black and the other white the wood from mount pelion the fire out of thessaly and slower and water from the river sperchius with these be to be use garland and festoon of green intermix with amaranth that in case the ship bring the necessary fromother ae9ountry should be keep back by contrary wind at least such green and flower that never wither might not be want to hang on the tomb . apollodorus and athenaeus relate that hercule be so great a eater as often todevour whole bullock at meal for wlich reason the ancient dedicated to he the waterfowl call by the gree e8 maoo in englissi seamew becausethis bird accord to suida be very voracious nay on account of this excessin eat they bring he offering whereby man be not allow to use anyother expreffion than curse and swear lactantius and apollodorus relate the story thus hercule on time travel with some companion through rhode and be very hungry meet with countryman at plough with couple of oxen which he desire to purchase for sill he belly but the man reject the proffer hercule take the cattle by force and with he companioneat they up the other enrage and frantic hereat curse and swore at hercules as he be eat who laugh and banter he say he never eat better morsel or with more gusto in all he life wherefore the inhabitant of that island erect a altar to he after he deification whereon be carve yoke of oxen offer thereon at certain timc couple of oxen at which soleninity the priest and people bustle about and make great noise by cursing swear and other impiety which they think would please the god in remembrance of the adventure with the ploughman . must subjoin another sacrifice to the honour and memorv of the deifyhercule not less foolisn than ridiculous suida relate that the baotian on certain time lead a ox for sacrisice he break loose and run away whereupon the mob unwilling to pretermit the time for celebration stick a apple on four stick with two smaller on top represent four leg and two horn offer this with great solemnity to hercule other ascribe this apple sacrifice instead of a ox to the athenian and julius pollux testify that it be long in use among the thebans yet pausanias in he memoir report that as the appletree be sometimes accept by the god in take of propitious sacrifice so the baotian at the ox92 running away offer to hercule a appletree having but four branch instead of the fourleg beast whence it become afterward customary to consecrate that tree to this god and apollodorus affirm becording to zenodotus that those offering of the baotian be instead of ram and sheep .the imploring help and favour by means of abullock remind I of custom of the ancient scythian now call tariar who kill and strip bullock the person who have receive any injury from another take the skin spread it on the ground and sit upon it with he hand behind he and those who in passingby promise to give they affistance trod onthe skin with the right foot thereby signify the means they propose to use for the injure person92 satisfaction . this custom be largely describe by lucianus treat of friendship under the name of toxaris and speak of the homolois he say that when they delig inviolably to engage themselves to each other they kill a ox and cut he intobit to give to people as they pass by which custom be still solemnlyobserve by the circassian tartar inhabit between the river tanais and phasis . and all such passanger as get piece of such a ox think themselves so bound in friendship and so much oblige to the giver as not to scruple hazard either goods or life in reveng the injury do to theirfriend .the athenian in thankful acknowledgment of the profitable labour of the ox stamp he image on they coin call didrachmum wherefore we read in homer and other writer that they use to buy merchandize by certain number of oxen as in the second book of he iliad he have it can every thing of that kind be sell for hecatomb a hundred oxen or in better term for a hundred piece of gold or silver coin with they impress .pindarus mention that the hyperborean perform they hecatomb or great facrifice to apollo with asf wherefore callimachus say that that god take delight in the kill fat afbut the agyptian hate this creature not only for he dulness and stupidity but also for he skin mix with brown and white which they account abominable and unfit to be offer to the god accordingly they abuse he as much as possible fling stone and clod of dirt and mud and prick hewith sharppoint stick and when in the pursuit they find he on convenient eminence they make he roll down it hence arise the comparative pro verb apply to contemptible person the af of agypt . these people be not the only one who pay honour to the hog other nationhave rank it with they god for this creature be formerly sacred in candia where they believe that jupiter at he birth suck sow which by she grunting intirely drow the cry of the child though some will rather afcribe this kindnef to the goat of amalthea . the ancient stalian king have custom to offer a hog in they nuptial solemnity and the great in they nuptial feast bring accord to the tuscan manner a hog to the altar consecrate it to the tutelar god and presider overnew marry person which be the general custom of the greek as well as of the latin . they of argo celebrate the festival call hystery by offer a hog in honour to venus of which callimachus largely treat though we find the sicyoniandedicated to she all kind of beast as aristophane testify say they killa hog to offer to venus . they likewise offer a hog to the goddess maja by whom be mean the carth thus call accord to cornelius labeo as signify greatness becausethis creature make great havock among the corn and grain and be very prone to tear up the ground as horace say the hog love the mud for these beastbe facrifice to the god either on account of they likeness and agreement or dissimularity and aversion wherefore the poet mention that the hog be first offer to cere for the great mischiefit do to the corn veranius say theyalso offer sow to cere after funeral for purify the family . on make peace alliance or truce they offer a hog as virgil affirm he make the peace during the killing of sow though quintilian and servius in they remark that virgil mean a hog because in that solemnity be always use a hog or boar suetonius in the life of claudius caesar report that he make a alliance with the prince during the offering of sow though tit li vius speak likewise of a hog .the mosait law enjoin tne king or prince to offer for they sin a he goat and those who have no public employment she goat or lamb aaron be command to offer for himself and family calf as harmless or righteous and an he goat for sin offer and we learn from hesychius bishop of jerusalem thatthe greck word signify a offering of a hundred beast . the highpriest after have offer a he goat for burntoffering be allowto go into the holy of holy cloath in white line coat with girdle of the same and breech and mitre of fine twine line as signify that be reconciled to god purify in body and soul chaste sober and righteous fillwith godly understanding and the gift of the holy spirit he might enter into that place . the offering he goat and fheep under the law imply mortify and rootout all impurity and carnal just as admantius explain it and to which cyril agree for scripture hieroglyphically commonly take the he goat for men plunge in stink impure and all manner of extravagant desire as alsoplainly appear by we saviour92 word when at thelast judgment he will setthe sheep or elect with all blessing on he right hand and on the lest those whoby stink sin be unworthy of he pity for eternal punishment and after such manner the goat be bring to attone for fin when the law command that he should be present alive before the altar and the priest lay he handon the head should confess over he all the iniquity of the people and put they on the head of this lascivious creature and then by afit person send heaway into the wilderness they add for confirmation that the thick andrough hair of this beast be lay upon he as stink burthen of he lasciviousness . the fable of the greek poet tell we that hercule be the first who tame the lascivious he goat mean that he overcame the wanton desire of the flesh . he likewise first offer this beast to juno for have vanquish hippocoon and there by irritate the goddess he find no other victim at hand to appease she with as paufanias relate in he third book but the lacedemonian sacrificeto diana call the corythalian in the field goat flesn only no other beast being allow in that solemnity wherefore xenephon in he memoir report thatwhen the persian invest achen with mighty force intend to ruin it intirely the athenian mode vow to diana to offer to she as niany goat as they should defeat enemy in case they beat they . the poet likewise mention that the goat be sacrifice to bacchus because he be the god of wine could not be more acceptably honour than with the death of creature so noxious to vineyard dedicated to he wherefore the festival call ascolia be also celebrate in he honour when they lay on the ground at equal distance sack or bag of goat fkin sill with wind whichbe smear with oil or grease they merrily to win the prize lcape from one upon the other tumble by reason of the glibness over each other to the no small delight and applause of the people . the romanlady on be deliver with twin formerly offer to juno to whom empire and rich be facr certain sheep which accord to bebius macer be tie between two pair of lamb on each side but the sicyonian causetom be to offer fat sheep by they call eumenide to the god of benevolence and good hope for the good luck and prosperity of theirfamily theylikewise sacrifice to hercule as god of rich and plenty fheep tie on feur stick instead of bullock who run away as they be lead himn to the altar whereforewherefore he be call melius or shepherd but of this ridiculous offering lhave say enough before . we gather from the greek and roman history and antiquity that they sacrifice dog the former to prosorpina and the latter to genetia at the festival call lupercalia sacred to the lycaan idol pan the roman offer the same know that the constant nature of dog be to pursue wolf other think thatthis be do in honour and renrembrance of romulus who they say be in his infancy lay in wood and bring up by wolf some report that evander first introduce and establish those solemnity the people of argo offerdog to the goddess cyonia to whom they aicribe the power of give woman in labour a happy delivery the lacedemonian consecrate those creature to mars 92 for they eagernef and alacrity in fall on deer for the young man in their warlike exercise use to begin they with sacrifice little dog to mar as the strongest and most valiant of the god judge that creature to be the most beceptable of the tame and sociable animal the augure fort of priest among the roman also often sacrifice kind of red dog before the town gate callfrom thence catularia or doggate that the heat of the dogday in july andaugust might not burn or spoil the tree and fruit of the earth the inhabitant of methone annually offer cock for the prosperity of the vineyard and for avert the violent southeast wind for when this wind rise in the blossoming time of the vine its malignity kill the young fhoot andfrustrate the hope of future vintage wherefore the augure of that tract of land find it proper to order that two young man choose for that purpose should at certain place take white cock and each holding leg above the spur by parting pull he to piece and then with the piece of the cock in their hand run round the vineyard one to the right the other to the leave tillhave as they think make a atonement they meet again at the place wherethe cock be tear to piece and there bury he by blind luck it sometimesfall out that as long as they observe the solemnity the issue of thing answerthey desire . the ancient roman also use to sacrifice annually a han to asculapius the god of health . the duck on account of its greedy and voracious nature be by the baeotiansacred to hercule whom they judge the greatest eater and glutton as the most acceptable to he . and accord to zenodotus the phaenician offer quail to the same god because it once save he life . the people of crene ascribe great honour in husbandry to saturn say he be the inventor of plant graft pruning and dung wherefore in his solemnity they wear on they head chaplet of fresh fig as well on account of they be food as dainty taste .the agyptian offer annually on the i day of the first month honey andfig in honour of mercury celebrating this feast with great noise and cry oh how sweet and agreeable be truth . the ancient gaul worship hercale as the god of prudence and as lucianus say eloquence even more than mercuzy because eloquence be accountmore consummate in aged man as hercule be generally represent than in the young wherefore they offer to he as tne agyptian do to mercury honeyand fig moreover all who minister hold figtree branch in they hand and they as well as the priest have they head adorn with popular leave .virgil likewise mention that evander offer to this god have chaplet of the same leave about he head call they hercule leave and macrobius say that the ancient solemnity to saturn and hercule be perform barehead . but in those to other god the prieft head be cover . the ancient roman offer to the goddess carna to whom they ascribe the support of the animal spirit in human body bacon and the green of bean where by man be make strong and hearty for labour and it be certain that thosepeople call the first day of june fabaria or bean92day because that oblation be institute by junius brutus of whom this month have also borow its name .festus pompeius say that the roman annually offer to vulcan in june at the feast call the fishinggame fort of fisni for the soul of man because the ancient philosopher hieroglyphically represent the soul by fish and as philo say because they consist of pure element and god create they the first of all living . creature . vincent cartarie relate another custom of the roman that after victory obtain they pile all the shield and other weapon of the enemy in a heap andburnt they as a oblation to vuican which be do say servius in imitationof tarquinius priscus who have overcome the sabine burnt all they weaponin honour of the same god and as evander mention in virgil he do when . young and have get the victory at praeneste . the agyptian offer to lsis loave and apple and the ancient sicilian acornand flour to cere the heathenisn priest offer to the nymph or water andfield goddeff white filly on account of they purity as serapis be repute . by the agyptian the god of rich or the production of the earth be the in ac ventor of sow and tillage he be therefore by they represent with basket of fruit of the earth on he head even he offering whether of meat bread . fruit or flower be carry in basket . we see that the jug be commonly sacred to ofiris not only on account of he be ac ing master and inventor of wine but also of all moisture wherefore he be called ocean and isis thetis for it be the custom to carry ajug in the procession of the offering thereby to shew they veneration for this god keep large one in particular esteem to carry it cover with great solemnity to the temple where be arrive they kneel down and with lift up hand thank the god for he loving kindness to man as believe that all thing be bring forth by . moisture . in certain place in greece they worship myngrus god of the fties when the people offer to he all the fly retire from those part the grenense iii bia al so honour the god of fly call achor make offering to hiin sor stopthe plague which sometimes be occasion by the multitude of those inseet . ancientlyanciently they offer red wine instead of blood for mose in he song in deureronomy say es and thou do st drink the pure blood of the grape in he psalm ee they have drank the blood of the grape indeed the aepyptim priest some of whom be king intirely abstain from wine but always use it in they offering not as a acceptablenefs to heaven but to signifythe blood and punissiment of those who rebel against the god and thereby to obtain favour and reconciliation for the agyptian firmly believe that wine sprang from the blood of the discomfitt giant which on they rise against the god and threaten to storm heaven be spild on the earth and therefore make men commit all manner of extravagancy they also intimate by the winepress perfecution adversity vexation and oppression . the roman on the other hand celebrate the feast of mercury with milk onlyto express thereby the sweetness of eloquence those rite be perform at rome in the street call sobrius or sober because wine have many strange effect as disclose of secret run rashily into danger weakness of the leg faultering of the tongue wander sense and other imperfection .slaughter of beast but also with festoon and garland of flower and with the tinkle noise of copper and iron instrument tabor harmonious sound hautboy pipe . to finisn this chapter let I add that anciently it be the custom of manynation to make on the face of the altar circle or ring with the blood of the victim carefully and with great devotion savingit in vessel for that purpose . this solemnity they call by word which signify make perfect say that the round be the most perfect of all figure . ch ap xix of the sacredotal dress vessel and other materialpertain to offering . the precede chapter more complete think it necessary to say something here of the sacredotal dress vessel believe it may be of service to the curious artist whose constant employment will not always allow they to peruse the author treat of those matter . when the agyptian priest for the sin of the people put up prayer for averting the wrath of god they be dress in black to signify that mortal pro ceed from usual earth besought and intreate that invisible be on belief that no other coloured dress be more proper . it be likewise general custom of the principal and most polite nation to dressin black at time of humiliation and those who mourn make use of the same colour wherefore varro call they anthracini or as black as coal . the the arcadian also worship cere goddess of the fruit of the earth in black cloath and the priest of the idol falacer to whom they attribute the care and inspection of the fruit of the tree wear commonly black cap but inthey solemnity all black the black be also dedicated to pluto and in offerto he the priest be in this colour believe that it best suite the hellisn or subterranean god .herodotus to shew that the heathen agree with the present opinion touchthe signification of cleanness testify that the agrptian do not allow the wearing in they temple any cloath make of wool but they have white line garment terfullian speak of we saviour therefore say as he be dress in the garb of white line it be the same with that of ofiris and plutarch treat of lsis and ofiris take this to be the reason why the priest make use only of white linen garment to signify that all clean and undefiled thing best agree with the nature of the god whose pure and sacred majesty accord to plato ought not to be worship by thing impure and filthy and as line be the clearest dress andcan be very easily wafh and make beautiful so it be think the most becom ing the sacredotal dignity and purity and indeed the magii or priest of the ancient perfian say that god take delight in white garment which assertion seem to be borrow from solomon who in he exhortation to good and blame97 let you garment be always white less manners and pure conscience say as if he mean 97 take heed in all you action not to be defile with evil and uncleanness . the priestly vestment call poderis from the greek word pode in englissi foot be of fine white line set close to the body and hang down to the foot ancient divine say that there by they signify the most holy and mysteriousdoctrine this be the undermost cover as we find in exod x xxix andthey make coat of fine weav line and they garment call hypodyte of hyacinth colour intimate heavenlynef and that man ought to raise their mind thought and faculty thither forsake what be earthly the priestalso wear under they coat breech of fine twine line cover they privityand thigh as a admonition to dref and appear in chastity they be likewise enjoin by the offertorial law to be girt with girdle embroider with blue purple and scarlet hieroglyphically imply fortitude strength and virtue . the romissi priest use to this day white line garment in they service as did al so apollonius zyaneus to whom they seem more agreeable with cleannef than other wave of foul and greasy wool .the shoe of the agyptian priest be not make of other matter than the bark of tree so cautious be they in avbide the least appearance of unchastity anduncleanness accordinglv and with respect to purity it be great crime among the roman prestess call flaminica to wear shoe of skin of beastwhich die natural death superstitiously believe it to be abominable but theyapprove of such as be make of offer beast skinwe saviour himself command he disciple not to wear shoe that be with all speed to publisn everlast life they might intierly forsake what be corruptible mose also leavethe agyptian bondage wear shoe of beast skin intimate he affinity with mortalitytality but afterwards as he grow in strength and virtue and be to serve the almighty he be command to pull they off . the egyptian priest adorn they head with hawk92 feather think to owe this honour to that bird because as they say he formerly bring the priest of thebe in agypr book write in red letter contain the manners of worshipping the god and many of the principal rite to be observe in their offering wherefore the latin poet accord to martial call those priestcop or crest . it would be needless to say more touch the sacred dress such as the mitre bonnet ephod and other ornament since they and every thing else relate to the priesthood be amply describe by goeree in he jezoijhi antiquity wherefore after have touch on the hair of the priest we shall only treat of the ancient roman priesthood . it be formerly the greatest scandal and indignity for man to have he hair cut off and possibly mose therefore command the priest not to have their beard or hair take off with razor but dlip with scifsor to distinguishthey from those of the agyptian who after the death of apis deify andworship by they have not only they head but they whole body shave that in they sacrifice they might be pure moreover accord to be in his churchhistory by shave the head be mean renouncing superfluous richwhich priest by they institution be punctually to observe and that hair be to be account but as superfluity of the body and in this sense speak hieronymus that as the priest hashis head shave so he ought also to cut and cast offsuperfluous rich and earthly desire and that by the little hair leave be signify that they must be content with small provision for support they mortal body . other add that the little hair leave on they head in the form of crown denote the crown of eternity with which after they conssict they be to be rewarded . but as for the law command to cut the hair round and to shave the beard many think it proceed from the abominable abuse of the heathen who offerthey own hair and that oftheir child to the devil . on the other hand diver council decreed that the priest in imitation of the nazariy should keep theirhair and beard and let they grow with intention that by see and handle the same they might always remember their duty wherefore they do not shave but dlip they hair with sciffor that it might not overgrow but to return to the roman . numa pompilius they second king and priest when he could no longer alone bear the weight of the government and discharge the duty of the priesthood institute three priest call flamine the sirst in honour to jupiter capitolinus the second to mar and the third to romulus quirinus they dref be muchlike that of the present romissi clergy in they service on they head they have white hat with a olive sprig upon it at the extremity whereof appear tuft of wool take from facrifice sheep this hat be call albogolerus .afterwards numa ordain twelve other priest call salii in honour to marthe the conqueror protector avenger and peace maker these be dress inlong loose garment or coat have breastpiece of copper enrich with gold silver and diver precious stone the solemnity grow numerous and at length amounting to above thirty thousand numa increase the number of priestaccordingly he create the feciale and pater patratus who proclaim war also the epulone or overseer of all sacred banquet and augure or soothsayer whose authority be so great that the senate could not assemble without their consent they have all particular garb except when they officiate at whichtime they dref be alike be garment of white line very wide andreach to they heel girt with girdle and buckle about they body this garment they call gabinus . and as ficlelity ought to be close that be the matter we be intrustedwith must be keep secret pure and inviolable .. numa order that the highpriest in offer to fidelity shouldkeephis right hand cover with white garment as tert ullianobserves to signify that sincerity ought to be preserve simple and upright andthat it be sacred to the right hand since we be to assert it with alacrity virgil likewise intimate that the firmness of sincerity be signisy by the right hand as pledge or asfurance wherefore dido in he fourth aneid complain es alas these be the gild word and promise of the son who as be say carry with he sacred thing and household god and in he third aneid we read ee fothe anchise himself give the deject youth achemenide the right handasbe 0 token of he sincerity to he and in another place amata say to latinus wherebe you sincerity be the former care for you kindred and you word andhand so often give to you nephew turnus 92 virgil also call fidelity whiteand grey meaning accord to servius that sincerity be most find in oldpeople who be grey and white horace complain of the wickedness of he own time say that sincerity dress in white be little worship add that inthe offering toit the highpriest keep not only the right hand cover with the white garment but also he head and almost he whole body to shew that the heart and will ought to be pure and immaculate and always to accompany sincerity wherefore aristo also say sincerity be formerly represent in white dress .petronius raeoport that numa himself for badge of priesthood wear small line cap like the priest and soothsayer in they service as do likewise the wife and maidservant of the roman priest call flamine . the hat also among the ancient roman denote the sacredotal dignity for the flamine take they name from pileus or hat as if they would say pileamine though other be of opinion they name be derive froin flammeum whichamong they be a head ornament for the bishoplike cap long coat andgarment be as lhave say peculiar to the priest the authority and credit of the illustrious fabius pictor iduce we to believe this when he say that the priest or flamine be not allow to appear publicly without the hat or cap but that in they house they be at they own liberty custom to this day strictly observe in many place by the romissi prelate . infula be fine white line garment with which the priest and victim were cover . when the vestal virgin offer they be dress in long and wide vestment of very fine white line call susfibuium they head be likewise wound with white garment and over it be vail of white line hang down square and come over they cheek and fasten under the chin with clasp or buckle wherefore they be call vestal from the word vestis the romissi woman wear to this day long vail pretend to imitate the virtuous ancient matron who cover they head neck and breast with they and keep theyselve so chaste and reserve as never to seperate from they husband nor givethe least opportunity for evil .besides the beforemention dress the priest have diver implement andsacred vessel for offering viz.prafericulum vessel of brass wide on top and without a handle . patinu or patera dish or platter whereon the priest save the blood of the victim . achana another small vessel in the form of cup in which they save the dropping of the wine at the offering . acerra be small box in which the perfume be keep . enclabri be the table whereon lay the sacred thing whence the utensil andother material for the offering be call enclabria on this table they laythe beast to be offer cut open and stretch out carefully turn with knife and inspect the entral to wit heart lung and liver in order to prognosticate future event to the common and silly people piusanias report that the gree e8 observe the same method in they sacrifice . cecespita so call secando

.aspergillum or holywatersprinkle be make of sprig and leave of hyssop which in marble vessel call labrum they place at the entrance of their temple accord to the present romish custom and with which they sprinkled the bystanders and congregation . they have diver other rite which for brevity shall pass over what havesay be only to let artist see how diligently they ought to consult history that bythat mean they may in they production follow antiquity in all its particular and so duly order and represent thing that lover may say with applause nothing be want th be of paintingbook of statuary . emblem touch statuary . young and sturdy maid have a hard look stand with her right leg on square plinth and the leave on globular body . tuck up behind before she have sheepfleecegarment be light grey fasten above the knee with button andwaiste she sleeve be turn up above the elbow on she leftarm she hold the figure of decorum and in that hand chisel pair of compass line and square and in the other mallet she lock and tress are tie behind with broad fillet which come about the head whereon appear small altar and a eagle grasp thunder . chap of statuary in general . rewe proceed to the quality and operation of statuary we shall as an introduction say somewhat of its antiquity . baedalus as famous for architecture as statuary be of royal extraction cadmus himself to whom thebe owe its rise be king92 son as those sciencethen then take they origin from the ancient greeaeb shall not trace they inventordown to the remains of the ifraelite nor to those who bestow they art on the costly and magnificent temple of solomon the cherubin and ornament of the ark or the vessel consecrate to worship scripture be so express in these thing that we must be convinced these art be also in great use at that time . the vast pain be knovn which the child of seth take in engrave andtransmiet to posterity they invention and skill in astronomy on two column one make of bake clay and the other of stone in order that that art threatened with destruction by the flood and violent water might remain intire to future age and that after the flood prometheus son of japhet be the first inventor of image which have give rise to all the fable and fiction of the poet . the assrrian and chaidean have knowledge in statuary as we gather from laban92have houschold god which he daughter rachel steal from he and afterward from the jezy make golden calf in the wildernefss by mount sinai for worship . the heathen apply themselves to inquiry into art with very good success . ninus son of belus in scripture call nimrod the first king of asspria immortalized he father92 memory by building to he honour temple embellish with statue and especially with the idol baal in order to be worship the obelisk or pyramid bring to rome by augustus out of agypt be stand evi dence of the greatnef of that people in they work . the ancient statuary instruct we in thousand pretty invention and circumstance in history which they unriddle teach we the custom worship different dress arm of the ancient thing very well worthy of we study . it be likewise not for want of judgment that the antique statue be propose to we as the most perfect model of elegance and symmetry because the age wherein alexander live be the most perfect we know of for carry ing art and science through the emulation of that time to the highest degree of perfection in order to which they begin with painting and statuary frame some pattern fromwhence might be lay down certain and positive rule not to be depart from without spoiling order and beauty the famous statuary of those time therefore employ they whole wit in prosecute the work unanimoussy and endeavour to make exact inquiry into the beauty of nature and what shape and proportion the several part of the body ought to have in order to form thereout a intire perfect and harmonious whole yet it be impossible for they to bring all the collect part into one and the same object they concludeto chuse the principal and most beautiful part out of several body in order to compose from they different perfect figure to serve posterity for pattern andmodel . chap ii of the execution of statuary . statuary be a imitation of nature perform its work by strong motion of the body and dexterity of the hand it consist in the symmetry or exact division of the object accord to the particular quality especially in human figure wherein it most excel and next in quadruped all relieved and conformable to the life . it be other performance concern the baf relief or half round work according to its different quality as we shall hereafter explain . the material for statuary be of five sort and each of particular nature and qaulity . the first be clay . the second wax . the third wood . the fourth ivory . the fifth stone . the two first be work with wooden tool and the rest with sharp iron andeach material require particular handling from the first something be taken off to the second something be add in the third be cut in the fourth scrape and in the last driving or thrust accord the the nature of the matter either soft or hard solid dry or brittle . in a human figure or other creature statuary first sketch its thought on paper make choice of the most beautiful side and then take clay and setthose conception upright and as like the design as possible the figure benow rough out with the proper tool or rather with the finger the life be set to the same posture in order to finisn after it and be bring to this forwardness the artist proceed gradually round till all side be finish and nothing bewant the work stand in this condition for some time to dry be afterwardsbake in a oven and then may serve as model for carving in marble or other matter . the esfence of this art lie in beautiful form and neat or distinct representation of the thing we would make whether human figure beast or other object of which the principal be figure and baf relief . the first consider man woman and child of all age as likewise portraitor bust . the second respects the horse camel elephant lion and other beast and the last regards the peacock eagle rave owl and other such creature occur in this art all require a exact knowledge .see therefore that so many thing be necessary to be understand think itof the last consequence that the artist before he begin sculpture be well acquainted.ed with the grounds of draw and for two reason first in hope of honour and advantage and secondly for fear of prejudice and reproach these two consideration always attend the master and one of they unavoidably depend on he knowledge and performance for as the work be of great consequence andcharge as well in the material as tool and slow procef so if it succeed well it bring reputation and gain otherwise greater lof and blame .atrue artist ought not to be without the follow work viz the statues of perrieathe lconology of casar ripaoudaan92 roman might and other hook of antiquity also the principal history but chiessy les charactere des passion by monsieur de la chambre and other author on the same subject together with those of dress and of beast and other animal and for practice he ought to be furnish with plaister figure baf relief medal bust hand andfoot lion and lioness sphinx term and manv other thing which be to be buy as likewise model of wax and clay and on paper . chap iii of baf relief . that may proceed in a orderly manner shall begin with baf relief of which there be three fort viz almost relief halt relief and faint or slat and the difference of these ought to be well consider as they have three particular intention in they proportion or division . the first fort or almost relief be commonly use in deep nich with figures in full proportion have three grounds behind one another the foremost figures be almost relief the second half relief and the third somewhat less . the second fort or half relief be use in shallow square nich frontispiece circularhead upper door and nich this have two grounds or depth the first be halfrelief and the second somewhat fainter . the third fort be proper for frize pedestals balustrade and medal thishave but one depth or single figure on one ground . in they ordonnance four thing be to be observe . that the principal figure of the work have its full relief and those of the least consequence most faint and stick to the ground . that the greatest motion and action of the figure be always in profile yet without any foreshortening of the member . that the setting on of the project part appear natural not force . that the work be eqully divide and distribute every where alike not too full in one part and too empty in another which be point of great importance . although these baf relief seem chiesly to concern statuary yet they as much affect painting on account of the particular relation the two art have to each other in that one can not be perfect without the other the statuary borrowfrom the painter the ordonnance or disposition for the ground of he work whichhe he afterwards put in practice the painter on the other hand learn of the statuary the method of modelling as necessarily serve fore0 foundation in the performance of bassrelief wherefore think painter can not possibly paint good one unless he understand something of modelling nor good statuary give satisfaction without have some skill in painting .judicious master ought to be exact in order these bafrelief that each receive its proper light all may appear distinct and without the least alteration . sun fhine or sharp shade make thing look otherwise than they really be by the misshapen groundshade which on these occafion be see in nature when the work be much raise have many deep hollow . large and universal light be most advantageous for the first fort or almost relief . light somewhat more from the side be most proper for the second or half relief because it have but few risings and the work be therefore more free fromgroundshade and direct side light be best for the third or fainter sort as give it great decorum and elegance though it be almost without shade . this doctrine touch the light may possibly seem strange to some viz .that it ought to be govern by the bassrelief or picture which be to stand or hang in it accord as they be more or less relieved but we must conceive that proper light ought to be choose for each sort of bassrelief from this consideration that the light be not equally good every where here suit bassrelief in deep niche there one less rise and here again one that be quite flat the one be thus light fromside and the other front nevertheless it mustnot be think that accord to the make of the room the disposition of the window and the place fix for niche on each side of the chimney it be in our choice to have in one of those bassrelief of three grounds and in the other one of two grounds or one because that which be nearest to the window receivemore front light than the other wherefore they ought to be alike hollow and raise by proper light we mean that the work must be so order thateach part accord to its light get good decorum for instance in the former niche where the figure be much raise they can not give such large groundshade since the light fall on they little front but it may happen in the other where the light come more from the side unless you place the figurewhich in one niche be on the right side in the other on the leave thereby to prevent the superfluous shade elegantly reconcile the difference of the light . the bassrelief in shallow nich with two grounds require as nice a observation and the same conduct be necessary in frize pedestals and medal .many err in place bassrelief in frize of chimney on pedestals and over roomdoor even upon the breastwork of the chimney itself set there more than half relieved nay whole relicve figure as once see a almost relief on single ground in chimneyfrize in my opinion it be veryimproper to in ake figure of nine inch length so very distant from each other and so little draperie sometimes figure have scarce three or four fold the work look then to speak in painterlike term more like smooth deadcolour or rather oldand wear out than new make and fhould by right be exeoute as faint and fine again have observe that painter in represent bassrelief in such place avoid all large shade as much as possible especially in frize pedestals and other flat it be in my opinion very proper that those part of architecture keepthey flatness and as all ornament viz capital foilage modilion triglyph and the like be in such case commonly perform neat and curious so our figure ought likewise to be perfectly finish . some keep too much to the great manner but the smaller the thing be especally within door and near the neater they must be for withoutdoor the case be different because they receive light from all side and be less set off be they ever so much raise wherefore statuary join to architecture in suchmanner as it ought to be be the business of judicious artist and for which no one be qualified without great practice . as this study concern painter as well as statuary ishall shew the former inhow many different manners bassrelief may be paint and see the most expeditious be always the beft snall lay down that which by experience have find to be the best . first paint my cloth neat and even with such colour as my bassrelief require whether white grey red yellow between light and shade or in second tint draw my ordonnance on this ground correctly and stronglytrace it over withblack lead and after rub it with dry cloth that it may stick fast and refist the varnisn without muddle then ivarnish it all over and proceed to painting first the shade and then the second tint against it leave the ground for the light and uniting the shade with the second tint airily without softeningthey with fitch scumble the second tint either with finger or stif pencil into the ground then take another tint as dark as my model direct andwith it give ground behind my figure leave the work on the right side without the least relief be to finish rub the whole work or as much as can do atonce with lighter tint than the first ground and so very thin and even thatevery thing may appear through it observe here that the white must be verystiff and thine only with turpentine on this wet ground clap my main light which then as well as the shade will gradually unite with it without touching each other . the second and third sort may be easily finish up at once the retouch excepted as have neither groundshade nor hollow the method be this . mycloth be prepare as aforesaid ifirst heighten scumble the main light into the wet ground which by the running of the turpentine oil be become somewhat tacky do the same with the shade leave the ground in this condition for the second tint if the work be to be very neat rub it over with good varnisn mix with some fat white oil that it may not dry so soon and that may with ease and as long as please paint upon it heighten on the most relieved part and give dark rouch in the hollow scumble also here and there some smalt with soft fitch and some yellow in the reflexion of the shade if the background ought to be little darker now be the time for do it because then itwill no more go in . the last sort need no other ground than the first and it ought to be neat andclean because the light on one side and the shade on the other make the work relieve and rise sufficiently yet let we observe that as often as we paint or retouch it must be rub over with varnisn or at least where necessary to prevent it be go in for such be the nature of varnisn that it will bear but one paintingf4therwise the work sink presently . we shall now shew what be to be observe in painting figure in dep nich work not to be perform either with respect to the figure or groundfhade without due knowledge in perspective whatever applause ignorant may get fromthose who do not understand it . he blunder be great who painting figure in niche with stick in his hand shew the ground shade of the stick very plainly on the hollow of the niche but give none to the leg which support the body save little on the plinth next the foot most sad conductl another simple young fellow seehe master paint grey figure in niche and be tell that the ground shade be of much importance and ought also to correct and be at the same timeshew the model it be paint by go immediately and get niche make but for want of figure he borrow he master 92 and set in the niche trace therein the groundshade with black lead agreeable to which he give all he figures in what action soever the same groundshade . now it be certain that thing paint on firm place ought that they may look natural to have they proper groundshade accord to the relief well observe whence they receive they light front or sideways how farthey be from the light in order to determine as one somewhat short sharp andstrong as be near the light and the other longer fainter and more melt in proportion as they go off from it . as furtherance to the artist shall treat somewhat ofthe painting on woodden vase urn cistern and the like or on other smooth object . as thing paint on smooth object stand in large and wide place can have no relief or projecture on the side when see front so rise and projecting ornament such as raise figure lionhead festoon and the like be havery improper and unnatural on they unless be fix and immoveable theybe see but from one side for then you may paint as strong and relievedthing upon they as you please avoid the side go off since the smooth roundneis of the figure do not admit it the moveable object which are use and see from all side must have front light and be paint vey flat or faint and with no rise swell and the ground of what colour soever it be be lay in such manner that what be paint on it whether figure or other object be set off by dark tint in its out line and this to be darker or lighter as itought to be more or less round yet the main light must be somewhat stronger than the ground . as to the colour there be many which agree well together lapis lazulli inlay with gold also green serpentine with white as marble or plaister touchstone porphpry agate and other on wood of any sort suit ivorywork pro vide the former be not of too light colour like palm or olivetrec in the uile use of gold it ought to be lay on such tint as you think fit so as it may be heighten with shelgold on the most relieved part and afterwards varnish . in these country holland statuary be of small account little advantage be to be gain by marble or other stone and though here and there in garden or other place figure or child be to be make in freestone yet that be too trivial for good master but it be otherwise in italy where there be so many magnificent building and mostly enrich with carving and statuary in fine that countrybe land of promise to one who understand he business he get money and has the esteem of the great on this accounte0 statuary in we country ought to be somewhat acquainted with painting as be oblige to make virtue of neceffi ty iknew one who for this reason apply so much to painting that he changed the stone into cloth and he chisel into pallet and pencil for say he peo ac ple here will scarce pay for cloth much less lay out so much money for block of marble it be certain they can not always carry such heavy baggage along withthey speak with respect to those who hang they house gallery hall or apartment with cloths and cause they to be paint with statue and bassrelief which at any time in case of removal fire or other acident they may roll up andhang in other room which otherwise they could not do at least it be betterthan to paint every thing on the wall themselves as be the former custom since this country be not like ltaly or france where the painting in fresco as diver palace and church of some hundred year standing can testify sufficientlypay for trouble and charge . chap iv of the force property and management of bassrelief . think a artist ought never to be at loss for matter in this point either for the pencil or chisel because it be to be furnish not only fromtne fable emblem and bacchanal but likewise from scripture . have formerly in the book of ordonnance proposedthe story of judah and tha mar which accord to bassrelief management be with little alteration as wellas many other very improper for it when you would represent two or three grounds in the same piece though that story require not so much depth and how sine would such bassrelief become the hall either of jeip or christian and ifherein the servant and the country house be on particular ground how plainly would the matter appear if naturally express for though many imagine that bassrelief be in the same case with medal which tend only to commemorate this or that occurrence or remarkable story imust entirely deny it since in my op inion the chief intention of the former be in a instructive manner to serve for adorning building and92 the plainer more artful and intelligible the better it be especially when the choice of subject be we own and we can go to the expence of it yet paint bassrelief ought as well as good picture to havetheir they property as the ancient who bring this art to such perfection havesufficirntly shew in they sine remains which be we best model . agree with other that without a exact observation and enquiry into antiqui ty and the comment thereon which some ingenious man have leave we we ghould bealmost stranger to the hieroglyphic sense of the antique bassrelief or many of they be so foreign and dark that we can scarce apprehend what the ancient would signify by they . we shall therefore make some remark onthe long and small yet sine bassrelief of meleager kill by he mother when she burnt the fatal wood it be certain that this story be faintly represent but in my opinion the master have omitthe bustle and violent stir of meleager92 body in order to preserve the elegance of the action find it also not strange that few can understand this story without some writing under it we there see the parcae or three fatal sister but nothing of the mother and though we suppose diana to be present and mourn yetthat circumstance do not fully clear the meaning meleager should rather havehave he hunt equipage and dog by he in order to point out he person andinclination and though the burn of the wood seem in some measure to express the matter yet think it too neatly cut and smooth and should be more like afire brand but my greatest wonder be at the absence of the mother althea she who be principal person great princess and act this tragedy out of revenge and see it be one of the greatest effect of revengeful temper to triumph in the presence of those who be overcome moreover we see no active passion rule in any part of the composition nor can say who the woman sitting by he be whether he mother diana atalanta or who else can not believe she be he mother because he seem to be as old as she moreover we do not perceive in he any motion of person in pain nor can apprehend the design of the face on the round board below on the ground it not be medal for ornament though doubtless place there by the artist for some reason . some think it represent rage or trouble or else fire because the hair seem to be flam but the matter might have be better express by press of the eye strugl of the arm and leg contraction of the nofe mouth finger and toe and the trouble and pain of the die person whercas here we see nothing like it but contrarily he seem to die very quietly as he arm lie close to he body at full length sufficiently shew besides it be against the rule of emblem to admit of any aid where the fact can be perform by the person himself much less the addition of two or three figure to express the meaning unless theybe statue such as tyranny with nero ambition with alexander valour with scipio and so forth . it be true that painter use formerly before they be acquainted with ex pre sing the pasfion in the face and gesture to write they on scroll proceed fromthe figure mouth that they might thereby be understand but as artist be nowmore enlighten it would certainly be very improper to set cock or spur by man sit or stand in order to shew he industry or scul by another in order to shew that he be dead . by these observation it be apparent that we meleager should rather have beena know by sine action and motion since the chief end of representation be to . expref naturally and with energy the nature of the matter and this may as wellbe do in bafrelief as paintied if the story require it nevertheless we must observe that there be some passion which do not work externally and ought to be express by addition in order to make they intelligible such may be cha ac rity mercy piety liberality and the like but anger madness or rage pain smart which disturb the body as well as the mind by irritate the mem ler do not require emblematic figure or aditional explanation . chap of the drapery of statue and bassrelief . mong the greck statue we find none but what seem to be dress in one fort of stuff and these be the model for good statuary of painter to govern himself by but portrait which be likewise a ornamental image must never be like statue or stone figure though white and paint with single colour even be ovid with he train of metamorphose present no fine disposition of foldbe here the advantage if the stuff be not like those of the gree be 8s they be not proper for stone and seem lef congruous with antiquity . let we therefore not flatter ourselves that we can make any improvement byseek new stuff for we figure nor rely too much on the dexterity of we hand that how brittle soever the stone be we can work they and perform any thing even fold as thin as paper small fly draperics loose hairlock hang on but rather imitate the greek in the thin pliableness and looseness of they drapery that the beautiful sway of the moving part be not obstruct but plainly perceive under they unless in the case of old people who because of they stiffness may be dress in coarse cloth and yet not as seem to be mere dress without body but sit close to it so as to discover the principal part with the end hang loosely down not sticking out .fly drapery have no place among statue or bassrelief and though the latter represent history yet such drapery be not proper in they unless on the second or third grounds where then they may be fix against the ground and be no hindrance . in medal little relieved or on urn or vase where fly and run figurecan be represent in all sort of history we may freely make as many of thosedrapery as we please because as we say in the third chapter the principal motion ought always to be in profile either on single or second ground .willingly allow the gree e8 to be the inventor of loose drapery as be the most easy but that therfore we may not now statuary be arrive at such perfec tion make use of all sort of stuff which be thing possible seem to I verystrange for it be certain that all thing through long practice improve and we daily discover and sce what be formerly unknoyn besides there be few lawwhichwhich be not capable of amendment or enlargement and though as the proverb say old people be seldom better by younger yet it happen in some thing especially in this art speak here of law only by way of comparison pray observe how little the famous bernini at rome have tie himself up to the greek an ac tiquity by the force of he judgment he have surpass they he have gone such length that it be indifferent what he meet with whether fly run lie stand naked or drest figure he do every thing not like the greekin stone like manner but withdrapery sly ruffle and swing as ifthey bebe 0 live people and those not twist like gut but with beautiful andbroad fold sometimes loose at other set thick or thin tenderly and agreeablywork as art require but what be say we need not go abroad for example what fine drapery have not the famous statuary keyzer make it be certain he donot merely follow the antique think it below he character to beat the common road he seek the plas ultra in order to go beyond . add to these the great master francisco qu ebnoy whom do not name as docommend other by pass they by in silence but as a excellent pattern for shew we way void of error and reproof for by say that bernini perform what the gree e8 never do mean that he dress he figure in thick andthin stuff in order to give they as it feeem more motion the drapery swinging fly and ruffle accord to the liberty allow to any master who can perform it . it may possibly seem to some that be trample antique glory under foot but declare have no such intention though know that if some person havethe option either to be praxitele or phidias or dutch keyzer or roman bernini they would chuse to be the last and for this reason that art have in theselater age meet with improvement unknown to antiquity but after all must say in reference to the judgment have make that though it be in we choice ro represent any stuff we can perform yet as long as we find none more beautiful proper or fine than those which the greek have leave we for example think we ought to follow they as to what be sly swing blow or ruffle which be very improper in statue as we have say shall leave thatpoint to bernini and not follow either keyzer or quellin but be to do thathonour to any person it would be to francisco qu ebnoy . but let I not by any means persuade artist to imitate the particular manner of this or that master for every one have the liberty of chuse for himself and preserve minc what have advanced be only whet for the judicious by making further enquiry . it be great fault in artist to fix they thought on single part of figure suchas a elegant neck handsom shoulder back finely muscle or beautiful thigh whichthey work with the greatest application and pleasure in order to give it softness and if that succeed well they be perfectly char with it insomuch that we may often perceive in what part they greatest delight lay hence it frequentlyhappen that the part of the same figure be very unlike in goodness and the hand and foot nay sometimes the face bungle for the sake of well finishback it must be grant that the principal part be of the most importance yetyet we be not ignorant how much the lesser can either set off or deform beautiful figure what be fine naked with poor hand and clumsy foot why was van dyke so famous for he portrait but for have as much regard to a hand as face to a expert workman it be indifferent whether he cut block of marble or make model in clay save that the former require more time . but after all this choice of handling and neatness be of no moment if the figure be not well set or design because the greatest perfection lie in conjunc tion of both wherefore it be certain that if phidias and praxitele have beena master of bernini92 handling and elegance and this last the knowledge of the greck all three would have deserve the greater praise . as readily own as take for grant that art owe its defect to artist theyselve as well in painting and statuary as architecture proceed not only from master keep they pupil ignorant of they principle experiment and secret but also from obstruct they advance in the art for though it be weakness to think the ancient do not understand it yet the decay must as imagine be principally impute to the rcason have give from whence arise another mischief to wit a indifference in pupil for further improvement especiallyaccordingly none will at this time seek the old path of he predecein statuary . for it be now overgrown and become so uncertain as hardly to be find every man run blindfold over the heath without know whether . we observe that the gree e8 have commonly make more naked figure than the roman which can ascribe to no other cause than choice of objectgreeable to they inclination and desire to display they skill in the composition and symetry of the part of the human body in they statue they rather choose to represent deity than man and in they bassrelief rather bacchanaland sacrifice than history the roman on the other hand desirous bythey statue and bassrelief to transmit the memory of they emperor to posterity find themselves oblige that they might not go against history to dress they figure in the mode of the time . we shall now consider the necessary observation in painting statue and bassrelicf it be certain that they must be very neat and white because such workin stone be both hazardous troublesome and costlv be never undertaken before the artist have choose fine block of marhle for that purpose whereforewe ought to take notice of the stone and they kind . light marble be various one fort entirely white another bluish third fleshcolour be thus either in nature or change through time they beall good when free from spot or eye and appear well against proper grounds . for this reason we see that the ancient represent the best and most remarkable history either in copper or white marble as many remains on palace temple honorary arch column pyramid tomb can witnef singlewhite have also this advantage above the coloured painting that it do not soon change and when it fade as marble itself be not free from it it be all of colour . the use of it be certainly attend with much less trouble and not less natural in colour moreover we may sooner find ten master for this sort of painting than three for colour because it be but single part of the art and remain alwaysthe the same and without alteration whereas the case of colour be quite different . the grey painting represent only wall or piece of stone work but the colour one shew the life itsel see as through window wherefore the grey can neither recreate nor serve for particular picture of delight nor can be of furthe use than in the place where they be set for ornament of which they makebut small part and be any thing else to be place there it would be but of the nature of the stone and not please like coloured picture it be even in the the same case with field in summer and winter the north wind deaden andgrey it and the summer revive and make it look green again feed the havery soul with its variety of flower . the white marble have particular colour and tenderness as may be perceivein the mixture of colour wherefore it be of great moment to suit it well to its ground . between grey stone it ought only to be temper with white and black andsoften with light or yellow oker but between reddisn or porphiry stone with little vermillion or indian red somewhat upon the flesncolour and this inshade as well as in the second tint if you learn this colour from the life vour work will have the utmost agreeableness . chap vi of the attitude of statue .deside the drapery of statue something be to be observe touch their sway and posture which be apoint of the greatest consequence wherefore we shall in the first place shew what statue be next whether they will admit of any other variety than what the gree e8 have assign in the third placc whether those which since they time have be in use be reckone as good andlastly whether it be not more adviseable to follow the antique and good one than to seck after new and less good . amidst the infinity of motion incident to nature in general it be observe thateverv man have one particular to himself and peculiar to he temper one bustling another slow and third between both and this distinction can not but be obvious even to man of small understanding since from thence and propen ac sity for company like ourselves proceed either we love or aversion for this or that person or they action and if this be grant we may be assure that the acient master especially the greek who be so famous for wisdom nicely observe all those motion as well the internal as external and expressthey in they several work wherefore it may then perhaps be infer that nothing in this particular remain for the improvement of after age but let Iask why we should not as well make use of we ability and judgment in order to go forward lthink we may in other thing especially but pass bywhat be already do we shall proceed to inquire what statue mean and signify . statue represent a idol in human shape a idol say with respect to its origin and use and as far as statuary be concerned form after the best propor tion either in gold silver or other metal and dexterously work by the handand judgment of the artist the use of these be to be set in temple court palace and other public place but especially to adorn architecture we find they as well in scripture as fable for instance in mordecai when royally beray he be lead on horseback by haman through the city also in christ when expose by pilate to public view . we likewise find matter for statue in profane even recent story as for instance in the late king william and queen maty of bless memory mouldfrom the life and set up in the temple of honour and such like none ofthese piece shew either active passionate or violent motion but plain or grave and majestic suitable to the dignity of the person they represent and whichwe ought to consider as gentleman or lady who stand at the door or window to see and be see by the people be serious and without motion whence the proverb seem to arise ec he stand like stone figure or block .92 or like dumb and lifeless person . we shall therefore consider two sort of statue the unactive and the movingthe unactive be such as stand singly in nich and on frontispiece and the mov ac ing or bustling be those which be see in group of two or three on pedestals triumphal arch and fountain . now it be certain that these two sort of statue must need have particular purpose and therefore particular place for the former be see from single stand for which they be properly make and the latter be to be view round about from all side but of this we shall say more in the next chapter . as to this latter fort of statue they receive not they appellation from the person they represent but from the action they perform or the misfortunethey underwent a hetein lie the main point since without they the personsingly of themselves would not be know as in the story of seneca petus laocoon pyramus and other and these occurrence or accident must be but once and on one occasion attribute tothem suppose any ofthese person be to berepresent by fingle statue as laocoon with serpent pyramus with sword . what difference would there be between one who once commit such a act or bear such calamity and one who in he lifetime have go through thou ac sand accident as hercule theseus achille hector and many other who be represent by one statue wherefore we may easily conceive that the ancienthave in every respect so firmly fix and orderly dispose they posture thatthere be no room leave either for alteration or addition besides we see that no addition of the modern master be like the antique either in quality or goodness as be evident in the work of quelin keyzer bernini and many other who make no distinction between statue and statue . ifi seem here to contradict myself because have in the preceed chapterset forth those three great master almost above antiquity now place they below it let it be observe that be speak of statue not of bassrelief for herein they have neither excel nor be equal to antiquity in the beauty the ancient in they statue have in view through e8e principal condition and natures of man the gay the heavy and the moderate the gay be active full of fire and slender like the apollo the second be melancholy slow and listless like the antinous and the third sort be of compose temper between both as the mercurius radian which recieve its light from below all these be etch byperrier we also commonly observe that the active and airy be seldom long without motion now stand on one leg then on the other accordingly the ancient represent such person stand on one leg rest little or nothing on the other foot but be to exhibit a indolent voluptuous melancholy one like antinous we may plainly discover how heavily he stand on one leg and yet rests on the other foot he belly stick out head hang down and hip excessively rise the contrarity of these two figure be worthy of remark one seemto fly and the other to be sink into the earth as to the expression of the chird figure which be mean between the two fort aforesaid he as well tempered person be make stand firm on he leg look thoughtfully down without any turn not too fiery or easy nor too much sunk one hip swell little more than that of apollo and somewhat less than that of antinous and though resting on one leg yet appear more firm than the one and more airy than the other now as the ancient know how to divide those three different body so verynicely accord to they nature and action so we need not question but theyhandle all they other figure in the same manner speak in reference to their quality as stillstand bacchus mar hercule saturn even the willman goddess and nymph not except all which proceed either in greater or less degree from the the three standard before mention this truth be evi whether in model or print let we then not imagine that we be able to invent new action for we statue or other than those which be already find muchless that they should be better and more proper but rather employ we thoughtmore advantageoussy on other thing and in the mean time implicitly follow the ancient in study so noble and in which they take so much pain . the main point lie in the beautiful sway of statue well express accordto the quality condition nature and intention of it but hereby mean not that we be oblige to imitate the action and posture of the ancient without the least deviation contrarily every man have the liberty of excercising he ingenuity propose they work only as pattern which have always follow andwould have other do the same without fear of be therefore call copyist or they work copy such moderation think even very commendable since the fable of lcaius teach we that highflyer have often great falls or by avoiding scylla they get into charybdis . there still remain necessary remark touch the explanatory additamentof statue and to be brief shall shew they nature in three particular statue and chuse out of many the story and figure of lucretia dido and thisbe among the woman those of the man may on the same foot be easily apprehend . rerepresent these three woman with dagger in they hand to denote that theyfall by those weapon . lucretia be grave and majestic . dido haughty and proud and thisbe very plain and citylike .exhibit lucretia thus because she be noble roman lady who be ravished by sextus tarquinius in discontent stab herself with dagger now to make this know round shield or board with the ravisher92 head thereon bestand or lie at she foot and on she right side lie dog to point out her faithful love on the pedestal appear the whole fact . the second queen of great spirit have likewise dagger because on bedeceive she in spite and rage kill herself the figure of anea place near she and on the other side sparrow as the emblem of wanton love . but thisbe in honourable affection move or rather deceive by pyramus92imaginary death stab herself for pure love and despair as be unwilling to survive she lover near she on one side stand the figure of pyramus and on the other two turtle underneath these two latter appear the fact itself as in the first . these think sufficient example for further representation as have shewthe difference in three which be almost conformable to each other . chap vii of the place of figure upon pedestals frontispiece in nich and other place . ytis evident that statuary have dependance on architecture and be regulateby it and as figure adorn and give life to landscape so statuary embelsish and make architecture look grand good landscape painter know what object be most proper for a ordonnance and what form they must have whethe crook strait stand sit to the left or right in order to produce decorum as we have shew in the chapter touch irregular object and fkil ful architect ought to be as well acquainted with the method of set off his work with figure bassrelief and other ornament accord to rule that it maythere by become not only magnificient and elegant but we may plainly perceive it must be so and not otherwise he should also know why some figure ought to face and other look from each other why these must swell or rise outwardly those be upright or sit . upon this account the statuary ought rightly to understand the architect92 intention ere he proceed to work as also what figure he be to make naked or cloath be they of man woman or child on what side they ought to rise or swell and how bent and from what side see and whether they must standhigh or low and so forth be apprise of these particular he be then to exe. cute he thought in finding accord to those sway fine action graceful motion and elegant drapery from whence may arise general decorum thus much as to these two active sister . in relation to the third to wit painting which embrace they both as need they aid niust say that it make the elegancy of architecture andstatuary whether in history or landscape its chief study so judicious painter ought for adorning he architecture with figure baf relief to be thoughroughly acquainted with they that he may naturally expref they with shade andcolour even so much as thereby to correct the inevitable misshape still to be observe in nature . it be unaccountable that among so many good architect statuary and painter so few have understand the right place of statue they sometimes hit it but not upon certain principle wherefore we shall endeavour to clear the point in few word and three sketch hope that no offence will be take at my adapthe matter also to painting since it have so near corcern therein . as there be nothing in nature without imperfection so in the use of thing we ought to proceed with judgment in order to chuse the best for the satisfaction of we own eye as well as those of the know and lover . in the place of statue in architecture the same regard must be have whereverthey stand or sit speak not of painting alone but what generally concern boththe art statuary in the first place and afterwards painting see plate lxv.and lxvi.behold the sketch in plate lxv with attention and my orderly disposition of the statue in different place sufficiently to evidence in the regularity of myscheme to any one who have mind to try the contrary . here you be only to observe the outline of couple or pair of figure andthey posture against each other for single figure act for itself but pair or couple of figure shew the result of both . have formerly assert what constitute beautiful action namely good turn of the member and motion of the head arm hand and foot . the first example chiefly concern statuary who by observe that position will shew that they understand it and be able to order and make large thing as well as small . the second example respects painter though it be the same as the former in reference to the outline but with respect to shade when we be confine to single and fix light we ought to chuse proper and advantageous one that the outline as we principal purpose may there by maintain its force and produce the effect and decorum we desire as you see here with its opposite . we have formerly say that the outline without the shade be of no effect andthat beautiful action and outline may lose they force and the gracefulnef be spoiled by a improper light which misshape be very visible in sharp and broad light and more disagreeable than in stir figure . the third example concern those who paint figure baf relief and other ornament either in white red yellow or other coloured marble or stone here as in observe not only the outline as in the first example or the same shade the second but likewise the colour of the stone as well in the shade as light say especially in the shade because therein appear the greatest variety either byanother of we position have be that all object retain they natural beauty inthe shade unless they receive reflexion from ocher thing likewise that white bethe most susceptible of it and by its cleanness easily receive whatever colour it meet with consider also the great difference between the closeness and solidityof marble and the thinness and transparency of line in the third example vou will find that white marble not without reason produce yellow or russet shade wherefore you ought carefully to consult nature in order to imitate she with knowledge . but to return to the first example let we observe how two oppose figure appear in they outline first upon the frontispiece where these two figure swelloutwardly the face either regard or turn from each other and the armthe same and the middlemost strait without swell and front and those on the outside also with little or no turn as be see only forward secondly the two figure on each side of the step likewise swell outwardly yet more turnthan the other because be also see sideways they ought to be beautiful from three side thirdly the foremost figure may have as much turn and action as you please and be good quite round fourthly the figure in the nich are front without the least turn or stir and the greatest swell be forward it bealso very probable for the man to stand below and the woman above because the woman taper upwards and thefore be more disappearing and uniting with the air which in architecture have fine effect for this reason they formerly oftentimeset small pyramid on the top of house instead of figure . the uppermost figure against the sky look best naked because of they airinefs those in nich must be massy and drest and those below on the balustrade half drest thus much as to thefirst fketch . the second example shew the method to be use when it happen that the shade cause visible deformity on the swell part of figure as to help it bythe disposition of a arm bit of drapery or hand mean in painting wherethe light remain always the same and to which statuary be not tie especiallyin the open air because the light continually alter but in painting not for as thing be paint they stand this remark be worth noth ing as well in stiras still figure . in the third sketch exhibite0 a standing figure in nich and between they bass viol suppose to be of vellowish or russet wood which colour because the figure be of white marble give strong reflexion on the side we see another figure between the green and third lie on the ground surround with the air in all three have one and the same intention viz to shew the cause of the mixture of the shade otherwise the figure will sometimes seem to be make of two fort of stuff as the light part white and the shade of some other colour . due observation of this enable we to answer for what we do .although although now by these pofition about the stir action seem to contradict former one namely that in painting or carving statue we ought to give theybut little turn yet in fact do not speak there only touch single figure whereas here be many in company and those set upon pedestals fountain andthe like place where they be see from all side which create difference as well in they nature as circumstance . ifi be tax with presumption for take upon I to place figure and set naked one and woman above and man with those which be dress below a swer that my conduct be found on architecture which intimate that the five order be peculiar to five different condition of man as polyphemus or the giantfor the first order mar as robust or masculous for the second apollo for his slendernefs for the third diana or venus as womanisn for the fourth and lris or cupid for the fith this consideration will think as well embolden as justify I to conclude this chapter ishall touch on head hand and foot because have find both here and in other part painter as well as statuary very imperfect in they as if of less consideration than body . some statuary do not sufficiently vary they face make little difference between youth and age give also much into the modern way of affectation andexaggeration mean kind of fondness in artist for particular manner as to make the eyelid of they figure too large which cause a heavy look and to cut the dimple on each side of the mouth and the hollow of the nose and neck too deep seemingly shew the fatness of woman whereas they ought rather to be somewhat more expressive in the muscle since accord to the turn of the head those rise more or less especially in thin and aged people speak onlyof give variety to the look and breast for face must not be always alike grave and lofty there must be wanton one as well as modest large feature as well as tender suitable to the body the case be here the same with the neck andbreast some be grow other full grow . much be to be observe about the make of the hand and set of the foot especially when naked and without sandal but the matter lie most in order the toe the three foremost ought to be the longest and close turn out more or less with the tread of the foot whereas some turn they in the great one liestrait with the foot and the rest against it which look very uncomely see the example in plate lxvii and the difference between they of which the two uppermost shew the unseemliness and the three other the elegance speak of andthough many have cast of beautiful women hand for constant use yet theseas have be say of face breast can not upon all occasion serve for the difference of the sex for woman have thicker and more taper finger andsmaller nail than man who accord to theirbuik and age have more rising knuckle than woman . chap viii of the usefulness of modelling . have in the second chapter touch upon modelling which be prac ac tice of great concern to curious artist shall here deliver my further thought about it . the making model whether in clay wax or other soft matter be both useful delightful and necessary for statuary as well as painter indeed for allwho endeavor at any perfection in the art for by this practice in reference to the relief of thing we be to represent whereby it seem alvvays to have life itself we obtain firmness and at the same time bold handle it disburthen our thought and make such lasting impreffion on the mind that we need not be at loss about the lifc we must be sensible of the great advantage arise fromit because we can model in the aforesaid body bay relief foliage and other ornament from the antiquity on all sort of object as altar vase difhe candlestick cistern and then paint they with such colour as we please also gild or bronze they accord to the use we would put they to by the same means we may have store of elegant sword hilt and helmet greek as well as roman to serve any occasion in short good modeller can help himself out of any difsiculty therefore let I advise you to fall bodily to work and make bass relief sphinx tomb vafe or any thing else necessary in the art you may likewise get small wooden dish and pot of diver kind turn and prettilyadorn they with wax imagery of satyr face play child dancing nymph tliese thing may be use in any manner of painting whether the picce be sunshine or moon or candlelight if you would go further you can divert yourself with modelling medeal in wax and oblige friend with cast ofshemany of the most famous master have practise modelling as sufficiently appear in they work the truth be we can make any thing we want even whatno body else have and be no where to be purchase to paint after as from the lise itself . shall say little of the method for make model because it be very common and every man have he own way wherefore shall consine myself to flat bafrelief . have sketch my design on paper as large or small as would model it and neatly work it up with light and shade board paint with the same colour and tint as my design and with point trace it thereon and sill theseoutline with wax or clay more or less raise as occasion require then work the stufffirst with singer afterwards with toothe tool and lastly with wet pencil in order to make it smooth and even which be do and the board place in the same light as we picture be tostand or hang in it serve for model to paint after if now we be to introduce it in we piece whether in landscape frize shallow nich it must be set either front or sloping in such light and at such height as the point of sight direct but if it be bass relief relief more raise the point of sight be place in the middle of the piece andthough the raise part on the extremity will then of course happen to jump overthe outline even sometimes over other figure accord to the length of the piece as in frize and such like to prevent that inconvenience make use of more thanone point of sight . chap ix of the visual decorum of statue with its pedestal as well within as without door as also the suit of vase and bust . find that the grace of the posture and sway of fine statue arise only fromcontrast in its outline from top to bottoni affect not only the figure but also the pedestal with this difference notwithstanding between toked and cloath figure that a ornament pedestal give the former greaterelegance than plain one yet this latter fort likewise produce fine effect byobserve that the swell or scroll of mens pedestals ought to be at bottom andthose of woman on top the course of which cause contrast both in the form andsex sce plate lxviii . if now it be afk in the case of place two naked figure together viz . man aud woman as diana and apollo venus and adonis whether the pe destal ought then to be represent so unlike my opinion be that they mustnot as be contrary to rule and order if both figure be man the pedestalsought to swell at bottom if both woman on top and if man and woman both ought to be plain if there be woman between two man the side pedetal must be plain and the middle one particular to itself and the contrary . plain pedestals though bear drest figure vase or bust suit not between two column or pilaster at least they ought to hollow in not swell out . the height of vase place between two figure must not exceed three fourthof that of the figure inclusive of the pedestal that be up to the breast and nohigher . bust with its pedestal should not rise above man92 height the pedestal not swell out but the contrary as in the example . where two vase and bust be place in garden between two figure the outward pedestals ought to be of the same height withthe middlemost and plain the two other must hollow in or swell out accord to the course of the vase andbe third or half lower yet retain the same breadth with the other . vase twice as high as broad and run up straight ought to have square swell pedestal the contrary will produce the same decorum . if bust stand between two vase they must be level with the shoulder of the figure the contrary be also good provide the pedestal be somewhat bigger and suite to the course of the vase . chap of the ornament of the frontispiece of temple house . toth can properly be do in statuary or painting without due reflexion speak not only of the manner and handling but also with reficct to the circumstance of thing even good building may abate of itslustre by bad choice in the outside ornament wherefore wa be 9 shall shew what ought to be do in this point by what follow . the ornament on the temple of jupiter should be a eagle grasp thunder . mar some warlike instrument as armour helmet shield sword arrow and standard . phaebus sun in the center of the zodiac with the twelve sign . pallas medusa92 shield and a helmet adorn with stand owl or liespinx . diana dog bow and arrow and above they moon . cere plough with ear of corn and fickle . bacchustwo tyger thyrsis twine with vine leave and bunch of grape . mercury wing cap on caduceus . vulcan a anvil with hammer and pincer thereon .vestaa oblation bowl out of which proceed flame in the middle of cirel serpent . cybele97 castle or key between two lion . the ornament on the house of senator consul or magistrate should be the fasce and in the middle thunder . learn man or philosopher spinx with burn torch and also some book .general shield with griffin represent thereon likewise club and lionskin.merchant 97 bale of goods pair of scale and yard measure . phyfician 97the figure of asculapius and staff twine with serpent . painter monkey with pallet and pencil . shepherd crook with scrip and flute hanging to it . fishermansome nets rope rushie and fish . the ornament on an hospital should be charity or compassion with the founder 92 or town92 armis.prison all sort of frightful instrument as iron chain rope . house of correctionthefigure of education hold the bridle of tamebeast which go before she .all the art as painting arithmetic architecture may be express by figure . it be certain that the design of temple build in honour of the god be to place they figure in they for worship either with prayer or sacrifice wherefore it be great fault in ignorant to place without in frontispiece or nich what we ought to seek within those building as may be see in the temple of diana at ephesus apollo at dolpho jupiier at dodone and many other where the figure all stand without they . th art of paintingbook x i. of still life . emblem touch still life . judgment and prudence sit here at table by whom be seen some cupid take out of large horn of plenty all sort of thing as sceptre crown necklace book shepherd92 staff mufical instrument garland flower fruit serve for still life andpresent they to judgment who by the help of prudence lay they in heaps on the table dispose they orderly for represent ingenious ordonnance in thatpart of the art . chap of still life in general . have thus far treat of the power and dignity of the noble art of painting together with the lustre and advantage accrue to those who thoughroughly consider and put it in execution we shall now for the sake of weak capacity proceed to still life or immoveable and inanimate thing such as flower fruit gold silver stone musical instrument dead fish and shew whichwhich be the best and of most advantage these may in they turn serve for ma ac terial for natural composition wherewith to please all sort of man the greatas well as the little the learn as ignorant wherefore out of many we shall fix on the follow oliject as the most beautiful elegant and agreeable . flower . . fruit gold silver and other rich thing . mufical instrument . these four fort artfully order and perform may serve for the ornament of hall and cabinet as well as the best painting provide they have proper light and hang together but we must know in the first place what constitute good still life piece since though it be naturally handle nothing but goodchoice can charm the sense andbring fame to the master it be weakneis to think that fad flower should please much less in picture or who wouldhave piece of ordinary unripe or rotten fruit in he best room and among cabinet collection see the life itself be so disagreeable such rubbish do formerly admire but as they only shew the deformity of nature have no appetite to view they any more but to return to the subject . my opinion be that the beauty and goodness of still life consist only in the most choice object92 say the most choice as among flower the most rare and beautiful and the same in fruit and other thing these will gain the mafter credit especially with the addition of some particular signification proper to they it be not probable that wealthy people should be delighted with oldfafhiion plate and furniture when they can have every thing more beautiful andelegant and as improbable that judicious lover of music should be pleasedwith the modern lyre dulcimer or bagpipe as for cabage carrot and turnip as likewise codfisn salmon herring smelt and such like which are poor and mean ornament and not worthy of any apartment he who be pleasedwith they may seek they in the market as little approve of horse furniture and hunt equipage though these latter with wild boar stag hare pheasant partridg and other fowl depend on prince and noblemen fancy be more tollerable .havethus in general touch on still life let the judicious determinewhich sort be best and most advantageous cither to the painter or purchaser . as for I think eloquence very charming to the ear but goodness alone make beauty aimable what be fine flower apple gold cup or well tuneviolin without good smell delicate taste proper use and agreeable sound goodness say ought to be perfectly apparent the smell taste hearing or soundcan not be paint but may be in some measure express by occult fignification either in bassrelief by fable hieroglyphic or emblematic figure or by ma ac ny other thing if the will be not want . as to the nature and property of the plice for still life they be twofold close and open the one represent it as if hang against wall or wainscot and the other as lve on bench or table or on the ground . we also suppose that no object use in still life ought to be represent less than the life . it be likewise improper and against the nature of still life to introduce in any of the beforemention choice coloured backwork or visto either close or open that be landscape architecture or any kind of living crme9ature whichwould spoil the very name of still life moreover it be difficult if not impossible for such painter to hit every thing and grant he can yet quetion whether he would be pleased with the title of still life painter say then that the depth of the picture be only to be represent by a hanging curtain or bass relief of wood or stone of such colour and tint as best suit the general decorum th e9 one darkish and the other somewhat lighter with flower dark grey back ground suit better than white yellow or red one with fruit white and grey marble but not yellow or red yet as fine bass relief requires more sxill than flower or fruit and such like you may instead thereof introduce niche with god or goddess92 bust therein proper to the subject as flora pomona bacchus apollo diana or other accord to the intent of you design and as you would have it bear either particular or generalmean which each of those sigure will supply in abundance flower are various and like fruit may be divide into three sort to wit the spring summer and autumn and have different quality be fit for many fine anduncommon design in conjunction with baf relief or bust as have say withthis caution that with slower suit no fruit but ear of corn as be airy andpliable but among fruit may be some flower especially such as alude to rest and mirth as poppy and rofe and yet these agree best with grape either in garland or festoon . let we now for exercise and improvement in this point observe what the learn say the white lilly be sacred to juno turnsol to apolbo the rose to venus diana and somnus claim the poppy cere the cornflower juno the pomegranate bacchus the figtree and vine cere or lsis the peach andear of corn venus and apollo the apple op or mother earth every thing she produce throughout the year of instrument the lyre be dedicated to apollo mercury and the mus the flute to pan and venus the trumpet to mar . chap ii design for bass relief proper to still life . tith flower fuit zephyrus and flora or venus and adonis in courtship . with fruit cere and pomona or pomona and vertumnus with grape bacchus and ariadne and merry bacchanal and if there be mulberry among they sleep silenus with the nymph agle be most agreeable . with musical instrument apollo and the nine mus orpheus play or arion on the dolphin with timbrel cornet and cymbal bacchanalian sacrifice feast or dancing . to the three season as spring summer and autumn in one piece we may apply venus cere and bacchus sit together accord to they rank exclude the winter as improper and disagreeable and admit of no other than poor interpretation such as hunger penury which tnis season brings with it . that these baf relief may have due decorum you must observe that in garland they ought to be octangular in festoon round and in group or bunch square and parallel with the frame especially when dispose hangabove below and on the side but when in corner compartment suit better and this to be square above and semicircular at bottom and both side thus much as to close baf relief in general as for the relief the slatter it be th e8better and without the least groundshade in order to prevent all mastery and confusion . touch the other sort of still life either stand or lie in deep nich or on bench or table we have before observe that it ought not to be represent less than the life and therefore must come quite forward in the piece as appear then in its full force and quality even much better with light coming from without than within front than side light . there be three sort of grounds which elegantly set off fruit grape especially the blue and cherry blue plumb and all fruit inclinable to be dark require one of freestone but apple peach and apricot appear better on dark grey ground there be third sort as pumpkin melon orange strawberry and other which best become white ground whether they be lie on bench or table or in deep niche .shall now describe some design which hope will not be unacceptable to the artist the first contain the three bloom seafon . table or ordonnancethis piece exhibit compasshead niche square within and its depth equal to its diamcter therein place beautiful vase either of chrystal copper or gold with flower of which set the shortest stalk in the middle and the otherspread on the side above in the middle on ring hang two or three bunch of the largest sort of grape to the ring fasten small ribbon on which loosely hang ear of corn intermix with cornflower take up and tied in the upper corner of the piece and hang down the fide below round the vase lie sine and palatable fruit of the largest and best fort as melon lemon fresh fig pomegranate walnut as well as apple peach china orange . this be the substance of the piece . the disposition be thus the festoon in bunch of a hand92 length are part with green and tie which green cover the stalk of corn and be intermixe as be say with some blue flower produce a agreeable mixture without mastery the jaum set they off be grey stone and the ribbon dark violet the grape of the largest sort tie to copper ring be in the middle white and thosc hang on each side blue with green leaf or two this groupbebe well set off against the shade of the hollow of the niche without draw the eye froi the principal my intention be to dispose the flower into large mafs of beautiful and light one the strongest and fullest to be in the middle consisting of white yellow and light red the highest next the grape to be turnsol and on the side other of less force and colour intermix here and there with beautiful blue one and because the vase on account of the room which the fruit lie about it take up can not stand quite forward the flower spread on the side must be in snade the fruit dispose contrary again as the biggest on the left side and the smallest and most tender such as peach apricot andplumb on the right they should be ltalian fruit especially the lemon at least two fist big as be the chief of the group and govern the rest if besidesthe season you would represent some other meaning add lyre violin or other musical instrument which may be set or hang against the light side of the aforesaid hollow and thus the piece be complete . and now curious still life paintersl view this example with attention and consider whether propose to you any difficulty above you ability ye flower painter be it more troublesome and artful to imitate grape apple or peach than rise lilly or turnsol and ye who practice fruit only what difficulty has flower more than fruit pomegranate or melon inwardly or outwardly any ofthese may be set stand or lie before you as long as you please and so may a harp violin lyre or slute these can store you and be all in you power andvour eye can determine the proportion measure and form of all that standstill hang or lie and the soft pencil skilfully handle bring they naturallyand properly on the cloth why then do ye so often obstinately build on single fort beautiful slower will certainly please the eye but more in conjunction with some fine musical instrument you cloth may take in some of each andvet ye most time do it with single sort if it be flowerpiece you cloth musthowever be fill as it also must when the subject be fruit and musical instrument when we say jan man be fine still life painter we be to suppose he paint every thing either stand still lie or hang . second ordonnance be the reverse of the former . the chief object in this ordonnance be low or shallow basket of fruit takeup in breadth the major part of the open this basket be sill with all fortof tender and palatable fruit instead of the grape over it fasten to the ring bunch of slower with elegant green tie up as in the former and against the jaumb of the niche some musical instrument as slute trumpet bassoon cornets hautboy on the right side of the basket lie porcelain disn of strawberry and behind it somewhat deeper in the niche wide glass of mulberry the hanging festoon on each side of the bunch of slower consist mostly of ear of corn and green the main light take the basket of fruit consistmostly of lightisn white yellow and somewhat red one and the shade side of dark black or violet the bunch of flower over it contrarily be make up of blue purple violet and little white and yellow the musical instrument the same . same the other thing encompaff these as the ear of corn and green explain themselves . this piece thus dispose and artfully execute be proper match picture for the precede . we shall subjoin third ordonnance of music piece imply harmony no less elegant than the former . . third ordonnance . in the middle of the hollow of the niche place on desk large book of music open longway on one side whereof be prick the cantus and on the other the baf either in church or chamber music over it on the ring ifasten a ivory lyre adorn with gold and between its horn hang crown of laurel with small olive or myrtle branch all the windinstrument beforemantion together with the violin must be dispose on the side and behind the book and forward some implement pertain thereto viz screw or two piece of colophony box of string bassoon or hautboyreed all encompassby beautiful festoon of flower intermix with ear of corn . this piece fuit well between the two other . as for the shape of all the three they will be better and look more noble iflonger than wide . there remain another sort of still life which with the precede would yieldgreat variety it consist of all sort of rich thing as gold silver crystal andother glass pearl precious stone and mother of pearl such piece be com ac monly call vanitase the famous kalf have leave many rare exaiple of thesething which deserve the highest commendation . now to shew that in this branch the artist have plentiful material for bringhe from trade to a art or in better term for enrich the production of the hand with those of the head whereby he may be repute a artful master shall sketch fourth ordonnance taking for the subject wisdom rich and honour solomon only pray for wisdom and with it obtain rich and honour .fourth ordonnance ple2ce in the middle of the piece every thing that be costly viz gold silver pot tankard salver cup of mother of pearl crystal candlestick heap of gold and silver coin full purse on the ring above hang small board with this motto in gold letter sapienria nutrix or instead of the writing put in golden sun on fkycolour ground on each side of it hang some book festoonwise intermix with laurel naval and moral crown garland of palm laurel myrtle oak and fasten to the upper corner of the piece proceedfrom the ring and hang down the side about they might be twine small streamer with these word laboris merce sapientia nutrix or pr e6mia majora iaboribus . now to bring wifdom which fs the principal part of the piece into the mid ac dle we may in lieu of the sun and book hang above on the ring the golden ffeece and exhibit belowbe 0 sphinx with some book and peach me8 .there be other sort of still life as dead fisni cabbage carrot aamnip . which be too low and poor and bear no particular lignification think unworthy to range with those beforemention how well soever they be execute much less to adorn the cabinet of great and wise man but dead hare partridg pheasants and all sort of hunt equipage may as have sald be praiseworthy . chap iii representation of still life applioable to particular person . although have before say that the famous kaff excel in still life yet he could give as little reason for what he do as other before andfince he only exhibit what occur to he thoughtas porcelain pot or diss gold cup mumglass rummer of wine with lemonpeel hanging on it clock horn of mother of pearl gold 92or silver foot silver dish of peach or elsecut china orange or lemon carpet and other ufual thing without anythink of do something of importance which might carry some particulai meaning or be applicable to something neverthelefs to shew that this may be do as well in still life as in other representation fhall give the followsketch make applicable to particular person . table or ordonnance adapt to triumph warrier herein we exhibit some arm viz steel breastpiece a helmet elegantlywring shield and sword with the hilt represent a eagle or lion92 head pike or spear bent bow and quiver of arrow also iome crown of laurel palm and olive above on the frame may be fasten on two ring gold chain to which hang a heart beset with precious stone come down to the breastapiece and over it may be the motto of the hero to whom we apply the subject we exhibit further gold crown bracelet and ring a hat with feather and diamond button and trumpet under these fie a embroider coat on the table with sleeve hang down from it on the wall or in small table may be see in baf relief apollo have kill the dragon python or perseus and andromeda or man in lion92 sxin tear open tiger92 mouth and near he club. comment on the aforesaid object . the breaftpiece be anciently take for mark of understanding and defence for as it guard the breast it preserve life . the helmet denote a inclination for war and martial spirit . the shield also take of defence be so much regard by the ancient thatthey make prefent of it to conqueror in consideration of they valour and conduct virgil in he ninth book mention aneas92 ordering fhield to be prought to he wherewith to reward the fidelity and valour of nijus the argive had eustom of march young man who have by notable exploit merit the hongur with the shield of enhippus carry before they triumphantly through they towi and territory we also read that the palladium which the ancient believefall from heaven be shield mysteriously represent the protection of the roman people and empire and accord to numa pampilius92 explanation the shield imply success and prosperity whereby he endeavour to buoy and comfort the roman people on they be sorely visit in he eighth year with pestilence which threaten the destruction of all staly the shield be moreover dedicated to those who have save the town and commonwealth from any great andimminent danger and to perpetuate such benefaction and as spur to virtue they cause the story to be engrave or carve on they shield the shield andpike also signify war chiefly in retrieve the damage sustain by the enemy and in put they to flight and destroy they yet weapon be of little advantage if not use with wisdom and understanding wherefore we generallysee pallas represent with shield and pike the latter signify force and quickness of apprehension . the pike orspear also denote the spread of glorious name for whichreason accord to plutarch lysippus adorn the statue of alexander with it tho other represent he with thunder in he hand intend thereby to immortalize the atchievement of that hero the pike or arrow also be throw or shot at mark hieroglyphically signify the spread of glorious name yet accord to the ancient the pike or spear not only imply royal grandeur andauthority but be likewise the usual reward for those who have shew they bravery in conquer theenemy as pliny say that sicinnius dentatus for he admirable walour be present with twelve pike festus pompeiusthink that genae8ral receive the pike or javelin in take of they be intrust with the principal management of the war and empire and that therefore it be customary to tsell the prisoner publicly sub hasta or under the pike or spear .the sword in reference to war signify fury cruelty fright persecution andthreaten with death . the bent bow be likewise sign of war and ithe arrow signify the people or the enlargement of power also velocity and quick motion . the crownof laurel be the take of conqueror and those who perform anygleriousactas theancient remains sufficiently inform we and we learn fromhistory that the roman general and commander use in they triumph to present crown of laurel to jupiter capitolinus .the ancient roman also use to bestow palm on those who triumphed as general take of victory and the palmtree though press bye0 heavy weight will yet grow against it wherefore in hot battle it be esteem take of victory which can only be get by firm resolution to refist and despise danger and adversity . the olive be likewise mark of victory the ancient adorning they trophyand warlike monument with its branch or decking the head of the conqueror with crown of its leave . the gold chain be the roman reward for valour and virtue it not only recompense merit but serve for badge of honour glory and esteem the roman history inform we that the son of tarquinius priscus though but fourteen year of age charge the enemy in the open field and conquer they wherefore to imortalize he valour he be the first who be honour with gold chain though accord to other hersilius the first bear of the ravish sabine at rome first receive that honour we also read that ricinnius dentatus be sixtythree time rewarded withbe 0 gold chain and twentyfive time with other gold or gilt present . the heart beset withprecious stone hang down to the breast on goldchain signify that wholesome advice and deliberation spring from the innermost of the heart wherefore those who triumphed be introduce with this goldchain about they neck in the utmost part whereof or the heart hang downto the breast they imagine be contain herb and balm which secure the triumpher from malice and envy asconius particularly remark that the children of the noble or free citizen wear those chain but the liberti or freedanen for distinction s 92 sake have they only of silver and copper to which juvenal in his satyr allude say the poor must be content with copper . the gold crown and bracelet which adorn both the shoulder and arm be likewise the reward of great action these gift be preserve for posterity as spur for young people indefatigably to tread in the step of they forefothers titus livius in he tenth book say that after the victory obtain overthe samnite near aquilonia papirius on that occasion present sp nautius he nephew spurius papirius four captain and troop of pikemen with bracelet andgold crown give the other captain footsoldier and horsem braceletand ornament of silver which they call crnicula or little horn and decius the tribune receive gold crown from aulas cornelius cossus for defend certain strong place belong to the roman against the samnite and forcing they to raise the siege . the roman also esteem the ring as badge of honour and nobility for becording to titus livius in he third book treat of the second punic war on mago92 be dispatch by hannibal to notify to the carthagenian the bloody defeat of the roman in the battle of can to he pour out before they a heap of gold ring take as booty from the slain add to extol the victory thatamong the roman none but the great and noble be allow to wear they andtowardstowards the close of he ninth book he relate that on flavius92 be in pub lic asfembly choose adilis or superintendant of the public building the nobility be so distinguisned that several of they lay down they gold ring andother token ofhonour and esteem and the eloquent ccero in he fourth oration against verre reproach he for bestow in public asfembly of the people the token of honour gold ring on mean and unworthy people with whom agree asconius say that the fasce civic crown and gold ring were by the people look on as badge of liberty and nobility and always attended with honour and profitable income . the greek repute the hat or cap as take of noble extraction whereforethey represent the head of ubss cover with hat or cap as be noble both by father and mother for this reason we commonly see on ancient coin and medal a hat or cap circumscribed liberta .the diamond be indisputably the hardest and for its sparkling the most beautiful and perfect of all precious stone and which be most surprising and remarkable it resist the consume fire without lose any of its virtue or excellence . wherefore it be use as a hieroglyphic of immoveable firmness in prosperityand adversity accordingly the ancient also attribute to it supernatural quality of freeing the heart from vain fear and despair and that it never leave man either in he pressure or danger when principally he ought to be master of himself .the plume of feather also signify honour and nobility and the trumpet esteem and a immortal name . the embroider coat call tunica palmata be a under garment commonlywear by those who triumphed acord to titus livius in he tenth book andisidorus hispalensis in he originum lib say that those who have conquered use to receive gown call toga palmata or toga picta from the victorie and palm branch work in it and macrobius lib saturnal cap .affirm that tullus hostilius first introduce this garment among the roman . the twofirst bassrelief explain themselves and by the third we mean strength for the lion s 92 skin imply high understanding and resolution of mind and the club conduct and intrepidity . second ordonnance relate to judge . in this we reprefent pair of scale sword lookglass septre topwith a eye board with triangle thereon inclose the number and the image of truth a hazel wand and fasce scythe rod be gold chain staff twinewith ivy large folio book whereto be affix the coat of arm of the commonwealth and on the wall fruitful palmtree in bassrelief. explanation of these object . the fcale commonly place in the hand of justice signify that weigh allmens mens action sne affign 92to every one what god have decreed he wherefore the heathen also represent astr e6 a ascend to heaven and seat there between the lion and scale intimate thereby that judge ought resolutely to punish trangreffion accord to they merit without respect person . the sword likewise signify justice and the severity of the law accord to the apostle ruler be the minister of god and bear not the sword in vain to execute wrath on he that doth evil lookglass in the hand of prudenoe denote reform of manners . the ancient agyprian by the hieroglyphic figure of the sceptre with a open ye fignify the absolute authority of equity and prudence which always watching and penetrate mens action justly reward each accord to he desert .platarch in he doctrine of the phythagorean intimate that the triangle be the most perfect figure of justice some palce the number within it because we therein see the godly character of the almighty . the image of truth explain itself . the hazel wand fignify ecclesiastical and the fasce secular dignity or religion and policy . the fcythe be bethe hieroglyphic of chastisement as we read in the prophet zechariah that the scythe he see in vision be go forth tocut off all thofe who steal or swore . the rod also imply punishment for the support of good discipline and lawaccord to equity and justice . the roman and some of the greek take the be hieroglyphically for heavychastisement we see in the medal and coin of tenedos mention by pollux for the king of tenedos have publish law that any person catch in adultery should be put92to death with the be and in compliance therewith not sparedhe own son he command this story to be strike on the coin and medal in order to be thereby immortalize . the agyptian likewise apply the bulla or gold chain and heart to their judge intimate that make pure truth they only aim they ought to be impartial and give judgment without respect of person . the staff twine with ivy signify that justice ought to be protectfor bythe staff be understand authority and by the ivy protection which should always flourish . the large folio book contain the statue and ordinance of the country . the fruit of the palmtree represent in bassrelief be of equal 92size with the jeave the ancient would thereby signify justice and equity this tree also con ac sisting of last matter and not alter or decay so soon asother serve for pattern of themaintenance of justice without impediment or alteration and as it never drop its leave as other do and refist alla pressure and weight thereby be imply that judge ought not to be biassed but withstand those who endeavour to draw they from theyduty by fair word gift or intrigue . ordornance relate to lawyer . in this table we exhibit plaister figure of mercury wing at head and foot stand on square stone pedestal have in one hand he golden caduceus twined with serpent and in the other a olive branch by he be plaister sphinx . also sword and fhield lyre or harp burn lamp a inkhorn with pens and roll of paper sieve some of the principal law book and abible in small vase or pot may be set a iris or two above on ring hang three garland one compose of laurel and ivy another of cedar and myrtle and the third of oak leave on the wall or in small table we see in bassrelief the fable of minerva bring forth out of jupiter 92 brain .explanation of the object . mercury imply the impreffion of word upon the mind and the force of eloquence wherefore the ancient believe he be the messenger and the interpreter of the god . the square stone whereon he ftand fignify the regard for and stability of the law and rule whereby to direct we speech for which reason mercury be stiletetragonus or square that be firm and certain . he staff or caduceus intimate that obstinate tyrant must yield to the law andhuent charm of eloquence by the serpent twine about the golden rod the ancient mean that eloquence temper with ingenuity and prudence can easilybring men92to reason some also would have the golden rod in the hand of mercury to92 signify the excellence and eminence of honourable office due to those who employ they eloquence the gift of heaven in they neighbour welfare and the common good . by the olive branch in mercury s 92 hand be understand peace for the ancient believe it compose 92 the difference of contend party . he wing at head and foot be affign he to signify the readinef and force of eloquence . the sphinx shew that nothing be so abstruse or occult that lawyer92 penetra ting judgment can not clear .we compare jurisprudence to92 the sword and thield for as warrior thereby defend himself and annoys he enemy so council get he cause by dint of cstrong argument and well grounded conclusion . the ancient roman signify by the lyre or harpe0 man of great learningand judgment for that instrument be compose of diver string and sound pro ducing fine harmony like the lawyer when he reconcile the difference of things to r e9ason in order to make contest party agree by the harp or lyre we also understand that harmony arise from different and dissonant cord and thatpeople of contrary sentiment meeting together may by good union settle andtransmit to posterity a excellent form of government and as plato in his timaeus stile the soul concert or sweet harmony so concord may be justlycallcall the soul of the state the gree e8 and roman say the lyre be partly invent by mercury and partly by other . the shape of the ancient lyre be this it be bent like two horn join together have swell bellyand on tophandle it be say to have have but three string and these could produce seven tune make perfect harmony . the three string be assign in imitation of the three season of the year known to the aguptian viz summer winter and spring each consist of four month and they attribute the cantus to the summer the bass to the winter and the treto the spring other say that this application respects man whose body consisting of four element and the soul in reference to its act ofthree thus makewherefore the darkness fly the light of true knowledge and understanding . lamp be sometimes take for the work do by it s light for as the night throughit be stilness be very proper for study so the greck poet also give the night namewhich signify the produce understanding wisdom and gladness as the mindbe then apt for meditation accordingly the old proverb of the student be plas olei quam vini he spend more in oil than wine mean more time in dili ac go labour of the mind to attain science than in take walk feast or other diversion epicharmus use to say that he who would study great thing mustnot for the sake of ease spare the night . the agyptian understand by the inkhorn pen and roll of paper all thingwhereby art and science

compare the lamp to the body the habitation of the soul and its fhiin light to the faculty of understanding but in scripture we often find that by the lamp be mean the doctor and teacher of art

hieroglyphically signify the tongue or word or eternal and heavenly eloquence for as bread support the body so the word of god nourish to eternal life and because bread by general consent imply

produce fruit acceptable to god . the jewissi priest be command to set the people pattern of chastity pietyand good behaviour and to be always ready to walk in god92 path as appear bythe white line girdle signify the most sacred and mysterious doctrine by whichthey ought to govern themselves and they congregation jerimiah92 girdle had the same meaning as gril largely shew as the girdle be white line we are lead to consider the first matter it be make of to wit flax . the seed of flax come up as green as grass in fhort time after sow andhave blossomed and set it be seed it be then pull and rot in water and afterward lay to dry in the sun and then be beaten to softness it be comband hatchel and spun into thread after boiling in strong lye it be make into web of line and whiten for dress to appear in before god the care nenecessary about this herb which be a emblem of undefiled life ought continuallyto be have in view that lay afide thing vain and unprofitable we may bymeans of science render ourselves irreproveable and through adverfity and temptation obtain the white garment of glory the quick and easy growth of flax shew how easily virtue and science be attainable if we set readily about they .hesychius understand by the flax the frail effort of mortal and the thread of the almighty 92 will always remain with we wherefore it be the duty of the ministrystry by stheir constent labour to give out the pax swhereof ten prepare 92 garment rf good work . many among the learned92 e mblematically fignify by the waggont wheel divihity because the whe ebfnever touch the ground but in one point so the soul lay to be elevate towards god thus divine be rightly compare to wheel fhat by forsake earthly thought they conversation should always be in heaven . the sapphire be always in great esteem as emblematically represent sovereignty and priesthood some say that this storie draw heavenly influence fromjupiter and saturn and that those who wear it obtain all they desire as fromjupiter dominlon and authority and from saturn the priesthood but according to the father this92 ftone represent the throne speak of by ezekiel to wit the s e9 at 92 af god erernal good and almighty and eacherius understand by the make of the hedven 92 the socie9ty of the pious and elect wherefore say hesychius thethrone of sapphiresignify 92 the tenth or empireal heaven for by the colour he understand purity clearnef and heavenly light always instruct the church in unalte9 rable and pure doctrine . we learn from scribture that the olivetree be originally th e9 emblem ofpeace for no sooner do the water abate but the dove which noah fend soonafter returnetl with a ofiveleaf as take that the wrath of heaven be appease god take compafsion on92 the remains of human race and other creatureiinthe ark and therefore cause the water to r eatire into the bowel of the earth .the olivebranch be also in scripture the emblem of 92 pious man as we see inthe gospel that the light ought92to burn pure on the candlestiek whereby our saviour intimate that both preacher and hearer should sill they jamp with the coil of christian virtue the sam be 9 tr e9e 92 for its continual verdure be also take forithe efblem of hope accordingly basilius wishie we might be like it becauseabound with blossom and fhining92 greennef it always afford hope of what be92to come or 92the durable fruit of piety and mercy . the wisest agyptian and greck do when mens understandings be fimple tand void of sophistry very properly calf the chain of certain science eneyclopa dia92as be by three circle so link together that the center of the one be the begin of the other and those inscribe within larger call theology for the inner circle signify human scienc eg which get root by means of custom reason and nature be perversely take for infallible but the circle inscribe they denote divine science we understand the same thing emblematically of the dress and ofnament of the highpriest92 among the jez for he girdle imply irreproveabl e9 manuer he priestly garb truth sound doctrine and discourse whichwith they explanation let man into the knowledge of thing or philosophy andhe glitt s e9ring robe signify pure divinity have no other tendency but correcction of manners and lead to virtue and heaven scripture teach that ee the spirit of wisdom enter not into the heart of the wick 92 accordingly mose denie the unclean and sinful entrance into the tabernacle thereby intimate thatthose who improve in virtue and the knowledge of god ought by the use of the five loave accord to grid or the five tart book of the law to prepare they heart for the two fishie or the doctrine of the evangelist and apostle and therein to pre serve . ferve next to the science for the improvement of manners divine should enwhich the learndeavour at distinctness plainness and order in they speech call dialectica whose province be to determine controversy and resolve doubt byreasoning justly for although like mose they practise moral duty and were receive into the sanctuary yet they touch not on sacred thing otherwise than by means of they speech after this they enquire into natural philosophy or physics have for the subject the universe and all create being this scienceclear they doubt and scruple and prepare they for contemplate the gloriwe building of the heaven in order to thank they creator for the knowledge receive they last study be theology which as we have say comprehend allscience this give divine such constant peace as neither the regularity of human deportment purest eloquence or the most exact enquiry into nature couldafford they but this unchangeable peace and firm alliance with god they obtain by submit they knowledge inclination and carnal affection to the rules prescribe by reason this mutual friendship which the pythagorean esteem the main point in philosophy lead we into the most secret part of the sanctuary in order to view the glory of god till at last arrive at the highest degree of knowledge we courageously defeat ofiris or the enemy of we soul . though the aforesaid instruction consist of four part yet solomon the wisest of man divide it into three science to wit ethic physics and metaphysics whichhe have handle in he proverb ecclefiast and song or canticum canticoaum teaching in the proverb moral obligation in ecclefiast the nature of thing and in he song the contemplation of thing supernatural this seem well to agree with the mention in scripture of the god of abraham lsaac and jacob for abraham92 obey god in all thing shew a example of moral duty lsaac92dig well and search the depth of the earth signify physics or natural philosophy and jacob92 dream of the ladder and the ascent and descent of the angel thereon the contemplation of divine thing both the hebrez greck andlatin divine have largely handle this subject even the element seem to inculcate this doctrine for the earth water and air by they wonderful conjunction represent the different degree of the science the earth and moisture implythe history of thing as teacher of moral duty the water disturb by the wind shew the turmoil happen in human action which ethic serve to allay the air admonisn that at length raise the whole force of we thought upward we ought continually to contemplate the divine nature call by the greck theologia which be the top and limit of we understanding we say nothing here of dialecticu because it be subservient to ethic physics and theology in order t of those three science . by the equilateral triangle we signify the aim and purpose of a holy and in nocent life because to make it both edify and happy three duty be necessary to wit to give we neighbour wholesome advice to judge justly and to do well wherefore pallas be by the heathen call tritonia as nave the care of impartial justice the agyptian and greek who be chiefly famous for emblematic learning judicioussy understand by the triangle the assiduity of human understanding in search into thing heavenly earthly and subterranean other wouldsignifyfignify by it mathematics phyfic and metaphyfics with which the opinion of socrate well agree .the squareimply constancy and immoveableness because however turn it alway shew four line and as many angles these though mathematical observation be very applicable to those who love piety and other christian virtue sincethey remain constantly with they and embalm they memory to posterity aristotle in he first book of moral duty and third book to theodat be of the same opinion believe that man by comparison may be call square or perfect andpious this quadrate with the latin proverb quadragonum in se perfectum criminis exper the square be perfect and not liable to censure ancient divine teach that noal92 ark which god command to be build square signifythe excellent pastor of the church by whose instruction notwithstanding any snare or heresy man be lead to eternal happiness for adamantius exhort to build square library nof4t of stone or wood but of the book of the prophet apostle and teacher out of which may be abundantly learn true wisdom and divine . mystery and renouncing sin to turn and adhere to the true and immutable cornerstone of salvation . the ancient agyptian hieroglyphically signify by the rock firmnef and con. stancy wherefore david speak of god92 assistance say thou art my rock92and we saviour imitate the duration of the church say ec he will build it on rock 92 agreeable whereto be the dream oof nebuchadnezzar in which he see gede lalager whose head wit of gold breast andarm of siver bellpane duighoee hand which smote the image and break it in piece which the wind carryaway so that no place be found 92 for they and the stone that smote the image become great mountain and fill the whole earththe palmtree as have the lower part of its stem thin and knotty but higher up become thick and agreeable for its continual elegant and spread verdure fignify that how abject soever the condition of the righteous may be in the beginning they at last gain wonderful beauty in virtue and good quality but let I add the word of the pious and l e9 arn eucherius ee the palmtree92 say he can differ from all other because they be thickest downwards and run taper upward and with more point branch and these may be compare to worldling who slighting the best thing seek they satisfaction only in the frail and momentary these man spare no labour or trouble in heap rich will even purchase temporal honour at the hazard of they life but stop at once when they be to bestow a hour92 service on they creator or to fuccour distress neighbour whereas the pious may be rightly compare to the palmtree which by its tender stem despise earthly pleasure exalt its virtue on high that it may adhere to and obey the will of the creator wherefore it be say that the righteous shall grow and blossom as the palmtree the cedartree as yield excellent and useful fruit be the emblem of mercyand piety two virtue best become the pillar of the ehurch who be ee continually to watch over the lose sheep of the house of lsrael92 and to practise work of mercy on they accord to st

supply the ifraelite with the knowledge of god and be sill with he spirit . they holy man compose hymn to the glory of he name several commentator on fcripture and illustrious instrument of the church would signify by thetspring water the apostle and first / teacher and euthymius and the primitive father the preach of the gospel and david in ps civ say ec he send . the spring into the valley whioh run among the hill they giye drink to everx beast of the field there by intimate that no place be so hilly or unattainable which god92 law can not penetrate writer mention that the elephant who be know to be the most docible of quadruped and by nature superior to other beast particularly love charity andpiety for as soon as the new moon enlighten the earth he purify himself in clear river and when fick take graf and other herbage with he trunk andsling it towards heaven as ifhe thereby invoke 92 the divine affistance in he weak condition .scripture as remarkably speak of the stork emblematically mean purifyunderstanding and mind exalt above earthly thing for this bird always buildon the top of the highest house to save himself from the wile of beast andafter hatch he young be at continual war with the snake which always creeping on the ground and into thehole thereof be a emblem of viscious affection wherefore in imitation of the ftork man should exait theirmind and seek dwellingplace in heaven where they will be freed from all the wile of the flesn and the craft of the devil .the ancient understand by the emblem of the cock the immortality anddivi ac nity of the foul and pythagora command he follower of feed and nurse the cock mean that they should feed they soul with the knowledge of divine thing wherefore socrate when die full of hope of speedyunion of he im ac mortal soulwiththedeity say he be bound in duty to offen cock to asculapius mean the phyfician of the soul for know he dissolution be at hand he believe he should now be cure of all he infirmity plato92 follower andcommentator say that the offering cock imply the soul92 departure for heaven to publisn for ever the glory of phaebus . by the mustardseed be signify thing which from small and mean beginning produce plenty of fruit wherefore wesaviqun fay ee lf ye have faith a grain of mastardseed for though the seed of thisplant be small vet be duly husbandedt in good ground it yield plant furpass all other whichin fhort time become tree for fowl of the air to build in and such be the fruitfulness of divinity which proceed from small seed soon become tree the expansion of wfiose branch shade the whole earth and yield place for the fowl of the air tolodge in or accord to hesychius ee man take up with the contemplacion ef divinetking ocher learn nien say that this seed implythe wonderful power of god which as small and contemptible feed lie hide inthe reading of scripture and despised by many for its tartness but on chew strengthen and oleanse the stomach correct vapour and humidity disturbingthe brain and refine the taste in order to we more exact search into the writingsof wise man and divine mystery for accord to horace nemo ade ferus est ut non mitescere possit si modo cultur e6 patientem commodat aurem . or the breast remain wild we need not fear after good learning have admission there . but wave horac we saviour charge we ee to search the scripture 92 92 whichsome disciple on certain occafion finding of too sharp and disagreeable taste think too hard and not to be understand but be prepare with this seed they will appear better to we than we at first expect dispelling the darkness of we understanding and purge it of all earthly humidity and evil thought tillwith hagar we in any distress discover the fountain of living water in the wilderness of this life wherewith to refresh and strengthen we faint soul moreover the mustardseed come up green and be with difficulty to be rootout after sow imply the constant rise and propagation of divine truth andthose who have once try the agreeable taste of the plant will never be drawn from ufe it this sprig have get root in the heart will grow and produce seedwhich wild beast can not tread down cold or heat wither or persecution extirpate by the same seed be also signify bright and vigilant soul and a high understanding for they who be seize with the lethargy have they head after shave rub with it for they recovery and thus we circumcise heart are likewise with the mustardseed cleanse from the lethargy of sin for conversion .pythagora once taste leaf of this plant afterwards much admire it and found that its spirit fly upwards as if alcend to heaven for the virtue go upthe nose to the brain purge it and clear the understanding . democritus say that few grain of it boil with other green make they soft and tender let we in like manner so mix the emblematie mustardseed with we divinethought that when become tender they may send steam and sweet savour up to heaven where we soul united with god can no more be affect with hunger thirsta or drowsiness but continually employ in praising the almighty . in this last ordonnance relate to divine we have crowded together great variety of object only to shew how fruitful this subject be in material for divinity comprising philosophy physics dialectica rhetoric logic and each of these afford plentiful matter the ingenious artist may by consult good author gain a inexhaustible treasure of thing and then as he thinx proper more easily leave out some than have too few represent they lame and defective to the know . chap iv of the origin nature and quality of the roman triumphal crown and other reward of honour . we learn from history how noble the ancient roman be in gratifvethe virtue valour and conduct of they citizen soldier and commander besides they ordinary pay with triumphal crown jewel and other present as an example to other to tread in the same step for the good of they country andwe judge this point very proper to be handle next to still life as it will conduce to make the emblematic sense of good piece more perfect .after commander have gain either great advantage or victory over the enemy in siege battle or sea fight he accord to custom make a exact inquiry what person have behaved with the greatest valour and resolution and then place himself on stage raise for that purpose and return thanks to the god for the victory obtain he commend the army in general for they steadyadherence and each company in particular which have shew the greatest courage then name they one after another he extol they valour stile they friendand lover of they country and tell they how highly they oblige the commonwealth by they loyalty and brave behaviour and thereupon in the name of the senate he distribute among they many rich present consist of crownof gold and silver girdle gold chain bracelet ring for ear and finger bemour shield pike sword javelin standard sine horse furniture and other elegantly wring warlike instrument which none durst use or wear but thosewho have purchase they in the manner aforesaid the roman story aboundwith such occurrence but especially titus livius who relate that the consul pa irius cursor bestow gold bracelet among four hundred man and afterwardsmagnificently rewarded whole legion he tell we the same thing of scipio when he wage war with spain and other country and we read lucius antontus son of lucius fubius quadratus be twice dignify by the emperor of tiberius with gold ornament for the neck and arm . but besides the native valour and military discipline for which the ancient roman be particularly famous we learn from pliny and salinus that oftentime single person by he virtue and valour obtain all the aforesaid ornament as we see in marcus sergius who receive almost oll those token of honour and even inthe battle of thrasimenus and trebir and the bloody one at can to in all whichthe roman be defeat by hanibal he obtain civic crown it be related of this sergius that have in battle lose he right hand and fix a iron one in itsplace he so manage with he left as one day to slay four armed man one after another and that in fight and skirmishy he have receive twentythree woundin the forepart of he body and yet this man be inferior to lucius sicinnius de ntat e6 tatus overseer of the city of rome of whom pliny solinus valerius maximus andaulus gillius unanimoussy report that he great merit have gain he from the senate above three hundred and twenty honorary present of all fort and that he nine time make he entrance in triumph with the general whom by he valour and conduct he have assist in they conquest and that he could shew great number of lance and pike unironed which as so many token of honour fall to he share as also eighteen gold and eightythree silver neckornament twentyfive costly horsefurniture a hundred and forty bracelet fourteen civic crown eight castrense three mural one obsidional and know not how many naval or rostral crown he have receive fortyfive wound and those in he forepartonly disarmed the enemy thirtyfour time and fight one hundred and twentybattle in word he be stile the roman achille . the crown bestow on man of particular merit have degree of dignity andparticular name suit the nature of the victory as corana obsidionalis cixica triumphalis ovalis muralis navalis and castrensis .the corona obsidionalis or obsidional crown be the most excellent of all for when roman town or camp besieg and reduce to extremity be relieved by roman captain the commonwealth rewarded the action in the most noble man ac ner viz this crown though make of grass be account of more worth than if of gold and enrich with precious stone the grass be pull up in the field of battle wherefore this crown be say to be sacred to mar which boccatius seemto affirm possibly because the graf grow mostly in open place and field of en campment the great quintus fabius be in reward of he merit by the general . consent of the senate and roman people honour with this crown when in the second punic war he deliver the city from the approach ruin and extremitywhich hannibal have bring it to amilius scipio have the same gift in africa for rescue the consul manlius and he force out of the power of the enemy calpurnius obtain the same honour in sicily as do also the incomparable lucius sicinnius dentatus .the coronacivica or civic crown be give to he who hrd preserve roman citizen from imminent danger or release from captivity this crown be made of oak sprig and leave with the fruit hang at it and by the general92 order who give it to the person set at liberty put on the deliverer92 head but though person have save king or other great ally of the roman from fall into the enemy hand yet he get not this crown which be only due to he who have freed roman citizen from death or slavery pliny say this crown be also presentto he who slew the first of the enemy besieg roman town it be next in dignity to the corona obsidionalis and wear on several occasion especially on the great festival and solemnity and in the play and other public sport thosewho be honour withit sit next to the senate and at they entrance be receive by they with all the mark of respect these person with they fatherand grandfather be entirely exempt from all charge and tax as havebegot son so beneficial to the commonwealth they be also at liberty to accept or refuse public office several roman obtain this honour especially the aforesay valiant lucius sicinnius dentatus who fourteen time glory in it as capitolinus dodo six the brave marcas sergius likewise receive it from the senate and in word all those who in a extraordinary manner have benefite the city or country . the famous cicero be of erow by partieular decree of th e8 senate for havehappily deliver the city from the imminent danger of the catiline conspiracy . thefe crown though seemingly simple as be make of graf and sprig of tree be yet of greater account than thofe of gold and jewel they be of oak because the acorn be the most ancient food and because that tree be sacred to ju piter the tutelar god the victor in the capitoline game institute by domitian as also stageplayer mufician and poet be likewise crowned with oakleave . the corona triumphalis or triumphal crown be give to the general who hav ac ing overthrown the enemy in pitch battle have there by either save roman ally or annex some dominion to the commonwealth wherefore he be also in ac troduce inta the city in triumph riding in gill chariot draw by four or according to some six white horse this crown be make of laurel faer to apodlo for its greennef and red berry and signify that the victory be attend with muchtrouble danger and bloodfh sextus relate that the soldier use to follow the chariot of the conqueror also croun with laurel to purify they on enter the city from the blood of the slain by the fuffiage of the fenate the victor in the wrestling game be honour with the same crown and it be anciently given oo man eminent for heroic poetry and eloquence wherefore hefiod say ee the musea have croun he with sceptre and erow of

excel in warlike atchievement cause they in the public pleading to fit in the sella cuyulis or the pretor92 ivory chair as we read of the great scipie andit often happen since all thing center in the voice and consent of the people that some of the soldiery be invest with greater power and privileges allgeneral who by conquest have enlarge the empire be allow to set up their statue in the consular dress augustus to eternize the memory of all such gene ac ral as have augment the state ordamed that next to the god the first veneration should be pay to they and for that purpose build gallery in he

maimsoldier as many land in the province they conquer as would comfortablysupport they and they family for the remainder of they life on this foot the city of seville in spain and the fruitful country round it be make roman colony by julius casar and corduba and several other place in diver part of the world be apply to the same purpose in word roman service never missreward and for this reason the commonwealth produce more brave man than any other nation whatsoever every one exert himself to attain all the degrees of of honour by the strictest virtue but on the other hand the vicious and cowardly be in proportion to they offence as severely punissied either by deprivation of they honourable office and future hope or else by be whip with rod till the blood come or loaden with iron and madt slave titus livius relate that troop of appius claudius cowardly desert certain post which theybe set to guard be rigoroussy punish by every tenth man92 be put to death accord to lot without respect of person julius frontinus write thatmarcus antonius cause certain troop who have not dulv defend townwall and fortification to undergo the same fate there be many other method for punish the disobedience of the roman soldiery which shall paf by and conclude with horace . adsit regula peccatis qua panas erogete6quas.that be crime do require the penalty of the law and strictest justice greatest reverance draw . chap of the solemnity of the roman triumph . two motive generally incite man to do great thing either in time of peace or war to wit honour and immortal fame or rich and profit .generous soul always aspire at the former and reject the latter as below they . the roman governinent know perfectly well how to make its advantage of these inducement in the encouragement give to its subject and we shall begin with the triumph by which they honour and rouze the valiour of they heros . the triumph be a entrance and welcome of general by decree of the senate after a happy expedition and the conclusion of war whereby in the most solemn and pompous manner they shew he they great esteem on the day of entry the inhabitant of all the town flock to rome and the whole citv temple street gate house and window be hang with all sort of costly stuff in gold silver and silk and beautifully deck with great variety of green branch and flower in word nothing be want to shew either the power magnificence or joy of the roman on this occasion the senate clergy nobility and most eminent citizen and therefore the greatest part of rome richlydress meet the conqueror without the town gate he sit in a ivory chair call sede curulis in gold chariot sparkling with precious stone and drawn cither by four or six white horse magnificiently equip and be dress in garment of purple and gold call toga palmata crowned with laurel and the staffof of command in he hand or else wing image of victory hold crown of laurel or palm branch . sometimes this figure be place behind he holdin its right hand crown of laurel over he head as we see it both way in the ancient bass relief and medal the prisoner of war dress like slave andwith shorn head and the king or general with the most eminent of the vanquishied be lead in fetter couple before the chariot which the roman legionfollow in troops or company on foot and horseback in they order richlyarmed and with they pike and lance twine with laurel as take of general joy but they who have most singulize themselves in valour march on each side of the chariot with crown of laurel on they head and palm branch inthey hand before the conqueror go likewise some carriage lade with the arm banner gold and silver vase jewel gold and silver coin take as bootyfrom the eneniy together with the gift and present he have receive from the friend and ally of the roman next come some castle and tower of wood elegantly carve resemble the town and fortress gain of the enemy in their passage the army feign some battle in so lively manner as thereby to affect the spectator with all sort of paffion as forrow joy and fright the varietyof those sight be so great and excessive as to spin out the cavalcade for three or four day and be arrive at the capital all the arm and booty call mannubiae take from the enemy be hang up and deposit in the temple of ju piter as a eternal memorial of the virtue of the conquerer here the senate return they thanks for the service do to they country and commonly chusethe victor as coajutor in the government the joy conclude with magnificent entertainment but for form better idea of these triumph and the order therein observe ishall as far as my memory will permit give some examples of they out of the roman history .plutarch describe the triumph vote to paulus amilias for he victory over the great perseus king of macedonia in this manner .first the people of rome and the neighbour town magnificiently dress appear at the door and window in the balcony garret and on top of house in great multitude as spectator of the solemnity all the temple in rome richly adorn be set open the house and street be wonderfullygarnish with all sort of costly hanging and fill with green flower choice perfume and thousand other fine and delightful thing and as the concourse of people be very great man with stave be appoint to make and preseve lane or passage through they for the march of the triumpher the first day be spend in the procession of the banner standard ensign statute coloss picture and figure all place on carriage elegantly paint and slowly drive . the second day be take up with the passage of the bright armour of the vanquishied king and macedonian place on neat chariot or carriage make for thatpurpose to these succeed three thousand man partly carry the gold andsilver coin in three hundred and fifty large silver dish and vase each weighthree talent and carry by four man the remainder of these man bore fountain and stately vase of filver artfully wring on the third day appearthe first company precede by great number of piper drum hautboy andtrumpet trumpet make warlike mufic as if prepare for a onset these were follow by hundred and twenty cow deck with gill horn and sacred linen covering and all sort of green garland wreathe with flower lead for victim by beautiful vo man richly dress and succeed by company of child carry gold and silver dissie for the use of the sacrifice after these come the bearer of the gold vase with gold coin in numberseventytwo follow by several great officer of the retinue of antigonus and seleucus late king of mucedonia andeven of perseus himself carry ing the excessive large gold vessel weigh ing ten talent and enrich with all sort of precious stone and diamond which be made by amilius92 express order next to these appear the bodychariot of the conquer king and therein he coat of arm diadem or royal headband crownand ceptre then follow the child of the unhappy prince attend by great numnber of he courtier as steward secretary and other such domestic weep and lament they slavery in such manner as consider the vicitude of human affair to raise compassion in the spectator especially the sight of the three innocent child two son and daughter who by reason of they tender age be insensible of they unhappy condition after these appear the father dress in black accord to the custom of he country and walk full of terror and concern on this occasion next to he come he friend favourite and confident who fix they eye onhim and bitterly weep move many of the roman themselves with tear in they eye to pity both they and the king92forrowful condition to these fucceed the gold crown which the ancient free city have present to the conquerer as gratulation for he victory and then come amilius himself sit on gold triumphal chariot dress in purple garment richly wring with gold with larurel branch in he hand and crown of the same on he head he be follow by the army horse and foot orderly marshall under they proper ensign have garland of laurel and palm branch in they hand and sing hymn in praise of the victor and victory . thus paulus amilius make he triumphal entrance into the famous city of romt where he offer the booty in the temple of jupiter capitolinus and return the god thanks for he victory and triumph . all other triumph be manage much in the same manner with abatement of some circumstance accord to the pleasure of the general who be honourwith they . and though we find the solemnity regulate by law precisely direct inwhat manner at what time and through what gate and street the cavalcade be to paf yet as for the play shew and other less appertenance they were lessen or augment at the will of the victor with liberty to chuse the chariot .history tell we that the chariot be commonly draw by four white horse butwe also find bull use for the same purpose pompy the great have subdueafrica make he entry on chariot draw by elephant suctonius relate thatjulus caesar triumphed in one with forty elephant the emperor gordianus triumphed in the same manner caius marius have subject afiica and extended the roman jurisdiction into agypt be draw by the same kind of beast scipo agricanus triumphed withelephant for the same reafon the emperor augustas on on he victorious return from the east and end the war with anthony be bythe confent of the senate and people of rome draw by four elephant the emperor vespasian have the same honour on finish several great war in the east the elephant denote the conquest of country where those creature breed .flavius in he history tell we that the emperor aurelian who be king of the goth make he entrance on chariot draw by stag but marcus antonius made use of tame lion intimate that in the civil war he would make the most va liant submit to he command which cicero in he oration call philippicae object he say that he triumphal chariot with lion imply a arbitraryman aim at monarchy .the roman general when they triumphed have also custom of carry one or more young child in they chariot as we gather from cicero92 speech before murena some use to be attend with great number of strange wild beast as lion bear tiger rhinocerose panthers dromedary and such like as josephus in he history of the vespasian mention other have vocal and instrumental music and other diversion among these triumph those of pompy the great casar the two scipio92 brother and several emperor have somethingsingular as blondus in he treatise intitle rome triumphant largely discourse . the triumph conqueror be likewise allow to set up they statue in temples and public place and to erect column and costly structure of marble callarcus triumphale whereon be carve in bass relief they battle and victoryfor eternal monument to posterity remains whereof we see to this day at rome and elsewhere herein the roman imitate the ancient greek who for memorial of great action set up trophy make in the follow manner . in the place of victory they fix the highest tree to be find in the neighbourhood and then chop of the branch they in honour to the victor hang on the remain limb the arm of the vanquish calling that tree trophaeum from the greek word tropi which signify overthrow slight and giveway because the enemy be in that place put to flight the roman afterwardsmake use of they for the same purpose for sallustius in he memoir relate thatpompey have conquer the spaniards plant he trophy on the top of the highest pyrenee and this custom afterwards grow into such esteem that theybe make of stone but accord to scripture the usuage be very ancient among other nation for it appear in chap of sam that saul havevanquish agag king of the amalelite and be come to mount carmel set upa arcus triumphalis or place in word the honour of triumph be becount by the roman as take of the highest esteem and therefore to obtain it they general spared for no toil or danger in warlike atchievement add to this the rich commonly arise from such glory by the present make theyby the ally and the booty of the enemy . in my opinion historian have describe the matter so circumstantially on purpose to put prince and governor in mind of reward the desert of their general soldier and man of merit and that the uuskilful cowardly and unfit for command iight not be range with those who willingly sacrifice they fortune capacity and bodily labour to the benefit of they country accordinglyto to paulus orofiris three hundred and twenty person have be honour with the roman triumph of whom the emperor probut in whose feign the fabric of the roman monarchy begin to decay be the last . let we here subjoin grecian triump antiochus surname epiphane or the illustrious king of sria have hear of the aforesaid glorious triumph of paalus amilius be so puff up with ambition that he resolve to make fort of one furpass it in magnificence to which end he cause proclamation to be made throughout he kingdom that at certain time he would at daphne hold grand and uncommon tournament which curiofity draw out of greece and the neighbouring country great concourse of people and the cavalcade be in the follow manner .first march five thousand grecian young man armed roman like followby as many mysians finely habit after they fafhion next appear three thousand thracian and five thousand galatian follow by vast number of other nation call for they silver shield argyraspide after these come two hundred and fifty rank of swordplayer call by the roman gladiator and then thousand knights with chaplet of gold about they head and they horsecostly equip with gold embroider housing and gold and silver bridle . these be follow by thousand other knights call companion afsociatewith some of the king92 friend and confident then appear thousand nobleman on foot and after they thousand other knights call the king92troops next come one thousand five hundred knights in gold armour overwhich they have coat of armour richly embroider with gold and silver and artfully adorn with all sort of animal to these succeed a hundred chariot each draw by fix horse follow by forty other each with four after theseappear chariot with elephant follow by thirtysix of the same kind of creature and those by eight hundred boy have garland aud crown ornament with gold in they hand next come thousand fat oxen with eighthundred indian elephant tooth after these be carry a infinite number of idol and figure of decease person who have be famous for art and science dress in gold and silver stuff adorn with precious stone with they name dignity and action write on the pedestals then come slave bear idol represent night and morning midday and evening and a infinite number of gold and silver vessel of great value next appear six hundred of the king92page dress in gold stuff follow by two hundred lady carry gold box sill with all manner of rich perfume and ordoriferious balm and these by fortysedan of massy silver carry as many lady and those by eighty gold sedans with lady dress in gold silver and jewel the street abound with all sortof rich oil balm and perfume this cavalcade last thirty day successively attend with play tournament and shew during which time every person after perfume himself be allow to fit at the royal table one thousand five hundred in number and to feast at the king92 expence to proceed to the roman . another solemnity obtain among they cafl ovatio which be inferior to the triumph in fome of its requisite for instance if the victor be not of consular or proconsular dignity or have meet with little resistence from the enemy or gain the victory without great bloodshed or have overcome people of fmal worth or as we faid speak of the corona ovalis when the war be undertake without the express command of the senate in such case the victorg be solemnly welcome with the ovatio in the follow manner . the general enter the city on horseback or as anciently on foot crownedwith myrtle tree facr to venus because the victory be gain not in martial manner but in manner become that goddess and woman as aulus gellius say and the troops in they possession appear not in arm and instead of druin trumpet and other warlike instrument they music be flute andother soft found the general enter with the booty in a orderly manner follow by he army and the senate solemnly receive he without the citygatehighly commend he action history tell we that several great generalsue for and accept this honour the first be posthumius libertus on he havesubdue the sabine and next marcus marcellus after the conquest of svracuse suetonius telate that augustus after the battle of philippi and on finilhing the war in sicily obtain that honour and pliny say that several general deny bythe senate the honour of the great triumph be decreed the ovatio which was so call from the general92 offering fheep in latin ovis when he come to the be derive from the shout of the people who use to cry oel or else ove whatever the truth be this solemn entrance be always call by the roman ovatio .other triumph of these people ishall for brevity omit speak of he who want further information may read appianus alexandrinus and ammiannus marcellinus the former describe the triumph of scipio africanus and the latter that of the emperor constantius . chap vi of the manner of the four principal and public grecian game and to whose honour institute . hhe antiquity and manners of the grecian game be somewhat unknown to many curious artist ithink it will be acceptable to give fhort description as well as can of the four principal game so highly and so often extolled by the greek and roman writer . the first and principal be call the obympic game hold near the city of obmpia in the province of elis and institute in honour of jupiter olympius bythe idan hercule and he four brother p 9coneus idas jasius and epimede meeting together from mount lda in candia and be five brethren they be stilethe ldaan dactyl these game be celebrate every five year with great solemnity the ancient therefore reckone they time by obympiad there by understanding period of five year they consist of five sort of exercife viz .run wrestling box throw the coit and leap the place of exercise be fence in with pale and no spectator be suffer to come within it . some pretend these game be institute by jupiter after he have destroy the giant who attempt to storm heaven and that apollo have get the preference in out run mercury that mar bear away the prize in wrestling box . other prove that each of the aforesaid bretheran invent he game and exercise and that be five in number they be from the five finger named dactyl dactylo in greek signify finger . the greek call these five exercise pentathlon and the lattin quinquertium . two of they have dependence on the leg viz run and leap two on the arm as coit and box and the wrestling respected both arm and leg the victor in all the five exercise be by the greek call pancratiast word compound of pan and krato signify bestow whole force of the body . prize be adjudge to he who gain he point most dextrouslsy accordingly they strike with fist and elbow kick bit scratch and sprain the finger hand and other part of the body they even endeavour to thrust out each other eye with they thumb in short no artifice be omit for gainthe victory . we shall briefly relate in what manner the aforesaid five excercise were perform . the circus wherein they run on foot be originally stadium or six hundred geomitrical foot in length but in the fourth olympiad they double it thisrace be at first on foot and in alight dress but afterwards on horseback and in armour man call runner on foot be also admit armed srom top to toe this excercise be judge very proper for the body of warrior the first victor herein be demaratus of herea and the hymn sung in they honour sufficiently testify they running in armour but the first who get the prize in running without armour be chorabus of elis after long contest with he about it arrachion of phigalia obtain the prize in the second and third excercife andpolycrate of messene man of noble extraction get much honour and glory in the fourth wherein he be victor .the wrestling be undertake after the body have be thoroughly anointedin order to prevent gripe and then daub with fine dust to dry the sweat . thus prepare the wrestler enter the list and begin with seize the hand then the arm and body under the short rib thus endeavour by va rious method of strength and dexterity in kick pufh and othet trick to fling one another on they back for fall on the belly go for nothing be ac fore they enter the ring they cause they part to be soundly rub to make they more supple and agile . boxbox and fight with fling be the most dangerous exercife the former be anciently perform with oxleather thong tie about the hand by but which with wonderful activity they deal each other with very hard blow . the sling consist of small leather strap arm at the end with little leaden ball the blow whereof when it happen on the head lay the adversary dead .the coit be flat round heavy piece of stone or lead to try the force of armsand hand and to see who could sling highest and furthest a excercise still in use in many place to this day but with this difference that the ancient with leg lift up throw the coit at mark set up on small pyramid and resemblepineapple . the fifth excercise be lef perilous as consist only of diver manners of leap . the ancient garland or crown give as prize to the victor on these occasion be make of olive leave but they varied accord to the time for theybe afterwards compose of couch grass willow laurel myrtle oak palm and wild parsley leave as plutarch in the life of cato uticensis relate but when make of olive leave they choose select kind call calistephancs beautiful crown have hanging branch like the myrtle very proper for twistgarland the leave of such garland differ much from other in that being white without the green when twist be inward whereas the other bewhite within and appear green without hercule and he bretheran first bring this plant into greece from the northern country as pausanias in his olympus tell we .the phythian game be institute long before the lsthmian yet after the olympic and celebrate in honour of apollo for he victory over the frightful serpent python some think they be so call from pytho the place of celebration or else from the greek word pythestai to consult because they there consult the oracle in order to know the event of thing to come the exercifes in these game only differ in the olympic in this that the phythian be performunder the sound of all sort of vocal and instrumental music these game from time to time have several alteration in form and solemnity after the institution of the pancratium or quinquertiam and it be related that in the firste0 pythiade wherein the most illustrious heroes and god of the ancient enter the list for the sake of the prize castor prevail in the horserace pollux in box callais in run on foot zethee in run in compleat armour peleus in throw . the coit telamon in wrestling and hercule in the pancratium or all the game . in each of these game and exercife the victor be crowned with laurel which in particular be consecrate to they because the ancient believe bywhat they have feign of peneus92 daughter with whom apollo be so much enamour and who be metamorphose into that tree that the god take singular delight in it but other will have the institution of the phythian game to be long before apollo92 amour with the beautiful daphne and before the laurel pythiade signify certain number of year in the pythian game . bore bear that distinction both the triumphal and victor crown and garland were make of palm or oakleave as ovia in he first book of metamorphofis teftify .plutarch and pausanias relate that theseus on he return from creia adorn the victor in the game institute in honour of apollo with garland of palm of praise and renown for the laurel be not know till after the phythin game be settle and when know it give rise to the aforesaid fable of daphne and both the tree and leave be find of so extraordinary make and nature illustrious victor and man of learning be commonly crowned with it some again say that apollo affect the leave and blossom of the appletree before he choose the laurel and therefore the victor in run wrestling ought to be crowned with that as the poet archia in he mytholog lib cap relate but lucianus affert that though in the phythian game the garland of laurel began to prevail yet they be intermix with sine yellow apple some writereven affirm that the laurel of delpho bear such large berry or fruit as almoft to gain92 the name of apple but the true reason of this difference proceedfrom the several alteration make both in the prize and time of hold thosegame for originally they be celebrate every ninth year from the number of nymph feign by the ancient to come from mount parnassus to offer to apcllo on he have overcome the delphic monster python and afterwards every fifth .the nemaan game be keep in wood of that name situate between phliuns and cleona two city of achia in honour and memory of archemorus otherwise call ophelt son of lycurgus on account of he be kill by serpent in thiswood which accident some relate thus oedepus have through mistake marrie he own mother the widow of laus king of thebe begat on she two fon eteocle and polynice to whom he resign the royal dignity on condition theygovern by turn but eteocle as the eldest have obtain the first year92 admi ac fistration refuse to admit he brother as partner to govern the second year who thereupon in discontent solicit the aid of adrastus king of argo whose daughter call argia he marry the king in conjunction with he other son inlaw zydeus raise great army in order to wage war with the thebans and bringthey to reafon the issue ofthis war be the death of the two92other in duel and they body accord to custom be lay on large pile of wood to be burnt the flame happen to divide and seperate as if they bear witness of they immortal hatred of the two bretheran in they lifetime which cease not with they death now in the army which adrastus send to polynice 92 assistance be seven commander who be arrive in the island lemno pertain to thracia and seize with a extreme thirst meet hypsipyle cary in she armthe child ophelt son of lycurgus priest of jupiter and euridice whom being native of that country they intreate to shew they where to get some water . whereupon she in haste vet fearful of lay the child on the ground as forbidden by the oracle before he could walk set he naked on the graf by bed of wild parsley near fountain where serpent lie perdue suddenly wound itself about the child neck and throttle he while she be go to draw water . the commander be apprise of this accident kill the serpent and to solace the the father institute in honour of he son so suddenly lose the aforesaid game to beheld every third year wherefore originally only soldier and they descendantbe admit to they though in procef oftime they be free for every person . theagne in he memoir of agina book chap relate that hypsipyle fleed fromlemne to nemda on account of combination among the woman to kill the man only out of jealousy because by the instigation of venus highly ineense againstthey they have to do with other woman accordingly they all put they design in practice except hypsipyle who endeavour to save she father92 life byhide he in baker 92 trough this happen soon after the departure of the argonaat and they arrival in this island but be discover they flung hewith the trough into the sea and condemned hypsipyle to die for not agree to they general resolution she hear this make she escape but in she flight be take by pirate and sell for slave to lycurgus whose wife euridice defire fhe might be put to death for the misfortune of she child she hide herself in remote and solitary place where be discover by the soothsayer amphiaraus to the two son of euridice thoa and eunoenus who make diligent search after she she be through they intercession and the commander testimony of her innocence pardon and readmit into favour other will have it that shecule institute these game on have kill in the wood nemaa terrible lion who devour all before he and lay the country waste some say they be set up in honour and memory of archemorus but that hercule after have slain the nemaan lion with whose skin he cover he head and body broughth they undere0 regulation and dedicated they to jupiter appoint they solemnization to be every three year on the day of the month call by the corinthian panemos and by the athenian boedromib answer to we month of august andthe rather as theseus have in that month happily vanquish the amazon but oth err be of opinion that it be do in memory of ophelt who by he own death presage the fate of the lacedemonian at war with the thebans yet some think thatthis be another ophelt son of eupheta and geusa who be lay on the ground by he nurse while she go to shiew some commander fountain was kill by serpent . the nemaan game be therefore institute in memory and consolation of lycurgus etridice and ophelt and the judge who determine the prize were dress in black and mourn garment for ophelt be afterwards call bechemorus because amphiaraus have at he birth presage he a early and untimely death archo signify in greek begin and moro death as if they sayee die shortly after he birth in which sense speak the poet ee naseente morimur finisque ab origine pendet be that be ee we begin die from we birth and we beginnings and end havea inseparable union . the excercise in these game be the same as in other but the victorbe crowned with green parsley mostly use in funeral to perpetuate the Iend mory of archemorus whether the greek selinon with we common parsleythe the petroselinon or stone parsley be the same let the botanist determine originallythe victor be crowned with garland of olife but after the defeat of the mede they begin to be present with one of wild parsley in memory of thosewho be slain in that bloody battle and afrer this regulation the say herb instead of croun the head on occasion of joyful meeting serve only in timeof sorrow and mourn for accord to the greek say this herb be veryearthy as spread long time over the ground and often bear to be dug upin order to gete0 deeeper root the seed or it also on sow be longer than otherin come up wherefore it be necessary that the mortal greek ophely afterward as we have say call art hemorus should be crowned with earthly honour .for of the four principal game which we handle in this chapter two accordto the poet archia be sacred to mortal and the other to deity the mortals be archemorus and meliceria whois also call palamon and the god be jupiter and apollo the wild parsley be not without reason appropriate to thesegany because some think it sprung from the blood of the child kill by the serpent yet this contradict these who say that hypsipyle lay the child on this plant which therefore be alreedy know at that time we shall now proceed to the isthmian game . this solemnity be perform at night in the isthmus of corinth parting morea from the continent of greece and have rather the face of facrifice and its mysterythan of festival it be institute by sisyphas son of aolus on he finding thereon the ground the dead body of he kinsman melcerta .plutarch write that theseus after have kill the bull of minos and perform . other great exploit errect pillar in the lsthnius of peloponnesus where in imitation of hercule who consecrate the olympic game to jupiter he institutethe isthmian in honour of neptune . yet accord to pausanias and other these game be not set up for thatreason but in remembrance of melicerta92 dead body find there unburied touch which there go this story learchus and meliceria be the son of alhamas and ino athama make rage mad by tifiphone at juno92 command attempt to kill he wife instead of wild beast tear the young learch out of she arm beat out he brain against the stone ino affright hereat eitherthrough sorrow or the insluence of tisiphone92 poisone serpent betook herself with the other child melicerta to the mountain gerane situate between megara and corinth but she sinally also yeild to rage cast herself with the child from the rock molury into the sea where she be metamorphose into sea nymph and call leucotha and he into sea god under the name of palamon the dead body of melicerta be afterwards bring on shore by dolphin sisipha king of crinth who be bis uncle command he to be bury in the isthmus and circus to be there erect for the celebration of the aforesaid game . but the poet aachias say that on ino92 sling herself with meliceria into the sea dolphin land they body on the92 chaenuntian shore where amphimuchus and lonacinus take they up and brougnt they to sispphus king of corinth andthenthen they be deify she by the name of lezrothea which in greek signify the white goddess and he by that of palaemon .leucotha call by the latin matuta be daybreak and palamon or portunus the vehemence of storm and billow for pallein in greek signify to toss move and pusn violently against each other whence come the name of palamon he be the son of matuta or morning because the wind commonly begin to arise with daybreak . other tell we that melicerta92 dead body be cast on the shore of the isthmus and lie unburied it cause great plague and that on consult the oracle touch the cause of the infection answer be make that melicerta ought to haveb 0 magnificent funeral and solemn race and

laurel saturn as the god of triumph jupiter for he victory over the giant apollo for the love of daphne metamorphose into that tree though before the palm be sacred to he on he kill the delphic dragon but asculapius wear it for no other reason than that it be useful for several remedy . the ancient roman on they nona capretinae or festival keep monthly in honour of juno crowned that goddess with figleave as memorial of the city of rome reduce to the utmoss extremity by the gaul who demand of the senate several noble virgin as hostage regain its fre ebdom by the contrivance of the virgin philoris who shew the roman how to slide down from the wall by the branch of figtree grow thercon and sacred to juno give they a opportunity of fall on the enemy when drunk and asleep which sne have cunninglyintice they to and by great slaughter to obtain compleat victory over they .the pomegranate be consecrate to juno by the people of mycena the white lilly be alfo sacred to she and therefore call flo junonius or accord to some flo regalis not so much out of respect to the queen or goddess but because thatslower almost surpass all other in height .minerva who be say to be virgin rightfully lay claim to the olivetree whichaffect purity and chastity as well as she . find no tree particularly sacred to mar but it be notorious that the herb commonly call dog92 grass be appropriate to he . they who be conversant with poet know that the myrtletree signify delight and mind richly endow the ancient say that tree surpass all other in tender and beautiful leave and they continual greenness and smell which recommend it to venus the most beautiful most tender and most perfect of the goddess inold time man on festival day use to put into each other handbranch of this tree as token of joy

ofiris and dionysius which belikewise the name of bacchus have carry he victory into india build therensa nysa large town and plant it round with ivy to perpetuate he memory thisplant be facr to bacchus either because he as well as phaebus be always representyouthful or that the tongue and spirit of father liber be tie up as the ivy catch hold of any thing that it come at for though horace say ee that the drunkard be in he cup free from all care even the greatest poverty 9292 yet it be as true that the liquor captivate the sense take away all power of judge the same plant be likewife a emblem of age not only for it be grow mostlynear old tree building and ruin but also as wine which be old and work off be highly esteem wherefore pindarus as well as horace mostly extol it the vine be

for he daughter . he cypress be sacred to pluto god of hell and of the sprig and leave of it the ancient make garland it be reckone mournful tree and proper for place of burial because when once cut it fhoot no more its branch set in the groundnear tomb or carve on they signify that the decease endeavour by prayer to be reconcile to the infernal god wherefore horace say ee man be attendto hell by no other tree than the unhappy and hateful cypress pluto92 crown bealso compose of the herb adianthum otherwise call capilli veneris some havecrowned he with narcissus flower and they leave flower

information in this point he may consult the history of claudius saturninus wherein he will find the origin cause quality and every thing else relate thereto in such manner as to observe that there beno beautiful flower green branch leave root but what be peculiar to the head of some person or other . chap vii of the military dress and arm of several nation particularly of the greek and roman . he distinction of nation can not be well represent without due regard to they warlike accoutrement dress and manners . it be certain that many painter have be herein very deficient as appear by they work who on better consideration and greater experience have afterwards correct they error but mean not by exposing the mistake of other man to palliate my own havehave my fault as well and perhaps greater than they be sensible that even in my very best time be not free from some great blunder which to this daybe concerned for and which though might conceal nevertheless lay open inthe course of this work and since be speak of mistake shall here observe some as necessary to this chapter . testa in print of the drag of hector92 body represent achille though greek with roman headpiece which he posfibly do to keep the light togetherand to preserve the face he also exhibit both those heroes naked and achilles without arm the sword in he hand make he look more like gladiator than general and the scabbard by he side have no tie or girdle about he body how can he use the sword when with one hand he hold the rein of the horfe these thing be very improper and unnatural but perhaps he inducement be that he might shew the beautiful body of the hero with greater advantage inthe last place the town wall appear so low as to be easily reach over .poussin likewise in the print of the death of germanicus have intermix greek with roman helmet let it not be think that we be unjust to the merit opsuch great master by so nice a exame of they performance fince my purpofe herein be only by shew other mens fault to correct we own but be as willling to shew mine as they occur to my memory witness my anen receive the aris of venus where have also make roman helmet and my father in he representation of seneca introduce one of nero92 captain stand by he with greek headpiece now art allow not such liberty either in military furniture or any thing else each nation have its particular dress manners and custom . how ean we exhibit a agyptian prospect without shew some token of thatcountry as palmtree pyramid and people dress in the agyprian mode let I recommend care to every person and that they do not build too much on other mens work it be better to be nice than negligent let we understand thing never of well we may yet err through hafte or careleffness . think it presumptuous to enumerate all the particular of the military order of the ancient as be largely handle by several author we shall therefore accord to we small ability and for the service of curious artist only touchbrieffybriefly on some of the principal matter relate to they arm believe the residue will follow in the course of they practice shall begin with the greek . the greek foot be divide into two fort pikemen or heavyarmed andarcher or lightarm the pikemen use buckler fort of boot pike twenty or twentyfour foot in length and sword the stoutest have for defence macedonian round shield of four foot diameter the archer bear buckler of wicker bows short pike and fling they wear long hair and beard and helmet or headpiece somewhat project over the face handsomely wring with imagery or foliage set off with plume and other elegant ornament they militarydress always excel in variety and elegance they coat of armour reachdown to the knee cut out on the shoulder and below into strap which were often adorn with lionhead some instead of strap have twist fringe the general and nobility wear buskin of young lion or tigerskin or else neat fandal but the inferior sort have plain sandal with string they sword hang byby they leave side by sinall hook on the girdle and on they right side be dagger . in the roman military order the young man between seventeen and twentyfive year of age be appoint for velite or swift footmen or lightarmed the hastati for darter or pikemen such as be in they prime for principe and the aged for triarii. the velite wear small buckler of foot and half long a headpiece sword and lance three foot long and thumb thick armed with sharp triangular point steel or head of foot in length some carry sling other bowsthe hastati and principe wear fhort coat of armour that they might be the fitter for march and the management of all fort of arm they have long breech reach halfway the leg and close at the knee and helmet and large oval buckler two foot and a half in the transverse and four or five foot in the conjugate diameter they be girt with sword on both side that on the left much longer than the other which like dagger be but span long they other weaporbe two dart or wooden stave one thia like a arrow and three cubit long breadth of the hand with point iron head as long as the staff and let halfway into the wood and beset with hook this iron next the wood be finger and a half in thiknef . the triarii bear the same arm as the principe except that instead of the dart they use pike formerly carry by the hastati and from whence they take their name who leave they for the dart the richest arm themselves with commodious bodycoat instead of breastpiece the roman generally wear short hair with shave chin but the hair grow on each side of they cheek yet we must observe that scipio be the only person among they who have long hair the roman helmet clof with the forehead be make either of double leather iron or brass and crest on top like the greek but less sumptuous except those of the general and other commander which be plume some also have wing helmet and on the crest snake or dragon or a eagle92 head .we we find likewise that the ancient roman in they march carry see basket spade a be bridle fickle and provision for three day the herculani of the old troops and the joviniani or accord to vegetius joviani be two select roman legion consist of six thousand man each andserve in selavonia to whom the emperor diocletianus who cause himself to be stile jupiter and maximinianus hercule after they have gain he the imperial dignity give that name in preference to all other legion for they valour these besides they large sword and oblong shield have dart the inside whereof were run with lead and call manorbarbuli which for they heaviness forward sword they so gall the enemy and they horse as to gain the emperor several great battle . the roman horse wear a helmet and breastpiece like the foot have crossshield by the horse92 side long sword on they right side javelin intheir hand and in they quiver three or more arrow broadirone yet sharp point andnot inferior to the javelin the ensign both of foot and horse wear lion sxinover they military dress and the trumpet the same save that the two forepaw of the skin be by these latter tie under they chin serve they also for cloak these skin be not merely flea with the hair on but also sitted for service and underneath either fring or elegantly cut out . the numidian and cretian under roman command and aid they on horseback as need require be armed with bows and arrow and also with sling wherewith they dexterously flung stone pliny write that even the scorpio machine of war with which anciently they use to throw large stone and timber be the invention of th e9 crerian . the ligurian who for long time valiantly keep the roman at bay be welldisciplined soldy armed with breastpiece a helmet fhield and in close dress they be also very expert in throw the javelin.the scythian barbarous people and horsem wear crest helmet pointon top they carry bows dagger and battleaxe .the scythian woman call amazon oftentime appear in combat as vincentius say in antique silver helmet and breastpiece because they countryabound with that metal but accord to the ancient memoir they militarydress be only adorn with serpent skin wring in silver they have the leave breast bare but the right which be scare that they might with greater ease use the bow and cast the dart cover like the rest of they body their garment button below reach not quite to they knee they defence be target or large round shy cut holow at one of the extremity into the form of twoconjoin crescent have part in the middle for cover and guard the arm and hand one of these cut serve for manage the lance and the other to look through they likewise carry axe and hammer . the goth together with the great attila descend from the scythian were armed with bows arrow long and strong spear or lance shield and helmet . the horsem full armoured and carry strong lance hammer and club would leap on they horse without the help of the stirrup or other advantage especiallypecially on smooth ice or on snowy ground where they generally fight their greatest battle sometimes as need require and in the heat of battle theywould in full gallop throw themselves on another horse turn and windwith incredible swiftness even catch up lance from the ground an evidence what great warrior these peopleformerly be . the persian and spartan be very much alike in dress except in they head ornament the former wear turban and the latter cap like nightcap yet point on top and curl forward or else iron headpiece like the roman but plain and without crest they have long hair and they beard almost hid theirear on the other hand the persian shave both head and face their vestment girt about the middle reach below the knee they wear also long open breech and wide stocking and shoe they use scale arm round shield greave or shin armour scimitar hang on the right thigh crof the bodyaud the dagger on the same side but at the girdle at they back be the quiver . darius the last king of persia be commonly array in rich purple mantle intermix with white stripe fasten on each shoulder with precious stone andbefore with gold chain or hook he coat of armour wring with gold was embroider on the breast with three golden eagle have spread wing andtail and bill turn towards each other and between the wing and tail were see the follow letter nikhtikstaton signify always conqueror at he golden girdle girt loosely and womanisn hang scimitar the scabbard whereof be beset with precious stone . the dacian wear gown hang down to the heel and open on the side andover they coat of mail which reach to the middle they helmet sit close about the head and run up to apoint they arm be bows and arrow dagger and javelin and they horse wholly guard except the eye with scalecovering . the parthian mede and assprian be guard like the persian save that the parthian wear long coat of mail cover both man and horse and the assprians brass headpiece . the phrygian and armedian use helmet short spear javelin and dagger wear wide stocking and shoe like the persian . the carthaginian be as elegant and magnificent in arm as the persiun . the macedonian and they neighbour differ little in they dress and arm fromthe greek and the roman and trojan the same . the lacedemonian first begin to carry shield sword and be . the people of caria be the first who serve for pay carry shield bore armour and have plume or feather on they helmet . the thracian wear headpiece of fox skin coat of armour partycoloureddress and stocking of skin they weapon be dart round shield and dagger . the athiopean horse wer guard with a helmet coat of armour reachhalf way the thigh powder with iron eye and proof against cut and push . they arm be round shield lance scimitar and club plate with iron . those who have no helmet wear long and hairy or woolly red cap like the manmaluke in agypt the foot to strike terror in they enemy wear fkin of lion tiger leopard and other wild beast anil have for weapon large bows pike arrow and sling the emperor himself wear costly silver diadem about his head and carry in he hand silver crucifix he be dress in gold stuff full pleated over silk shirt with large ducal sleeve and from he middle hang loose garment of silk and gold stuff he body guard cover they headand shoulder with beast skin carry sword dagger and javelin.the indian be cloath in wood and have bows of reed

darter . the inhabitant of marchia anconitana anciently stile by the roman ager picenus or country of woodpecker be likewise good soldier and bore shield pike a helmet and sword . thus think to have make some provision for further enquiry that artistmay not be at loss he who want more information can read virgil ammianas marcellinus vegetius polvbius and herodotus hallicarnassus which last in the life of xerx lay down all the particular relate to each people and all sort of barbarian vitrueius also have write treatise of the roman military exercife . homer in he lliad speak offight wherein some have gold braf and steel bemour say ee he pussie he in the belly but pierce not he armour be and inanother passage ee he deal he such blowon he steelbreast as to make it strike sire and resound now ifit be afk what sort of armour this must have be of massy gold and other metal and whether it could be possible for any person to move bend and turn in such armour as shew the muscle and limb sat close to the body answer they could not and that the notion of they havebe thus be wrong think those be also out of the way who suppose they be so represent for the sake of decorum and that this be reason enough without consider whether it be posfible or not since other reason may be assign whichcan give better satisfaction without force nature for my part believe thatthe arm and they use be anciently as now and the coat of armour be like we buff coat make of leather they may possibly have be so contrive as to shew shew the muscling but grant it they must be much sitter for use than if of steel or solid gold wherefore can not but think they be make of leather and of all sort of colour wring or embroider with silver or gold even cover over with gold like we gill leather and set off with scale foilage andother such ornament remember to have read in my youth in certain ancient latin treatise yet extant dedicated to the emperor theodosius and valentinian and entitle eethe great number of the roman force 92 92 that the roman bemour breastpiece or military coat as there call be line with wool and cover with the skin of wolf lion and other wild beast of libva nevertheless to support the opinion of the poet add that they have gold brass andsteel breast and bellypiece fasten with small hook and buckle on the shoulderand side to ward off blow but they be plain without muscling and not put onbut in time of preparation for battle wherefore they be much to blame who introduce such accoutrement on every occasion as for instance scipio in he tent with the young bride and sit in full armour or alexander with roxana rinaldo court armida and other such occurrence . chap viii of the origin of the several ensign and shield andthey device for distinction of nation and particular person . ttbe in painting absolutely necessary first to distinguish the nation andnext the personage among they of high and lesser degree by token either devise by themselves or appropriate by other think proper to handle this point largely in order to shew the greatness of the roman power and the manyforeign troops entertained in they service say both painter and statuary especially the latter ought to be acquainted with these thing that in representeither particular nation or hero they may on they shield exhibit the proper badge of dictinction whereby to be presently know by person conversant in atiquity this knowledge be as necessary for history painter since history bequently make mention of congref of several nation and they heroes in one place without describe they arm and banner point which cost Imuch trouble to gain but prove of greater advantage in the use made thereof and which introduce here as have some relation to the preceding chapter . on consulting history find the ancient instead of banner make use of bundle of arrow or bough and green tie together which they call manipulus or a handful and the ensign bearer manipularii titus livius the nice roman historian and antiquary tell we that romulus have by accident appease tumult with few people from that time represent it in the ensign andarm by wisp of hay cause this take as a happy one to be bear before he in the ensue war the roman afterwards paint on they ensignandanc standard simall red flame in take of suecess az in the battle with the sabine near eretum where the arm of the former appear by night as if on fire without be damage thus the standard and ensign of the legion by the sight whereof the soldier know the will of they general be from . time to timeaugment they have also at different time diver other token as open righthand the image of they emperor insilver or gold or gill and sometimes therehang under they small pendant have the general or people motto qr they likewise bear in they banner the representation of wolf minotaur wild boar horse bull and dragon till at last they fixed on the eagle for the chief field standard the roman use the wolf minotaur wild boar horse bull and dragon for the follow reason the wolf partlyas he be sacred to mar the god of war and partly because he penetratron beso gre e2t that he can see as well by night as by day whereby they mean that prudent general ought always to be on he guard so as not to be surprise bythe stratagem of the enemy by the minotaur say vegetius they signify thatas this beast keep himself in the most hidden part of the labyrinth so the designs of general ought to be keep secret the wild boar because no peace or cessation of arm be make without it vide we gth book page treating of the offering the horse as be of great account among the roman and the proper sign of war th e9 bull because the ancient roman pretend that the word italia be derive from stala which nowday signify calf or bull the dragon they commonly paint on the baniier of the foot and each century haveone whence the bearer of it aceord to vegetias be call dragonarius am ac mianus mercellinus tell we the manner of carry it ee they tie say he to the top of they gill pike which be gold fring and beset withpeapland precious ftone dragon make of wave stuff and hollow within which on be advanced in the air open they frightful mouth and make grumblenoise as if full of wrath and fury bend and move they tailwith the wind . of which claudianus speak ee et cessante vento multi taucere dracone the dragon be all sileat when the wind abate this enfign accord to ammi ac anus aforesaid be of reddishi purple the eagle surpaff all other bird in courage and boldness be not improperly call the roman eagle for to what corner of the know world have he not extend the roman dominionwhat resisting nation have not feel the effect of they deliberation and the valour wherewiththey put they in execution and yet know from history that the eagle be inuse long before among the persian for crus the founder of that monarchy bore accord toxenophon golden eagle withspread wing on long pike as if he would sly over the universe which custom he sucessor retain as royal take by consent of the soothsayer all nation anciently ascribeto this bird the honour of belie ving he prognosticate good luck and happy success in any undertakings inwhich sense justinus tell we that hiero when young who be of mean birth on his mother92 side make he first campaign a eagle fly down and sit on he shield which be judge as presage of he become in time a excellent general92 and king as afterwards come to pass the poet even say thatthis bird imply prosperityassignassign to any person by divine providence this opinioh bwe its rise to the relation of anacreon the first writer of antiquity that jupiter intend to destroy the giant who threaten t e9 storm heaven the power of which he offerto be by the aecidental flight of a eagle asfure of a happy and fuccefsful victory which afterwards obtain he always bear golden eagle in he arm andbanner ase0 perpetual memorial thereef from jupiter the getian asfume thatbird and from they the candiot anea the trojan introduce he among the latinesand from they the roman in process of time cam e9 to use he for they arm though lipsius be of opinion they assume he after the example of the perfian the juscans beaten by the roman in they last conflict near the city of eretum on the border of the sabine present tarquinius prisca king of the roman their king92 regalia to wit gold crown purple garment and mantie of various colour also a ivory chair and a ivory sceptre with a eagle on top which he and he fuccessor always bear after the banishment of the king the senate take the eagle from they sceptre and set they on they pike exalt heabove all they other arm whether the wolf minotaur horse wild boar . marius when child happen to find a eagle92 nest with seven young presage of he two consulat often place the say number in he arm and in his second consulat asfign the eagle to the roman legion use he only in battles in order to spirit the soldier and asfure they of victory the other militarytoken be set on the tent but marius take they down and from that timeno legion be without two eagle but josephus in he fourth book giveeach legion one eagle and by the number of eagle they count they legion as

attend by foar child represent the four season each dress in garment or drapery of the coulour peculiar to he and dancing with flower andfruit which they present to she . chap of flower in general . x xxthe spring be the most delightful seafon of the year it be no wonder that flower have particular charm above other object and this not only in nature but also in painting whichthough ever so indifferent lover often prefer before fine piece of hiftory or landscape . it be remarkable that amidst the various choice in the art of painting none bemore feminine or proper for woman than this and the reason be plain itis also to be note that of those choice one be asperfect as the other with respect to art be it ever so singular and though this choice be but small part of the whole yetyet it be attend with as many excellency for as bunch of grape carry its perfection so the least grain do the fame but though both the part as well as the whole fall under the fame rule and one master understand he branch as well as the ocher yet he who have from he youth apply himself to this or that single choice let have progref therein be what it will can perform nothing else that be good we havemany instance of excellent mafter who depart from the general to particular choice with applause but of none who have do the contrary without discredit reckon discredit as bad a exchange as copper for gold or water for wine of the former fort be innumerable italian and french as well as looo duich master but of the latter few among whom vereist alone claim the laurel to the wonder of those who know he when he paint flower for if ever painter excel in that branch he be the person neither mario do fiori father seger or de heem come up to such pitch and yet through bad exchange he at last fall from a agreeable springson first in confirmation of my asfertion that he who can perform the most difficult thing may easily even without trouble attain those of less consideration butnot the contrary without disadvantage and discredit secondly because my design be to treat of flower as a effectual admonition to those who would bestow they time with advantage on that single choice .flower painting be certainly commendable study but as there be double and single slower so there be two fort of flower painter the one singular and simpleand the other rich and ingenious of which latter sort we have but few andof the former abundance three thing be especially necessary in good flowerpiece first choice and beautiful flower secondly good disposition and harmony and lastly neat and soft penciling first the flower must not be poor or lie or stand they always keep they proper quality and shape thatthe round seem not by too extravagant spread to be triangular square or oblong whereby to mistake one flower for another that the most noble and beautiful have the predominancy and that by they place they produce a agreeable mixture of coulour delighting and satisfy the eye consist in so order the strong and stripe with the faint one as to exhibit lovely rainbow lastly that each flower be well express accord to its nature andquality as one thin another thick this soft and limber that set and stiff one shine another dull and glossless . we be in the next place to suppose that it be impossible to be masterwithout firm and exact draught and thorough acquaintance with perspective together with good knowledge of the colour and they body and which willstand best and lastly due enquiry into the nature of slower that they may be handle accordingly . he who would follow this study in good earnest ought to be master of flower garden which he should carefully cultivate that he may in the season be furnish with sine and choice flower for though modelling be great affistance in winter practice when 92 the life be not to be have yet no perfection athe who be afirm and nimble draughtsman and good tainable without the life . manager of water colour have double advantage and may in time get treafure of beautiful model flower bear good price and great esteem among the curious after the flower the green leaf of they be of great importance through its various quality and difference in texture and colour cause flower piece to look natural and more decorous .chap ii of painting flower in hall apartment gallery but principally on cieling for ornament . be the business of good flower painter principally to aim at what be praiseworthy what great thing what glorious occasion be there for master92famel but this lie not always in the representation of garland of slower pot glafbottle butterfly fly beetle cobweb or drop of water any more than in neat penciling and bright colour with which we think to set the world in gaze such trifle be too low and the repetition too irksome for the taste of noble foul what opportunity do not daily happen in palace garden gallery and apartment for shew we skill and ingenuity suppose to yourself lofty room build with white marble and set out with fine pictureand bassrelief for the common recreation of young gentleman and lady this room may be embellish above and on each side of the nich with fine and large festoon of flower between the pilaster and over the bassreliefmuch green yet somewhat lef in case any landscape be there and on the white marble may be all sort of beautiful coloured flower on red marble contrarily white and yellow one accord to the rule of art and in large part now light then again dark leaf as the matter and ground require . but of the several grounds and colour of flower suitable to they we shall hereafter treat particularly on the ciel there may be thin branch of airy foilage also intermix with slower here festoonway there in group sastenwith ribbon or ring and have in some place loose sprig and leave projecting from the ground and return they proper shade thereon which though the life be not to be have may by some such make thing be perform thatthey may seem more naturaly to hang off such flower and leave ought to be strongly and boldly handle but yet so as to seem fasten to the work wellconsider the colour and lightnef or darkness of the ground and chuse for it flower of such colour that some may look as if stick to it and othercome off now if many festoon be to hang in such place or room theymust need have like length breadth and fullness and be place equallyhigh or low what difference be it to we whether the proprietor desire to haveslower or fruit or mixture of botht for the festoon may be fill with peach peach apricot mulberry plumb hang on they twig over the representation of bacchanal some bunch of white and blue grape intermixed with pineapple look become on the alcove may hang loosely over it papaver of all sort of colour intersperse with poppy tie here and therewith ribbon as most proper for that place . why should not such sort of ornament be agreeable when naturally dopose and paint especially if well light and the ground shade duly expresed on the ground the company beforemention may possibly raise mirthenough among themselves but so pleasant sight must need be great addition to it let we therefore take hold of every opportunity that offer andin the mean time exercise we talent in the attainment of great handling let we exchange we small cloath for whole wall we pot and bottle for vase and mudling for beautiful manner let we enquire what flower be painterlike and which the principal conjoin they sense application and colour together with they proper grounds . chap iii that flowerpainter should understand perspective also the mistake of represent thing improperly . the have already asfert that good flower painter must need understand perspective and yet which be to be lament few know anything of it possibly supposing they have no occasion for it and that thereforethis branch be so much easier than history or any thing else which can not subsist without perspective as indisputably require more by work viz architecture landscape or other object cause ground shade which never hrppen inthey work 92 and should they at any time be nonplus92 they can get help from thosewho be acquainted with perspective if therefore they have but point of sight they think that sufficient and yet not for the sake of the flower but solely for the corner of marble table or slab whereon they set flower glass as if the lighting or shad of the flower be matter of indifference this fromside thatfront one from below another from above whence they piece have usuallymany point of sight sometimes as many as there be flower but it can not be otherwise since they often paint after model place slower on the left side which stand before on the right and the contrary or else below or above whichthey imagine nobody will discover because they can not see it themselves . another ridiculous custom of some flower painter in my opinion be that in painting any glossy body such as flower glass gold silver or copper vase after the life they fail not to shew therein the pane of the window and afterward to hang the picture in hall and gallery which have none here let I take notice of a extraordinary nice and finish piece of that nature painted by certain know n gentlewoman wherein not only some stalk of the slowers er appear naturally through the glaf but afso she own picture in she posture of painting with such a air as evidently shew it be she who sit in it nor do she forget to represent also the window and pane sky and cloud we neednot question whether she endeavour by the depth of she penetration to surpass she master in that piece of work this case bekin to that of certain young artist who painting look glass front bring into it all that appear behind he people could not be persuade it be lookglaf though paint dark and dull and it have frame about it and he protestation thatevery thing be take from the life stand he in little stead wherefore to salve the matter as he think he paint himself in the lookglass sit at his easel and to make it more perfect underwrit ee this be look glass andthat beI . ch ap iv of flower on all sort of grounds . hat white be set off by black and the contrary need no demonstration and on the other hand white on white and black on black cause stick together of which particular notice ought to be take that slowermay have they due force and effect so order they that some seem to stick to the ground and other to come off from it the most proper grounds for flower be these . the colour of blue tombstonedarkolive or green serpentine . lightgrey freestone . white marble but of second tint . this observation would rather spoil good ordonnance than have the desireeffect if we do not maturely weigh what use we would put thefe grounds to as also where the flower most properly ought to have the greatest strength andwhere the greatest weakness in order that the principal mean the fix stone and wood work may not thereby be overpower say strengh with respect to force and beauty but mean not by weakness that the colour light or shade should be weaken or sully however shall in the sequel explain what mean by that word . any colour suit on white but the darkest most beautifully warm colours be preferable to the broken one and the most weak ought to be on the extremity but sew white one and those with caution what now say concerns the disposition which shall more plainly handle in treat of festoon and groap of flower . the black grounds though quite different from the precede with respect to great force can give little reffexion and therefore do not admit of light or weak slower but neverthelefs fall under the same rule and observation as flower on white ground because the green by they union have relation to the ground and colour . red and yellow suit not but with dark grounds . all flower and green look well on grey ground . all weak flower as violet light purple blue appleblossom and white agree with warm ground .flower have particular decorum on gold or silver ground and still greater on copper or bronze by reason of they darkish lustre since the colour of gold be too strong and that of silver too pale . chap of the disposition of flower and they colour in festoon and group .yyave hitherto treat of flower in general we shall now prooed to they disposition in group and festoon . shall compose each group of particular emblematic colour asyellow red purple violet blue and white which consider as follow . the first group yellow have for its principal flower turnsol african or marigold anemone which stile upper power or eternity . the second red as peony papaver rose signify power or might the third purple flower role papaver tulip imply nobility . the fourth violet as fritillaria or fritillary signify inconstancy . the fifth blue as iris convolvolus or bindweed imply constancy . the sixth white as the lilly or white rose signify purity . it must be observe that though in these group the capital flower be of particular colour yet they will admit of other small one about they of variwe eolour suit therewith as with the yellow purple violet and blue . red lightyellow appleblossom dark blue and whitepurple white yellow and light blue . violet fosecolour orange light red and afhblue . blue purple orange light yellow and white . two capital colour as deep yellow vermilion or blue must never be placeor upon one another . by white suit any where except on deep yellow or deep red . dark green agree with all light flower and pale green with dark flower . under these group there should always be either motto or verse . as for festoon they may be handle in the same manner yet with less confinement if the emblematic colour have but the middle place that be sufficient the other part may be fill up with such colour as we please provide theyhave somewhat less brightness than the principal for instance let the middie die flower be large and high coloured as african or marigold yellow andred on the right side may be purple as rofest anemones and on the leave blue as iris flo principius hyacinth the purple side mix with little white andless yellow the blue side with yellow and red and the yellow in the middle with violet dark blue little purple and white . in second festoon white may possess the middle place as white rose lillyand other on the right side may be yellow and on the left pale red the yellow may be diversify with purple violet and dark blue the red with pale yellow white violet and dark blue and the white in the middle with rose colour violet purple and beauriful red . in the middle of athird festoon may be red as papaver anemones on the right side stripe flower of purple and yellow violet and pale yellow diversisy with dark blue and beautiful red but on the other side all plain flower . the white may be intermix with slower of any colour except light yellow .the intermixture consist of small flower but the single coloured whether inthe middle or largest as also those on the side require they particular small diversify flower the single coloured with speckle or stripe and thecontrary . if either group or festoon full or close flower should always be place in the most relieved part the open one be mostly set on the side in order to create shade for instance let the middle part of festoon have the largest finest andfullest slower such as red and white rose papaver between the middleand the extremity lesser sort as tulip anemones narcissuse or daffodil gilliflower malva rosea further towards the extremity the more long and smaller one as astragalus ranunculus or crowfoot convolvolus flos principis borage barbatum nigri violet . on the relief of the festoon between the largest and middle fort may be mixture of the smallest flower if the middle flower be yellow those further offought to be purple or red and such as be towards the corner white and blue the longer the weaker that the strongest colour may keep the middle but ifwhite have the middle place the other part must not eclipse it with yellow andred.complete festoon must have a orderly disposition not only with respect to the flower themselves whether large or small but also in the place of doubleand single one as first white rose and centifoliae next single rose and lastlywild blossom . as for the colour there be single and half coloured flower the single colour be peony rofe and the other stripe or speckle with two or more colour as anemones with white and red stripe rose tulip whichought to be so regularly order as to raise in the eye balancing mixture andto unite the strong and weak that the one do not project too much and the other too little and that at distance and at one view the festoon may have it be due sway yet if here or there it be either too weak or too strong you must recollectwherefore observe that yellow and red be strong lect how it may be thelp .colour and contrarily blue and violet weak if too much yellow and red come together place somewhat blue or violet between and if too much blue or violet some yellow or red . to begin festoon well you ought first to mark out it be course as you will haveit either thick or thin next lay on the green with such leaf as you think proper but somewhat large and with due light and shade accord to its light be dry lay in the flower flat first the principal each in its place with single colour red blue or yellow of such atint as will best admit of paintingupon it the light and shade after the life 92 or model the flower between withthey leaf be put in over the green on finish the grounds whether plain or in bass relief or other ornament ought to be neatly finish with the first green to save you the trouble afterwards of par away something here and there . chap vi continuntion of the ordering and place the flower .. rywill observation ef consequence in festoon group or garland still r e9main to wit the order the flower and they place of hanging . jt be easy to conceive that many small thing come together produce at distance only confused maf and little affect the sense as have nothing inthey to make any impression or be worth remark and though each flower haveit be particular name shape and colour yet they be only consider in general under the name of flower because of they be place either too high or too distant such festoon or group look well on paper and in hand or on teatable toilet and the like either in painting or needlework on the other hand large flower may be see distinctly at distance in they quality shape and beauty . then each flower get name this be rise that papaver in word festoon group or garland place high or to be view at some distance ought to be dispose in great maff and separate with few speckle or stripeflower either large or small as have no effectbut when see near wherefore it be necessary to take in they stead other of single colour in order to set off the work with more force and distinction and to give the eye satisfaction . for this reason when92 see in hand they ought to unite and out of hand to look more seperate and distinct but shall explain this by some example chuse two group one agreeably uniting so as to be view near and the other the contrary . in the middle of the former be white rose and behind it centifolia behindwhich be purple and behind that peony now these four colour differ but half tint from each other compose together a half ball gradually round . the latter contrarily though have also white flower in the middle have be ac hind it purple one and behind that dark violet colour darker than that of the peony and these will create greater force than the former as startmore suddenly from each other and differ whole tint as the other do but a halfone whence it be evident that the more distinct the tint be the more lively and strong they will appear .for further satisfaction ishall subjoin five other example of festoon as full again as those in the precede chapter since they sometimes happen to be of different size and therefore require more flower divide they thus .th be 9 first . in the middle yellow next white then purple or violet and lastly yellow . the other side the same . the second . in the middle white next yellow further blue and the last yellowisn white . the other side the same . the third . in the middle red next blue then yellow and lastly violet the other side the fame . the fourth . then blue and lastly light red . in the middle purple next pale other side the same . the fisth . in the middle violet next orange and other yellow then blue red and violet . the same on the other side . the three last ought to be intermix with white and the two first with varietyof colour as it best suit in order tounite the part with each other . three sort of flower be proper for intermixture vizi yellow red and blue all in they greatest beauty . if the work consist mostly of red and yellow itought to be intermix with blue and if of blue you must take yellow but if of all three you be to use white so distribute it as to refresh the eye now for proof of all that have be ebn faid shall shew here two method of great use to flower painter though they may seem trifling . painting all sort of flower on card or pasteboard as rude as you please evenbut single spot for each and five or six of each colour or as many as there are tint tint red blue purple yellow violet let these be capital flower . make smaller one for intermixture of red blue yellow and white as beautiful as possible cut all these afunder and lay each colour orderly by itself in little box then paint up green festoon or group on pasteboard and thereon placesuch flower as you please shift and change they accord to you design . and thus you will perceive the truth of what have be before speak . the other method be this takebe 0 parcel of slower of all sort make of paperor filk and with wire stalk as they be sell by the tirewoman now if youwould make group festoon or basket of flower or any such thing order andshift those flower by and upon one another as .they suit best and thus you may exercise yourself in winter time when you can not have the life because thoseflower never wither green festoon may also be furnish after the same manner and flower hang on they accord to you desire . of engrave . since neither caesar ripa nor any other author give we the figure of the art of engrave with its signification shall here make it preliminary and in the sequel shew what respect bedue to this art by its reflexionand even relate property with that of painting . chap . he beautiful virgin sitting at table have before she copperplate lie on sandbag and near it stand little monkey place light lamp before

vander meulen andseveral other ltalian and french as well as duich and german master in the offscape europe asia and africa appear stand in surprise at the sound of the trumpet . chap ii of the art of engrave in general . that may treat of this art in methodical manner think proper to observe flrst wherein its excellence consist secondly its performance and lastly the qualification of a etcher and engraver . the art of engrave be questionless noble and praiseworthy because it bespect painting as painting do nature for as the latter have nature for its model or object which it faithfully imitate with the pencil so engrave likewise copy painting either with the needle or graver in such manner as only to stand in need of colourwhich when require may be add to it painting consist in neat and good outline proportion light and snade and these be alsothe foundation of engrave painting distinguisnes between common light andsunshine engrave do or can do the sanie in fine whatever the one perform with the pencil the other can express with the needle or graver and as neatly whether sluff of all kind wool silk sattin line glass water gold wood stone . its performance be to the sight what fame be to the ear painting have but one original but engrave hundred fame can tell the many wonder of painting in its absence but engrave make itself every where present sly overthe universe as well as the sounding trumpet of fame it keep a eternal register of every thing that be praiseworthy and as the intire welfare even happiness or unhappiness of good painter depend on the certainty or uncertainty of the engraver as ishall shewin my remark on print after painting or designso the latter ought to disengage himself from prejudice and inclination to this or that particular manner and exert he sxill in a exact imitation of what he be to engrave or etch after any manner or any master be it flat or rise dark or light without addition or diminution except with the licence of the painter or designer . he work must be like clear lookglass which exhibit all object true andwithout falsity as to the manual operation fine handling be great step to grace and in order to it the knowledge of three thing be absolutely necessary to wit the art of draw perspective and the doctrine of light and shade these as principal compose the theory of the whole work he ought also to be very diligent in hatch with the pen or red chalk in order thereby to get firm handling and it behove he as well as the painter to draw after the naked lifeand dress lay he should likewise be furnish with print both engraveand etch of the most famous master . ch ap iii of the general elegance requisite in good print and of the difference between book and other print . grace of welletch or engrave print confist first in bright light . dark shade by which understand that the faint hatch on the light part be keep almost imperceptible and the shady touch contrarilystrong and dark secondly that the naked or carnation be hatch fine andsomewhat dull and the drapery courser and rougher accordingto they quality yet all without any outline either on the light or shade side even so that the extremity be only form by the tint of the grounds against which they come . but to give the work the greatest perfection and shew the judgment of the master the tint of the colour should also appear as much as possible yet as print do not so intirely consist of fine ordonnance beautiful figure elegant by work and neat cut or etch stroke as in good general harmony so this harmony ought to be principally study . the engraver will be commendable sometimes to express in he work the co ac lour if the matter require it such as the white and black in the day and night good and bad angel or spirit these two observation be absolutely necesary in bookprint the other beforemention be only requisite in such as represent complete picture for there be great difference between book andother print the former express the matter which be represent even be it design in white marble baf relief nay in snow or sand and the latter consider only the master who paint it and he art together with that of the engraverand he capacity for this reason bookprint stand in need of explanation but other print not for the colour be in the one what the writing be in the other . chap of the difference of engrave and etch . accord to the general opinion and not without reason etching be account more loose and designerlike than engrave becausethere be no difference between etch and draw as to the handling but the difference between draw and engrave be very great the management of the needle be the same with that of chalk or the pen the plate lie flat and firm like the paper to draw upon but wefind the contraryin engrave wherein the graver be hold almost parallel with the plate and the latter be moveable on qushion or sandbag and as to force there be also less occasion forit in etch than engrave . now to prove that etch must need be more designerlike than engrave let we only make we remark on both in the course of they bufinef each havedesign before he and then we shall find the reason to be that in the one boththe draw and plate be fix before the artist and he only move he hand whereas the other can not go forward without stir the plate be continuallyturn and both the hand and arm employ in direct the graver by whichmean engraver be often hinder from perceive the difference between their work and the pattern before part nay the whole be finish wherefore inmy opinion etch be superior to engrave in exactnef and speed say speed because three or more plate may be etch before one can be engrave etchbe also most designerlike because of its near affinity with draw as we dailyexperiment for where one painter or designer engrave for he pleasure a hundred take to etch and make good progref therein because of the slow advance in engrave compare to etch whether in figure or building but especially landscape and since painter or designer care not to have they design censure and correct by other they chule rather to etch they themselvesthan to set about engrave a art not to be master without much expence of time in get knowledge how to handle the tool whereby it would become rather labour than diversion .many engraver etch for pleasure because of its easiness but seldom any etcher handle the graver unless in case of necessity tothis perhapsit may be object that as each painter or designer have particular choice wherein he labour most as one in the ordonnance another in nicety of draught and third in the neat finish of some particular thing therefore the title of designerlike in etch be not absolutely due to painter or designer to which answer that undoubtedly the word must not be understnod to relate to modern designer because itbe in use before etch be brougt to its present perfection as appear by caracci titian antonio tempesta who excel in design anduse the needle with noother view than to give the world the design which they count capital and most praiseworthy for the encouragement and consideration of the less know . know whereby we plainly perceive that they intention be only to put forth they own performance in such manner as safely to be rely on accordingly we scarce see any more in they than a outline but this be so firm and correct that however slightly the other part may be scratch these work thus of they own hand be more value than those of the best and most famous engraver or etcher . we have example in the print of the woman by the well etch by caraea bimself how much it differ from that do by le potre and another by bissop . what vast difference be there between perrier 92 and bissiop92 work as to the designerlikeness and looseness ofhandling and in landscape between titian 92 and perelle92 could if need require produce more proof of the atiquity of the word designerlike but shall wave they and acquaint the reader how oddly take to etch and how strangely drudge before couldgain my point . have in mny youth a inclination for etch but no knowledge of what be good or bad as see no other example than the old and poorly en grave print of raphael michael angelo paul veronese tintoret which yet be excellent for they fine outline and few etch one my slender attempt may be easily guess at indeed can not but still think of itwith wonder for begin not with copper or steel but piece of pewter and nail about finger92 length which with great pain ground to point after my own way first try only singie stroke and then crosshatch which look strange enough and instead of rollpress rub the backside of my proof with the nail .. this however do not abate my curiosity which daily encrease though my work appear so black as to be scarce intelligible my father see this could not forbear laugh and for humour sake give two or three of my proof to bartholet and he again to natalis the famous engraver who bestow on I some little instruction and small copperplate to try on but what drudgeryhave undergone before scratch this beautiful plate bosse92 book of etching happen to be publisn about that time leave off plague myself and cheerfully set about split of wood provide needle boiling grounds cleaning plate buy aquafortis wax when before know of no better ground than thick and foul oil out of the smushipot boil to blackneis which give I no little trouble to get off the plate again after itbe bit and which therefore be oblige to put into the fire till it was soft as lead thing so far succed to my wishi happen to see some print of vovet from france which spur my curiosity and should certainly have make early and good progress have not my father leen fearful might six my thought on this study to the neglect of painting whereforehe dissuade I from it say it be too soon to enter on so difficult pastime and instruct I in other thing as delightful as advantageous .marrying some year after go to holland be reasumed this noble art with great pleasure and which do not repent of though some think it the cause of my misfortune the truth of this god know yet have savefave candle and ufe more daylight for it perhaps my old age mighthave prove more comfortable to I but alasl those two noble sister painting and etch be now vanish with my sight . let the reader judge whether he ever hear of stranger way of etchhowever mention it here to shew that diligent man geting.better instruction may in time gain he point it be certain that few young man would have have patience enough to drudge as do without instruction but that a industrious tyro after leave he master may possibiy improve through diligence and study be very natural even so as to excel he in neatness smoothnef and expedition as well in etch as engrave mean in the use of the graver and needle but not in knowledge by knowledge understand keep the likeness of beautiful face hand and foot according to what we say in the second chapter that the knowledge consist in correct outline proportion light and shade and perspective for we commonly see the greatest fault commit in the aforesaid part for want of knowledge and not inure themselve to draw by hand large thing after small andthe contrary but accustoming themselves to squar practice not difficult to swineherd 92 boy if he understand the division of square and management of chalk but they may yet be eroneous in trace they object on the plate though draw upon square for miss the outline in the least either inwardly or outwardly it presently become too little or too big but the tyro can not see this for want of due knowledge and though he may be sensible that hereor there he have little miss the outline yet he pass it over as matter of no great moment and if he propose to help it in etch or engrave he may possibly forget it before he come so far in the work he commonly thinkno further than what be already on the plate whence we may easily conclude that he who know what constitute beauty can be as little sensible that smalldifference in face arm or hand be of any great consequence another difficulty no less than the former be that though the tyro have the outline correctly draw on the plate yet he may run over it when he come to shade or hatch and as this fr e9quently happen shall here give the reason of it . in either engrave or etch anything the offwork whcther building landscape or even grounds ought always to be begin first that by reservethe principal thing for the last the hand may be prepare to handle theywith more boldness now the tyro be to engrave or etch ground behind he figure be it naked or dress he will not only especially in engrave end he hatch against the outline but sometimes exceed it whereby the part whetiier arm leg or hand must need loose they truc proportion andquality gatthus the almost imperceptible and tender rise muscle fold the work go on and when they come to sce the mistake they scrape burnisn and rub to bring it right again which grant be well enough in case of need but alas hoy seldom be it practise ff it be something of no great consequence it remain as it be without further inspection this know not by hearsay but experience wherefore they who have a inclination for en grave should apply to painter for instruction in beautiful proportion andin draw every thing by hand whether print drawing painting plaisterfigure even the life itself for painter first teach the theory or knowledge of proportion and then the practice of colour whereas many engraver begin with the practice or handling as for the scrape burnish and rub out beforemention it be point which ought to be well understand because it affect not either the too great darkness or hardness of the hatch but the outline as shall shew by the example of the face in plate lxix . in the face the hatch ground run over the outline of the cheek whereby it appear more sunk in as in that of and thus the outline be lose nowthis face be to be finish and the cheek bring right again so much must be scrape off within the line as to give the chcek the former swell and if the face be fourth part less the difference will be so much the greater especiallyin portrait and greater still if it be in profile as face shiew wherein we see how little soever be take off with the ground from the tip of the nose mouth and chin it will produce another aspect whence it it be evident what vast alteration this must cause in the likeness . in this art as well as painting it be constant rule to be begin with the painter for when the principal figure be finish the whole piece be reckoneinto the work here somewhat more strength there more faintness butwhat we now speak of to wit scrape concern engrave only whereas inametch nothing be do but stop unless thing be already bit . if it be afk whether what be stop up can be repairbeforeit be bit as in when the hatch which take away the swell from the cheek be stop up with stopground whether then the former roundness cannot be fetch out with fine needle on the same ground that all may bite together answer that this will make bad work but if something be want it must be touch up with the graver however shall shew another method make burnissier pretty hot and rub it gently and speedily over the part youwould have out and then it will close up the hatch so that you need neither stop up nor bite now etch thereon what be necessary and thus all may be bit at once these observation especially that of not carelessly spoiling the outline as in the example and be very needful . let any person now consider how little fine ordonnance of famous mafter when put out of hand in such condition can be like the original andvet this be too often the case however assert that without the former knowledge it be impossible to become good master for he who make blundering design and perceive not the mistake to be apparent and convincing cannot possibly mend they even great master sometimes blunder as we see in audran92 battle of alexander after le brun what poor hand and finger he has make in some place as thin as pencilstick especially those which be wide open as the captive porus and in darius can not too much wonder thatin in so glorious work audran do not correct such mistake since he be one of the best engraver ever know this indeed be but small matter with respect to so great work nevertheless it make the same imperfect and become charge upon le brun but this work have less justice do it here in holland inthe copy of schoonebeek who seem to have use he utmost endeavour to . spoil it for there be neither design nor keep observe all the posture which in the original be fine and beautiful he have turn into grimace everything be lame and crippled . chap remark on hatch . he course of hatch yield great pleasure to the eye because it makeevery thing appear in its nature and quality whether wood silk steel water silver wood stone sand each of which in engrave and etch require particular exprefsion yet in etch it be more expeditious especiallyif you can somewhat handle the graver the french artist audran excel herein.the st. bruno of bartholet engrave by natalis be admirable for the naturalnef which by particular hatching and the utmost neatness appear therein . now when great artist have shew he utmost sxill in plate and all things be work accordiag to rule yet we find it almost impossible to make people sensible what true art be and wherein the knowledge of good print lie most man nowday be take with sine stroke without regard to ill order or bad design sad reflexion for those who know better again a engraver or etcher be not so happy as painter or designer forthese last compose what they please or at least what they can and the engravermust follow they be they ever so indifferent yet this be no great matter ifthey might but etch and engrave with as much freedom as painter use withthey pencil or crayon this would spirit they to produce finer thing as other ingenious man have formerly do who have they liberty and do not tie theyselve up to any person as many nowday be oblige to do how seldomhave they a opportunity to work after fine picture or finish draw thishave often induce I to think that many good master understand more than he work shew happy be they whose circumstance will permit they to execute even but single plate accord to they skill and pleasure but alas the time will not allow it in these we free and note country moreover we see many artist sigh and groan under the difficulty lay on they by some painter and designer in sometimes send they such rude drawing that the round can hardly be distinguished from tne square the sharp from the blunt or wood from stone even such as they themselves could not sunderstand swerethey to receive they from other if the engraver happen to hit the design the master claim honour but on failure the engraver be sure to bear the scandal for this reason it be to be wishie that engraver would before they begin plate after such draw or sketch consult the painter or designer for resolution of all they doubt and that they might proceed with certainty . also think it not only useful but necessary that the designer be particular in he expression of all the material for instance that the basementstory of building shew to be of rough stone the column and pilaster with the imageryand ornament of marble that the engraver may exhibit the former rough by break stroke and what be sinooth and polish by neat and more curious one with the graver etch the bywork somewhat coarser again the wood ac work with long and break stroke humour the grain the tree accord to the course of the bough and sway of the leaf the grounds serpentine andalso break these observation ought to be heed in general as well as inthe particular together with the diminution of the offscape yet not in the manner of some by wide stroke but by close and make they fine on thisfoot there would be laf complaint of the designer and these not think themselves injure on see they design so ill follow thing thus workaccord to rule would certainly prove fine and the more in work of consequence and bear price though to one who understand he business thismanagement be no more trouble than the contrary . have see drawing of goltzius wherein he have plainly express all the particular object the tender or smooth body be well wash also neatly scum blead with red or black chalk what be rough or coarse he have handle boldlywith the pen or black chalk by which mean the one appear darker and the other lighter in the shade as if it be picture but it be no wonder that we see not such thing do nowday for goltzius use to make he own pattern and as good painter consider what ought to be ftone wood flesh white or black before he colour so goltzius do the same when he be to engrave any thing he would express every thing in he pattern though he be ever so certain of he art in order to do he whole worst after slight sketch and that nothing might escape he on belief that we ought not to trust to we memoryin matter of consequence wherefore shall illustrate this point by a examplein plate lxx wherein introduce several different body for besides the icorrectness of draught have alfo express they different colour the wall be rough stone the child tenderly shade the vessel of bright copper the vase white polish marble the pedestal or foot of freestone the wooden pale whereon hang cloth veiny and the sky and offscape as it go off the fainter and finer by this method of expression have stillanother advantage which be that if liy accident should leave my plate half do another hand by this means may understand my meaning and finifh it . hereby even painter may direct another who else would rather chuse to have the work he might leave behind he unfinisned rub out than thatanother who do not rightly know he mind should finish they . chap vi curious remark touch stip . any imagine they can represent the roundness against the main light by stip but they will find themselves mistaken since it cause great fungriness and therefore the method can not be good hatch look better and have more affinity with the shade stip be sometimes useful in case of need when we care not to crosshatch on the light and also when the shades be hatch too wide in order to express the restexion somewhat the plainer instead of cross they over again especially again the light though it be better to go over they again with asine single stroke and if you find this will not do then you may with finer needle continue the same hatch somewhat farthe but better method would be to lay it at once as far as it ought to be and then somewhat to stop up the end or extremity he who neglect this beoblige to make shift with stip yet that must not be too close the bestway be first with fine needle to continue the hatch little further andhatch as be old visscher 92 way in he boor after ostade whereby he prettilyexpress the colour of face and fetch out the main light touch stipping be very helpful and also expeditious to one who have not get the firmness of hatch for the point thus lengthen answer the same purpose and then you can proceed with certainty especially if vou use the same needle with which the hatch be continue in the light round the relief the shade again ought to be soften with the same necdle that make they then the stip of the large needle in the shade will not be too visible yet would you work the last stip in the light with smaller needle you may but because the shade ends more suddenly than the relief in the light should use no other for the stipping be nice point to he who will be curious the stip ought also to be equal say equally distant and not to come between the extremity of the stroke if it be afk whether any thing hatch too wide can be darkenwith stip instead of third stroke my opinion be that it may and thatany slight thing can be perform in this manner but the work be more tedious . thing so touch up look very neat for by strong stroke fainter one more faint and point we can very commodioussy darken a object more or less atpleasure boulanger have in my opinion overstip he print which makethey look rather like miniature than any thing else wherefore can not muchcomcommend stip and why because of the inequality and hungriness of the point or stip occasion by touch one harder than another whereby in biting one penetrate the copper more than another be the dot ever so small add to this the impossibility of make the stip perfectly round they willalways be more or lef longifh as may be easily prove by magnisyglass . have see in engrave print of goltzius the faint tint upon the relief crosshatch as well as in the shade but this be only proper for engrave espe ac cially in high finish because in etch the cross hatch express coming shade and then it may be very well effect by stip as broadlightobject want not so much darkness in the light . now if any thing should happen to be amiss and you would beat it out andmend it take proof and fasten it neatly behind you plate and then beat outwhat you would have away this may be do even to a hair and if you carenot to strike on the paper you may mark the place with sharp point on the copper so as to see it which will do as well though the spoiling proof bebutbe 0 trisse yet the proof when once dry be no more fit for this use wherefore the work must be do as soon as the proof come from the pref for be wet again it will always be uncertain and unlike the plate in order to find these little place or misbit spot with still greater ease method whichmany engraver make secret of take fine thread or string and put it crosswise about the plate ty it on the edge so that the center of the crofs come exactly upon the misbit spot or place then lay the plate backside upward on smooth and hard stone beat the place gently with point hammer and then with some stuff take from the oilstone rub it out thus you may find all the place how small soever even to a hair on the backside of the plate . dd chap vii of etch bassrelief . we have assert that each object require almost particular handling so think baf relief call for it for many who can etch well after fine picture or draw be at loss when they come to imitate and represent bassrelief they lay the stroke therein as in other object though in my opinion the difference be very great especially if we would not handle they in the manner of perrier and pietro santi but accord to rule though the former understand it the best of the two since he work better preserve the stoniness and design and yet he have add some thing of he own but the other have do it to suchsuch excess as thereby to render he work obscure he fold indeed be fine yet superfluous and improper for stone and more like gold silver or bronze appear better in print than in stone in my opinion santi understand not the naked proportion muscling or motion wherefore can not by any means allow he the preference the truth be they be good for draw but bethey to be compare with the life we should discover great difference in the next place it be absurd to imagine that so many bass relief as be find at rome and in other place both under cover and expose in and upon the tri umphal arch frize nich pediment pedestals ancient wall tomb column and vase from whence these two artist make they collection should allstand in so precisebe 0 light right and leave as they represent they in certainly some of they must have be light from above from below front even from all side and can not think they draw they by candlelight but rathershade they as they think fit . be once afk whether since the baf relief stand in many different place mould or model have not sometimes be take from they by one or other from which they shadow they drawing dispose these model as usual inwe the left or right light as they think proper which be not improbable . might likewise light some from above other from below from side frontand from behind in order to use they on any occasion which would be great help to those who know little or nothing of modelling . we have say that we think the bassrelief of perrier better in design than those of pietro santi but much inferior in finish though the work of the latter for the reason before assign have no affinity with the stoniness andyet some think that be the figure three or four foot high they would haveanother look for then the part would appear more grand and those of perrier on the other hand too slim and dull which do not disown nevertheless itmust be agree that this observation be good in order to shew the difference between carving in stone and chase in gold or silver but it be likewise true that have perrier finish he drawing as well as santi they would have beena much finer and more useful for it be easier to leave out superfluity than make addition it be not improbable that santi92 intention by he method of management be that he might be of greater service to painter statuary andchaser than perrier . we have affirm that pietro santi have possibly add much of he own now it be also not unlikely that perrier draw he object from greater distance than santi whereby he could not see all the minute part and can not but at the same time think that santi design most of he bass relief after undamagedwithindoor work in hall chamber and other inclose place whereas perrier possibly take he from withoutdoor work fuch as pediment frontispiece frize . and the like half eat up by the weather we might still subjoin thatperrier work only to shew the world that such excellent thing be at rome and at the same time to display he light and firm manner of draw whereas santi have not only view to profit but also to be generally useful to curious betist and other how true this be let the virtuoso determine . as as to the right handling of baf relief think it absolutely necessary thatevery thing be etch equally coarse or sine with one and the same needle without any difference with respect to stuff as be the best method for representing the stonework well unless it be but grey one with foreground andoffscape when the stroke ought to diminish or grow faint accord to perspective . there be likewise little observation make about the light of bassrelief for oftentime thing paint sharp and in sunshine be exhibit in the plate with common light through the roundness of the shade and somerimes we see the contrary but these be liberty tihich neither etcher nor engraver ought to take he whose province it be to imitate let he exactly follow the beaten path in relation to etch bass relief sharp light or sunshine be very improper and render they disagreeable but as for embellishment in sunshine the matter be of less moment . chap viii of engrave and the management of the stroke . tis to be wonder that among the many art and manual operation en igrave be so little and etch so much treat of the reason whereof bepast my apprehension many painter and lover for the encouragement of those who would make it they business or to shew they skill have earnestly strove to say something of it but no engraver have to my knowledge undertake the tafk possibly as not think themselves sufficient for it or else because they would keep it as secret from each other but the most pro bable reason as think be the late appearance of this art which be evident since the roman till they latter time know nothing of . it be certain that engrave as well as painting be found as much on theory as practice and that both depend on establish and positive rule which if orderly follow will make man master why then be they not made public for the information of the curious in what they want to know mustnot he who intend to go to certain town or village be first tell where it lie and then the way to it chuse the nearest as beft it be not strange that more engraver have apply to painting than painterto engrave because the latter have so many excellent book for they encouragement publisn by judicious master where as engraver have not one touch they practice but as every thing have it be time so we must hope for it in this . nam mora that vire tenera mora concoquit uvas et valida segete quod fuit herba facit . or perfect time bring on the tender grape and give the herby corn it92 ripen shape . in the mean time fhall boldly enter the list and accord to my small ability impart what know of it but the practice or handling shall not touchupon as not have the greatest skill therein what however mention of it as unavoidably necessary to what purpose to say submit to those of betterknowledge hope my endeavour will not be tax with presumption since myonly aim be thereby to rouze noble genius 92 and by my small spark to kindle greater fire accord to the latin proverb parva sape scintilla magnum excitawe have beforemention first on what basis engrave be found secondly good engraver92 qualification lastly what constitute a agreeableprint wherefore we shall now discuss the management of the stroke in object accord to they nature and course with respect to perspective and as well inetch as engrave together with some example for illustrate the point andprevent and correct mistake . in plate lxxi be wheel mark have eight spoke or point as also staff set upright in the ground cross by the horizon this wheel shew that each speak ought to have particular course accord to its turn and thatthe stroke muff be govern by the extremity of each speak as may be heresee the foremost run circular the third almost straight comparealso the foremost speak one with the hinder one five how much they differ in force for one approach and five retire which can not be otherwise according to perspective again the stroke draw with ruler and run off towardsthe point of sight grow gradually finer and fainter now though the short or crosshatching ought by establish rule to be more visible and strong than the long yet few be observe to make any distinction therein . we have say before that each object whether flesh stone grounds bequire particular stroke and among other that wood especially must be thickstroke along the grain and consequently crosshatch with finer stroke but now we shew the contrary for the cross one be stronger than those runwith the grain which here can not be otherwise if some say that contradict myself in make the crofsstroke thus against the grain ishall for they satisfac ac tion shew my reason for it observe then that any thing turn have no other grain than what the chisel make and as the turner work against the grain andthe wood retain more or less mark of the tool it must be express accordinglyin engrave but second question may be whether it would not do as well if both the hatching be equally fine or coarse answer it would as to the book xiii engrave . shade but not with respect to the stuff for it would be more proper to stonc copper wax and suchlike nevertheless these observation be generally little heed though also found on certain rule of this art . as for the staff it shew that the stroke begin round from below grow straiter as they approach the horizon and above the horizon the same but in reverse manner . now let we consider the other example in plate lxxi wherein the retireparapet shew the diminution or faintneis of the stroke not only in such but inany other object accord to they distance in go off the one in greater the ocher in less degrec hertby we may plainly discover the perverse notion of some man namely that diminution imply grow scanty or wider see with single stroke from one end to the other now although the offstrokes scem neater than the near yet they be not so in fact but as the place diministy so the stroke close and thin in such manner that they become neither closer nor more fcanty the diminution of the figure and the three vase bearthe same construction neverthelefs be sensible that many even old master do otherwise in handle they retire object figure tree offscape and sky more coarsly behind than forward have even observe that they closehatchthe nearest and darkest sky and work wider and wider towards the horizon but this more in etch than engrave possibly to save the trouble of use two or more needle or of stop up which be properly the point this example aimat for do not afk here whether it create more troubl e9 but shew what may possibly be think of less moment than in fact it be for instance place the three figure no ten or twelve step apart and at the same distance on the parapet three vase also number whereby may be plainly perceive how much the one differ from the other but although in these figurethe meaning be sufficiently to be understand to wit that the finer they be the more fine and close the stroke become yet have add the vase to they for the sake of those who may be curious enough to count the stroke when theywill find not stroke more or less in the one than the other which in the figurewould be tedious work observe in the next place the groundshade of each figure against the parapet each grow faint accord to its distance and withwhat certainty the accurate tint of the figure may be perceive thereon even to know how much they diminisn and grow finer and at the same time how muchthe light differ but let it not be think sufficient that the shade diminish or grow faint and the white remain all over the light since we know that the plan or ground can not shew its level otherwise than by means of light forward go off darker and darker for instance be white figure or white stone standing forward and you would place such another further in where the ground bedarker you must govern vourself by the ground where the first object stand as be subject to the same rule if thing be well finish if the plan or groundbe finish the figure ought to be so likewise be they airily handle andbroadlight the ground must be the same and though the ground in its colour be more or less dark yet that be not regard in this case because we are speak only of the diminution of the tint consist of white and black . suppose dloitize by google suppose the floor be of white marble and the figure the same or in white drapery the foremost would be broad light and the more distant less andless white be it even in sunshine nay if the light come from behind or fromaside the most distant would only keep a utmost heighten and still less bethe colour express in it as they who understand perspective well know nor can it be otherwise as may be see in the first example in the child92 hand holding the end of the hindmost speak which plainlv appear to have little or no whiteness and as for the stuff of the object as line cloth and such like some may rather think they possible to be so work than the naked because havealready engrave forward as neat and fine as may be we can therefore further in not express any thing finer or neater but say that as thing have the utmost neatness do not become neater by distance nor alter in the eye but doappear so when the object be very remote neither silk line or wooll be to be distinguished so far as it concern the hatch but the coarse part alwayskeep they form and this observation respects not only the three stuff but also figure stone grounds tree here some perhaps may say how can the stroke possibly unite the light when they as they retire ought to be closer and closer especially when the air which on the horizon be clear and brightand free from cloud unless they widen more and more towards the horizon be they never so faint to which answer as experience will prove that when the stroke thus thin and grow faint in they go off they certainly disappear and die away nay become at last invisible and unite enough with the light even be it sunshine though they be ever so close and such length think the graver can go when skilfully manage in etch the needle can do the same by stop up . however question not but my proposition will be tax with impossibilityand puzzling novelty especially by such as be not thorough engraver who may blame I for thus disclose the grounds of this noble art and so plainly shewtruth but my answer in the first place be that find myself oblige in duty to do so since all my wishie tend towards its arrive at the greatest perfection secondlv because what lay down be prescribe by certain rule of the mathematics though sew be senlible that the art of engrave in general flow therefrom andthat different object require different handling but rather believe that good method of draw will easily lead to engrave notion true enough in etching though even therein the point lie most in the biting and stop up . as to engrave vou must certainly be conversant with the handling and force of the graver two point not to be attain without great experience thoughthe beginning it be better for a etcher to have no handling at all becaute he may then gradually the better bring the graver to the needle and in a uniformityof stroke adapt the one to the other and make they harmonious whereas some rely too much on the graver use it here and there in they slovenly work without any difference and that with incredible carelessness sometimes cut foreground stone or stem of tree neat and smooth which ought to be rough andknobby when at the same time they be work face or marble figure withthe the needle this must be ow either to they carelessness or desier of ease or they ignorance since such doing be against reason and common instruction . could mention many such disorderly print among other there be one of the raising of lazarus do by berry wherein the figure of lazarus with so much ofthe line as come about he body be etch and the rest of the line lie on the ground neatly engrave whereby one part look like line and the other like silk the one be here and there stip and the other be not but perhapsthe plate be not well bit it also sometimes happen that we be oblige to rub out thing which make good my affertion for if the fault lie in the plate the master ought as much as possible to help it by he knowledge and judgment . could he handle the graver why do he not shew it and make thing agree andif he be not master of the graver why do he not better follow the stroke of the needle92 have he insteed of cross hatch make the stroke somewhat finer andtriple hatch they and use some stip then it would have be passable . there be another print with a ornament round it represent sacrifice of flora or the spring which be also wretchedly etch and engrave for the foremost figure as charity piety and time and every thing else on the foreground be neatly finish and mostly engrave but the figure on the second ground so slight and poorly etch as not to have any agreement with the other the stroke even look as if they be dab on and draw with shake hand instead of grow fainter every where which would make the work neat and intire this artist might have know that he could not make the graver and the needle agree . be sensible some will determine that many thing such as water silver gold and such like smooth and shine body can be more conveniently expressed with the graver then the needle but in my opinion fkilful hand can no give every thing its naturalness . it be very strange to I in the old print that the master have in nothing reprepsent the natural quality but etch every thing after one manner whether nudity drapery air grounds or stone except water and yet not this with thin and thick stroke but only crof parallel and those very unlike oftentime close and then wide as if they be scratch again they have not express anycolour and always make the water dark and brown now to create difference in shine body my thought be that you first lay the stroke strong and pa ac rallel and of reasonable width from each other and then close they by putthinner between mean in water black marble polish steel and such like for by this method we produce certain stir shew the smoothness and glitter . if it be afk why in etch the stroke which be close and thick sometimesfly up though the plate be in good condition and the ground neither burnt nor too hard answer that have find by experience that when the water be too strong and at first bite too sharp we must then take we chance because the plate be cold can not grow warm so soon as the ground which therefore be forcibly lift from the plate and presently rise and the sooner if the stroke be close and thick which happen not so easily in the tender part wh eare by the thinness and width of the stroke the water have not so much power to get under they . they to prevent this the water must be somewhat weaken and the groundand plate gradually make warm in order to make they unite with each other especially in cold weather for in the warm month of june july and august it benot necessary because we then use harder grounds . now to kuow whether the ground be in good condition make scratch or two with large needle in spare place of the plate and if the ground come out of the stroke like dust it be then too hard but if in curl it be in good temper especially if you can blow they off if they can not be wipe off with soft feathe but stick to the ground it be then too soft this be nice point it fometime happen to I that here and there they remain in the stroke . some etcher also frequently give themselves needless trouble when they put out the outline which be make too strong on the light side with stopground which youknow always flow more or less overthem especially if the place be hot but consider what trouble they must afterwards have when the out line be go for they be oblige to renew with the graver all the stroke run against it . wherefore the best way be to trace the draw neatly on the plate and mark at first softly with small point the dark touch as those of the eye nose andmouth on the snade side yet not on the light but to help they in stop upthey too strong stroke shall assign better method than that of the stopground . take thickground whitelead thin with oil of turpentine and spread itwith small pencil over the outline so as just to cover it and no further but be very careful not to do it over more then once lest you take off the ground for the oil afterwards evaporate and in the biting you must also not wipe overit with the featiier this be a invention of afriend of mine and though never experiment it yet question not its success mention whitelead but you chap ix of the black art or mezzotinto hough no figure of this art be to be find in caesar ripa as have beena unknown to he yet since in we time through its foundation lay by prince and the kind affistance of great man it be arive at so great perfection hope the follow figure will not be unacceptable to the profefsor and lovers of it . figure of the black art or mezzotinto . here you see young and plump virgin of frefh complexion and ami ac able countenance dress in black velvet line and face with skyblue powdered with gold glitter star she have broad gold girdle embroiderwith black bat which diminisn towards the arm she head attire be wanton andand modish adorn here and there with small flower about she neck be gold chain to which hang medal exhibit burn altar and theseword magnae britann c6 in she right hand be small tool like lancet together with feather and in the left table whereon be paint an head on black ground represent nature she poise airily on one leg as if she be dancing . explanation . the art be represent young and plump to fignyfy that she be still grow . the black velvet gown and star imply that like the star she be sprung fromdark night the golden girdle and bat give we to understand that though her production be not very lasting yet she make great gain the chain withthe niedal and altar thereon proclaim she lustre and the word round itallude to a offering of thanks to greatbritain to whom she owe she origin and glory the table with the figure of nature shew that she excel therein. the rest explain itself . why this beautiful figure bear the name of the black art never hear though she practice sufficiently give we the reason to wit that she proceed fromblack and though the art of etch also seem to be derive from black yet it be do in quite different manner for the former come forth from the light and the latter from the shade the one heighten and the other shadow . we have already say that etch be in speed superior to engrave but the black art be more expeditious then either of they and in neatnef havenot its fellow it may even compair with painting how soft and sluent seover abating for the colour indeed in duration and wear it be the weakest but on the other hand its expeditiousness bring in more money . this noble art preferable to any engrave in represent uncomon light as candle torch lamp fire and the like wherefore think it do not im ac properly bear the name of the black art it be remarkable not to be above fifty ycar stand and yet be ariyd at so great perfection those other arthave require more time but england where the climate be healthful andtemperate have contribute much to its neatnef and lustre there it haveits birth and furtherance for prince rupert give we the first example where fore we may rightly stile it noble the first print see of this prince be of an old man92 head with cloth about it take as far as know from a italian painting it be design so sine and great and broad handle as if wash withthe pencil by the best master it even look by reason of the natural softnessor melt not to be less than black art the same prince also invent cerain metal bear he name which it will retain for ever doubt not but this art will in time become delightful diversion to painter for through e9e reafon one for its easiness in learn two for its neatneis and lastly for its conveniency . it be easily learn by any one who be accustom to draw on grounded or blue paper because there be no difference in operation between the scrape on the plate and heighten on the grounded paper begin with the greatest light andsparing the shade as we have shew in we drawbook touch the handlingof crayon or chalk pencil wherefore affirm that it come nearer to painting than etch or engrave and it be so easily apprehend mean in theory as to be learn in lef than three day . it be neat and free from soil and smell as not require either stopground grease or aqu e6fortis .lastly the conveniency arise from it may be easily conjecture as it be more expeditious then either etch or engrave . but many be so eager in this art to learn neat scrape as to neglect the princi ac and when correct design be want in plate or print what judicious person willapprove it indeed we can not manage here as in etch where the outline may be trace on the plate with needle for the white sometimes go out or be so faint as scarce to be see besides it be inconvenient to scrape figure against lightground though artist generaly use to work the figure first and then the offscape against it now to prevent this inconvenience first scrape vour background andspearthe neat outline rather keep little out from it tillthe figure be finish afterwards you may gently scrape nearer thus you will not so easily run overthe outline as when vou begin with the figure . painter and that of engraver for the former make it only they diversion do not finish thing so very highly as the latter who have be bring up therein and make it they constant bufiness painter be satisfied with shew only good design and general decorum because when they be neatly to finissi one plate thay can work another . this art be certainly easy to person of good knowledge but if the work be not light enough at first go over it second time indeed you must not think to finish up at once because till proof be take you can not possibly know what condition you plate be in do like the painter first to deadcolour with broad part and then finisn now have proof you can give the work its main heightness and thus with patience finisn every part point require neithermuch time nor study but little observation there be publish print of little satyr which in a hour92 time scrape loose in my hand as walk in garden and after proof take finish in another hour few learn this art because as il think they can not be persuade how easy it be and with what few circumstance attend but should the lover set about it we may possibly intime see it become too common and etch and engrave neglect mean in object pecular to theb lack art such as portrait night and candlepiece spectres and inchantment apparition flower fruit silver gold chinaware crystal armand herb who will be able to etch or engrave those thing so perfect and nattural tural as thay can be scrape but in figure architecture bassrelief and landsca pe the art be weak and not at all so proper as engrave . it be great pity that both this beautiful art and the artist have so bad ame as if the one be witchcraft and the other magician though nothing but mere artwork long to hear what name the italian will give it the french andenglish agreeable to the dutch call it the formerart noire and the latter the black art a improper and unnatural name unless they mean first that the artist work the light out of the black ground and in the next place to distinguish it from etch and engrave
