the principle of design for the curious young gentleman and lady who study and practise the noble and commendable art or draw colour and japanning or new and complete draw book consist of variety of whole figure in diver position and all the several part of the human body from head to foot in fifty copper plate neatly engrave design chiefly for young beginner very neceffary and useful for all draw school boarding school to which be prefixe a introduction to draw contain description of the instrument and they respective use and the material proper for draw rule for manage the pencil and the best method for attain perfection in the art with instruction by which young practitioner shall be enable to form judgment as well of he own performance as those of other with easy proper and necessary lesson for he at he first entrance also the name of the colour use with instruction to temper and mix they and fit they for painting likewise colour for wash landskip or prinis of any kind translate from the french of monsieur gerrard de lairesse london print for serjeant ' at the black swan near temrle bar four shilling introduction none of the art which have be invent for the use or amusement of man kind can boast so great number of admirer as that of draw and very justly for it give such a agreeable representation of thing that we be apt to fancy we see object which have no real existence and that the imagery before we which be no more than paint cloth actually breathe the whole creation with all its work and wonder come within the power of its imitation it fet before we thing long since bury in oblivion exhibit to perfect view the most note action of people who have bcan long in they grave and shew we we ancestor in perfect resemblance of they feature through several successive generation that therefore youth may be instruct how to attain good degree of perfection in the art we shall prescribe the best rule we be able at least such as we apprehend be absolutely necessary for they information after which we shall give they some very useful and pertinent instruction for they better understanding of this art rule for the direction of the young practitioner in the art of draw it be highly necessary for he who would draw well to understand what be truly good and beautiful in draught in order to which the most expeditious method will be to comparc print and draught together many painter have grievoully miscarried by satisfy themselves only wich imitate bad piece without give any scope to they own genius or improve they knowledge in judge of the beauty and defect of picture the idea in we mind may in great measure serve we for model but the labour of the hand must indeed aid and assist that of the brain for whoever would be a able artist must by continual practice make the art habitual the rule of all art be soon learn but to attain perfection in any of they long prac tice and strict attention be absolutely requisite it be true maxim that laziness be never the parent of any thing excellent draw be not attainable but by length of time or perfection in it acquirable unless the hand be frequently employ in the practice and the mind in judge every day should produce something and the hand give frequent proof of thie speculation of the head he who propose to gain a entrance into minerva 's cabinet must make he approach es gradually thus in the art of draw though the representation of the human figure or many figure in piece be the principal object which every practitioner have chiefly in view yet he must not make this he first essay but procce to this by proper and regular step let the first part of he study be to draw streight and curve line square round regular irregular and inanimate figure also part of human figure as the eye the ear the hand foot this will be good foundation whereon to erect he future structure for by this means he will acquire readiness of hand freedom and exactness in draw line and accustom himfelf to the exercise of he patience qualification absolutely necessary for one who would be esteem a exact copier of nature especially in piece that require length of time and more than or dinary skill in the performance the out line be the circumferent stroke of figure the perfection of good out line consist in the freedom and boldness of the stroke and the due proportion of all its part to attain which the scholar be admonish to reject all mean and trifling prac tice such as trace the original through oil paper or make use of thin paper for the same purpose or take advantage of any artificial light the use of such deception will certainly prevent all progress and improvement in drating for some time at first be satisfied with practise upon good out line without aim ing at finish piece nor be it necessary that you should as yet hatch or shade you own draught you out line at first must be sketch with flight and faint touch that you may have a opportunity to amend it where proper which will have the less appear ance of be retouch in every stroke endeavour a exact imitation and when ever you mend the out line either by take away little of its part or by swell the other be sure to lose nothing of the freedom and boldness of it mind frequently to compare you copy with the original take particular notice of what be amiss and let not the least fault escape uncorrected that so in the draught which you may afterwards make the same original these error may be avoid for you must pass from one original to another ' till you be in good degree master of the first the best and surest method of practice be to make great number of sketch of the same figure in each of which endeavour to excel what you do in the former in you first operation procecd slowly for hasty production be seldom beautiful or correct and the design be often thus spoiled in the first attempt it be no easy matter to amend bad habit expedition in performance be acquire by constancy in practice when you fit down to work and all the time you be at it take strict and close view of you original and in you mind divide it into several part take due notice of the length breadth and similitude of each part observe the proportion of each to the other and to the whole the distance between the part and the part that lie parallel or be exactly opposite to each other when you have finish you copy and lay aside both example and draught let you mind be employ for some time on other affair then return to it again and view you work afresh and very probably you will discover fault which do not appear to vou before let you out line be large and smooth and draw in flow glide manner for if they be too fsreight they will carry disagrecable stiffness but if draw accord to this direction they will have the resemblance of life and motion and appear with a easy grace in all you draught let there be perfect relation between the part and the whole and uniformity run through the whole piece that be let every member be make for its own head and agree with it you must not put strong limb to body that be confump tive or to old age in its decay nor must you be less exact in pair the eye hand leg and foot for the least disproportion will be blemish and when any of the limb be not proportionate to the rest when you draw the muscle take care to insert they accord to the rule of anato my they must not be croud into small section but keep as entire as possible and only the principal muscle express in member which be to express any particular force they must be shew large as in the leg when it support the body or in the arm when it lift weight and be more swell than in any other member the material proper for draw the material necessary for this purpose be either pencil of black lead or black lead fix in porcrayon charcoal chalk black red and white pastil or crayon pen hair pencil and indian ink nothing be more proper for beginner to practise with than black lead in draw plain line especially as this make smoother stroke than can be do by charcoal or crayon cut you lead with penknife ' till you have bring it to fine point that it may give it neat small stroke or you may fix piece of the same lead in porcrayon but whatever it be you sketch with use yourself to hold it long way in you hand and let you finger be much farther from the point than the nib of pen be when you write and let you stroke be form with light gentle touch thus will you gradually acquire ready command of hand and you will with ease make you out line free and bold in practise after limb and figure it will be proper at first to draw the rough sketch with charcoal which be more easily discharge from paper than black lead slit you charcoal in small flender piece one of which fix in porcrayon the better to hold it then sharpen it to point and lightly but correctly sketch out you original when vou have so do if there be any thing you mislike in the performance you may easily wipe it out by brush it with feather or clean rag when you have secure you out iine with charcoal procce thus take feather and wipe they slightly over with it that it may appear faint then go over the line with black or red lead and cor rect they where ever you can if after all this you still see any error to amend take bit of crumb of stale white loaf with which you may discharge any part of it you please by rub it therewith you may use red lead or red or black chalk in the same manner as black lead if in heightnings or when you would give strong light or draw on coloured paper use white chalk and tobacco pipe clay pistil and crayon be term which perhaps the learner may not readily understand they be colour mix up with tobacco pipe clay which must be work into paste and roll up into the thickness of quill two or three inch long and then dry when fit for use the artilt work they on coloured paper but not in hatching as black and red iead commonly be the colour be rub and work together so that there be no single stroke but the whole appear as if only brush have be use the crayon be very expeditious manner of draw and when skilfully handle always produce delicate softness and fine expression however it must be observe that the careless or rude touch of linger may at once blot out all the beauty of this fine work to prevent which let it be preserve in book or in frame under glass the crayon will be work more easily if the grain of the paper be little rough and be express more strongly than when the paper be quite smooth or if the paper be some what dark or brownish or what they call white brown it will give relief to the ten der part of the work by shew the light stroke of it in shad draught sometimes pen be use for hatch the cross stroke however the hair pencil and indian ink serve much better for this use which be not only proper for hatch by stroke but for shad by method much more expeditious that be by wash which be the same way of work as with hair pencil and water colour in hatch the shade arc produce by line not unlike the stroke whlich shade print engrave but in wash no line appcar but the shade shew themselves like those in metzotinto print of the tint of light and shadow ilght and shade when judiciously dispose give the appearance of substance nature and distance to such body as the pencil represent suppose for instance circle draw on piece of paper imagine you see it fill up with any even colour you can conceive of it no otherwise than as round flat equal body but if you put the strongest of the colour in the middle and weaken it gradually towards the extre mity you will perceive a agrecable deception and instead of flat even body it will have the resemblance of ball or globe wherever the colour appear the most lively there the object catch the eye first and seem nearest to it but where the colour weaken and go off it grow faint and at length seem to fly off and break away from the fight thus the painter by break and diminish he colour throw that behind which he have mind shall be less visible when you round the part of a object it require the nicest touch of the pencil to draw the extremity so as that in turn they shall lof themselves insensibly and con fusedly without too sudden transltion of the light into the shadow or of the sha dow into the light but let the one pass into the other as it be reciprocally and im perceptibly that be by degree of light into shadow and shadow into light when you object be to be paint light you must allow due breadth of shadow to sustain they if dark sudden light must rise behind they to separate they from the ground or from other object that be place behind they or else they will appear as if they be stick upon each other in confuse manner whereas by just oppo sition of light to shade and shade to light projection be give which make se paration of the object you must keep proper ballance between light and shadow and introduce broad light into you draught you must give it large shadow you must make you light serve as repose to the dark and the dark to the light it should be farther observe in regard to light and shade that it be not enough that remote object be coloured in more faint and languid manner but the more or less distant they be the part should appear more or less confused the eye can not minutely discriminate a object which be at distince from it we can see human figure at street length but can not discern the feature of they face or the plait in they cloat be so the innumerable leave of dsitant grove appcar to the light but as one mass in the representation of body you must always give they such light as be most proper and convenient for they suppose situation suppose the object before you in the field or open air and the sun obscure with cloud you business be to introduce a universal light though not vivid or strong you shade too must be faint but when the sun appear in all it be glory you light must then be very strong and bold and the shadow exceed dark suppose again that the object you represent be in room little though not very much illuminate and to survey it you take you station without and stand level with the light that slrike upon it that figure must have very soft shadow which will shew it very beautifully and though the shadow be so soft yet the figure will seem as if it be emboss and have very bold appearance when small light illuminate body the shadow on the dark side appear large and they extremity very bold whereas large light render the shadow on the darker side more distinct and much softer than they limitation useful instruction for the young practitioner he that would be perfect master in the art of draw must learn to sketch well to which therefore be ought to give the greatest attention in copy statue some person begin with the head which they entirely finish before they pro cecd any farther by which mean it frequently happen that they either make the head too little or too big and the other part so disproportionate that there be but small re semblance of the original occasion cheifly through want of duly observe distance when therefore you have any thing to draw let you first care be to divide it into its different part then measure the distance in the original wich you eye mark the distance and length of each division with faint line on you paper and make sketch of the whole figure before you proceed to finish any part of it so will you secure the pro portion in the exactest manner the learner will find among these example several draught of the part of the face as the eye nose mouth view in different position all wlich he should practice upon before he attempt whole face for which purpose we shall lay down such lesson and instruction concern a oval with its several change and varia tion and of the cross in the same as will enable he to figure all bowings and re turning reclination and inclination of all fort of face the head you be to observe have the shape and form of a egg or oval this head have eye eye brow nose and ear which must be place in they proper situ ation by run cross through the oval by this means you will divide the per pendicular in the oval into four equal part which will make the head measure four nose in height the face three only the diameter cross the perpendicular divide into five part cach be the breadth or wideness of one eye this diameter be call the ocular line or that whereon the eye be to be place you must therefore draw streight line from the top of the right car through both eye to the top of the left ear and the line draw from the top of the head down through the nose mouth and chin be call the perpendicular cross the diameter or ocular line at right angles these line together we call the cross of the oval upon which cross what ever situation the face be in you must place the eye nose mouth and ear in proper place when you understand this thoroughly and have fix it in you mind you will soon be able to draw good face we of you own fancy and invention and execute they in masterly manner but if you accustom yourself to draw only after print draught er picture without know the use of the cross line and the proportion of face wich its part you take wrong method don know what you be about and will never attain to any degree of perfection have thus instruct you in the several method of draw face we come now to give you the dimension and proportion of the several part of the body it be cuslomary with the antient to allow eight head to they figure though some of they have only seven the modern usually divide figure into ten face take it at the crown of the head and end at the sole of the foot thus from the crown of the head to the forehead be the third part of the face the face take its beginning at the root of the lowest hair on the forehead and it end be at the bottom of the chin painter divide the face into three proportional part namely the forehead the gose the mouth and chin the distance from the chin to the pit betwixt the collar bone measure two length of nose from the same pit to the bottom of the breast one face from thence to the navel onc face from the navel to the privity one face the distance from the genitals to the upper part of the knece two face the knee itself measure half face measure from the lower part of the knee to the ancle and you will lind it two face from the ancle to the sole of the foot be half face when man stretch out he arm as wide as he can line draw from the top of the longest finger of the right hand to the top of the longest finger on the left will measure the length of he whole body or he will find himfelf as broad as he be long the distance from side to side of the breast two face the bone of the arm call humerus from the shoulder to the elbow measure to face the bonce call cubitus with part of the head measure from the tip of the elbow to the root of the little finger contain two face from the box of the shoulder blade to the pit betwixt the collar bone be onc face in take the measurement of the breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other to see if it be equal to the length of the body you be to observe that the box of the elbow with the humerus and of the humerus with the shoulder blade bear the proportion of half the face when the arm be stretch out the sole of the foot measure the fixth part of the figure the hand be the length of the face the thumb of the nose from the place where tle pectoral muscle or that muscle which make the breast disappear to the middle of the arm measure four nose carry you measure from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand you will find it five nose you longest toe be the length of you nose the top of the two nipple and the pit betwixt the two collar bone make a equilateral triangle these farther rule be to be observe in draw hend viz you must fet the eye at such distance from one another that you may place one between they the mouth when shut have the dimension of a eye the car be always on level with the eye top and below with the nose whether ie be short or long the nostril should be place exactly against the corner of the eye in face that be flat the check swell out and once that be lean the cheek fall in and the jaw bone stand out have finish we instruction for the draw of the face let we now procce to draw man at full length in the first place you must make you oval then divide as before direct you then draw perpendicular line from the top of the head to the sole of the foot which you must divide into eight length this will be good direction in place you figure upright or in whatever action the posture require whether it either fall in or swell out you must make the length of one head between the chin and che breast the third measure must reach to the navel the fourth from thence to the genitals the fifth to the middle of the thigh the sixth come to the lower part of the knee the seventh to the lower part of the leg and the last reach to the heel or sole of the foot in every measure or division you must take particular notice what touch there be of the muscle the leg must be first draw on which the body sland then the other after which draw the arm and hand you must first draw all the part very lightly only with coal because that will give you the leaf trouble in rub out or alter the hand you must observe be twice as long as broad and each of they part have its particular length breadth and thickness the nail of the finger make about half the joint it be upon the length of the foot mensure the sixth part or height of man or five eight more in length than in breadth take notice that the length of the face and hand be exacly equal and be just the tenth part of person height have thus instruct you to draw complete man we shall in the next place lay down some rule for draw of child some will have the length of child to contain five measure of the head as thus from the top of the head they make three and the thigh and leg two more the breadth between the shoulder be the length of one head and half the breadth of the body above the navel the length of one head and the breadth of the thickest part of the thigh be one third of two length of the head the breadth of the knee measure exactly the distance between the eye and the chin the brawn of the arm and small of the leg be just the thickness of the neck if you take the proportion of child slanding backward you will find it of the fame meafure as the former rule for fill up empty figure when with you charcoal you have draw the out line you must retouch they with you red lead crayon and then with feather brush away the dirtiness of the charcoal when you have donc that you must retouch with gentle hand such place as have be foul in the rub as the hair eye mouth finger toe out line let I also caution you that in those out line which be open to day you make you stroke very light but strong in those which be darken thus will the out line appear in natural manner and add wonderful beauty and grace to human fgure and all other object when this be do you must begin the shade wich single hatch but pretty strong you begin it at the top proceed insensibly to the bottom as evenly in the distance as you possibly can you then go on to the rounding which you must also express by single stroke wich such light as the object before you require be cautious not to make you shadow too hard or dark at first if you would present the perspective in the best manner begin the shadow lightly and faintly and heighten they afterwards and you will soon be pleased with the agreeable effect instruction bow to draw after picture model or the life when you have get picture to draw after be sure to place it in goodl ight so that the sight of you eye and the light of the day may fall together on the pic ture place yourself at moderate distance accord to the largeness or smallness of the picture at least no farther off than that you may with glance of you eye see the whole picture at once for the larger the picture be at thie greater distance you must fit to draw it be careful likewise to place you print exactly right before you and let it not lie down flat for if it be lay flat you will quickly see the figure in it fore shortne the paper you draw upon you must lay five or six time double upon pinnel board set in you lap and raise as high as you can with you knee or let it be rest on form or stoop desk so that you work may stand upon one end before you thus will you be enable to judge of the similitude between you draught and the original which it will be impossible for you to do if it lie flat before you the next thing you have to do be to guess as near as you can at the middle of the thing you have to draw whether picture or any other matter then mark it on you paper with the point of you coal when you have do this look for the largest figure if there happen to be more than ione and touch they lightly in proper place and so all that be in the picture you will then presently discover whether you gue and sketch be true or not but besides this before you draw stroke be sure you do it with good reason and observation and be very careful about the great and general part and meddle not with the small break ing ' till the next sketch and by constantly practise in this manner you will in sensibly acquire facility and judgment in you work another rule you be to observe be always to begin on the right side of the figure for so you have the first stroke conslantly in you eye and the rest will naturally follow and give less trouble but if you begin on the left side you hand cover the object from you sight have thus make rough sketch you should carefully review and examine it and see if it be do accord to art and if the action of the figure or figure in it be answerable to the original now as action be the life of picture they must shew themselves in the first draught however rude it be or you can never expect it will be happily finish you must then correct you sketch and improve it in neatness and air by add and diminish as you see proper as you may easly do with you charcoal but in do this be mindful that you don spoil the first good action in it which may easily be do if you don well observe the movement of the several part if you can always make choice of north light for you situation because it be less variable than any other should you fit at south window you will find it proper to place sash of oil paper before it which will break the intenseness of the fun ray and diffuse they more equally without any sensible variation the next thing you have to do be to put you figure whether it be the life or model in proper position the best light be that which be high and equally diffuse not too strong nor glaring when object be so dilpose you see all they beauty and the minutest part show themselves to advantage for draw the face when you have draw the circle of the face which you must do at first with plain circular line without make any bend or indenture in or out make stroke from that place of the forehead which be even with the chin down the place where you intend to fix the middle of the nose and the middle of the mouth this stroke you must observe must be strike that way which the face should turn either to one side or straight down which stroke will be great help to you in place the feature rightly so that they may not stand awry but directly one under another now if the face turn downward the stroke must be strike in such manner that the eye may turn answerable with the face downwards when you have do that make another stroke for the length of the nose where the end of it should come and another stroke for the mouth that it be not make crook still observe to make all the stroke to turn one way up or down accord as the face turn that be if the face turn up or down the eye nose and mouth mult turn with it when you have make these stroke ex actly procce to place the feature accord to the precede rule in the face be usually observe this threefold proportion from the top of the forehead to the eye brow from the eye brow to the bottom of the nose thence to the bottom of the chin this proportion however be not constantly the same for in some person the forehead be lower than in other the nose of some longer and in some shorter than other and therefore this rule can only be observe in well proportion face the distance between the two eye be juft the length of one eye if in full face but if it turn any thing aside then that distance be lessen accord ly the nostril ought not to come out farther than the corner of the eye in any face and the mouth mult be always place between the eye and the chin just under the nose as the greateft difficulty and principal part of the art lie in the lively draw of the face shall add these farther direction to perfect you in this particular branch of you art first if you would draw face exactly so as to resemble the original you draw it from you must in the first place take notice of the physiognomy or circumference of the face whether it be long or round fat or lean big or little that so you may be sure to draw the physiognomy or bigness of the face right if it be fat face you will perceive the check to make the fide of the face swell out and so make the face look as it be square if it be lean face the jaw bone will stick out and the check fall in and the face will look long and slender if it be neither too fat nor too lean the face will for the most part be round when you draw the utmost circumference of face you must take in the head and all with it otherwise you may be deceive in draw the true bigness of the face secondly you must carefully and judiciously observe and discern all the master touch which give life to face or discover the grace or disposition of the mind in which lie the whole grace of the work and the credit of the workman thus smile countenance be easily discern in the mouth when the corner of it be little turn ' up frow countenance in the forehead eye brow bend and the top of the nose between the eye somewhat wrinkle sober and stay countenance be best discerned in the eye when the upper eye lid come somewhat over the ball of the eye laugh countenance be easily discerned all over the face and so be a angry wrathful countenance by extraordinary frow there be also qome touch about the eye and mouth which give life and spirit to face which you will by degree find out by frequently observe and imitate the work of the best master further rule for the young praclitioner in draw you charcoal be neatly sharpen you must in the draw of face first lightly draw the out stroke or circumference of the face exactly be cording to the bigness of the pattern make it to sland fore right or to turn upwards or downwards accord to you pattern then make some little touch where the feature namely the eye nose mouth chin should be place not draw they exactly at the first when you have thus lightly point out the feature then begin to draw they more exactly and so proceed ' till the face be finish which be do then add the beard and other thing about it in draw side face you need not at first draw the nose mouth and chin that stand in the outmost line but only make it first but bare circumference turn this way or that way accord to the pattern and then make the mouth nose and chin in they place and just proportion you must be sure to place the muscle in the right and proper place by the muscle mean all the shadow that be cause by some dent or swelling in the face and be able to find out the reason of every muscle that so you may procce to work with the more judgment the muscle will be most visible in a old wither ' face and you must first draw the most principal of they and then you only draw the more ealily the lesser within be sure to be very exact in the place of they or you will spoil you draught be it ever so good observe to make the shadow rightly and be careful not to make they too dark where they should be faint or if you do you can never recover it to make it hght again and so the whole face will be marr ' and appear unhandsome the shadow be generally fainter and lighter in fair face than in swarthy complexion when you draught be finish you will do well to give fome hard touch with you pen where the shadow be darkest which will add great life and grac to you draw when you face be finish you come next to the car and hair wherein you must observe this rule have draw the out line of it you must first draw tle princi pal curl or master stroke in the hair which will guide you wich ease to do the lesser curl which depend on they always make you curl to be bent and turn exactly accord to the pattern that they may lie loose and fast and not appear stiff stub bear and unpliable when you have draw you curl exactly you must in the last place strike in the loose hair which hang carelessly out of the curl the face be draw which be the principal thing in the art chen proceed to the hand and arm leg and foot and so to full body of man and woman of draw tbe hand and foot the action and posture of the hand be so various that no certain rule can be give for draw of they only this in general when you first draw it with charcoal you be not to do it exactly that be you must not make the joint or vein or other thing to appear more than lightly or faintly and to touch out the big ness of the hand and the manner of turn it with faint touch and not with hard stroke if you have do that right then you part the finger asunder or close accord to you pattern with the like faint stroke then mark that place where any of the finger stand out from the other and make faint resemblance of it have so do if you perceive you draught to be right proceed to draw it more perfectly and make the bend of the joint the wrist bone and other principal thing somewhat exactly and laftly go over it again and draw every small bend or swell of the finger and make the nail knuckle and vein so many of they as appear and every thing else that you can discern the proportion of hand you have sufficiently describe in the print which shew how many quality or equal measure there be in it which you should endeavour to be acquainted with that of you may know when hand be well proportion with just and equal distance but you be to observe this rule or exception that accord as the hand turn one way or other the proportion must be shorten accord as they appear in the eye as you may see by the fore shortning of the hand in the print so much as the hand turn away from we fight so much it lofss of its ordinary propor tion and be make to shorten unto that proportion that the eye judge of it nay some time whole finger sometimes two or three or more be lose to we sight by the turn of the hand another way from we and so they must be wholly leave out and not make as to the foot it be not of difficult to draw the m as it be the hand and you must proceed in the same method in the one as in the other when you can draw hand and foot pretty well then proceed to arm and leg wherein be little difficulty after which you may procce to whole body rule to be observe in draw the whole body in the draw of body you must begin with the head to which you must give just proportion and bigness because all the body must be proportion accord ing to the head when you have draw the head proceed to the shoulder and go on to the trunk of the body begin at the arm pit leave the arm till afterwards and so draw down to the hip on both side and be sure you observe the exact breadth of the waist when you have do thus draw first that leg on which the body stand and afterwards that which stand loose or from the body and last of all the arm and then the hand either join to the body or separate from it agreeable to you pattern observe in you draw to place the parallel joint finew and muscle directly opposite in strait even line one against the other as the shoulder arm pit waist hip knee and so every thing else that one may not be higher or lower than the other that the body may not seem crook or deform but every parallel joint bend may directly answer the other that be opposite to it to which end you may strike strait stroke directly cross the shoulder to direct you to place they even and strait one against the other which you may likewise do in other place as the arm waist hip thigh or any other part that be opposite where you should place the one even with the other but you must have the same care in all part of the body as you have in one place where any bending or member of the body have or do require direct opposition onc to the other you make use of this help and direction observe that if the body turn one way or other then this stroke must be so sruck that it may answer the bow of the body thus if the body stan little downwards yon must strike the stroke stope or sideways in which case you must make the shoulder and other thing which should be strait against one another to be somewhat higher than one another so that the side which the body turn upon the shoulder and other thing that otherwise should be place even against the other must be make somewhat lower than the other side more or less accord to the stoop of the body as you be to be careful in the place rightly all level or parallel joint bending finew and muscle so you must be very exact in all perpendicular joint muscle that be when vou have draw the out line of you piece and be come to draw the joint and muscle that be within the body you must be as exact in place they that be directly once against another as you be in place choose even that be opposite to one another to the end that you may place thing exactly perpendicular that be in strait line one under another you may strike strait perpendicular line from the pit of the throat down to the privity just in the middle or seam of the body where you discern the parting of the rib and from thence strait down to the fect which line will direct yon to place thing perpendicularly even that the body may stand strait upright and not appear crook or awry take notice of the bowings and bending that be in the body to make that part which be opposite to that which bend to answer to it in bend with it thus if one side of the body be bend in the other side must stand out answerable to the bend ing in of the other fide if the back bend out the belly must bend in if the belly come in the back must stick out if the breech stick out the thigh that answer to it in opposition must come in so also in any other part of the body as when the knee bend out the hams that answer to it must come in and the same rule must strictly be observe in all other joint of the body otherwise the body will be make grosly and absurdly and without any proportion be careful to make thing of a equal proportion and bigness that one arm or leg be not bigger than the other or one breast larger than the other or any part of the body in a unjust proportion but as every thing in face must answer to the big ness of the face so one member must answer to another in bigness that so there may be perfect harmony in all the part of the body that it may not have brond shoulder and thin slender waist raw bone arm and thick gouty leg or any part dispro portionable from the other unless it be so that any part of the body do turn awry from we eye thus it one arm should be see side way and the other fore right then the one arm must be make so much less than the other by how much it turn awat frem we fight and appear less to we eye and if one leg be see full or fore right and the other leg be see side way then it must be make so much less than the other by low much it turn away from you fight as just proportion must be observe in the bigness of you draught so like wife in the length that one thing may not be too long for the other the body not too long for the leg nor the leg too short for the body that neither leg nor arm be disproportion in they length but that every thing have it be due proportion both for length and bigness unless when the body shorten away in any part from you fight as thus it one leg stand behind the other it must be make so much shorter than the other accord to the distance it be remove from you eye se likewise if one arm remove itself ever lo little out of you light that which come first to the eye and stand nearest to the sight must be make longer than the other and the other be make so much the shorter by how much it turn away from you sight so again be any part of the body be fore shorten that be if it appear so to you eye as to hinder the full light of the latitude of that part of the body then the body or that part of the body must be make to shorten accord to that proportion that the eye judge of it observe the due distance of one thing from another that you may be exact in you draught and perfectly imitate you pattern observe how much one part of the body stick out beyond the other or fall in within the other or whether it stand even with the other to which end you may strike small stroke down from the top of the shoulder along by the outside of the body strait down to the fect and this will direct you how far one part of the body should sland out beyond the other and how far other part should come in let no thing be do without rule and judgment let nothing be donc hard sharp or cutty that be let not the bending that be in the body or in the joint be make as if they be dent or cut in the flesh with sharp corner stroke but finely round and sloping like bending and not like cut in the body this be common fault among learner who should therefore be the more careful to avoid it by imitate they pattern exactly in the manner of make every stroke and touch that be give for nothing should be do without judgment rule for draw landskip landskip be the express tract of land by hill wood castle seas valley ruin rock in which there be not so much difliculty as in draw figurc and therefore the follow rule will be sufficient the best way of make landskip be to represent they shoot away one part lower than another as hath be practise by we best artist but other have run into contrary error by make the landskip mount up higher and higher till it reach to such height that it seem as if it touch the cloud as if the drawer have stand at the bottom of steeple when he take the prospect which be altogether incon gruous for we can discern no prospect at the bottom of hill but the most proper way of make landskip be to make the nearest hill highest and so to make the rest that be at greater distance to shoot away under that that the landskip may appen as if take from the top of hill be careful to lessen every thing in proportion to its distance express it bigger or less accord to the distance it be from the eye you must make all you light fall one way both upon the ground and tree and all thing else and all the shadow mult be cast one way you must give every thing its proper motion as tree when they be shake with the wind they smaller and more pliable bough must be shew in such a action as if they strike one against another by yield and decline from that part whence the wind blow the stiffer bough have less bend and motion you must likewise observe the bend of twig when bird fit upon it so likewite it it be force or press with any other thing cloud in the air must be shew with motion now gather together with the wind now violently condenfed into hail thunder bolt lightning rain and such like finally you can make nothing but what require motion peculiar to itself be cording to which it ought to be represent but this rule you must always observe namely that all you motion which be cause by the wind must be see to move one way because the wind can blow but one way at once always express fair horizon shew the heaven cloudy or clear more or less be cording to the occasion and if you express the fun let it be either rise or set and as it be behind or over some hill or mountain the moon and star be seldom or never depict unless it be in representation of twilight because all thing be suppose to be see by day if you express the fun make he light to reflect upon all the tree hill moun tain rock or building shad the contrary side after which manner also shadow cloud mist and the like make the shadow to fall all one way in express thing at large distance as ten twenty or thirty mile off where the object be hard to be discerned as whether it be temple castle house or the like shew no particular sign thereof or any eminent distinction but rather as weakly faintly and confusedly as the eye judgeth of it if landskip be lid in colour the farther you go the more you must lighten it with thin and airy blue to make it seem as if it be afar off begin first with dark green io drive it by degree into blue accord to the distance in river observe the general current and dashing of the wave against the boat side in the sea observe the wave and other proper agitation the rowl of the biliow the tumble of vessel up and down ship float some dipt some half drow some standing almost on end some hide almost with the wave through the uncertainty of the surge other strive to live in the motion of water fall from a high place but especially when they fall upon rock or stone you must make it leap up in the air and sprinkling all about it you work imitate the season you intend it for thus if you intend it for winter piece represent fell of timber slide upon the ice fowl by night hunt of bear or fox in the snow make the tree every whole naked or lade with hoar frost the carth bare without greenness

shade it with indico green thicken and blue verditure colour building with as much variety of pleasant colour as may be imaginable yet let reason be you rule in mixing you colour you may sometimes use white and black for the wall conduit or other thing for brick house and the like red lead and white if many house stand together set they off with variety of colour as umber and white lake and white red lend and white and the like lastly for the sky use maslicot or yellow berry and white for the lightest and west place red rosset and white for the next degree blue bice and white for the other blue bice or blue for the highest these degree and colour must be fs wring together that tle edge of each colour may not receive any sharpness that be so as that you can not perceive where you be gan to lay they be so drow one in another of the practice of wash with the alom water wet over the picture to be coloured for that keep the co lour from sink into the paper and will add lustre unto they make they shew fairer and keep they from fad then let the paper dry of itself be wall with alom water before you lay on the colour or before you wet it again for some paper will need wet four or five time the wash of the paper must be donc with large pencil brush but if you intend to varnish you picture after you have coloured they instead of wash they with alom water first size they with new fize make of good white starch with very fine brush and this you must be sure to do all over for else the varnish will sink through have thus prepare you work go to lay on you colour accord to you former direction suit they as near as may be to the life of every thing how to lay on you colour first provide yourself of pencil of several size and if you will be curious you ought to have great and small to each respective colour if not you must always have by you dish of fair water in which you must wash and cleanse you pencil wipe it with clean line cloth before yon put it into another colour for you pencil close those that be good thus see that they be fullest next the quill descend or lessen into small room or sharp point which you may see by put the hair into you mouth and draw it through you lip once or twice then you see what it be and if you find any straggling hair finge they off with the flame of candle be thus provide with colour and pencil if you delsgn to lay any colour about the edge of any map part piece or division of ground in plat as suppose you would inclose particular field or close in meadow with yellow with you pencil take camboge or yellow berry water very small quantity and on the inside of the black lead line draw the colour along of a equal breadth as near as you can from the line broader or narrower as you field be in bigness not daub the field or close all over with the colour which would be but a abuse to you map or plat then have go round the close or field in this manner with you colour wet you pencil in you mouth or have by you small quantity of water to dip it in and strike along the inside of the coloured line bring it more down towards the center of the field and this will sweeten you colour and make it shew as if it loft itfelf by degree to the very colour of you paper or parchment this course be to be take not only for yellow but for all other colour lastly with pen if you can not do it handsomely with pencil take fome of the colour which shadow the colour you have already use about the field and go over you black lead only of shall you field be finish lastly after the same manner you may adorn all the part in you plat or map of diver colour
