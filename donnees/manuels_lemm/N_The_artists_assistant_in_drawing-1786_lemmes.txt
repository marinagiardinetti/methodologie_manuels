place pillar at and obferve the same method rule the parallet fg and ik and the perpendicular gill and kl will give they height at the diftance require to find the diameter of thickness of pillar at any particular diftance you be allo to be guide by that neareft the bafe for inftance suppofe you neareft pillar to be ten foot high and one foot in diameter divide it from top to bottom into ten equal part and fet off one of they upon the bafe of the pillar then rule line from the point of sight to the diameter and you will have the thickness of all you pillar on they respective parallel of

then place you neareft figure or mark the dot for the head and foot by the point and which a fiver the same purpofe and rule from thefe dot to the point of sight the line pand bp and if you would find the height of figure to be draw at rule from thence the parallel ed to the diagonal bp and the perpendicular de will give the height re  quire the fame direction will thew the height of fizure at any

where thefe two line inserf be the point of sight this perpendicular will pat through the center of all the arch in the dome of cupola which center may be find by any three give point as in fig vil next divide you bafe line into any give number of foot and the vifual line rule from thefe di  vifion to the point of sight will reduce all you object to they juft proportion by fet off they height
