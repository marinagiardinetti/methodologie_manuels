its work and wonder come within the power of its imitation fet before we thing long fince bury in oblivion exhibit to perfect view the moft note action of people who have be long in they grave and

to the mechanic who fubfift by he handicraft this excellent art feem inculcate by nature herfelf for we fee it not only practife by grow proficient but even child frequently draw various figure and that to curioully as even to aftonith we with they productums that therefore fouth may be inftruct how to attain to good degree of perfection in the art we shall prefcribe the beft rule we be able at leave fuch as we apprehend be abfolutely neceftary for they information after which we shall give they fome very ufeful and pertinent inftruction for they betrer underftanding of this art for the direction of the young practitioner in the art of deaw in raw may be define reprefentacion by line and shade of any object in nature or art the imitation of another draught or the expreft the likeness of fomething conceive in we own mind in lmitation of nature or copying from any draught the form and shape of the figure be the firtt thing that make a impreftion on the mind which be afterwards reduce into form by manual operation which draw the line hence appear the neceflity of frequently employthe mind in curioutly obferve whatever object be propot to it by which wlean it will be more capable of conceive rruly and exactly of object and the hland will more eafily and juftly delineate that which be to ftrongly fix in the memory be highly neceilary for he who would draw well to underfland what be truly good and beautiful in draught in order to which the moft expeditious method will be to compare print and draught together many painter have grievoully mifcarry by fatisfying themfelves only with imitating have piece without give any scope to they own genin of improve they knowledge in judging of the beauty and defect of picture the idea in we own mind may in great meafure ferve we for model and to improve thefe we should frequently examine the performance of other and we obfervation on piece that be efteem correctly do should be nice and critical we should attentively confider every print and draught we fee and every beauty we find in it endeavour to fix on we memory particularly the freedom and boldness of the outline and the proportion of the feveral part above all thing it be neceffary that the judgment be rightly inform for then the vo practitioner will make the greater and quicker progress in he improvement than if he go on in practice without encreaf he knowledge for he succet will be more ow to he genin thin he hand the labour of the hand muft indeed aid and affift that of the brain for whoever would be a able arrift muft by continual practice make the art habitual the rule of all art be foon learn but to attain perfection in any of they long pradice and striet attention be abfolutely requifite it be true mexim that laziness be never the parent of any thing excellent draw be not attainable har by length of time nor perfection in it acquirable unless the iland be frequently employ in the pultice and the mind in judge every day should produce fomething and the hand give frequent proof of the speculation of the head be some part of every day should be spend in the practice of this art we would recommerd the murning as fitteft for that purpofe which therefore should be employ in perfect yourfeive both in judgment and practice he who propofe to gain a entrance into minerva s cabinct muft make he approach gradually thus in the art of draw though the reprefentation of the human figure or many figure in piece be the principal object which every practitioner have chieffy in view yet he muft not make this he firft effay but proceed to that by proper and regular step let the firft part of he study be to draw rreight and curve line quare round regular irregular and inanimate figure allo part of human figure as the rye the ear the hland foot oc this will be good foundation whereon to erect he future structure for by this means he will acquire readiness of hand freedom and exactnet in draw line and accuffom himself to the exercife of he patience qualification abfolutely necellary for one who would be eftcem a exact copier of nature especially in piece that require length of time and more than ordinary skill in the performance he who begin well have more than half performhe work the outline be the circumferent stroke of figure the perfection of good outline confift in the freedom and boldness of the stroke and the due proportion of all its part to attain which the scholar be admonith to reject all mean and trifling practice fuch as trace the original thro oil s paper or make ufe of thin paper for the fame purpofe or take advantage of a artificial light the fe of fuch deception will certainly prevent all progress and improvement in draw neither should the rule and compaff be ufe except in arcbitetfure or to raife perpendicular in order to form square or fome other figure to draw in or when a artift have finith he draught he take this method to compare it with the original to fee whether there be a agreement between they however the bare eye if ufe to it will be fufficient for fuch difcernment for forme tune at firft be fatisfied with practife upon good outline without aim at finith piece nor be it neceffary that you should as yet hatch or fhade you own draught you outline at firft maft be sketchwith flight and faint touch that you may have a opportunity to amend it where proper which of will have the less appearance of be retouch in every stroke endeavour a exact imitation and whenever you mend the outline either by take away little of its parte or by swell the other be fure to lofe nothing of the freedom and boldness of it mind frequently to compare you copy with the original take particular notice of what be amiss and let not the leave fault efcape uncorrected that of in the draught which you may afterwards make of the fame original thofe error may be avoid for you muft not pass from one original to another tiil you be in good degree mafter of the firft the beft and jureft method of practice be to make great number of sketch of the fame figure in each of which endeavour to excel what you do in the former in you firtt operation proceed flowly for hafty production be feldom beautiful or correct and defign be often thus spoiled in the firft attempt it be no eafy matter to amend have habit expedition in performance be acquire by conftancy in practice as the young beginner will have frequent occation for the exercife of he patience he muft be careful to fubdue he paftion in he firfl attempt he mutt proceed deliberately and flowly and ufe he utmoft endeavour to perform well fecure every stroke and try all he skill to make one good draught rather than to hurry over in negligent manner great number of bad one when you fit down to work and all the time you be at it rake srict and clofe view of you original and in you mind divide it into feveral part take due notice of the length breadch and similitude of each purt observe the proportion of each to the other and to the whole the diltance between the parr and the part that lie parallel or be exactly oppolite to each other when you have finith you copy and lay afide both the example and draught let you mind be employfor fome time on other affair then return to it again and view you work afreth and probably you will difcover fault which do not appear to you before eafy to imagine that when the eve have be engage confiderable time on the fame object the form and shape of it become familiar to he and that on revifal he mind may entertain different notion of it than in the light it appearbefore and affure yourfelf whatever pain you beflow in review and compar you copy with the original draught in order to difcover and amend you fault will vet be ufelet but you will find this advantage in it that it will be means of perfect you in that particular draught and improve you in the knowledge of line draught and proportion and by continue to practite this method you will in litde time find yourfelf qualified for the exacteft imitation let you outline be large and finooth and draw in flow glide manner for if they be too streight they will carry difagreeable stiffness but if draw accord to this direction they will have the refemblance of life and motion and appear with a eaty grace in all you draught let there be perfect relation between the part and the whole and uniformity run thro the whole piece that be let every member be make for its own hlead and agree with it you muft not put firong limb to body that be confumptive or to old age in its decay nor muft you be let exact in pair the eye iland leg and foot for the leave dilproportion will be blemith or when any of the limb be not proportionate to the reft in the inftruction which we shall prefently give the learner will find direction to avoid any fuch miltake and solecifin when you draw the mufcle take care to infert they accord to the rule of anaromy they muft not be croud into fmall section but keep as entire as poffible and only the principal mufcle expreff in member which be to express any particular force they muft be thewn large as in the leg when it fupport the body or in the arm when it lift weight oc and be more wellthan in any other member thus when the limb and member be draw with few and large mufcle they thew themfelves with majetty and beauty of in drapery the beauty of which confift not in multiplicity of fold but in they plain simplicity and natural order the drapery muft feem to cover the part loofely for if it be too clofe and hreight the piece will appear too fiff the plait muft be large fold naturally over the part which be to be feen underneath which be do by place properly the light and shade in cover both the extremity of the joint fuch as the shoulder elbow knee oc care muft be take to mark they in fuch manner as to diftinguith they shape and in fact drapery be no trifling or intignificant part of this art for if well do it add new grace to the picture give a enliven air to its other beauty and never fail of pleaf the eye of the spectator material proper for draw he material neceffary for this purpofe be either pencil of black lead or black lead fix in porcrayon charcoal chalk black red and white paftil or crayon pen hairpencil and indian ink nothing be more proper for beginner to practife with than black lead in draw plain line coc especially as this make fmoother stroke than can be do by charcoal or crayon cut you lead with penknife till you have bring it to fine point that it may give neat fnall stroke or you may fix piece of the same lead in porcrayon but whatever it be you fketch with ute yourfelf to hold it longway in you hand and let you finger be much farther from the point than the nip of pen be when you write and let you stroke be form with light gentle touch ihus will you gradually acquire ready command of hland and you will with eafe make you weline free and bold in practife after limb and figure it will be proper at firfl to draw the rough skerch with charcoal which be more eafily discharge from paper than slack lead slir you charcoul in imall flender piece one of which fix in porcrayon the better to hold it then tharpen it to point and lightly but correctly fketch out you original when you have to do if there be any thing you miflike in the performance you may eafily wipe it out by bruth it with feather or clean rag when you have fecure you outline with charcoal proceed thus take feather and wipe they flightly over with it that they may appear faint then go over the line with black or redlead and correct they wherever you can if after all this you slill fee any error to amend take bit of crumb of htale white loaf with which you may difcharge any part of it you pleafe by rub it therewich you may afe redlead or red or black chalk in the fame manner as blicklead if in heightnings or when you would give ftrong light or draw on colour s puper ufe white chalk and tobaccopipe clay piffil and crayon be term which perhaps the learner may not readily underfland they be colour mix up with tobaccopipe clay which muft be work into pafte and roll up into the thicknel of cuill two or three inch long and then dry when fit for ufe the artiff work with they on colour s paper but not in hlatching as black and red lead commonly be the colour be rub and work together to that there be no fingle stroke but the whole appear as if only brush have be ufe the crayon be very expeditious manner of draw and when skilfully handle always produce delicate softness and fine expreftion however it muft be obferve that the careless or rude touch of finger may at once blot out all the beauty of this fine work to prevent which let it be preferve in book or in frame under glaf the crayon will be workmore eafily if the grain of the paper be little rough and be expressmore flrongly than when the paper be quite finooth or if the paper be fomewhat dark or brownith or what they call whicebrown it will give relief to the tender part of the work by shew the light stroke of it in chad draught fometime pen be afe for harch the cross stroke however the hair pencil and indian ink ferve much better for this ofe which be not only proper for hatch by stroke but for thad by method much more expeditious that be by wath which be the fame way of work as with hair pencil and water colour in hatch the shade be produce by line not unlike the stroke which fhade print engrave but in wash no line appear but the shade thew theyselve like thofe in metsitinto print of the tint of light and shadore and shade when judiciouly difpot give the appearance of subftance nature and diftance to fuch body as the pencil repretent suppofe for iaftance circle draw on piece of paper imagine you fee it fillup with any even colour you can conceive of it no otherwife than as round flat equal body but if you put the hrongeft of the colour in the middle and weaken it towards the extremity you will perceive a agreeable deception and inslead of flat even body it will have the refemblence of ball or globe wherever the colour appear the moft lively there the object catch the eye firft and teem neareft to ir but where the colour weaken and go off it grow faint and at length feem to tly off and break away from the sight thus the painter by break and diminithing he colour throw that behind which he have mind shall be lef vifible when you round the part of a object it require the niceft touch of the pencil to draw the extremity to as that in tarn they shall lofe themfelves infensibly and confafedly without too fudden of of the light into the shadow or of the shadow into the light but let the one pass into the other as it be reciprocally and imperceptibly that be by degree of light inmo sh dow and shadow into light when you object be to be paint light you muft allow due breadth of shadow to fustain they if dark fudden light muft rife behind they to feparate they from the ground or from other object that be place behind they or elfe they will appear as if they be stick upon each orher in confated manner whereas by juft opposition of light to shade and shade to light projection be give which make separation of the object vou muft keep proper ballance between light and shadow and in introduce broad light into you draught you muft give it large shadow you muft make you light ferve as repote to the dark and the dark to the light thus drapery which be coloured red or yellow in some place in other will take brown with good effect the hye fee a objet the more frongly and plainly the nearer it be diftance werken the sight the farther off a object be the more imperfectly it be perceive thofe object therefore which fland neareft to view should be better finiththan thofe which be throw bekind but obferve that they muft have reciprocal dominion over each other to that as one object by its heightenings force other to appear at dillance to the fame object maft be throw farther from the sight than other which be illuminate more krongly it should be farther obferve in regard to light and shade that it be not enough that remote object be coloured in more faint and langaid manner but the more or less diffant they be the part should appear more or lef confufe the eye can not minutely difcriminate a object which be at diffance from it we can fee human figure at streer length but can not difcern the feature of they face or the plait in they cloarn to the innumerable leave of diftant grove appear to the sight but as one mmass white pure and unmixed have two different property it draw a object nearer to it and it carrie it off to farrher diftance when it be place with black the opposition of light and dark bring the object more into view and render it more fenfible but pure white as it be the lighteft of colour will fy off to the remoteft view unless force forward and fupport by black on the other hand pure black be deem the heavieff moft earthy and moft fenfible of all colour and prefent object nearer to the sight you muft caft it into maff confufe it infenfibly and give it its proper repofe in the reprefentation of body you muft always give they fuch light as be moft proper and convenient for they fppof situation suppofe the object before you be in the field or open ffir and the sun obicure with cloud you bufiness be to introduce a univerfal light though not vivid or frong you shade too muft be faint but when the sun appear in all it be glory you light muft then be very flrong and bold and the shadow exceed dark suppofe again that the object you reprefent be in room little though not very much illuminate and to furvey it you take you station without and ftand level with the light that ftrike upon it that figure muft have very foff shadow which will thew it very beautifully and though the shadow be to foft yet the figure will feem as if it be emboff and have very hold appearance when fmall light illuminate body the shadow on the dark side appear large and they extremity very bold whereas large light render the shadow on the darker side more diftinct and much fofter in they limitation feseil instruction for the young prattitioner hoever would make any proficiency in the art of draw muft firft underftand geometry for it be by this and the help of line that we be instruct to take the length and largeness of body and know whether they be streight or curve round oval square or any other imaginable figure but as it be not we bufinet here to treat of geometry or give thofe geometrical rule which be ufe in the art of draw we shall refer the learner to le clerc s practical geometry he that would be perfect mafter in the art of draw muft learn to ketch well to which therefore he ought to give the greatelt attention in copy statue fome perfon begin with the head which they entirely finith before they proceed any farther by which mean it frequently happen that they either make the head too little or too big and the other part to difproportionate that there be but small refemblance of the original occafion chiefly thro want of duly obferve difance when therefore you have any thing to draw let you firft care be to divide it into its different part then meafure the diftance in the original with you eye mark the diftance and length of each divifion with faint line on you paper and make sketch of the whole figure before you proceed to finith any part of it of will you fecure the proportion in the exacteft manner the learner will find among thefe example feveral draught of the part of the face as the eye nofe mouth view in different pofition all which he should practife upon before he attempt whole face for which purpofe we shall lay down fuch leffon and inftruction concern a oval with its feveral change and variation and of the cross in the fame as will enable he to figure all bowings and returning reclination and inclination of all sort of face the head you be to obterve have the shape and form of a egg or oval this head have eye eyebrow nofe and ear which must be place in they proper situation by run cross throthe oval by this means you will divide the perpendicular in the oval into four equal part which will make the head to meafure four nofe in height the face three only the diamerer croft the perpendicular divide into five part each be the breadth or wideness of one eye this diameter be call the ocular line or that whereon the ly be to be place you muft therefore draw rreight line ii line from the top of the right ear thro both eye to the top of the left ear and the line draw from the top of the head down thro the nofe mouth and chin be call the perpendicular crossing the diameter or ocularline at right angles thefe line together we call the cross of the oval upon which crot whatever situation the face be in you muft place the eye nofe mouth and ear in proper place when you underfland this thoroughly and have fix it in you mind you will foon be able to draw good face out of you own fancy and invention and execute they in mafterly manner but if you accuftom yourfelf to draw only after print draught or picture without know the fe of the crotline and the proportion of face with its part you take wrong method don know what you be about and will never attain to any degree of perfection have thus inftract you in the feveral method of draw face we come now to give you the dimenfion and proportion of the feveral part of the body it be cuftormary with the antrent to allow eight hlead to they figure though fome of they have only feven the modern ufually divide figure into ten face take if at the crown of the head and end at the sole of the foot thus from the crown of the head to the forehead be the third part of the face the face take it begin at the root of the loweft ifair on the forehead and it be end be at the bottom of the chin painter divide the face into three proportional part namely the forehead the nofe the mouth and chin the diftance from the chin to the pit betwixt the collarbone meafure two length of nofe from the fame pit to the bottom of the breaft one face from thence to the navel one face from the navel to the privity one face the diffance from the genitals to the upper part of the knee two face the knee itfelf meafure half face meafure from the lower part of the knce to the ancle and you will find it two face from the ancle to the sole of the foot be half face when man firetch out he arm as wide as he can line draw from the top of the longeft of the right hland to the top of the longeft finger on the left will meafure the length of he whole body or he will find himself as broad as he be long the diftance from side to side of the breaft two face the bone of the arm call humerus from the shoulder to the elbow meafure two face the bone call cubirus with part of the hland meafure from the tip of the elbow to the root of the little finger contain two face from the box of the shoulderblade to the pit betwixt the collarbone be one face in take the meafurement of the breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other to fee if it be equal to the length of the body you be to obferve that the box of the elbow with the humerus and of the humery with the shoulderblade bear the proportion of half the face when the rm be fretch out the sole of the foot meafure the fixth part of the figure the hand be the length of the face the thumb of the nofe from the place where the pectoral mufcle or that mufcle which make the breaft difappear to the middle of the arm meafure four nofe carry you meafure from the middle of the arm to the begin of the hand you will find it five nofe you longeft toe be the length of you nofe the top of the two nipple and the pit betwixt the two collarbone make a equilateral triangle no certain meafure can be give for the breadth of the limb becaufe even the meafure be changeable accord to the different quality of the perfon and movement of the mufcle thefe farther rule be to be observe in draw head viz you muft fet the eye at fuch diftance from one another that you may place one between they mouth when thut have the dimenfion of a eyc the ear be always on level with the eyetop and below with the nofe whether it be short or long the noltril should be place exactly againft the corner of the eyc in face that be flat the cheek fwell out and in one that be lean the check fall in and the jawbone fland out have finifh we inftruction for the draw of the face let we now proceed to draw man at full length in the firft place you muft make you oval then divide it as before direct you then draw perpendicular line from the top of the head to the sole of the foot which you muft divide into eight length this will be good direction in place you figure upright or in whatever action the pofture require where it either fall in or fwell out you muft make the length of one head between the chin and the breaft the third meafure muft reach to the navel the fourth from thence to the genitals the fifth to the middle of the thigh the fixth come to the lower part of the knee the feventh to the lower part of the leg and the laft reach to the heel or sole of the foot in every meafure or divifion you muft take particular notice what touch there be of the mufcle the leg muft be firft draw on which the body sland then the other after which draw the arm and hand you muft at firft draw all the part very lightly only with coal becaufe that will give you the leave trouble in rub out or alter the hland you muft observe be twice as long as broad and each of they part have its particular length breadth and thickness the nail of the finger make about half the joint it be upon the leagth of the foot meafure fixth part or ileight of man or five righths more in length than in breadth take noice that the length of the face and hland be exactly equal and be juft the tenth part of perton height have thus indruct you to draw complete man we shall in the next place lay down fome rule for the draw of child some will have the length of child to contain five meafure of the head as thus from the top of the head they make three and the thigh and leg two more the breadth between the shoulder be the leagth of head and half the breadth of the body above the navel the length of one head and the breadth of the thickeff part of the thigh be one third of two length of the head the breadth of the knee meafure exactly the diftance between the eye and the chin the brawn of the arm and small of the leg be jutt the thickness of the neck if you take the proportion of child ftand backward you will find it of the fame meafure as the former if you be defirous of draw piece well proportion you muft be very careful and attentive to copy all the feveral part fingly as the eye ear cc .vl es for sill up empty figure hu far we have treat of colour and outline we come now to infiruct the learner how to fill up the empty figure and to mark the hlatching to as to produce the beft effect in the firft place obferve that you hlatching muft confift but of two stroke croff each other or at moft three to make the ftrongeft shade where the cavity be fuch as require the whole force of you lead or crayon you muft rub it upon you paper as you fee occafion for it would be needlet trouble to employ more than three hatching one upon another when with you charcoal you have draw the outline you muft retouch they with you redlead crayon and then with feather bruth away the dirtinet of the charcoal when you have do that you muft retouch with gentle hand fuch place as have be foul in the rub as the hair eye nofe mouth finger toe outline let I alfo caution you that in those out line which be open to day you make you stroke very light but aronger in thofe which be darken thus will the outline appear in natural manner and add wonderful beauty and grace to human figure and all other object when this be do you muft begin the shade with fingle hatch but pretty flrong you begin it at the top proceed infenfibly to the bottom as evenly in the di stance as you poffibly can you then go on to the rounding which you muft allo express by fingle stroke with fuch light as the object before you require be cautious not to make you shadow too hard or dark at firft if you would preferve the perspective in the beft manner begin the shadow lightly and faintly and heighten they afterwards and you will foon be pleafed with the agreeable effect instruction how to draw after picture model or the life avin give you the neceffary instruction for draw print and draught we shall in the latt place direct you how to draw after picture model or the life and in what manner you be to place they when you have get picture to draw after be fure to place it in good light to that the sight of you eye and the light of the day may fall together on the picture place yourfelf at moderate diftance accord to the largeness or smallnet of the picture at leal no farther off than that you may with glance of you eye fee the whole picture at once for the larger the picture be at the greater diftance you muft fit to draw it be careful likewife to place you print exactly right before you and let it not he down flat for if it be lay flat you will quickly fee the figure in it foreshortenthe paper you draw upon you muft lay five or fix time double upon pannel board fet in you lap and raif as high as you can with you knee or let it be reft on form or flooping defk to that you work may fland upon one end before you thus will you be enable to judge of the similitude between you draught and the original which it will be impoftible for you to do if it lie flat before you the next thing you have to do be to guet as near as you can at the middle of the thing you have to draw whether picture or any other matter then mark it on you paper with the point of you coal when you have do this look for the largeft figure if there happen to be more than one and touch they lightly in proper place and to all that be in the picture you will then prefently difcover whether you gueff and sketch be true or not but befide this before you draw stroke be fure you do it with good reafon and obfervation and be very careful about the great and general part and meddle not with the small breaking till the next sketch and by constantly practife in this manner you will infenfibly acquire facility and judgment in you work another rule you be to obferve be always to begin on the right side of the figure for to you have the firft stroke conflantly in you eye and the reft will naturally follow and give less trouble but if you begin on the left side you hand cover the object from you sight have thus make rough skeich you should carefully review and examine it and fee if it be do accord to art and if the action of the figure or figure in it be antwerable to the original now as action be the life of picture they muft thew themfelves in the firft draught however rude it be or you can never expect it will be happily finith you muft then correct you sketch and improve it in neatness and air by add and diminithing as you fee proper as you may eafily do with you charcoal but in doing this be mindful that you don fpoil the firft good action in which may eafily be do if you don well obferve the movement of the feveral part you muft be careful to admit nothing into you work that be improper or foreign to the subject of it and to let nothing trifling have the chief place in it if you can always make choice of north ligbt for you situation becaufe it be less variable than any other should you fit at south window you will find it proper to place safh of oil s paper before it which will break the intenfeness of the sun ray and diffufe they more equally without any fenfible variation in draw after the life you be to confider the bigness or size of the object you have to reprefent and remove from it to the diftance of three time its magnitude and be fear in fuch manner as that you eye may be on level with it and at every stroke you draw be canricus to obferve what part of you object lie under the perpendicular or principal line the next thing you have to do be to put you figure whether it be the life or model in proper polition the beft light be that which be high and equally diffate not too frong nor glaring when object be to dispote you fee all they beauty and the minuteft part thew themfelves to advantage but this you be to obfervg that in draw from the life that you light should come from such a altitude as that the shadow of body project on the plane be equal and in proportion to they height so that the ligbt do not firike upon or enlighten all the part fome of which be theltered by the protuberance of other the eycbrow overhade the hollow of the eyc the nofe hide fome part of the mouth and the throat be obfcurby the chin for this reafon pourtrait painter blind all the window of the room they work in except one the lower part whereof they clofe up and let the light in from the upper only which irike upon the object they be painting after while themfelves be beneath the light direction for the young painter the instruction we have hitherto give the young beginner have be pretty much in the general we shall now introduce he into every part of he work by fuch particular direction arictly observe they will make he compleat draughtfiman for draw the face han you have draw the circle of the face which you muft do at firft with plain circular line thout make any bend or indenture in or out make stroke from that place of the forehead which be even with the chin town the place where you intend to fix the middle of the nofe and the middle of the mouth this stroke you muft obferve muft be ftruck that way which the face should turn either to one side or ftrait down which stroke will be great help to you in plar the feature rightly to that they may not fland all awry but directly one under another now if the face turn downward the stroke muft be ftruck in fuch manner that the eye may tarn anfwerable with the face downwards when you have do that make another stroke for the length of the nofe where the end of it should come and another stroke for the mouth that it be not make crook ftill obferve to make all the stroke to turn one way up or down accord as the pace turn that be if the face turn up or down the eye nofe and mouth muft turn with it when you have make thefe stroke exactly proceed to plice the feature accord to the precede rule in the face be ufually obferve this threefold proportion from the top of the forehead to the eyebrow from the eyebrow to the bottom of the nofe from thence to the bottom of the chin this proportion however be not conflantly the fame for in fome perfon the forehead be lower than in other the nofe of fome longer and of fome fhorter than other and therefore this rule can only be obfervin well proportionfacc the diffance between the two eye be juft the length of one eye if in full face but if it turn any thing afide then that diftance be leffen accordingly the woliil ought not to come out farther than the corner of the eye in any face and the mouth muft be always place between the eye and the chin juft under the nofe as the greateft difficulty and principal part of this art lie in the lively draw of the face shall add thefe farther direction to perfect you in this particular branch of you prt firft if you would draw face exactly to as to refemble the original you draw it from you mutt in the firft place take notice of the phyfiognomy or circumference of the face whether it be long or round fat or lean big or little that to you may be fure to draw the phyfiognomy or bigness of the face right if it be fat face you will perceive the cheek to make the side of the face fwell out and to make the face look as if it be square if it be lean face the jawbone will stick out and the check fall in and the face will look long and flender if it be neither too fat nor too lean the face will for the moft part be round when you draw the utmoft circumference of face you muft take in the head and all with it otherwife you may be deceive in draw the true bigness of face secondly you muft carefully and judicioufly obferve and difcern all the mafter touch which give life to face or difcover the grace or difpofition of the mind in which lie the whole grace of the work and the credit of the workman thus fmiling countenance be eafily difcernin the mouth when the corner of it be little turnup frow countenance in the forehead eyebrow bending and the top of the nofe between the eye fomewhat wrinkle fober and stay countenance be beft difcerned in the eye when the upper eyclid come fomewhat over the ball of the eye laugh countenance be eafily difcerned all over the face and to be a angry wrathful countenance by extraordinary frowning there be allo some touch about the eye and mouth which give life and spirit to face which you will by degree find out by frequently obferve and imitate the work of the beft marer further rule for the young practitioner in draw we charcoal be neatly charpenyou muft in the draw of face firft lightly draw the outrroke or circumference of the face exactly accord to the bigness of the pattern make it to fland foreright or to turn upwards or downwards accord to you pattern then make some little touch where the feature namely the eye nofe blouth chin should be place not draw they exactly at the firtt when you have thus lightly point out the feature then begin to draw they more exactly and to proceed till the face be finish which be do then add the beard and other thing about it in draw sideface you need not at firtt draw the nofe mouth and chin that fland in the outmoft line but only make it firft but bare circumference turn this way or that way becording to the pattern and then make the mouth nofe and chin in they place and jutt proportion vou muft be fure to place the mufcle in the right and proper place by the mufcle mean all the shadow that be cauf by fome dent or swelling in the face and be able to find out the reafon of every mufcle that to you may proceed to work with the more judgment the mutcle will be moft vifible in a old witherface and you muft firft draw the moft principal of they and then you may draw the more eafily the leffer within be fure to be very exact in the place of they or you will spoil you draught be it ever to good obferve to make the shadow rightly and be careful not to make they too dark where they should be faint for if you do you can never recover it to make it light again and to the whole face will be marrand appear unhandsome the shadow be generally fainter and lighter in fair face than in complexion when you draught be finish you will do well to give some hard touch with you pen where the shadow be darkeft which will add great life and grace to you draw when you face be finith you come next to the ear and hair wherein you muft obferve this rule have draw the outline of it you muft firft draw the principal curl or mafter stroke in the hair which will guide you with eafe to do the leffer curl which depend on they always make you curl to bend and turn exactly accord to the pattern that they may hie loofe and faft and not appear fliff rubborn and unpliable when you have draw you curl exactly you muft in the laft place ftrike in the loofe flair which hang carelessly out of the curl the face be draw which be the principal thing in the art then proceed to the iland and arm leg and foot and to to full body of man and woman which be the moft difficult thing which if you can attain to perform with well grounded celerity nothing will be difficult to you but moft eafy as flower bird beaft ship or any other thing that be to be draw by hand of draw the hland and foot come now to speak particularly of the hland and foot which you ought to spend some time about before you come to whole body becaufe they will be too difficult for you to enter upon till you have pretty well practife you iland in the draw of other thing more especially hland and foot which be the moft difficult member of the body to draw except the face by learn of which you will attain the reft with less difficulty and greater perfection and undoubtedly it be thing highly commendable to draw hland lively and exactly which hath fuch variety of pofture and action and you will find it no eafy matter to imitate it in every one of they with spirit and life or without some lameness or imperfection the action and pofture of the hland be of various that no certain rule can be give for draw of they only this in general when you firft draw it with charcoal you be not to do it exactly that be you muft not make all the joint or vein or other thing to appear more than lightly or faintly and to touch out the bigness of the hland and the manner of turn it with faint touch and not with hard stroke if you have do that right then you part the finger afunder or clofe accord to you pattern with the like faint stroke then mark that place where any of the finger fland out from the other and make faint refemblance of it have fodone if you perceive you draught to be right proceed to draw it more perfectly and make the bend of the joint the wriffbone and other principal thing somewhat exactly and laftly go over it again and draw every fmall bend or swell of the finger and make the nail knuckle and vein to many of they as appear and every thing elfe that you can lifcern the proportion of hand you have fufficiently defcribe in the print which thew how many equality or equal meafure there be in it which you should endeavour to be acquainted with that to you may know when hland be well proportionwith juft and equal diftance but you be to obferve this rule or exception that accord as the hand turn one way or other the proportion muft be thortne accord as they appear to the eye as you may fee by the forethortning of the hand in the print to much as the hand turn away from we sight to much it lofe of its ordinary proportion and be make to thorten unto that proportion that the eye judge of it nay fometime whole finger fometime two or three or more be loft to we sight by the turn of the hand another way from we and to they muft be wholly leave out and not make as to the foot it be not to difficult to draw they as it be the hand and you muft proceed in the fame method in the one as in the other when you can draw lland and foot pretty well then proceed to arm and leg wherein be little difficulty after which you may pro ceed to whole body rule to be observe in draw the whole body wn the draw of body you muft begin with the head to which you muft give juft proportion and bigness becaufe all the body muft be proportion accord to the head when you have draw the head proceed to the shoulder and go on to the trunk of the body begin at the armpit leave the arm till afterwards and to draw down to the hip on both side and be fure you obferve the exact breadth of the naift when you have do thus draw firft that leg on which the body sland and afterwards that which fland loofe or from the body and laft of all the arm and then the hland either join to the body or feparate from it agreeable to you pattern observe in you draw to place the parallel joint sinew and mufcle directly oppofite in strait even line one againft the other as the shoulder armpit waift hip knee and to every thing elfe that one may not be higher or lower than the other that the body may not feem crook or deform but every parallel jont bend coc may directly anfwer the other that be oppofite to it to which end you may flrike ftrait stroke directly cross the shoulder to direct you to place they even and frait one againft the other which you may likewife do in other place as the arm waift hip thigh or any other part that be oppofite where you should place the one even with the other but you muft have the fame care in all part of the body as you have in one place where any bending or member of the body have or do require direct opposition one to the other you make ufe of this help and direction obterve that if the body turn one way or other then this stroke muft be to sruck that it may anfiver the bow of the body thus if the body ficop little downwards you muft firike the stroke rloping or fideway in which cafe you muft make the shoulder and other thing which should be ftrait againt one another to be formewhat higher than one another to that the side which the body turn upon the shoulder and other thing that otherwife should be place evehn againft the other muft be make formewhat lower than the other side more or less accord to the stoop of the body as you be to be careful in the place rightly all level or parallel joint bending sinew and mufcle to you muft be very exact in all perpendicular joint mufcle that be when you have draw the outline of you piece and be come to draw the joint and mufcle that be within the body you muft be as exact in place they that be directly one againft another as you be in place thofe even that be oppofite to one another .. to the end that you may place thing exactly perpendicular that be in rrait line one under another you may ftrike ftrait perpendicular line from the pit of the throat down where you difcern the parting of the rib and to the privity juft in the middle or seam of the body from thence strait down to the foot which line will direct you to place thing perpendicularly even that the body may fland frait upright and not appear crook or awty take notice of the bowings and bending that be in the body to make that part which be oppoi tite to that which bend to anfwer to it in bend with it thus if one side of the body be bend in the other side muft fland out antwerable to the kend in of the other side if the back bend out the belly must bend in if the bellycome in the back muft stick we if the breech flick we the thigh that an fiver to it in opposition muft come in to alfo in any other part of the body as when the knee bend out the hams that antwer to it muft come in and the fame rule muft firictly be obferve in all other joint of the body otherwife the body will be make grotly and abfurdly and without any proportion be careful to make all thing of a equal proportion and bigness that one arm or leg be not bigger than the other or one breaft larger than the other or any part of the body in a unjutt propottion but as every thing in face moff anfiwer to the bigness of the face to one member muft anfwer to another in bigness that to there may be perfect harmony in all the part of the body that it may not have broad shoulder and thin flender waift rawbone arm and thick gouty leg or any part difproportionable from the other unless it be of that any part of the body doth turn awry from we eye thas if one arm should be feen fideway and the other foreright then the one arm muft be make of much less than the other by how much it turn away from we sight and appear less to we eye and if one leg be feen full or foreright and the other leg be feen fideway then it muft be make to much less than the other by how much it turn away from you sight as juft proportion muft be obferyin the bigness of you draught to likewife in the length that one thing may not be too long for the other the body not too long for the leg nor the leg too short for the body that neither leg nor arm be disproportionin they length but that every thing have it be due proportion both for length and bigness unless when the body chorten away in any part from you sight as thus if one leg fland behind the other it muft be make to much thorter than the other accord to the diftance it be remove from you eye to likewife if one arm remove itfelf ever to little out of you sight that which come firft to the eye and fland neareft to the sight muft be make longer than the other and the other be make to much the shorter by how much it turn away from you sight so again if any part of the body be foreshortne that be if it appear of to you eye as to hinder the full light of the latitude of that part of the body then the body or that part of the body muft be make to thorten accord to that proportion that the eye judge of it observe the due diftance of one thing from another that you may be exact in you draught and perfectly imitate you pattern obferve how much one part of the body slick out beyond the other or fall in within the other or whether it fland even with the other to which end you may ftrike finall stroke down from the top of the shoulder along by the outfide of the body ftrait down to the foot and this will direct you how far one part of the body should fland out beyond the other and how far other part should come in let nothing be do without rule and judgment let nothing be do hard charp or curty that be let not the bending that be in the body or in the joint be make as if they be dent or cut in the fleth with charp corner stroke but finely round and floping like bending and not like cut in the body this be common fault among learner who should therefore be the more careful to avoid it by imitate they pattern exactly in the manner of making every stroke and touch that be give for nothing should be do without judgment of perspective proportion derspect ive proportion differ much from that we have be hitherto defcribe and may be define the judgment of the eye of the proportion of thing by its diftance from it as thus if one part of the body come nearer to the eye than the other it be make to much bigger than the other part of the body which turn away from the eye thus if one leg fland behind another the foremoft leg that fland firft in sight muft be make fomewhat bigger and longer than the other becaufe the eye to judge of it it be the fame with regard to any other part of the body the proportion muft be leffend accord to the diftance of the object from the eyc the next thing to be obfervin good draught be graceful pofture and proper action that be that the true natural motion of every thing be expreft in the life and spirit of it that be the life muft be quickenby art as to express the majefty of king you muft put he in fuch graceful pofture as may move the spectator with reverence to behold he to to make soldier you muft draw he in fuch pofture as may betoken courage boldness and intrepidity of to make clown he muft be see in the moft deteftable and clownith pofture to in every other inftance the inward affection and dispofition of the mind muft be expreff in the moft lively manner in the outward action and gefture of the body now to attain competent skill herein my advice be diligently to observe the work of we great mafter

lead to execution to mark the contracting of they brow the motion of they eye and the carriage of they whole body to the end you may expret they to the life in you drawing and work another thing to be obferve in good draught be loofeness or air that be that the body be not make ffiff in any part but that every joint may have its proper and natural bend to as it may with the greateft life express you intention that the picture may not feem lame or the joint fliff as if they be not pliable or capable of bend but every joint or limb muft have its proper and natural pofture accord as it may beft fuit with and become the pofture in which the figure be fet another thing to be note in draw be what the painter call forechorten which be to take thing as they appear to the eye and not to draw the full length and proportion of every part but to make it shorter by reafon the full length and bigness be hide from we sight of if would draw ship stand foreright there can appear only she forepart the reft be hide from we sight and therefore cannot be expressagain if would draw horfe fland foreright look full in my face muft neceffarily forechorten he behind becaufe he side and flank be hide from my eyc obferve therefore this rule that you ought rather to imitate the vifible proportion of thing than the proper and natural proportion of they for the eye and the underftanding together be direct in the perspective art ought to be the guide meafure and judge of draw and painting the latt thing to be regard in good draw be that every thing be do by the guidance of nature that be that nothing be expressbut what accord and agree with nature in every point as thus when would make man turn he head over he shoulder muft not make he turn more than nature will permit nor muft any thing be forcbeyond the limit of nature or be make to come short of it but though nature muft not be firetchbeyond it be centre yet it muft be quicken to the higheft pitch of it thus if would express king muft express he in the moft majeftick poffure can invent and if would draw clown muft reprefent he in the moft clownith action can imagine yet muft neither the one nor the other be draw in fuch pofture as will not agree with the motion of nature that be in fuch pofture which man can not imitate with he natural body of in all other thing nature muft be the pattern of all kind of draught rule for draw
