introduction be a observation of pliny that the ancient paint with four colour only and out of they make all they teint monficur de pile be of opinion that it be of thefe they make they grounds or what we call the dead colour it really be tine have put it out of we power to determine but if we suppose thofe four principal colour in perfection then think it can be no longer doubt but that from they might be make all the various colour in nature for my part can not believe that the four capital colour of the antient would mix to that furprifing perfection we fee in the work of tilian and ruben and if we have no certain knowlege of they method of colour who live in the laft century how should we underftand theirs who live near two thouland vear ago and why the method and practice of colour which be of well in oduct on know to ruben and van dyck should not be continue down to the pretent mlafter be to I furprifing muft confess have often think and still believe that thofe painter who have acquire to fine manner of colour might if they pleafed have communicate it to pofteriry in writing but never hear that any attempt be make towards it though tis probable there might be some it be attonith neverthelefs all enrope should fuffer alike at the fame time for want of that noble franknef and generous spirit which might have be expect from thofe mafter and which would have do the world more service than they picture it be plain from the work of they pupil that they know it becaute in they picture we fee the fame sort of colour and colour and from the little variety of capital colour and sameness of method ufe by they it be not to be doubt but the whole be contain in few principle neither difficult nor tedious if we trace the art through its feveral declenfion we shall find rembrandt who be mafter of all the part of colour in the higheff degree live to the vear next to he be zouff who die in lely live to the year reily england about eight vear after who be zouft 's disciple furvive they and be leave the beft colourift we have mo . richardson who die about the vear be he pupil but in my opinion in point of merit much he inferior reily think decline in the same proportion to zouft that louff do to rembrandt as all thefe mafter from rembrandt funk gradually below each other in the art of colour we may with certainty date the declenfion of that art from he can not attribute this gradual degeneracy in the knowlege of to charm ing a art to any thing but inability or want of that generofity have before mention or both though thefe gentleman be not able to give we to perfect a account as the great mafter yet they might have com municate what they learn from they and if it be againft they own private intereft to have publish it whilft they practife they should out of general regard to man of taffe and to the art itself have leave it behind intr oduc on they to have give to pofterity a opportunity of reap the benefit of they study flatter myfelf that the follow sheet compile originally for my own ufe contain fomething that may be of confequence in sludy this art and hope the practicable method of colour here lay down which have be the refult of much study and long experience and which now ufe will be find both ufeful and agreeable in the courfe of fludying this part of my art as could have no affiftance from the living find myfelf oblige to make my court to the dead mean they work and though have have very little op portunity to fludy even they yet from the few have copy have after tedious courfe of miftake at laft by mere dint of labour and the affiftance of genius fuch as it be find the follow method of colour very eaty and expeditious painter fay de pile spend many fear in the search of knowlege which they might have attain in little time have they bit at first upon the right patb this truth have experience and confess that the work of van dyck and rembrandt be the fureft guide to nature it be out of thefe moft excellent mafter that have eftablish my method it be from they picture have find the firft lay of colour and from they have learn the virgin teint and finifh secret though have always apply they to practice from nature in the method of my work begin with short and plain account of the principal coloun ufe in the flesn next follow with the principal teint first paintinc of dead colour second painting third or last painting of painting back grounds some remark on copying of drapery painting of landscape painting new thort and familiar account of the art of perspective be b odu ti on thefe particular have endeavour to make familiar clear and instructive without defign to flatter or offend and thro the whole courfe of the work have have the utmoft regard to truth the motive of my publifh be folely the benefit of the art such as be bear with happy genius though deftiture of mafter or guide may from thefe instruction acquire competent knowlege of colour ing almoft without ftudy here the lover of painting who ftudy for they pleafure and amufement may be conduct eafily rep by step to the secret of that art which of all the defign one afford per haps the greateft pleafure to the mind it may be object to I by fome that my own work do not thew have either acquire or revive that art which accord to my own confeffion have long time lain dormant be not the proper perfon to anfiver this objection neverthelefs have some copy by I that will leave to judge to compare in this point with any painting that have be do for the laft fixty or feventy year and believe could con vince any artiff even at twice painting head from the great mafter that my method will certainly anfwer to all they variety of colour and fure every fenfible painter will grant that that method which come neareft to van dyck and rembrandt will certainly be the nearest way to nature since have eftablifh myfelf in thefe principle muft inform the reader that find no difference in the method of the working between copying and painting from nature have iknown at my firft fet out as much as have fince learn should have approach much nearer to thote great wafter other who have the advantage of vouth may pertuad attain the end propofc be for they that write and moft fincerely with the rule lay down may contribute to reffore of divine a art monficur de pile fay titian and rembrandt prepare they sir lay or grounds very near alike and with colour that kindly united and be as near to the life as possible on which they lay they virgin teint with light stroke of the pencil and thus they imitate the force and freshness of nature in troduc ti on be convinced that there be certain colour which deftroy each other if they be mix to excess and that they should be as little shake as possible by the notion of the pencil it would be folly in any man at this prefent time to affume of much knowlege in the art of painting as monfieur de pile really have who be man of genius and learn that make painting he principal study and travel on purpoto to complete he knowlege in that delight ful art be intimately acquainted with the painter in he time who affift he in fludying the work of the great wafter which he care fully examine and from which he make he reffection and judicious remark this be when the work of van dyck and rembrandt be more in perfection and in a age when painting be better underftand be it poffible for any thing to be more plain and intelligible than thefe two moft excellent remark of monficur de pile which contain the principal matter and foundation of colour this be vaftly different from theirs whofe colour be as they pretend to change and wear to the complexion though this may anfwer they purpofe yet none that ftudy the art of colour will hope believe it it be certainly true that the great mafter imitate nature in they firft painting or dead colour ing to far as they could without dirty the colour omit only the finithing touch and colour that should come laft which defign to shew in the courfe of this work in the moft intelligible manner can and exactly to the rule and method of my prefent practice some painter imagine the great mafter have colour which we have no knowlege of and it be probable they might vetl confess fee none in the picture of van dyck and rembrandt but what be common to painter only fome of they be better than ours which would be reme die if that art be more encourage by the painter thofe we have be convinced would appear much finer if they be lay on proper grounds painter should have as great regard to he firft lay as he have to the fucceeding part of he work sir godfrey kneller in lely time udy he manner and prepare he grounds and firft lay of colour on int roduc ti on fuch cloths as lelyuf but after he death he foon fall into flighter manner which be more agreeable to he genius and inclination and invent the cold grey coloured cloths on which he eftablifh he flight expeditious manner then be the time when the painter expofe they underftanding in neglect the charming stile of van dyck to follow kneller but though colour be not he talent yet he be in he time the beft face painter in enrope nor have there be a artift fince he whofe head can fland any comparifon with he after he co louring hang here for fome time between the manners of mo . richardson and rofalba the follower of the latter fail in oil eftablish she method have trace the art of painting thro its feveral declenfion will venture to give my opinion on it as it fland at this prefent time in regard to portraiture and hope to do it in fuch manner as to offend no body that may differ from I if may be allow to judge from the picture bring home by gentleman from abroad as the work of the moft eminent living mafter may without partiality affirm that face painting be no where of well perform as in england notwithfland ing the prejudice of fome in favour of foreigner nor be it at all fur prifing it should be of fince where there be the greateft encouragement to a art thither the moft eminent mafter in that art will refort and there it will be improve to its greateft height it be well know that no nation in the world delight of much in face painting or give of generous encouragement to it as we own and it be equally know that no country afford fuch help in regard to beautiful nature we have alfo the greateft number of van dyck ' picture and the reft of the best facc painter rembrandt except of any people and it feem rea fonable from thefe obfervation which be found on matter of fact to infer that england be preferable to all other nation whatfoever in this respect and the beft place for fludying the art of face painting can not but indulge fort of compaffion for thofe artift as do for other miltaken man who conceive it abfolutely neceffary to traverfe nraty and other country walt that time abroad which in my humble opi nion may be employ at leave as well at home in fludying the work of van dyck and the inimitable beauty of the english lady which chink ol as much preferable to the antique as the animated beauty of nature be to the cold initation of she in stone am inform there be scheme on foot to eftablifh a academy for painting and sculpture with it may fucceed as it muft probably in time improve thofe art to the higheft perfection and will of courfe do honour to the nation and to the nobility who will from frequent it for they amufement learn the principle of thofe art and to become real judge dff e riut ridea the principal colova use in the fieth from which all the teint be make lake white or fine white be the very beft white we this colour should be ground with the fineft poppy oil than can be make at prefent we white be bad on account of the oil which be not really poppy white be friendly work colour and come forward with vellow and red but retire with bly and green it be the nature of all white to fink into whatever ground they be lay on therefore they should be lay on white grounds ivory black be the beft black we have it be colour which fympathize and mix kindly with all the other it be true shade for blue ivory black and little indian red make the beft general shadow colour that can be it be ground with linfee oil and we ed with drying oil black be cold retire colour ul tramarine be the fineff blue in the world it be tender retire colour and never glare and be beautiful glaze colour it be ufe with poppy oil prusstan be very fine blue and kind work colour it be ground with linfee oil though think nut oil be more proper it should never be ufe in the fleth but in the green teint and the eye licht ol licht oker be friendly mixing colour and of great dic in the fleth it be ufually ground with linfee oil but nut oil be better all fellow be ftrengthen with red and weaken with bly and green licht red be nothing but fine light oker burnt this and white in mixing produce the moft perfect fleth colour that can be make it be beautiful clean kind work colour but too ftrong for the white and therefore will grow darker it should be ground and ufe with nut oil no vermillion but what be make of the true native cinnabar should ever be ufe it will not glaze but be fine colour when it be glaze it be ground with linfee oil and should be ufe with drying oil carmine be the moft beautiful crimfon that can be it be middle colour between lake and vermillion be fine working colour and glaze delightfully it should be ground with nut oil and ufe with drying oil lake be tender fympathizing deep but of no frong body therefore it should be ftrengthen with indian red it be the beft glaze colour that can be ufe it be ground with linfee oil and ufe with drying oil indian red be ftrong pleafant working colour but will not glaze well and when mix with white rall little into the lead it be ground and ufe as the lake brown pink be fine glaze colour but of no ftrong body in the fleth it should never join or mix with the light becaufe this colour and white antipathize and mix of warm dirty have for which reafon they joning should be blend with cold middle teint in glaze of shadow it should he lay before the other colour that be to enrich it it be one of the finithing colour and therefore should never be ufe alone in the firtt painting it be rengthen with burnt umber and ein weaken with terraverter ground with linfee oil and ufe with drying oil burnt umber be fine warm brown and good working ftrong colour it be of great ufe in the hair and mix finely with the warm shade of the principal teiwr that be absolutely necesfary for painting fleth all which be make from the principal colour icht red teint be make of light red and white it be the a moft kind and best condition of all colour for the general ground of the fiesh with this colour and the shade teint we should make out all the flesh like claro obfcuro or mezzontinto we should alfo remember that this colour will grow darker becaufe it be ifn its nature too ftrong for the white therefore we should improve it that be mix some vermillion and white with it in proportion to the fair ness of the complexion and though it be thus mix yet shall call it the light red teint in all the courfe of the work becaufe would not have the vermillion teint confound with it as if there be no difference vermillyon teint be only vermillion and white mix to middle teint it be the moft brilliant light red that can be it agree beft with the white lightr and vellow teint carmine teint be carmine and white only mix to middle teint it be of all colour the moft beautiful red that can be for the check and lip it be one of the finithing colour and should never be use in the firft painting but lay upon the finish colour without mixing rose teint be make of the red shade and whice mix to middle degree or lighter it be one of the cleaneft and moft delicate teint that eint can be use in the flesh for clear up the heavy dirty colour and therefore in changing will fympathize and mix kindly vellow teint be often make of naple vellow and white but make it of light oker and white which be good work colour remember the oker be too ftrong for the white therefore we should make little allowance in uting it it follow the light red teint and should always be lay before the bly if we lay too much of it be may recover the ground it be lay on with the light red teint blue teint be make of ultramarine and white mix to lighrith azure it be pleafant work colour with it we should blend the gradation it follow the vellow and with they it make the green and with the red it produce the purple no colour be of proper for blend down or foften the light into keep lead teint be make of ivory black and fine white mix to middle degree it be fine retire colour and therefore be of great ufe in the gradation and in the eye green teint be make of pruffian light oker and white this colour will dirty the light and should be lay paringly in the middle teint it be moft ufe in the red shadow where they be too ftrong it be of dirty antipathize nature shade teint be make of lake indian red black and white mix to beautiful murrey colour of middle teint this be the beft colour for the general ground of shadow for which reaf call it the shade teint it mix with the light delightfully and produce pleafant clean colour little inclined to the redith pearl as all the four colour of its composition be of friendly fympathizing nature of confe quently this will be the fame and therefore may be eafily change by the addition of any other colour red shade be nothing but lake and very little indian red it be charming work colour and good glazer it ftrengthen the shadow on the shade teint and receive when it be wet the green and blue teint agreeably it be good ground for all dark shadow warm fir ba in i warm shade be make of lake and brown pink mix to middle degree it be fine colour for ftrengthen the shadow on the shade teint when they be wet or dry we muft take care that it do not touch the light becaufe they will mix of dirty snuff colour and therefore should be foften with tender cold teint dark shade be make of ivory black and little indian red only this colour mix very kindly with the red shade and tympa thize agreeably with the middle teint in the dead colour it be it be charming glaze colour for the eyc brow and darkeft shadow of all the moft excellent shadow colour and one of the fineft working colour we have haks aasftr hpetefdpt ankeh hheeehheeeigrr first painting the colour and teint that be necesary for the firft painting of the fleth ine whice light oker—and its two teint light red —_ _____and it be two teint vermillion ___ and it be teint teint make of lake vermillion and white rofe teint blue teint lead teint green teint half fhade teint be make of indian red and white shade teint red shade warm shade the finifh pallet for fine complexion require fix more viz carmine and it be teint lake brown pink ivory black and pruffian bluc the ir pa in in firft painting or dead coldure divide into two part the firft call the firft lay or ground the second the lay on the virgin teint the firft lay of colour confift of two part the one be the work of the shadow only and the other that of the light the work of the shadow be to make out all the draw very cor rectly with the shade teint in the fame manner as if it be to be do with this colour only and remember to drive or lay the colour paringly the light should be all lay in with the light red teint in different de gree as we fee they in nature thefe two colour united produce clean tender middle teint for mixing with the shade teint they turn to pearly hue and by ftrengthen they with the lightr we may work to very good refemblance in uniting the light and shade we should ufe long softener about the size of large swan quill which will help to bring the work into character and leave the colour ing more delicate then go over the darkeft shadow with the red or warm shade which will finish the firft lay the warm shade be lay on the shade teint improve it to warmer hue but if lay inftead of the shade teint it will dirty and spoil the colour it mix with and if the red shade be lay firft inftead of the shade teint the shadow would then appear toor and bloody therefore notwithflanding thefe two colour be the beft that can be for the shadow yet they be too ftrong to be lay alone which be proof of the great ufe and merit of the shade teint fere we may obferve that the shade and light red teint be to friendly and delicate in they nature that they will not dirty though we be continually change they how proper then and agreeable to we purpofe be they for make the moft principal part of the likeness when in alter and change they always produce clean colour of the invite pearly ffue the second part of the first painting in order to finith the firft painting improve the red and vellow to the complexion and after they the bly obferve that the bly on the the red make the purple and on the vellow produce the green same fir pa in in method be to be underftand of the shadow but be fure to leave they clean and not too dark therefore allowance should be make in they grounds with the light red becaufe glaze they will make they darker when the cloth be of dark or bad colour there muft be itrong body of colour lay all over the shadow fuch as will not fink into the ground but appear warm and little lighter than the life of that it may be of the same forwardness to finish as if it have be light ground therefore the bufinet of dead colour be that we leave it always in the same order for finish though the colour of the cloth be quite the reverfe be convinced by experience that the grounds of shadow in what we call the dead colour should be fuch as will fupport the character of the finithing colour which ground muft be clean and little lighter than the finithing colour fay little lighter becaufe the finifh of shadow be glaze and no other method but glaze can leave fuch brilliancy and beauty as they ought to have for find that glaze the shadow in the firft painting be not to proper as lay body of shadow colour that be very near to the life though little lighter thefe may be glaze and touch upon when dry with great deal of eafe but if we begin the pirft painting with glaze we shall find it will ftare and be of no ofe and the folid colour which be lay on it will look heavy and dull therefore all shadow and colour that be to be glaze should be do with colour of clean folid body becaufe the glaze be more lafting and have the beft effect on fuch colour remember to leave no roughness mean fuch as will appear rough and interrupt or hurt the character of the finifh colour which by examine the work whilft it be wet with foft tool or when it be dry with knife may be avoid as it will eafily take off the knot and rougheft part the lightr and white improve be fuperior to all other colour for the firft lay or ground which should be always do with full pencil of fliff colour make brighter than the life becaufe it will fink little in drying the greater the body and quantity of colour and the stiffer it be lay the less it will fink every colour in drying will fink and partake in proportion to its body of the colour it be lay on therefore all the light of the flesh if not lay on light ground muft confe quently .. ond . be not in .. change little from the life if there be no allowance make the shade teint for the shadow should fall into the rofe teint as the com plexion grow delicate all which should be lightly united with foft long point hog tool to the light make out the whole like mezzotinto believe the great wafter very feldom sweeten or foften the co lour but in uniting the firft lay they be very careful in preferve the brightness of they colour and therefore do not work they below the complexion for to force or keep up brilliancy in the grounds can only be do with the white red and fellow which method will make up for the deficiency of the white grounds therefore the firft painting should be leave bright and bold and the let the colour be break the better we should forbear ufe any colour that will prejudice they and be content to add what be avant the next painting where if we fail clean rag will reffore the firft ground second pain tin.. the second painting begin with lay on the leave quantity that can be of poppy oil then wipe it almoft all off with dry piece of silkhandkerchief the second painting be alfo divide into two part one call the firft lay of the second painting which be fcumble the light and glaze the shadow the other finithing the complexion with the virgin teint and improve the likeness as far as we can without daub scumble be go over the light where they be to be change with the light red teint or fome other of they own colour fuch as avill always clear and improve the complexion with short fliff pencil but fuch part only as require it otherwife the beauty of the firft painting will be spoiled and we make ourfelves double work the light red teint improve be the very beft colour that can be for scumble and improve the complexion in general where the shadow and he pa in in draw be to be correct we should do it with the shade teint by drive the colour very ftiff and bare that we may the eafier rerouch and change it with the finithing teint some part of the shadow should be glaze with fome of the tranfparent shadow colour fuch as will improve and come very near to the life but be fure not to lay on too much of it for fear of lofe the hue of the firft painting the ground of which should always appear through the glaze be very careful in uniting the light and shade that they do not mix dead and meally for the more the light mix with the shade the more meally thofe shade will appear thus far the complexion be prepare and improve in order to receive the virgin teint and finifh touch the second part of the second painting be to go over the complexion with the virgin teint thefe be the colour which improve the colour to the greateft perfection both in the light and shadow this should be do in the fame manner as we lay they in the second part of the firft painting that be with the red yellow and bly blend they with delicate light touch of the tender middle teint without foften we should leave the teint and they grounds clean and diftinct and be content to leave off whilft the work be fafe and unfullied leave what be farther require for the next sitting for in attempt the finifh touch before the other be dry we lofe the spirit and draw and dirty where ever we touch ikkkkkkocrjjdiectukkkmkk the third paintinc or pin ishinc be to be fuppof the complexion now want very little more than few light touch therefore there will be no occafion for oil begin with correct all the glaze firft where the glaze ferve as ground or under part then we should determine what should be do next before we do it to that we may be able to make the alteration on the part with one stroke of the pencil by this method we preserve both can cr und the glaze and the teint but if it happen that we can not lay tuch variety of teint and finifh colour as we intend it be much better to leave off while the work be fafe and in good order becaufe thofe few touch which would endanger the beauty of the colour may eafily be do if we have patience to stay till the colour be dry and then without oil and those finishing with free light stroke of the pencil believe that rembrandt touch upon he beft picture great many time let they dry between it be this method moft certainly which give they that furprifing force and spirit which be to inimitable find it much eafier to foften the over ffrong teint when they be dry than when they be wet becaufe we may add the very colour that be want without endangering the dry work if any of the colour of the pallet want to be little change to the life when we be painting it be much better to do it with the knife on the pallet than with the pencil becaufe the knife will mix and leave it in good order for the pencil back grounds dyck make out the keeping in he back grounds more from the different opposition and harmony of the colour than from he knowledge of the claro obfcuro confess can not find in he picture that intelligence of light and shade which be to strike and beautiful in rembrandt van dyck general nethod be to be very still and mellow and to break the colour of the ground with thofe of the drapery this vill certainly produce harmony the principle of which method belong only to the art of colour but it be the knowlege of light and shade which give that furprifing force and strength which at firft sight we find in rembrandt work have feen picture of lady where he have make the ground juft light enough to thew she complexion and hair which be dark brown in the greateft perfection the ground be wall which near to the pace be lighter than the shadow of the fiesh and und the light diminish to arttully in the gradation that though the part round the head be much darker yet it appear to be of the fame colour with that near the flefh muft own like this nicthod of relieve the hlead from the ground betterthan a dyck method where he have make the ground almoft of the fame colour with the hair and though admire he way of break the colour of the ground with thote of the drapery yer be not to much pleafed where there appear too near samenet as have feen in fome of he picture where he have carry this principle to near that it be almoft imperceptibic in rembramdt picture at farmouth the light and shade be as vitible as thofe in he print and be remarkably broad clear and still the shadow be very warm and thin and look as if they be paint all at once with plenty of colour which appear tranfparent which tranfparency be do by glaze the dead colour the principal colour that be neceffary for painting of back grounds in portraiture as wall building or the like be white black indian red light and brown oker pruffian and burnt uumber from which the eight principal teint be make as follow pearl be make of black white and little indian red le ad of black and white mixt to dark lead colour vellow of brown oker and white olive of light oker pruffian and white flesi of indian red and white mixt to middle teint murrey of indian red white and little black mixt to kind of purple of middle teint stone of white umber black and indian red dark shade of black and indian red only here the lead teint ferve for the bly the fleth teint mix agree ably with the lead and the murrey be very good blend colour and of great ufe where the olive be too frong the umber white and dark shade will produce fine variety of stone colour the dark shade and umber ufe plentifully with drying oil make charming warm shadow colour all the colour should be lay with drying oil only becaufe they mix and fet the better with the softener where un the mark of the trowel be of ftrong in the priming of the cloth that one body of colour will not be fufficient to conceal it we should lay colour to prevent it which should be dry before we begin with those part that we expect to finith at once painting the method of painting back grounds divide into two part the firft part be the work of the firft lay the second be to follow on that with the finithing teint of the first lay we should always begin from the shadow side of the head and paint the light firft from they go into the gradation and shadow which should be do with large ftiffith tool very paringly with the dark shade and white little change with the colour that will give it more of the require hlue but very near in regard to tone and strength leave they like mezzotinto the dark and warm shadow should be lay before the colour that join they this we should do with the dark shade and umber drive with drying oil fay before the colour that join they becaute if thote colour be lay on firft they would interrupt and fpoil the tranf parency which be they greateft beauty the more the firft lay be drive the cafier and better we may change it with the finifh teint there fore we may lay they with the greater body the second part be to follow directly whilft the firft lay be wet with thofe teint that we think be moft proper to harmonize and finish with begin with the light firft and remember as we heighten and finish they we do it with warmer colour and let thofe be accompany with tine tender cold teint .. the lighteff part of the ground be always neareft to the fhadow side of the head this be the part which govern all the roft and should be paint with variety of light warm clear colour which vanifh and lafe they strength imperceptibly in the gradation thefe ck und should be lay with kind of cloudy touch rather than potted and we muft take care that we do not cover too much of the firft lay but confider it as the principal colour from the light we go to the gradation and shadow for when the light be well adapt to produce and fupport the head it be eafy think to fall from they into whatever kind of shadow we shall find moft pro per for we work then foften and blend the whole with long large hog tool which with the strength and body of the drying oil will melc and sweeten all together in fuch flatter manner as will seem furprife ingly finifh remember the teint will fink and lofe little of they strength and beauty in drying all the grounds as wall sc should be finish at once painting but if they want to be change we may glaze they with little of the dark shade and drying oil drive very bare on which with few light touch of the colour that be want we may improve they hue the dark shadow may alfo be ftrengthen and im prove by glaze which should be do after the figure be near finish for fear of make they too ftrong fee rembrandt grounds be rather brighter in the light and have more variety of teint than any other painter and to be fure he have obferve and juftly too that thofe teint diminish in proportion with the light therefore he shadow have but faint appearance of teint ie underftand the gradation in perfection by mixing and break the firft lay of colour of artfully that they flatter we in regard to they real strength frefnoy fay let the field or ground of the picture be pleafant free transient light and well united with colour which be of friendly nature to each other and of such mixture as that there may be something in it of every colour that compose you work as it be the contents of you pallet de pile fay variety of teint very near of the same tone employ in the same figure and often upon the same part with moderation contri bute much to harmony all the curtain should be dead coloured when we paint the ground and should be do with clean colour of near fiue to the intend curtain py in fuch as will fupport the finish colour do it with tender fort of keep and near in regard to they tone in the light but much fofter in the shadow all which should be mix and break with the colour of the ground and as fresnoy fay body that be back in the ground should be paint with colour ally to those of the ground irfelf it will often happen for want of the life or fome defign that we can not make the fold the firft painting we should then leave the maff of light and shadow in regard to the keeping of the picture broad and well united together fuch as may feem eafy to finith on the colour of the landlkip in back grounds should be break and foften alfo with thote of the part which join they this method bring they into keep which will make all the part of the ground as it be of one piece to that the different part do not ftare nor cut at they extre ilitic the sky should be break with the lead and the fleth teint the murrey teint be of great ofe in the grounds of diftant object and the umber and dark shade in the near grounds the green should be more beautiful than we int they becaufe they will fade and grow darker after all be paint we should go over the whole very lightly with the softener aswe do the grounds which will make it look agreeably finifh on ick a no dr on copy author of the anclyp of becuty have give he opinion of copy in he true spirit and genius treat with ridicule one of the moft ufeful part of painting this impute to he want of akill in this branch of the art or to moft ill grounded prejudice for be it reafonable to believe that painter who underftand the true merit of copying would treat that part of the art with contempt which the greatelt mafter have always practife and eftcem man of common senfe know that the artift in all age have copy and ftudy each other in whatever they find moft for they purpofe and for the advance nent py in of they art be it not for this the art itfelf would foon dwindle and decay and with this have not

and without be clearly con vince at sight of the picture he be go to copy of the method and principle on which it be paint it be the want of this knowlege and conviction which lead we into of many error and miltake painter that have acquire any sort of mlanner will always tincture he copying with the fame now day we be too apt to fall into manner before we underfland the nature of colour which be the cafe where fome predominant colour or hue appear in all the complexion alike for this reaton painter whofe carnation be too red will cer tainly make he copy bluth or if he colour and shadow be heavy they will of courfe fall into the obicuro by the jame rule whatever teint infect he colour the same will unavoidably taint he copying for which there be no cure becaufe he himfelf be infect

which they noble work have be to often repeat and as it be renew be to to far from deferve contempt that it ought to be encourage as thing highly ufeful and worthy of eftcem per will hr be wmr hr h hr mo tmr mor painting dr pee order to underftand the nature and different degree of colour or teint ufe in painting drapary firft determine how many di vifion be absolutely neceffary to make the firft lay of colour and after that the reffect and finish teint the right method of painting drapery or sattin in general be to make out the whole or what call the firft lay with three colour only viz the light middle teint and shade teint for the light mean the colour of all the high light the middle teint should be very near to the general hue of the sattin cec and of a exact middle degree between the high light and the shade teint the shade teint would have dark enough for the general hlue of all the shadow for which reafon call it the shade teint we should obferve that the light should rather incline to warmiffi hue and the middle teint should be make of friendly working colour tuch as will always mix of clean tender coldish flue the shade teint should be make of the fame colour as the middle teint only with less light therefore this teint will alfo mix of tender clean colour it be with thefe three colour we should make out the whole like mezzotinto and we should underfland that all the beauty and character of the fold the shape attitude and principal light and shade be all to be con sider and make with thefe three colour only which should be do to we satisfaction before we add any of the reffect or finifh teint the reffect of drapery and sattin be generally production of they own and be always lighter than the shadow on which they be find and be produce by light will confequently have light warm colour mix with the local colour that receive they here it will be neceffary pe observe the general method and secret in manage the colour of the fisil lay and thote of the retlect and finithing teint in the first lay the high light should be lay with plenty of siff colour and then ship ' and fotten ' into character with the middle teint vely correctly where the gradation of the light be llow as in the large part it will be proper to lay the middle teint firft at they extre mity with tool that will drive the colour and leave it paringly be caute the light will mix and lie the better upon it next be to make out all the part of the shadow with the shade teint drive barc after this come the middle teint which fill up and ferve as the fecond light and gradation and should be manage together very nicely to character without touch any of the high light which finith the firtt lay the reffleet and finifh teint be in general the antipathy of the firttlay they will without great care poifon and dirty the colour on which they be lay and therefore should be lay with delicate light touch without foften if it be over do we muft remember to recover it with the colour of the part on which it be lay this may be do directly or when it be dry we should alfo observe whether the retleet proceed from the fame colour or any other that the method of uting they be the tame before proceed to the particular colour it will be proper to make fome observation on they grounds it often hapen that the colour of the cloth be very improper for the ground of the drapery and when it be of we should change it with thofe colour which we think be moft proper to improve and support the sinithing colour this method of dead colour muft confequently preferve they in they greateft luftre in dead colour we should lay the light and shade in manner to as only to thew faint idea of they with regard to the shape and rounding of the figure if we have betign to work from then it will be proper to make all the large and principal part in they place which should always be do with colour that be clean and lighter than the intend drapery though in gene ist of the fame ilue and let the shadow be no darker than middle teint white sattin dr per thefe should be mix ' and break in tender manner and then foftend with large tool to that nothing rough or uneven be leave to interrupt or hurt the character of the finithing colour white sattin all white should be paint on white grounds lay with good body of colour by reafon this colour fink more into the ground than any other there be four degree of colour in the firft lay to white sattin the firft be the fine white for the light the second be the firft teint which be make of fine white and very little lvory black mix to a exact middle degree between the white and middle teint this co lour follow the white and it be with this we should shape the light into character before we lay on any other and take care that this firft teint appear diftinctly between the white and the middle teint other wife the beauty and character of the sattin will be fpoil the middle teint should be make of white black and little indian red thefe three colour be very friendly and mix to beautiful clear colour of pearly hfue which have the true brightness and warmth of the general hue of the sattin remember to allow for the red huc change little to the lead if there be occafion to make any part in the middle teint lighter we should do it with the firft teint only this colour should alfo be lay fparingly before the white in all the little light that happen in the middle teint and shadow on which we should lay the white with one light touch and be fure not to cover all the part that be make with the firft teint if we do it will spoil the character and look like spot for want of the foften edge or bor der which muft be between the white and the middle teint the shade teint should be make of the fame colour as the middle teint but with lef white to that it he dark enough for the shadow in gene ral with which we should make out all the part of the shadow nicely to character which be the work of the firft lay next sattin dr aper tes come the reffect and finish teint brown oker mix with the colour of the light be the moft ufeful colour in general for all reffect in drapery that be produce from they own colour all accidental retlex be make with the colour of the part from which they be produce and the local colour that receive they there be but two reflect teint want for drapery in general mean to any one particular colour one should be lighter than the middle teint the other darker thefe colour may be little change on the pallet with the firft and middle teint as occation require or lightly break on the part that receive they but this laft method be not to fafe as the other the teint fufficient for blend the dark shadow to the mellow tender hue be make with the shade teint and little brown oker which should be lay on very paringly with foft light touch for fear of make they dull and heavy if it should be over do we may recover it with the colour it be lay upon we often fee little blue ufe in the firft teint of white sattin van haecken who be the beft drapery painter we ever have in england do to and fometime inftead of the blue he ufe bluc black till he find it to be pernicious colour and be therefore oblige to ufe blue be caufe he middle teint which be make only of black and white be to very cold that no other colour but blue would make colder teint tet he manage thefe cold colour in all the light and middle teint to agreeably and to light and eaty be he touch that we can not help admire and may learn fomething from he though he be not folucky in he shadow which be generally of heavy dirty hue this be ow to the colour he ute and the method of uting they which will always have fuch a effect when warm or dirty colour be mix with clean light one for be mix together they will form dirty colour that muft confequently appear to in the work but if he lead or shade teint have be mix with indian red instead of the oker and then follow with few light blend touch of the oker teint it would have leave they clean and mellow it be the want of the red huc which make the white sattin appear to often like pewter bive bhie sattin drapery sit tin blue sattin be make of pruffian blue and fine whice the bett ground for blue be white for the light and black and white for the shadow the firft lay of colour for blue be divide into three degree or teint we should firtt make the middle teint of beautiful azure then mix the colour for the light about middle degree between that and white make the shade teint dark enough for the shadow in gene ral all the broad light should be lay with plenty of colour and shap ' to character with middle teint before we lay on any other colour remember the less the colour be mix the better they will appear and fland for the light of blue should be manage with as much care as thofe of white sattin next be to follow with the reft of the middle teint and then make out all the shadow the more we drive the shade teint the better it will receive the reffect and finish teint the shadow should be ftrengthen and blend with lvory black and fome of they own colour which will mix with they into tender mellow fluc the reffect be make as thofe of white sattin that be with oker and fome of the light which should be perfectly do as we intend it the shadow when dry may be little improve at once painting if there be occation to alter they with the colour they be make with the pruffian proper to be ute be that which look of the moft beautiful azure before it be ground and the fooner it be ufe after ir be ground the better it will work and appear velvet may he paint at once the method be to make out the firft lay with the middle teint and shade teint on which we should lay the high light with light touch and finith the shadow as we do thofe of the sattin but the neareft imitation of velvet we can make be do by glaze which be to prepare ground or dead colour blue with tuch colour as will when dry hear out and fupport the glaze colour in its higheft perfection the nature of the glaze colour be to be of fine trantparent quality and ufe fimply with oil only fir that whatever ground it be lay on the whole may appear diftinctly thro ' it the heft crround for blue be make with white and lvory black the whire be for the hligh light which with the middle teint and shade teint make we the firtt lay like mezzotinto remember to make the mliddle teint lighter in proportion to the glaze becaute that will make it the darker it be often neceffary to cover all but the high light with thin claz do not mean with plenty of oil in the colour but lay with let quantity than if it be to be do once only if any of it touch the light we should wipe it off with clean rag the very high light should be improve and make of fine white and leave to dry the glaze colour be pruflian ground very fine with nut oil and should be lay with large ftiffith tool that will drive the colour as occafion require it be on the laft glaze we should ftrengthen and finith the shadow the greateft fault in the colour of drapery be the painting the shadow with ftrong glaring colour which deftroy the beauty of the light this be not only the reverfe of art but of nature whofe beauty always diminifh in proportion with the light for this rea ton we should take care to blend and foften the shadow with fuch friendly colour as will agree with they local character and obfcurity here we may obterve that glaze the middle teint which be make of black and white will not produce colour to blue as if it have be prepare with prullian and white yet this colour will preferve the eeauty of the light in the higheft perfection by reafon of ii tender abteure tlue when the eluenet of the other would only diminith they this mlethed of glaze the eluc be the general rule for all clare winate we be glaze blue the light may be glaze with ultra marine though all the other part be do with pruffian this method levee great cquantity of that valuable colour and anfiver we purpote be veil as if it have all be do with ultramarinc though scarlet dr aper ie this general method of painting sattin be to make the firft lay of colour with three degree or teint yet we should underftand in ufe they that they produce two more for the mixing of two dit ferent colour together on the cloth will make another of middle teint between they so it be with the light and middle teint and with the middle and shade teint the firft antver to the firft teint in white sattin and the laft will confequently be fort of gradate or hialf shadc if the light and middle teint mix to beautirul clean colour of middle hue between both there will be no occation for colour to go between they as in the blue sattin but if in mixing they produce teint incline to dirty warm hue then there must be another find of trmpathize nature which should be lay between they in order to preferve the beauty of the light as the firft teint in the white sattin for if it be not of the red in the middle teint would certainly dirty and poil the white it be highly neceffary to underfland thefe principle of the firft lay of colour in order to have perfect knowlege of the general rule of co louring on which the principle of colour depend scarlet and crimson light vellow red make of light oker light red and white be the proper ground for scarlet the shadow be indian red and in the darkeft part mix with very little black the second painting should be little lighter than we intend the finiffi ing colour mean in proportion to the claz which will make it darker the high light be vermillion and white for sattin and velvet and vermillion for cloth the middle teint be vermillion with very little lake or indianre the shade teint be make with indian red and lake with the addition of little black in the darkeft shadow the difference between scarlet and crimfon be that the hligh light of crimfon be whiter and the middle teint be make darker they reffect be make wicli lizht draper ie pink yellow and vermillion the high light should be lay and manage in the same manner as thofe of the blue for fear of dirty they and foinctime they require to be rouch over the fecond time before we glaze they the more the colour of the second painting be drive the eafier and better they may be manage to character but the high light should have good body of colour and be leave with delicate light touch after it be well dry we should finish with glaze the whole with fine lake and improve the reffect and shadow remember that the scarlet require but very thin glaze and it be better to glaze the lrimfon twice over then lay too much at once painting pink colour there be two different method of painting pink colour one be by clize the other be do with body of colour at one painting the jame grounds do for both which should be whitith colour incline to vellow for the light and indian red lake and white for the shadow the second painting for the glaze method be do with the fame colour and little vermillion for the reffect and vermillion and white for the high light when it be dry we should glaze it with fine lake and then break and foften the shadow into character and hlar mony directly the other method be to make the high light with carmine and white the middle teint with lake white and little carmine and the shadow with lake and indian red with latle vermillion for the rehleel but remember the shadow will require to be break with fome render oblcure teint vell the ground for vellow should be yellowith white for the light and mixture of the oker for the shadow there dr apert green be the fame number of teint in the vellow as there be in the white sattin the method of ufe they be the very fame the light be make with king vellow ground with clean good drying oil the firft teint be light oker change with little of the pearl teint make with the dark shade and white which should be lay and manage as the firft teint in white sattin the middle teint be mixture of the light and brown oker foften with the pearl teint the shade teint be make with brown pink and brown oker thefe belong to the firft lay the reffect be light oker and fometime in the warmest part mix with little light red the shadow be ftrengthen with brown pink and burnt umber thefe colour well manage will produce vellow very like virn dick but if we leave out the king vellow which be the high light only then it will be one of lety favourite vellow green the proper ground for green be light yellow green which be make of light oker little white and pruffian for the light and the oker brown pink and pruffian for the shadow the fineft green we have for drapery be make of king vellow pruffian and brown pink the high light be king vellow and very little pruffian the middle teint have more pruffian and the shade teint be make with fome of the middle teint brown pink and more pruffian eur the darkeft shadow be brown pink and little prullian the light and middle teint should be manage in the fame manner as thofe of the bly the shade teint should be keep intirely from the light becaute the brown pink that be in it will in mixing dirty they as the black do thofe of the bly remember to allow for they drying little darker and that the kipg vellow should be ground with good drying oil for the longer it be dly the more it will change and grow darker and the fooner it be ufe the better it will sland it be proper to have two sort of king vellow mean one to be very light which will do beft for the high light of velvet changf colour be make with four principal teint viz the high light middle teint shade teint and reffect teint the greateft art lie in find the exact colour of the middle teint becaute it have more of the general hue of the silk than any of the other the shade teint be of the fame ffue with the middle teint though it be dark enough for the shadow the high light though often very dif terent from the middle teint should be of clean friendly working colour that will in mixing with it produce teint of clean fympa thize llue the mcthod of painting silk be to make out the fold with the shade teint and then fill they up in the light with the middle teint this be what call the firft lay which should be do to we satisfaction before we addany other colour and the hiffer the middle teint be ufe the better the high light may be lay upon it the reffect teint fallsge nerally upon the gradate half shade and should be lay with tender touch paringly for fear of fpoiling the firft lay this nicthod of painting anfwer to all the coloured silk as well as changeable with this difference only that the plain colour require not to much art in match the teint as the changeable do the laft part of the work be the finithing and ftrengthen the shadow with a obicure teint little incline to mellowith hue fuch as will not catch the eyc and interrupt the beauty of the light blace the heft ground for black be light red for the light and indian red and little black for the shadow the finithing colour be for the light black white and little takc the middle teint have lef white and more lake and black the black draper ie shade teint be make of a equal quantity of lake and brown pink with very little black the method of painting black be very different from that of other colour for as the principal thing in they be to leave they light clean and brilliant of in black it be to keep the shadow clear and tranfparent therefore we should begin with the shade teint and glaze over all the shadow with it next lay in the darkeft shadow with black and little of the shade teint very correctly after that fill up the whole breadth of light with the middle teint only all which should be do exactly to the character of the sattin cc and then finith with the high light here we may obferve the ground be red will bear out and fup port the red which be ufe in the finithing colour the lake in the light take off the cold hue and give it more beautiful colour if the shade teint be of any other colour than tranfparent warm hue the shadow would confequently be black and heavy becaufe no other colour can preferve the warm brilliancy which be want in the shadow of the black like lake and brown pink black be of cold heavy nature and always too ftrong for any other colour therefore we should make a allowance in ufe it there will be few reflect in sattin which should be add as thofe of other colour but they should be make of arong colour fuch as burnt umber or brown oker mixt with little of the shade teint though the grounds which have mention for the drapery be absolutely neceffary for the principal and neareft figure in picture fuch as fingle portrait or the like yet do not intend they to for figure which be place more into the picture such as be behind the principal of front figure they grounds should always be fainter in proportion to they local finish colour line the colour ufe in line be the fame as thofe in white sattin except the firft teint which be make of whice and ultramarine affy inftead of the black and mixt to very light blucith teint in draper ie line the dead colour we should take particular care that the grounds be lay very white and broad in the light the shadow be make with black white and little indian red like the middle teint of white sattin thefe should be leave very light and clean in order to fup port the finifh colour the second painting begin with glaze all the light with stiff pen cil and fine white only drive bare without ufe any oil the shadow may be fcumble with poppy oil and some of the colour they be make of this be the firft lay on which we be to follow with the finithing colour directly the middle teint of white sattin be the beft colour for the general hue of the shadow with this and white in different degree we should make out all the part to character with free light touch without foften then with large long point pencil and fine white lay the high light very nicely with one stroke after this come the fine light blueith teint which should be mix light and lay in the tender gradation very paringly and lightly without fill they up remember the firft lay should be leave clear and diftinet the more it appear the better it be the overmix and join all the colour toge the which fpoil the beauty of the character therefore it be better to let it dry before we add the reffect and finithing teint the method of let the beautiful clear colour dry before we add the warm reflex and harmonizing teint prevent they from mixing and dirty each other the principal blend colour ufe in the reffect be the vellow teint green teint and the rofe teint which laft be make of lake indian red and white find glaze the pearl and lead colour with white though it teem to anfwer we purpofe when it be do will cer tainly fink and be loft in the grounds on which it be lay therefore we should make the dead colour as white as we intend the finifh colour by reafon they will fink little in proportion to the colour of the cloth which the glaze with pure white only will recover land nd pe nd + ahe principal colour ufe in landichape be fine white common white fine light oker brown oker brown pink burnt umber ivory black pruffian blue ultramarine terra vert lake indian red vermillion king vellow the principal teint ufe in landichape be light oker and white light oker pruffian and white light oker and pruffian

oker vermillion lake and indian red the teint be fine azure lighter azure light oker and white vermillion and white and teint make of white little vermillion and fome of the light azure landschape should be paint on fort of tan leather colour which be make of brown oker white and lightr this colour give warmth to the shadow colour and be very agreeable and proper for glaze sketchinc or rub in the defign be the first work of the picture this should be do with burnt umber drive with drying oil and little oil of turpentine in faint flight fcumble free manner as we shade with indian ink and water leave the colour of the cloth for the light as we do that of the paper remember in do it we leave no part of the shadow to dark as we intend the firft lay or dead colour which be to be lighter than the finithing colour and though the foliage of the tree be only rub in with faint fort of scumble yet the trunk and body should be in they proper shape with they breadth of light and shadow all kind of building should be do in the same manner leave the colour of the cloth for they light the vigure on the fore ground if they be determine should alfo be sketch in the fame method and then leave to dry of dead colour let the firft lay or dead colour be without any bright glaring or ftrong dark colour to that the effect be make more to receive and pre ferve the finithing colour ithan to thew they in the firft painting the sky should be do firft then all the diftance and of work downwards to the middle croup and from that to the fore ground and reareft nd ch part remember all the part of each group as tree building or the like be all paint with the group they belong to the greateft secret in dead colour be to find the two colour which ferve for the ground of the shadow in general the sky except and the whthod of ufe they with the light the firft of which be the dark shade with little lake in it the other colour be only burnt um ber thefe should be little change to the natural hue of the object and then lay and drive with drying oil in the fame manner as we shade with indian ink which be fcumble kind of glaze and as fuch they should be leave for otherwife they will be dark and heavy and there fore would be intirely fpoil for the finifh glaze both thefe colour mix and fympathize agreeably with all the light but should be lay before they when the landfchape be defign begin with the sky which should be lay with good body of colour and leave with faint refemblance of the principal cloud and this we should do more in the manner of claro obicuro than with finish colour the whiter it be leave the better it will bear out and fupport they the diftance should be make out faint and obicurely with the dark shade and some of they light in different degree and lay of as beft to find and shew they principal part as we come more into the middle group we fall by degree into the burnt umber in the shade all the grounds of the tree should be lay or rub in enough only to leave a idea of they shape and shadow faintly the ground of they shadow muft be clean and lighter than they finithing colour fuch as will fupport they character and feem eafy to finith on in painting the light it be better to incline more to the middle teint than to the very high light and obferve to leave they with fufficient body of clean colour which will receive and preserve the finish colour the better all which may he do with few teint after this go over the whole with the sweetener very lightly which will foften and mix the colour agreeably for finish second and ch pe painting begin with the sky and lay in all the azure and colour of the hori then foften they after that lay in the general teint of the cloud and finith on it with the high light and the other teint that be want ing with light tender touch then foften the whole with the sweetener very lightly remember the finithing of the sky should be do all at once painting becaufe the tender character of the cloud will not do of well as when the whole be wer obferve that the ftiffer the azure and colour of the horizon be lay the better the cloud may be paint upon they the greateff diftance be chiefly make with the colour of the sky and as they grow nearer and darker we should glaze and fcumble the part very thin with fuch glaze shadow colour as come neareft to the general hue of the group the object be in this glaze should be underftand of darkith hue and that the firft painting or dead colour should be feen through it diftinetly on this lay or ground we should ald the finish colour now fuppoling this glaze ground be properly adapt to the object and place think then it will he cafy to find the other colour which be want for the light and finishing of the fame but in lay they we muft take great care that we do not fpoil the glaze therefore we should be very exact in make thofe colour on the pallet and then be sure to lay they with light free touch before proceed any farther it will be proper to fay fomething of the moft ufeful glaze colour lake terra vert pruffian and brown pink be the four principal the more we manage they like indian ink and the more diftinctly we leave they the better they tranfparent beauty will fland and appear pro vide we do it with good drying oil after thefe four glaze colour burnt umber be very good glaze warin brown and of great ufc in the break grounds and neareft part but the moft agreeable colour for the nd pes darkeft shadow be the dark shade improve with lake it be fine warm shade when it be drive with drying oil no colour in the world be to sweet and fympathizing it mix harmonioutly with all the light as well as the shadow and be charming colour in the trunk and body of tree and in all kind of building we should make out all the ground of the object with fuch glaze shadow colour as feem neareft to the natural hue of the object in that situation but as the principal glaze colour themfelves be often too ftrong and glaring they should therefore be little change and foften with fuch colour as be of near refemblance to themielve and the object thus if it be in the diftance the terra vert and azure which be they principal glaze colour may be improve and mad lighter with fome of the sky teint and as the diftance come nearer with the purple as we get more into the middle group the terra vert and pruffian may be change with fome of the green teint fuch as be make without white for white be the destruction of all glaze colour as we approach the firft group there be less occafion for change ing they but the fore ground and its object require all the strength and force of glaze which the colour be capable of produce after this glaze ground we should follow with firengthening the same in the shadow and darkeft place in fuch manner as will feem eaty to finith which be the firft lay of the second painting the colour that come next for finish be in the degree of middle teint thefe should be carefully lay over the greateft breadth of light in fuch manner as not to fpoil and cover too much of the glaze do it with good body of the colour as fliff as the pencil can agreeably manage to character remember the colour of the middle teint should be of clean beautiful hue accord to thefe method think it will be eafy to finith all the second painting as we work down from the sky through the middle group as we come to the firft croup where all the object should appear perfectly finish we should finith they under or moft diftant part before we paint any of the other which appear nearer obferve this method down to the laft and neareft object of the picture and where it of happen that painting one tree over another do rot and ch pe pleafe forbear the second until the firft be dry thin near tree of different colour will do better if we let the under part dry before we add the finifh colour the third and laft painting if oil be necefiary lay the leave quantity that can be which should be do with stump tool or pencil proportion to the place that be to be vile to that we may oil no more than be want then wipe the whole place that be oil with peice of silk handkerchief by this method we leave no more oil than be proper for we purpofe when we be go to finith any object we should remember to ufe great variety of teint very near of the fame colour but moft of all when we be finish tree this give richness to the colour and produce harmony find by experience the green will fade and grow larker therefore it be highly neceffary to improve and force they by cxaggerating the light and make a allowance in ufe they to much the lighter for the fame reafon we should take great care that we do not overcharge and fpoil the beauty of the glaze for if we do it will be dull and heavy and therefore will confequently grow darker the method for painting near tree be to make the firft lay very near to nature though not quite of dark but more in the degree of middle teint and follow it with firengthening the shadow then the middle teint and laft of all lay the high light and finifh colour but all this can not be do as it should be at once painting therefore the beft way be to do no more than the firft lay with the faint shadow and leave it to dry then begin with improve the middle teint and shadow and let they dry the third and laft workis add all the lightsand finifh colour in the beft manner we be able this method of leave the firft and fecond part to dry feparately not only make the whole much eafier and more agreeable but leave the colour in the greateft perfection becaufe nd ch pe moft of the work may be do with scumble and glaze and fome part without oil the light alfo may be lay with better body of colour which will not be mix and spoiled with the wet ground what have faid of tree anfwer the fame to all kind of shrub and buthe the figure in landichape be the laft work of the picture thofe in the fore ground should be do firft and thofe in the diftance next for after the figure in the firft and fartheft croup be paint think it will be much eafier to find the proportion of thofe in the middle part of the picture and we should obferve that the shadow of the figure should be of

have intermix no figure that might interrupt or divide he attention uggerassessesesesesesegse pl the ficure a order to explain the general rule of perspective let we fuppofe we lee the real object as part of garden with fome distant prospect and between they and the spectator eye let we imagine trantparent plane as clat to be place perpendicularly on the ground at the nearcht part of the object on or thro which plane we fee they repretentation and it be with the affiftance of this imaginary planc that we be to undertland the principle and be fuppof to produce the perspective projection or reprefentation the seat or line on which this plane fland be call the bafc line line iil at the ilorizon be call the iforizontal linc the ileight or diftance this line be from the bafc line be always equal to the leight of the kye of the spectator and be always draw parallel to the batc linc the tntet idtth faer tin parngon into delin scut latei per pe have diftance which we be from the imaginary plane when at the station where we propofe to take the peripective view be the diftance of the picture the point of sight be the principal point in picture it be that point where line from the spectator eye cut the imaginary plane at right angles and which always diftinguith with the letter the line be equal to the diftance of the picture and cut the horizontal line at right angles as the principal ray do the imaginary planc therefore be the eyc point becaufe it reprefent the fyc transfer from its firft pofition or point of view to the imaginary plane the next thing we be to confider be the ground plane the ground plane be that part which be below the bafe line it be the plane whereon the plan of the geometrical or original object be draw though we be oblige to have the ground plane below the baic line yet the part which be in it will be produce by the rule above it and as it be beyond it at diftance in perspective proportion as thofe in the ground plane be diftant from the bafe line we should remember that in order to reprefent any object in per spective it be neceffary that we underfland they geometrical plan eleva tion profile and section before we attempt the perspective projection in the beginning of the work we should firft draw the bafe line then affume point for the point of sight and draw the horizontal line through it make be equal to the diftance of the picture and defign the gco metrical plan of the object in the ground planc here the geometrical or original object be the point the repre fentation of which be require to be find in the imaginary plane or firtt picture pe pe draw line from the give point to cut the bafe line in any direcion at pleature as ab parallel to that draw line from the eyc point to cut the horizontal line which give the vanith point for the reprefentation of the line ab here the line os be parallel to the line ab therefore will be the vanith point draw the line bs and a the interfection of which be the reprefentation fight the line ba be alfo the reprefentation of its original ba we may find the reprefentation of the seat or place where the pine tree grow without ufe the original in the ground plane thus bring down the diftance 's to the horizontal line as sd and bring up ea to the bafc line as bc which make bc and sd parallel then line draw from to will cut the line bs in therefore if we fuppofe the imaginary plane to be the picture and have affume the line bs in which we fuppofe the pine tree make bc on the poctom of the picture equal to the diftance we suppofe or know the tree be beyond the imaginary plane which diftance be commonly call the require diftance then the line cd will interfect bs which give the reprefencation fight be the vanith point of the original line ab becaufe the line ab vanithe in that point the reprefentation depend on the parallelifm of the line os and a for be they parallel in any other direction they would then project the point in the very jame place now

the sfame point as may be feen by the line vh all circle and curve line figure be reprefent by find feveral point in they and then join they neatly by hand therefore we should affume in the original

point and which be alfo bring to the vanith line and ufe as thofe of the horizontal the method of find the center of vanith line be only to draw line from the point of sight to cut or interfect the vanith line at right angles which interfection will be the center of that vanish line the general rule for find the distance of vanith line be always to make the diftance of the picture from the point of sight parallel to that vanith line and to draw line from that to the center of the vanith line which will be the diftance of that vanifh line as di be to the vanish line pil or ov to that of gii to find the perspective reprefentation of circle we be oblige to make plan of the circle or part of the plan by add fuch line to it as may cafily be project and leave clear idea of the require circlc fic let be the point of sight dand the point of diftance and kl mn the scheme of the plan the per pec have moft exact and cafieft method be to inclofe the circle with square and then make the two diameter and diagonal which give the eight require point but inflead of draw line thro the point of the diagonal parallel to the side of the square make they parallel to the diagonal this method give the fame point with the line nearer to the circle than can be draw by any other method whatfoever the reft of the figure need no demonftration frc shew the method of make the plan of the circle in order to find the perspective reprefentation of the torus which have do accord to my method juft thewn of draw circle and which may be underftand very eafily at sight of this figure the perspective of the torus feem to be circle contain in four line which be nearer or farther diftant from each other accord to the situation of the eye two of which be perpendicular to the hori plane thefe give the greateft breadth of the torus the other two be parallel to that plane and give the height and depth the one be the upper and fartheft part of the circle the other the neareft and bottom part of the torus the two perpendicular line proceed from the ex tremity of the circle in the plan which be find from the projection of the two eight oppofite part thofe that give the height and depth be govern by the perspective section of the bafe which be in the vertical plane frc ig be the diagonal scale which be of univerfal ufe for trant ferr all sort of defign to the greateft exactness and to eaty to under tland that one demonftration be fufficient for every artift who will imagine find no manner of difficulty in apply it to practice suppofe to reprefent one foot in the defign which we be to work from and be to be the intend length of one foot in that which we be go to make the method be firft to take the dimention of the part we propofe to begin with then to place the compaff to the bafe line of the scale aid pec find what it be in the line de then open they to that in the line dc which will be the require length thus the reprefentation be find by foot and inch becaute the bafe line do contain twelve part which confequently divide the length ab and be on the line db and dc into that number by this method we may make the scale to any proportion and as it be the bufiness of every artift to find proper scale for he purpofe there fore painter be not oblige to ufe always fuch scale as the work be wring to suppofe we draw the pedeftal without ufe the method of foot and inch divide the whole height into any convenient number of equal part and let one of thofe be for the scale then divide the height we intend to make the pedeftal of in the fame manner and apply they to the method of the scale which will antver we purpofe as well it be fometime neceffary in copying to divide the original into number of square and then divide the cloth for the copy the fame if in one of the square at the corner of the cloth we make the scale accord to this method we may ufe they as we do the scale of foot and inch the number in the bafe of the scale be at we pleafure remember to make the square very large for none but novice make they otherwife fic be method which have often find to be of great ofe and very eafy to practife when we be little ufe to it suppofe the line be to be the height of any defign we have to work from and the line bb the intend height of that which we be go to make draw the bafe cb then place the defign perpendicular to it as a bb oc and draw line from through to cut the bafe which will give the center pe have the line be be divide into any number of part and we draw line from the genter cthrough they to cut the line bb then will they divide the line bb in the fame manner exactly therefore if the line ag be the axis of column and entablature the same may be transfer to the height we would have it by have fmall nail in the center and fine thread fuch as the wig maker weave with and only strain the fame over the part in a to bb which will give the require dimenfion in the fame manner we may have all the breadth by apply they to the line be and continue they to the line bb or if it be only few of they as the diameter they may be do feparately but remem ber that after the place of the line ag and bbare fix they muft con tinue of till the whole be finish the antique figure in the fixth plate mark with the letter be a object have study with great application and care in order to project it exactly accord to the rule of perspective and as improve in the knowlege of the new principle flatter myfelf should fucceed believe if larrive at fuch perfection in the art should then be able in time to reprefent all object whatfoever as fome of the learn in the mathematick will have it accord to the pricteff rule who dogma tically affert that every part of the perspective should be mathematically true when we fancy this to be really the cafe it be reafonable to believe that we should be anxious to learn a art which we think of abfolutely necef fary now gentle reader muft confel my weakness and tell you that notwithftanding all my care and puzzling after this mathematical truch find the uundertaking be too great for my capacity and therefore from the experience of my folly determine to give up the attempt and flatter myfelf no farther with fuch expectation but whenever the rule which have shew should fail and grow tedious which believe will not happen in matter of confequence defign immediately to fettle the affair at sight of the object the er volute in the capital of column and the twift in stair cafe be object of this nature and very probably be take from this a tique it have alfo great refemblance to nr hegarth precise serpentine line and therefore without doubt have fome grace though the twift be little quicker it be a object of well varied contents whofe pro portion gradually leften to its extremity and its dimenfion be govern by fitness variety oniformity simplicity intricacy and quantity what pity it be this venerable object of antiquity should not be reprefent by the rricteff rule of perspective confel this would afford matter of triumph to any learn critic that be happy enough to fucceed in the attempt in purfuance of we prefent inquiry fuppofe accord to certain chimerical new syftem the object under we confideration be imagine to have all its inward contents nicely fcoop out and the eye at once to view the whole from within and mark the oppofite corresponding part and take care to acquire perfect idea of the diftance and bearing of they feveral material point and line in the surface or for the more caty description of the projection fuppofe we be to gauge the contents with wire in order to affift and guide we to readier conception of all the intervene part leave it to the critic to judge of what ufe thefe expedient be towards raif in the imagination true and perfect idea of the antique in queftion the pamphlet intitule critical examination of the painting on the coile of the banqueting house at white hall thew that that celebrate ceiling have nine feparate point of sight and that no painting can appear perfectly true unless feen from the point intend by the painter and though picture may be perfectly true from one certain point of view it can not from any other therefore the author have take great care to thew the neceffity of regard picture as intend by the painter the picture he fay be always consider as transparent surface or medium through which the visual ray be suppose to pass if the spec tafor change bis situation those ray in nature will interfett that sur face per pec have in different point and therefore in the pitture be determine to such certain point the station of the spectator become neceffarily six and unalterable and the picture must appear falfe see otherwife suppofe we fee through window or tranfparent plane real cube place directly oppofite though fomewhat below the eye in this situation we shall fee only two face one in front and the other at top and if we move to the right or leave we muft fee one of the other face this ishis proposition which be certainly true in order to underftand the principle of perspective we be oblige to confider the picture as tranfparent plane thro which the vifual ray pat to the spectator 's eyc but when the defign be really picture whofe reprefentation be fix upon fome opaque body as board wall or paint cloth that can not be tran parent but flat fmooth surface and the object reprefent be cube that thew only two face one in front and the other at top though we move to the right or leave from the point of sight we shall never fee more by change the place nei the be it reafonable to believe we should for if we find the fame appear ance though move from the point intend by the painter the cafe be not alter which thew there be no neceffity of have the eye of the spectator exactly in that identical point if the spectator eye muft coincide with the point of sight the distance should be confider accordingly and it will then be very difficult mac ter to come at the proper point of view to fee the picture and the more of as its horizon when hang up be feldom of low as the eye own the sight of the pamphlet excite my curiofity to examine the ceiling and find the centre of the whole to be the only point of sight requifite in all that noble defign for from the middle of the room faw the intention of that great painter and be convinced of it from the order of the whole and by the natural pofition of the figure which appear all finely forefhorten and look like fuch living object view from the middle of the room below which be in my opinion the principal point of view that ruben intend for the whole ceiling iam pe . have be alfo of opinion that allceilings except thofe of gallery or long room should have but one point of sight and that there be some subject which believe require no point of sight as live object reprefent in the cloud which have no architecture nor any terreftrial appearance which be the cafe with moft of the work in this ceiling and if there be no point of sight require in the work of the picture then think there be none in regard to its be truty see becaufe the kye can not coincide with the point that never be make or intend it be not material to take notice of the moft dry and lifeless part of the performance expect mo . highmore would have give we some ingenious remark on the forefhortenings of the figure and of the excellence of the colour which prefume would have be more agreeable to he reader than tell they that ruben be little deficient in a art which be never underftand as he might have faid till this century but it be reafonable to believe if he leifure have permit he to examine the whole he would have find much to commend and very little to cenfure as it may be expect that should fay fomething of the perspective of shadow shall only observe that the geometrical or perspective know lege of shadow be of very little confequence to painter it be eafily underftand when we have learn that of the object but in my opinion painter may pare themfelves the trouble of learn the lineal perspec tive of shadow becaufe they bufiness be to fhun every thing of that nature in picture all the limit and shape of shadow should vanish every part that be hard and edgy cut and offend the eyc have now give my reader the beft infight in my power to the practice of painting and perspective hope they will excufe the size of this treatife which it have be my study from its first projection to con fine to as narrow limit as poftible be from experience convinced that a art if properly can not be too
