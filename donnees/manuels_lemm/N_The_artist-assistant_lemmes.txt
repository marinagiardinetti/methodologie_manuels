the assistant artist draw the great advantage derive from knowledge of theart of draw be universally know and acknowledge it be not only useful but absolutely necessary to those artist concerned in design draw be the basis of painting sculpture architecture engrave modelling chase carvingit offer so elegant and agreeable a amusement for the leisure hour of the man of business or the gentleman that every one who have neglect it have feel and confess its loss to enable those who may not have the assistance of skilful instructor to become master of this desirable accom plishiment we shall give plain and concise direction and point out such mode of study as we trust will render the task of acquire it pleafant and remove many impedi ment which without such assistance would retard they the material necessary for draw beblack lead peneil camel hair pencil crow quill pen red white original trom the black lead peneil should not be hold so near the point as the pen in write the use of it be for the sketch or first outline of the piece which should be draw with freedom as any erroneous stroke or line may be erase by rub the work gently with indian rubber or crumb of stale bread as the subject first propose to the student s attention will be find to influence he future practice more than may be easily imagine great care should be take that none but the work of the most eminent master be put into he hand lest the ill habit he may acquire by contrary mode of conduct should be find difficult to be remove by the strongest exertion of mature judgment every figure nay every stroke give he as pattern should be excellent in its kind that he may be early familiarize to beauty taste and symmetry fortunately for the student such example be at prefent by no means difficult to be procure the work of bartolozzi afford we the most compleat specimen of correctnef of draw and elegance of form after have for short time accustom himself to the use of the pencil he would do well to study with the most scrupulous attention the rudiment of draw engrave by that accomplissied artist from the design of cipriani aster have prepare himself by acquire the habit of copy correctly the best print he may proceed to siudy from plaister cast from which he will derive more real improvement than from copy drawing since he will by this method become acquainted with the principle of the chiaroscuro or light and shade by the magie sorce of which the painting of parrhasius be term reality and the finger of alexander in the character of jupiter the thunderer paint by the same apelles seem to fhoot forward while the lightning appear to flaffi from they in the formation of painter genius be the first and most indispensable requisite for the absence of which no human acquirement can compensate picture like poem would afford little pleasure though form accord to the strictest rule of art and finish with the most indefatigable attention be genius want to compleat the designdesign which may be say to be like the celebrate statue fafhion by prometheus lovely but lifeless unless genius like the fire which he be fabl to have steal from heaven dart its invigorate ray and give soul to the finish piece but though genius be absolutely necessary since nothing can be do without it yet it will not alone suffice like rich but uncultivated soil it will be fruitsul only in weed be not its exuberance correct by the rule of art by reflection and strict attention to nature which be the grand object of painter s meditation it ought never to be out of he sight it be the only source of beauty since nothing can be pleasing that be not natural a intimate knowledge of the beauty of the ancient will he of the greatest advantage they make nature they peculiar study and transmit to we example in sculpture which have triumphed equally over the rage of time and barbarian example which have ever be consider as form perfect rule of beauty close and servile imitation however be not what we would wishi to recommend man may find he account in attend to the manner and store up the observation of wellbreed and intelligent acquaintance without ridi culoussy affect he gait or copy he phraseology in order to acquire knowledge of the face begin with draw the feature separate place the copy at such distance as the eye may measure both it and the draw without move the head sketch in the sirst outline very light and in rub out leave faint trace of the first sketch by proceed in this manner without the assistance of rule or compass the outline should be bring to the greatest exactness and in place the feature Ã  perfect oval should be form through which perpendicular line be draw in the middle and across the centre of this diameter line from one side of the oval to the other on these all the feature of the face be to be draw accord to the follow rule for draw head the perpendicular must be divide into four equal part one from the crown of the head to the top of the forehead two from the top of the forehead to the eyebrow three from the eyebrow to the bottom of the nose four from thence to the bottom of the chin the diameter line divide into five part the breadth of the face be suppose the length of five eye this be to be understand in full front face only and these proportion be rather inconstant in different man as to length and shape but in well proportion face be nearly right and should be strictly observe when the face turn to either side then the distance be to be lessen on that side from you more or less in proportion to its turn most artist begin the draw with the nose that be the centre and then proceed to the other feature observe that the top of the ear be to rise parallel to the eyebrow the eye to be place so as to leave exuctly the length of one eye betwixt they the nostril should not project farther than the corner of the eye and the middle of the mouth snould be on the per pendicular line in order to understand better the different turning of the face it may be very advantageous to procure piece of wood make in the shape and size of a egg draw line down the middle as before direct divide this in two equal part and draw another across the centre let the feature be make as accurate as possible from the forego direction by turn this oval great variety of face will appear accord as it be ineline or turn but care must be take to observe in what manner the nose project beyond the round of the oval persect knowledge of this may enable the student to form a idea of the face better than merely copy print or picture without it but after this acquisition let the best drawing or picture be study that can be procure previous to which those paffion in manner of le brun may meritimitation the position and action of the hand be so various no perfect rule or method can be give sor draw tem time and pain should be employ in bestow care on those member for it be very necessary not only to avoid all lameness and imperfection but also to make they appear with lise and spirit the attainment of which must be acquire by application and practice carefully imitate such posture both in hand and foot as can be procure in good print or drawing line and meafure and such mechanical rule be not only perplex but reject in the practice of the best master the properest method be to lightly fketch the whole shape of the hand or foot with its position or action and examine carefully that it be correct rub out and alter it till it be so when the bend of the knuckle the vein joint and tendon may be draw with much ease after the shape and proportion be make perfect in size and attitude after proper study of the leg arm hand foot and the student have reason to deem himself sufficiently practise in draw feature the human figure entire shiould be he next attempt to measure which accord to fresnoy es the antient have commonly allow eight head though some of they have but seven but we ordinarily divide the figure into ten face that be to the artist s assistant fay from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot in the follow manner from the crown of the head to the forehead be the third part of face the face begin at the root of the lowest hair which be upon the forehead and end at the bottom of the chin the face be divide into three proportional partthe first contain the forehead the second the nose and the third the mouth and chin from the chin to the pit betwixt the collar bone be two length of nose from the pit betwixt the collar bone to the bottom of the breast one face from the bottom of the breast to the navel one face from the navel to the genitor one face from the genitor to the upper part of the knee two face the knee contain half face from the lower part of the knee to the ancle two face from the ancle to the sole of the foot half face man when he arm be stretch out be from though longest finger of he right hand to the longest of he left as broad as he be long from one side of the breast to the other two face the bone of the arm call humerus be the length of two face from the shoulder to the elbow from the end of the elbow to the root of the little finger the bone call cubitus with part of the hand contain two face from the box of the shoulder blade to the pit betwixt the collarbone one face if vou would be satisfied in the measure of breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other so that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body you must observe that the box of the elbow with the humerus and of the humerus with the shoulderblade bear the proportion of half face when the arm be stretch out the sole of the foot be the sixth part of figure the hand be the length of the face the thumb contain nose the inside of the arm from the place where the muscle disappear which make the breast call the pectoral muscle to the middle of the arm four nofe from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand five nose the longest toe be nose long to the utmost part of the teat and the pit betwixt the collarbone of woman be a equilateral triangle for the breadth of the limb no precise measure can be because the meafure themselves be changeable accord to the quality of the person and accord to the movement of the muscle in draw figure there should be slight sketch make of the whole not begin with the head and finish it then proceed to the other part method customary to many in consequence of which the head be often dispro portion or some part void of draw skesch in the whole outline of the figure lightly and measure with the eye or draw the pencil or finger over any way to determine exactness without the rule or compass in begin the sketch the head be the first object then the shoulder in exact breadth the trunk of the body next observe with accuracy the breadth of the waist next the leg and lastly the arm and hand the principal difficulty be overcome when perfect outline be procure after which the shadow claim the attention of the student every appearance of body represent animate or inanimate in distance shape substance and distinction be perfect by this let they be first make broad and massy without attend to the many little distract part which sall under second consideration in draw after plaister figure the eye will easily discover the general light and shadethe maf of light should be keep broad and be well attend to before the smaller part be divide the outline should be exceedingly faint in such part as receive the light the rise of muscle may by its appearance prove deceive and seem darker than it really be but by casting the eye to the other darker shadow true degree of its tint may be afcertain and sometimes the light may catch on the projection of bone near the mass of shadow which must be scuible very tenderly or it will have harsh unpleasing effect this may also be regulate by compare it with the stronger light observing this rule with care and exactness be the only true means of preserve the consistency of the whole together the instruction give above respect the maf of light upon the figure will regulate the student in manage the sold of the drapery which should never have the light part cut by dark sold as the effect of the whole be there by injure but this subject will be treat under the article of painting above all the young student must apply to he task with pleasure as well as with perseverance for improvement can not reasonably be expect if the mind instead of be fire with emulation gloomily contemplate the employ ment as penance nor must the patient artist be too easily satissied with he own performance he must review it and retouch it again and again he must search for its blemish with the most rigid scrutiny till by repeat effort he bring it as near to perfection as possible in word diligence in the beginning of any study will render the progress of it easy and the end delightful of the expression of the passion hrat language which above all other painter should carefully endeavour to learn and from nature herself be the language of the paffion without it the finest appear lifeless and inanimate it be not painter to be able to delineate the most exqu give they the most graceful attitude and composecem well together it be not enough to dress they nut with propriety and in the most beautiful colour ft be nÃ´t enough in fine by the powersul magie of light and inade to make the canvass vanish no he must likewise know how to cloath he figure with grief with joy with sear with anger he must in some sort write on they face what they think and what they seel he must give they life and speech it be indeed in this branch that painting truly soar and in manner rise superior to herself it be in this branch she make the spectator apprehend much more than what she express the means employ in imitate she by painting be the contour or outline chiaroscuro and colour which appear solely calculate to strike the visual faculty painting also contrive to represent hard and soft rough and smooth surface which be object of touch and this by means of certain tint and certain chiaroscuro which have disserent look in marble in the bark of tree in downy and delicate fubstance nay sne contrive to express sound and motion by means of light and shade and certain particular configuration in some landscape of diderich  we almost hear the water murmur and see it tremble along the side of the river and of the boat upon it in the battle of burgogne we be really apt to fancy that the trumpet sound and we see the horse who have throw he rider scamper along the plain but what be still more wondersul painting in virtue of she various colour and certain particular gesture express even the sentiment and most hidden affection of the soul and render she visible so as to make the eye not only touch and hear but even kindle into paffion and reason many have write and amongst the rest the famous lavater on the various change that accord to various pafsion happen in the muscle of the face which be as it be the dumb tongue of the soul they observe for example that in fit of anger the face redden the muscle of the lip puff out the eye sparkle and that on the contrary in fit of melancholy the eye grow motionless and dead the face pale and the lip sink in it be necessary principal part of he profeffion should study with care the le brun write for the pupil of the french academy charle le brun celebrate french painter bear at paris about the vear he be the son of sculptor of small celebrity at very early age he have the good fortune to gain the patronage of the chancellor seguir wno after place he for some time under the care of vouet who at that period be account the raphael of france send he to italy for three year where he allow he large pension after he return have by several considerable work establish he reputation louis xiv ennoble he honour he with the order of st. michael and make he he principal painter through the effort of le of painting will be more intelligible but it will be of infinitely more service to study they in nature itself from which they have be borrow and which exhibit they in that lively manner which neither tongue nor pen can express but if painter be to have immediate recourse to nature in any thing it be particularly in treat those very minute and almost imperceptible difference by which however thing very different from each other be often express this be particularly the case with regard to the paffion of laugh and ery as in these however contrary the muscle of the face operate nearly in the same manner brun the revenue of the academy of painting be enlarge and the institution place upon permanent foundation he also draw up project for a academy at rome to be found by the king for the use of the french student who travel there when the kinz appoint le brun he principal painter he give he also the direction of the manufacture of the gobelin which he attend with such affiduity that he make the design for every thing that be do there he die in the year most considerable of he work be he picture contain the history of alexander the great in the ceiling of the gallery of versaille and the great staircase there as the famous pietro de cortona be one day finish the face of cry child in representation of the iron age with which he be adorning the floor call the hot bath in the royal palace of pitti ferdinand il who happen to be look over he for he amusement could not sorbear express he approbation by ery out oh how well that child cry to whom the able artist say have you majesty mind to see how easy it be to make child latch behold will prove it in a instant and take up he pencil by give the contour of the mouth concave turn upwards instead of the convex downwards which it before have and with little or no alteration in any other part of the face he make the child who little before seem ready to burst he heart with cry appear in equal danger of burst its side with immoderate laughter and then by restoring the alter feature to they former position he soon set the child ery again lecture of philip baldinucci in the academy of la crasca illustrat accord to lionardo du vinci the best master that painter can have recourse to in this branch be those dumb man who have find out the method of express they sentiment by the motion of they hand eye eyebrow and in short every other part of the body this advice no doubt be very good but then such gesture must be imitate with great sobriety and moderation least they should appear too strong and exaggerate and the piece should shew nothing but pantomime when speak figure alone be to be exhibit and so become theatrical and secondhand or at least look like the copy of theatrical and secondhand nature we be tell strange thing of the antient painter of greece in regard to exprefsion especially of aristide who in picture of he represent woman wounded to death at Ã  siege with child crawl to she breast make she appear afraid least the child when sne be dead should for want of milk suck she blood medea murdering she child by timomachus be likewise much praise plionardo du vinci have perhaps one of the greatest mind the art of painting ever possess he be mathematician a engineer poet and philosopher he write on he art with the same spirit and talent with which he exercise it during he residence at milan he paint a exquisite picture of the last supper for the refectory of the dominicans not be able to find fuitable model he leave the head of christ unfinished for some time as be the head of judas for the same reason till the prior of the convent impatient to see the work compleate press he in so troublesome manner that he draw the head of the importunate sriar and place it upon the shoulder of judas he resided the latter part of hii life in france where he ably support the high reputation he have acquire by he former work the king francis visit he during he last illness in the year he rise in he bed to shew he sense of the honour confer upon he and he respect for he royal patron the exertion cause he to faint and whilst the king be support he in he arm he expire in the zith year of he age as the ingenious artist contrive to express at once in she countenance both the fury that hurry she on to the commission of so great crime and the tenderness of mother that seem to withhold she from it ruben attempt to express such double effect in the face of mary of medciis still in pain from she past labour and at the same time full of joy at the birth of dauphin and in the countenance of sancta polonia paint by tiepolo for st . anthony s church at padua one may think clearly read mixture of pain from the wound give she by the executioner and of pleasure from the prospect of paradise open to she by it few to say the truth be the example of strong expression afford by the venetian flemissi or lombard school deprive of that great happiness the happiness of be able to contemplate at leisure the work of the antient the purest fource of perfection in point of design expression and character and have nothing but nature constautly before they eye they make strength of colouring bloom complexion and the grand effect of the chiaroscuro they principal study they aim more at charming the sense than at captivate the understand the venetian in particular seem to have place they whole glory in set off they piece with all that rich variety of personage and dress which they capital be continually receive by means of its extensive commerce and which attract so much the eye of all those who visit it doubt much be in all the picture of paolo veronese paolo cagliari veronese be bear at verona in he resided chiessy at venice he be not famous for composition nor be he design correct but he drapery have peculiar richness and be admirable imitation of the different stuff of wnich they be compose he delighted to copy the rich habit of he countryman and of the inhabitant of tne east there be to be find bold and judicious exprefsion or one of those attitude which as petrarch express it speak without word unless perhaps it be that remarkable one in he marriagefeast at cana of galilee at one end of the table and directly opposite to the bridegroom whose eye be fix upon she there appear woman in red hold up to he the skirt of she garment as much as to say suppose that the wine miraculoussy produce be exactly of the colour with the stuff on she back and in fact it be red wine we see in the cup and pitcher but all this while the face and attitude of most of the company betray not the least sign of wonder at so extraordinary miracle they all in manner appear intent upon nothing but eat drink and make merry such in general be the stile of the venetian school the florentine over which michael angelot preside above all thing curious of design be most minutely and scrupu lously exact in point of anatomy on this she set she heart and take singular pleasure in displaying it not only elegance of form and nobleness of invention but which he often introduce into he picture sacrifice propriety and truth to brilliancy he have many fault but he colour and whatever depend on it be so charming that it make we forget those quality in which he fail he die of fever in he tomb and statue in braf be in tue church of st . sebastian michael angelo from he infancy snew strong inclination for painting and make so rapid progress in it that he be say at the age of to have be able to correct the drawing of he master dominico grillandai he quicknef of eye be wonderful he use to say that Ã  sculptor should carry he compass in he eye Â« the hand indeed say he ne do the work but the eye judge he be extremely disinterested for he immortal design of st. peter s church at rome he receive onsy roman crown it be sinisned in fortnight likewise strength of expression triumph in the roman school nurse as it be amongst the work of the greek and in the bosom of city which have once be the seminary of learning and politenefs here it be that domenichinor and poussin both great master of expreffion refine themselves as appear more particularly by the st . jerome of the one and the death of germanicus or the slaughter of the innocent by the other here it be that raphaelf arise the sovereign master of they all one would imagine that picture which be generally consider as the book of the ignorant and of the ignorant only he have undertake to make the instructor even of the learn one would imagine that he intend in some measure to justify quintilian who affirm that painting have more power over we than all the art of rhetorick there be not indeed single picture of raphael  from the study of which those who be curious in point of exprefsion may not reap great benefit particularly he martyrdom of st. felicitas he magdalen in the house of the pharisee he transfiguration he joseph explain this painter when young make but very slow progref in he profession he take so much pain and study so closely while in the school of the carracchis that he sellowstudent call he the ox sayin he toil as if at plow but annibal carracchi who know he better tell they that this ox by dint of labour would make the ground so fruitful that painting itself would be sed by what it produce   prophecy which have be accomplisnied since many thing may be learn from he work nichola poussin commonly call the french raphael stand at the head of the french school of painter he study in italy and spend the greatest part of he lise there he picture possess more grandeur and classic simplicity than those of any other french painter raphael sanzio  urbino boin on good friday he be the moft celebrate of the modern painter and the sounder of the roman school he die on goedfriday in the year further account of this great man will be give in the article painting to pharaoh he dream piece so highly rate by poussin he school of athen in the vatican be to all intent and purpose Ã  school of expression among the many miracle of art with which this piece abound shall single out that of the four boy attend on mathematician who stoop to the ground he compass in he hand be give they the demonstration of theorem one of the boy recollect within himself keep back with all the appear ance of profound attention to the reasoning of the master another by the brifkness of he attitude discover greater quicknef of apprehension while the third who have already seize the conclusion be endeavour to explain it to the fourth who stand motionless with open arm stare countenance and a unspeakable air of stupidity in he look will never perhaps be able to make any thing of the matter and it be probably from this very groupe that albani who study raphael so closely draw the follow precept of he that it behove painter to express more circumstance than one by every attitude and so to employ he figure that by barely see what they be actually about one may be able to guef both what they have be already do and be next go to do this be difficult precept but it be only by due observance of it the eye and the mind can be make to hang in suspense on paint piece of canva it be exprefsion that painter ambitious to soar in he profession must above all thing labour to perfect himself in it be the last goal of he art as socrate prove to parrhasius it be in expression that dumb poetry consist and what the prince of we poet call visible language albani s success in painting child and handsome female stand unrivall he be remarkably placid and live to very great age perspective perspective be the art of delineating visible object on plain surface such as they appear at give distance or height upon transparent plane place perpendicularly to the horizon between the eye and the object there be three fort of perspective viz linear Ã¦rial and specular perspective linear perspective to which most properly belong we definition and which be branch of the mathematics regards the position magnitude form of the several line or contour of object and express they diminution erial perspective which make part of the art of painting regards the colour lustre strength boldness of distant object consider as see through column of air and express the diminution thereof specular perspective represent the object in conical spherical or other mirrour erect and clear whereas on lawn and other plane they appear confused and irregular these three sort of perspective have each its particular doctrine but before we proceed in the explanation of the doctrine we must teach we pupil what be plane in perspective of which there be five fort viz perspective geometrical horizontal vertical and objective plane perspective plane be plain pellucid surface ordinarily erpendicular to the horizon and place between the spectator s eye and the object he view through which the optick ray emit from the several point of the object be suppose to paf to the eye and in they passage to leave mark that represent they on the say plane geometrical plane be plane parallel to the horizon whereon the object to be delineate be suppose to be place this plane be usually at right angles with the perspective planehorizontal plane be plane pass through the spectator s eye parallel to the horizon cut the perspective plane when that be perpendicular to the geometrical one at right angles .vertical plane be plane pass through the spectator s eye perpendicular to the geometrical one and usually parallel to the perspective lanea objective plane be any plane situate in the horizontal plane whose representation be require in perspective there be likewise several disserent line in perspective viz terrestrial line geometrical line line of the front vertical line visual line line of station objective line and line of distaneegeometrical line in perspective be right line draw in any manner on the geometrical planeterrestrial line or fundamental line be right line wherein the geometrical plane and that of the picture or draught interfect one another such be the line form by the intersection of the geometrical plane and the perspective planeline of the front be any right line parallel to the terrestrial linevertical line be the common section of the vertical and of the draught .visual line be tlie line or ray imagine to paf from the oliject to the eye .a objective line be any line draw on the geometrical plane whose representation be seek sor in draught or picturesa line of station accord to some writer be the common section of the geometrical and vertical plane other mean by it the perpendicular height of the eye above the geometrical plane whose representation be seek for in draught or picture .line of distance be Ã  right line draw from the eye to the principal point this as it be perpendicular to the perpendicular of the plane or table can only be the distance of the eye from the tabl the point of the distance in perspective be point in the horizontal line at such distance from the principal point as be that of the eye from the same there be other point befide this point of distance in perspective viz the point of fight the third point the objective point the accidental point and the visual oint which term point be use for various part or place with regard to the perspective planethe point of sight or of the eye be point on the plane mark out by Ã  right line draw from the eye perpendicular to the plane this be also call the principal point this point be in the intersection of the horizontal and vertical plane some author call it the principal point and give the name point of sight or vifion to the point wherein the eye be actually place and where all the ray terminate the third point be point take at discretion in the line of distance wherein all the diagonal draw from the division of the geometrical plane whose representation be require on the perspective planea accidental point be point in the horizontal line where line parallel to one another though not perpendicular to the picture or representation meetvisual point be point in the horizontal line wherein all the ocular ray unite thus person stand in strait long gallery and look forward the side the floor and ceiling seem to meet and touch one another in point or common centre these thing be previousty consider we shall next pass to the explanation of the different fort of perspective from point in give line to raise perpendicular see fig ii draw with the ruler the give line then set one foot of you compass in and extend they to rather more than half the length of the line sweep the arch cd and with the same extent of compass set one point in and sweep the arch ef then without alter the compass set one foot in and describe the arch hi next rule through the point cg to intersect the arch hi in and draw the line from to which be the perpendicular require another way see fig iii from the point take the equal distance and on each side of it then stretch the compass to any distance greater than or and with one foot of they in sweep the arch then with the same extent of compass set one point in sweep the arch fg and these two arch will intersect each other in the point from which line draw to the point be the perpendicular require the draw one line parallel or equidistant to another give line see fig iv extend you compass to the distance of the parallel you require then with one soot in any point of the give line as in describe the arch again without alter the compass six one foot in any other point as in and sweep the arch gh then rule the line ik touch the outward part of the two arch and that will be the parallel to the give line to bisect or divide give line ab into two equal part see fig take with you compass any distance greater than half the give line then with one soot of they in sweep the arch cc and with the fame distance set one foot in sweep the arch and these arch will intersect each other in the point gh which join by perpendi cular will intersect in the middle point upon the end ofa give line ab to raise perpendicular see fig vi place one foot of the compass in and extend they to any point without the give line then set one foot of they in cand turn the circle and and through draw the diameter can meet the circle in join and that right line be the perpendicular require to turn the circle through any three give point not in right line see fig vii fix three point at any distance you think proper as at and and join they by the right line and bc then by fig biseet the line with the line de which do biseet the line bc with the line fe and from the center where these line meet extend you compass to and describe the circle bcg to draw a oval see fig viii draw give line which divide into four equal part set one foot of the compass at and from that center describe circle with the same extent of com pass place one foot in the center and turn the circle ff then with one foot still in extend you compass and turn the arch gg and with the same extent place one foot in describe the arch hh join the intersection with perpendicular from to next place one foot of the compass in sweep the arch will and without alter they set one foot in and describe the arch mm another method for a oval see fig ix draw give line and with the compass extend place one foot in with the other turn the circle then without alter you compass on the line in the suppose point sweep the circle ff and through the point gg where the two circle intersect draw the perpendicular hi then six you compass with one foot in and extend they so as to describe the arch kk to the lower extremity of the circle then with the same extent with one foot in sweep the arch il to join the upper extremity by these example it will appear that a oval of any form or size may be construct at pleasure only take care always to fix the compass equidistant from the give line in the perpendicular hi practical example in perspective to draw square pavement in perspective see fig suppose you piece of pavement to consist of sixtyfour piece of marble each foot square you first business be to draw a ichnographical plan or ground plot of it which be thus perform have make a exact square of the size you intend you plan divide the base and horizon into eight equal part and from every division in the base to its opposite point in the horizon rule perpendicular line then divide the side into the same number rule parallel line acrof from point to point so will you pavement be divide into sixtyfour square foot because the eight foot in length multiply by the same in breadth give the number of square foot or piece of marble contain in the whole then rule diagonal from corner to corner and thus will you ground plot appear as in fig now to lay this in perspective draw another square to you intend size and divide the base line into eight equal part as before then fix you point of sight in the middle of the horizon de and from the same point rule line to every division in the base after which rule diagonal line from to and from to answerable to those in the ground plot and you square will be reduce to the triangle bc then from the point where the diagonal db intersect the line be to the opposite intersection where the diagonal cross the line cb rule parallel line which be the abridgment of the square then through the point where the diagonal crof the rest of the line which go from the base to the point of sight rule parallel line and you square pavement will be lay in perspective as in fig xi to find the height and proportion of any object as they appear above the horizon on suppose plane seec fig xii first rule you horizontal line no and fix you point of sight as at then mark the place of you nearest pillar by make dot for the base or bottom as at the artist s assistant another for the summit or top as at rule line from to the point of sight and another from bto and these two line will give the height of any number of pillar as for example suppose you would have pillar at six you dot for the base and rule from thence parallel line to meet the diagonal mat then rule the perpendicular de to the diagonal bm which perpendi cular be the height of you figure require at or if vou would place pillar at and observe the same method rule the parallelsfg and and the perpen dicular gh and kl will give they height at the distance require to find the diameter or thicknef of pillar at any particular distance you be also to be guide by that nearest the base for instance suppose you nearest pillar to be ten foot high and one foot in diameter divide it from top to bottom into ten equal part and set off one of they upon the base of the pillar then rule Ã  line srom the point of sight to the diameter and you will have the thicknef of all you pillar on they respective parallel or basis the fame rule exemplify in object below the horizon ste fig xiii below the horizon rule you horizontal line gr and six you point of sight as at then place you nearest figure or mark the dot for the head and foot by the point and which answer the same purpose and rule from these dot to the point of sight tlie line pand bp and if you would sind the height of figure to be draw at rule from thence the parallel cd to the diagonal bp and the

of prepare the various body employ by painter for produe the difference of light and shade which may be term either pigment or fluid as they be solid or aqueous and be distinguisnied in they several kind accord to the manner of work they as oilcolour watercolour enamelcolour but they variety be too numerous to be in general use most painter therefore felect set out of they and become very unjustly prejudice against those they reject it be no little impediment to they improvement in the profeffion that they be not more extensively acquainted with all the ingredient fit for they purpose oa gem those colour which become transparent in oil such as lake prussian blue and brown pink be frequently use without the admixture of white or any other opake pigment by which mean the tint of the ground on which they be lay retain in soie degree its force and the real colour produce in painting be the combine effect of both this be call glaze and the pigment endue with the property of become transparent in oil be call glaze colour as colour be obtain from various substance the means of prepare they be consequently various some be of fimple nature and require only to be purify and reduce to proper consistence or texture and other be compound of different body to be form only by complex process it be therefore very difficult to give such general direction for the make every sort of colour as may be intelligible to all the utensil to be employ as well as the method to be pursue be such as belong to different art and trade where nevertheless simple means and the use of such utensil as be generally know may be sufficient to perform what be want it be best to avoid all technical term and more complex method of operation adop such mode of instruction as may be universally intelligible we now proceed to the nature and preparation of the different colour as they follow in they class classl red colour vermillion be one of the most useful colour in every kind of painting except enamel or on glass as it be of moderate price spend to great advantage in any kind of work and stand or hold its colour extremely well it may be prepare in great perfection by the follow pro cess take of quicksilver eighteen pound of flower of sulphur six pound melt the sulphur in a earthen pot and pour in the quicksilver gradually be also gently warm and stir they well together with the small end of tobaccopipe but if from the effervescence on add the latter quantity of the quicksilver they take fire extinguish it by throw wet cloth which should be have ready over the vessel when the maf be cold powder it so that the several part may be well mix together but it be not necessary to reduce it by nicer levigation to a impalpable state have then repared a oblong glass body or sublimer by coating it well with firelute over the whole surface of the glaf and work proper rim of the same round it by class red scarlet or tend to the orange crimson or tend to the purple vermillion carmine native cinnaber lake red lead rose pink red okerscarlet oker common indian red venetian red spanis brown terra di sienna burnie which it may be hang in the furnace in such manner that one half of it may be expose to the fire fix it in proper furnance and let the powder mass be put into it so as to nearly fill the part that be within the furnace piece of broken tile be lay over the mouth of the glass sublime then the contents with as strong heat as may be use without blow the fume of the vermillion out of the mouth of the sublimer when the sublimation be over which may be perceive by the abatement of the heat towards the top of the body discontinue the fire and after the body be cold take it out of the furnace and break it collect then together all the part of the sublime cake separate carefully from they any dross that may have be leave at the bottom of the body as also any lighter substance that may have form in the neck and appear to be dosimilar to the rest levigate the more perfect part and when reduce to fine powder it will be vermillion proper for use but on the perfectnef of levigation depend in great degree the brightnef and goodness of the vermillion in order therefore to perform this it be necessary that two or three mill of different closeness should be employ and the last should be of steel and set as finely as possible it be common perhaps general for dealer to sophisticate vermillion with red lead but to detect with certainty the fraud both with respect to the general fact tand the pro ortion use the follow means take small but know quantity of vermillion suspect to be adulterate and put it into crucible have first mix with it about the same quantity in bulk of charcoal dust put the crucible into common fire have first cover it with lesser crucible invert into it and give heat sufficient to fuse lead when the crucible be take  out of the fire should be well fhake by strike it against the ground if the suspected adulteration have be practise the lead will be find reduce to its metalline state in the bottom of the cruciblÃ© and be weigh and compare with the quantity of cinnabar that be put into the crucible the proportion of the adulteration may be thence certainly know but if no lead be find in the crucible it may be safely infer that no red lead have be commixt with the vermillion native cinnabar be find naturally form in the earth though seldom so pure as to be fit for the use of painting at least without be purify by sublimation the mistaken notion that it would stand better than vermillion because it be totural production have make it to be covet by painter who be curious in colour it be however not worth they while to be solicitous about it as it never excel the beft vermillion in brightness and what be generally sell for it be pigment compound of quicksilver and sulphur red lead to minum the goodness of red lead may be see by its brightnef and mixture of any kind will make it of dull appearance it be on this account not so liable to be sophisticated as white lead or vermillion it be lead calein till it bequire proper degree of colour by exposing it with large surface to the fire scarlet oker be a ochrous earthy or rather irony substance and be the basis of green vitriol separate from the acid of the vitriol by calcination it be kind of orange scarlet colour and rival any of the native oker from its certainty of standing and extreme strength and warmth either as ground or in the shade of carnation it be useful as colour in any kind of painting the manner of its prepara tion be as follow take of green vitriol or coppera any quantity and be put into crucible of which it will sill two third set it on common fire to boil take care that it do not boil over till the matter be nearly dry when it will be greatly diminish in quantity fill then the crucible to the same height again and repeat the boiling and replenish till the crucible be sfill with dry matter take it then from this fire and put it into windfurnace or if the quantity be small it may be continue in the same fire the coal be heap up round it let the contents be calcine there till they become of red colour when cold which must be exa mine by take Ã  little of the matter out of the middle and suffer it to cool for so long as it remain hot the red colour will not appear though it be sufficiently calein when duly calcine take the oker out of the crucible while hot and put it into water in which the part of the broken crucible may be soak likewise to obtain more easily what shall adhere to they and stir oker well about in the water that all the remain vitriol may be melt out of it let it then settle and when the water appear clear pour it off and add fresni quantity take out all the broken piece of the crucible and proceed as before repeat several time this treatment with fresh quantity of water then purify the oker from any remain foulness by wash over and have bring it to proper state of dryness by draining off the fluid by filter in which the paper must be cover with line cloth lay it to dry on board indian red be substitute in place of the real kind bring from the eastindy serve equally well for common purpose give tint verge to scarlet varying from the true indian red which be greatly ineline to the purple and on account of its warm though not bright colour it be much use as well in finer as coarser painting in oil it be af ford cheap and may be thus manage take of the caput mortuum or oker leave in the iron pot after the distillation of aquafortis from nitre and vitriol two part and of the caput mortuum or colcothar leave in the long neck after the distillation of oil of vitriol one part break the lump find among they and put they into tub with good quantity of water and have let they stand for day or two frequently stir they well about lade off as much water as can be get clear from they and add fresni quantity repeating the same treatment till all the salt be wash out and the water come off nearly insipid the red powder which remain must then be wassy over and be freed from the water lay out to dry when this be design for nicer purpose it should be wash over again in bason the grof manner of lad it out of one tub into another not sit it always com pletely to such end venetian red useful to housepainter in imitate mahogany and be native red oker incline to scarlet and easily prepare by mixing it with the colcothar or caput mortuum take out of the aquafortis pot and wassy over it require no other preparation for use than to be well ground with oil unless when it be use in miniature paintingwhen it should be wasny over with the utmost care spanish brown resemble the venetian red very much in colour but be fouler it be native pigment and be use much in the same state nature produce it be dug up in several part of england no other preparation be needful than freeing it well from stone and filth and grind it with oil to ren der it fit for colourman in the preparation of cloths for picture and other coarse work calcine or burnt terra di sienna be originally yellow but when moderately calein become a orange red though not very bright it be Ã  totive oker bring hither from italy in the state in which it be naturally find it be calcine by put lump of it either in crucible or naked in common fire and conti nu it there till the colour be change from yellow to red it be exceedingly useful in oilpainting and admit of no adulteration it may be distinguishied from other ochrous earth by its semitransparency carmine be bright crimson colour of great advantage in paint ing as well in water as varnish the preparation of it be keep Ã  secret by those who prepare it in perfection and the superiority of the french carmine shew that the pro per method be want in englandthough some wrongly attribute the excellence to quality in the air and water of france there be several recipe for this colour but rather than insert imperfect instruction for a article of great consequence we choose to be silent lake the best of what be commonly sell be make from the eolour extract from scarlet rag and deposit on the cuttlebone which may be do in the follow manner take pound of the best pearlashy and have dissolve they in two quart of water purify they by filter through paper add then to this solution two more quart of water and have put in pound of carlet shred procure of the taylor which must be entirely clean boil they in pewter boiler till the shred appear to have wholly lose they scarlet colour take they out of the solution and press they well dipping they after in water and press they again that all the sluid they have imbibe may be get from they in order to be put back to the rest take then another pound of the scarlet snreds and repeat the like treatment of they in the same solution as also third and fourth pound while this be do dissolve pound and half of cuttlefishibone in pound of strong aquafortis in glaf receiver add more of the bone if it appear to produce any ebullition in the aquafortis and have strain off this solution through flannel pour it into the other by degree observe whether it produce any esservescence on put in the last quantity which ifit do in any great degree more of the cuttlefishbone must be dissolve in aquafortis and the solution very gradually add till no ebullition appear to be raise by it in the mixture if this be properly manage the fluid will soon become clear and colourless and the ting particle extract from the shred together with the cuttlefishibone will subside to the bottom and form crimson sediment which be the lake the water must then be pour off and two gallon of hard spring water must be put to the lake and well stir about to mix they this be likewise pour off after the lake have again settle to the bottom must be replace by another two gallon and the same method must be repeat four or five time but ifhard water can not be procure or the lake appear too purple half a ounce of alum should be add to each quantity of water before it be use when the lake be thus sufficiently freed from the salt it must have the water drain from it in filter cover with line cloth which have be so wear as to have no nap or down remain on its furface after the lake have be drain to proper dryness it must be drop on clean board by means of proper funnel through which the drop be suffer to paf and rest on the board at proper distance they will become small cone or pyramid in which forin the lake must be suffer to dry and the preparation be then complete rise pink the basis of this pigment be principally chalk and the ting substance extract from brasil or campeachy wood it will not stand with oil or water and be seldom employ but for the coarse work of house painter or for paper hanging unless secure from sly with varnisn when if good it may be substitute for lake it be prepared as follow take brasil wood six pound or three pound of brasil and three of peachy wood boil they a hour with three gallon of water in which quarter of pound of alum be dissolve purisy then the fluid by strain through flannel and put back the wood into the boiler with the same quantity of alum and proceed as before repeat this third time mix then the thre e quan tity of tincture together and evaporate they till only two quart of fluid remain which evaporation must be perform first in the pewter boiler and afterwards in balneo mariÃ¦e prepare in the mean time eight pound of chalk by wash over pound of alum be put into the water use for that purpose which after the chalk be wash must be pour off and supply by fresn quantity till the chalk be freed from the salt form by the alum after which it must be dry to the con sistence of stiff clay the chalk and tincture as above prepare must be then well mix together by grind and afterwards lay out to dry where neither the sun or cold air can reach it though if it can be conveniently do gentle heat may be use red oker be native earth bring chieslsy from oxsordshire and burnt afterwards by those who prepare it in large oven till by caleination it become red it be very useful as well in the more delicate as coarser painting in oil for it stand infallibly for nicer purpose it should be wash over but for other it may be use in the state in which it be find in the shop class ii of blue colour ultramarine be bright blue colour of the highest value in every kind of painting be equally serviceable in all even in enamel it have transparent effect in oil and in some degree in water and will stand without the least hazard of fly by reason of its high price prussian blue have be much introduce to the prejudice of painting in general as the sky of landfkape and many other part of modern picture shew the loss of ultramarine by they changing from warm or clear blue to faint green or olive tint the method have be continually varied by those who have attempt to prepare this pigment the follow be the best of the more modern take the lapis lazuli and break it into very small piece or rather grof powder put it into crucible and cover it securely to prevent the coal from fall amongst it calcine it then with strong fire for a hour if there be any large quantity or less time in pro portion quench it when take out of the fire in vinegar stir they well together and suffer it to reclass ii blue uitramarine indigo uitramarine affy smalt prussian blue verditer litmus or latmus cendre blue or sander blue main in that state for day or two pour off then the vinegar except what may be necessary for moistening the calein lapis lazuli in grind which operation it must then undergo in mortar of flint or glass till reduce to the greatest degree of finenef those means may effect but if it appear yet too hard to be easily ground give it another short calcination and quench it second time in vinegar the vinegar must then be wash off from the powder by the put to it several successive quanti tie of clean water each of which must be pour off when the lapis lazuli have be well stir about in they and be again settle to the bottom it must then be ground on porphyry stone with mullar till it be perfectly impalpable and then dry in which state it be duly prepare to mix with the follow cement take of burgundy pitch nine ouncesof white resin and venice turpentine six ounceof virgin wax one ounce and halfand of linseed oil one ounce and quarter mix they together by melt in pipkin over the fire and suffer they to boil till they acquire so stiff consistence that be drop into water while of this boiling heat they will not spread on the surface of it but form roundishi mass or lump the cement be thus form may be pour out of the pipkin in the water and make into cake or roll for use of this cement take a equal weight with that of the calcine lapis lazuli and melt it in glaze earthen pipkin but not so as to ren der it too fluid then add to it the calcine matter by very slow degree stir they together with a ivory spatula till the whole appear perfectly mix be thus mix heat the composition to something greater degree and cast it into large bason full of cold water when it have cool to consistence to bear such treatment knead it well like tlie dough of bread with the hand rub over with linseed oil till all the part be thoroughly incorporate with each other then make the maf into cake which may be either keep till some other convenient time in cold water or immediately pro ceed with in the follow manner put the cake into a earthen disni or bason the bottom of which should be rub with linseed oil and pour on it water of the warmth of blood let it stand quarter of a hour and as the water soften the cake it will let loose the finest part of the calcine matter which on gently stirring the water but without break the cake or sepa rate it into lesser part will be suspend in the water and must be pour off with it into another vessel the quantity of water must be then renew and the same operation repeat second or third time and as the mass appear slack in afford the colour it must be move and stir in the manner of knead with the ivory spatula but not break into fragment or small part and when so much of the colour be extract as to render it necessary for the obtain more the heat of the water must be increase to the greatest degree the quantity of the calcine matter which be now the ultramarine that be first wash off and appear of the same degree of deepness and brightness may be put together and the same of those of the second degree the last washiing make third the water be then pour off from each of these parcel put on lixivium form of two ounce of salt of tartar or pearlashy dissolve in pint of water and filter through paper can after the solution be cold this lixiviui must be put on boiling hot and the ultramarine stir well about in it and then the mixture set to cool the powder be subside the clear lixivium must be pour off and clean water put in its place which must be repeat till the whole of the salt of the lixivium be wash away the ultramarine must afterwards be dry and will be then duly prepare for use uitramarine be subject to be adulterate on account of its great price this be frequently do by precipitation of copper make by alkaline salt and be very injurious because the magistery of copper if the ultramarine sophisticated with it be use in painting either with oil or water will change it be hue and turn black and in enamel painting as soon as flux it will become green and consequently make the effect of the ultramarine vary from what be intend this fraud may be easily detect by pour some dilut spirit of nitre on small quantity which if there be any copper will soon dissolve and form greenisn blue solution ultramarine ash after the ultramarine have be extract from the lapis lazuli the residuum or remains form this pigment and when the operation of extract the colour have not succeeded well considerable share of the ultramarine be leave behind with the recrement and greatly enhance the worth of the ashy for of course the value of the latter be inferior to the former but it be still subject to adulteration which may be discover by put some of it into small quantity of spirit of nitre and if there be any copper in it it will be ting green it be prepare as follow take the cement of the ultramarine which remain after the colour be extract and mix it with four time it be weight of linseed oil let the mixture be set in glaze pipkin over the fire and when it be thus boil the fhort time put it into glass vessel sufficiently large to contain it of cylindrical figure of which vessel the diameter must be small in proportion to the length but care must be take that the matter when put into this glass be cool enough not to endanger the breaking it this glass must then be put into balneum mariae which must be make as hot as possible without boiling and keep there till the colour appear to be all subside to the bottom the oil must then be pour off till the colour appear to rise with it and the remainder with the colour in it must be put into another glass of the same kind with as much fresn oil as will rise sive or six inch above the colour this glass must be treat in the same manner as the first observe when the colour have subside the oil must be pour off and fresni quantity put in its place this have be likewise pour off the colour must then be well wasny to free it from the remain oil first in boiling water and afterwards in some of the lixivium abovemention make boiling hot also as much of the lixivium be pour off when the colour have subside as can be separated from it that way the colour must be thoroughly freed from the remainder by frequent ablution with clean water after which the water must be take off by the means above direct for the ultramarine till the matter be ofa proper degree of moisture for grind it must then be thoroughly well ground on porphyry and wash over that all the harder and insufficiently calcine part may be reduce to a impalpable powder in order to which the remain grosser part after the finer have be separate by the wash over must be again ground till the whole be perfectly fine the same means must be afterwards use to bring the afhy to dry powder that be before direct for the ultramarine prussian blue be the earth of alum combine with the six sulphur of animal or vegetable coal and may be make from almost any animal substance but it be generally make of the coal of blood only it be useful in all kind of painting save enamel and prepare to different degree of brightness and strength the common kind find in the shop and sell at very low price can be little depend upon in painting of consequence therefore it should be prepare perfect and in the true manner and then consider the high price of ultramarine and the soulness of the indigo it may be truly deem very valuable acquisition to the art of painting take of blood any quantity and evaporate it to perfect drynef of this dry blood powder take six pound and of the best pearlashy two pound mix they well together in glass or stone mortar and then put the mixt matter into large crucible or earthern pot and calcine it in furnace the top of the crucible or pot be cover with tile or other such convenient thing but not lute the calcination should be continue so long as any flame appear to issue from the matter or rather till the flame become slender and blue for if the fire be very strong small slame would arise for very long time and great part of the ting matter would be dissipate and lose when the matter have be sufficiently calcine take the vessel which con tain it out of the fire and as quickly as possible throw it into two or three gallon of water and as it soak there break it with wooden spatula that no lump may remain put it then into propertin vessel and boil it for the space of three quarter of a hour or more filter it while hot through paper in tin cullender and paf some water through the filter when it be run dry to washi out the remainder of the lixivium of the blood and pearlashy the earth remain in the silter may be then throw away in the mean time dissolve of clean alum four pound and of green vitriol or cop peras two pound in three gallon of water add this solution gradually to the silter lixivium so long as any effervescence appear to arise on the mixture but when no ebullition or ferment follow the admixture cease to put in more let the mixture then stand at rest and green powder will be precipitate from which when have thoroughly subside the clear part of the fluid must be pour off and fresh water put in its place and stir well about with the green powder and after proper time of settle this water must be pour off like the first take then of spirit of salt double the weight of the green vitriol which be contain in the quantity of solution of vitriol and alum add to the lixivium which will soon turn the green matter to blue colour and after some time add proper quantity of water and wasn the colour in the same manner as have be direct for lake and when properly wash proceed in the same manner to dry it in lump of con venient size the brightness deepness and coolness of prussian blue be proof of its goodness for with these quality it may be depend upon in standing well sophistication or any thing amiss in the process may be see by its he more foul and purple verditer be form by add due proportion of chalk to solution of copper make by refiner in precipitate the silver from the aquafortis in the operation call parting verditer be to be have at cheap rate from the refiner who be at no expence in make it but that of the chalk and labour the manner in which it may be best do by they be as follow take any quantity of chalk and have render it sufficiently sine by wash over carefully add it gradually to the solution of copper so long as any change appear to be produce by it from the ebullition excited or the due proportion may be perceive by the fluid lose its green tinge and become colourless let it then stand at rest till the sediment be subside and pour off the clear part of the fluid from the powder add in it its place clean water which must be several time renew till the salt be entirely wash out the sediment which be the verditer must be afterwards freed from the sluid by silter through paper cover with cloth and lay out in lump of middle size to dry those who desire to make verditer themselves may prepare the solution of copper by add copper filing gradually to aquafortis of any kind or put plate of copper in it and then proceed as be above direct for the refiner s solution blea de cendre or sander blue lf enquiry be make at the colour shop for this article nothing be to be find under the name but common verditer or Ã  species of it where the precipitation of the copper appear to be make in part upon starch as well as chalk it may be prepare as sollow take of the refiner solution of copper make in the precipitation of silver from the spirit of nitre or dissolve copper in spirit of nitre or aquafortis by throw in filing or put in slip of copper gradually till all effervescence cease add to it of strach finely powder the proportion of one fifth or sixth of the weight of the copper dissolve make then solution of pearl afhy and filter it and put gradually to the solution of copper as much as will precipitate the whole of the which may be know by the fluid  become clear and colourless though before highly ting with green be ni the powder which will be precipitate in the manner direct for lake and when it be so well drain of water by means of filter as to be of proper consistence grind the whole well together and lay it out to dry indigo this be formerly almost the only blue colour use in painting it be make in the spanishi westindy by means of putrefaction from certain plant and coagulation by the air it can not as far as be hitherto know be prepare in these colder climata on account of the tender nature of the lant which produce it the indigo bring from the french or we own plantation be foul and greatly inferior in brightnef to that formerly import hither from the spaniards it be equal to the prussian blue sor some purpose and there be no other preparation necessary to use it in painting except perfect levigation smalt smalt be make from glaf ground to powder and coloured with zaffer or prepare from flux to the proportion of glass one seventh part of zaffer or more or lef accord ing to the degree of deepnef require it will not work with either brushi or pencil but by strew it upon any ground of oilpaint while wet it make bright blue shine furface proper for large sundial and other such application in enamelpainting and in painting on glaf it be of great use bice at present several composition of indigo and verditer with chalk and other cheap substance be sell in this name but the true kind be smalt reduce to fine powder by levigation from its unfuitable texture it be now greatly disus or it make light warm blue colour and be formerly use in oil but more frequently in watercolour litmus or latmus water painting be the only kind in which this can be use and as it be bring from holland at very cheap rate it be almost needless to give the preparation but if any be desirous for curiosity to know the process it be form from archal species of mof bring from the canary and cape de verd island and prepare as follow add quick line and putrify urine or spirit of urine distilled from lime to the archal previoussy bruise by grind this mixture must be susfer to stand till it acquire very blue colour after which the fluid must be suffer to evaporate and the remain maf when it be of the consistence of paste must be lay on board to dry in square lump if it be use in miniature painting care must be take of the approach of acid sor that change it instantly from blue to red though it will stand if no such accident in tervene class iil of yellow colour king  yellow when prepare well which must be do by mixing sulphur and arsenic by sublimation be a extremely bright colour and true yellow but when mix with white lead and several other pigment its colour fly or change this defect join to its nauseous smell and the notion of its be strong poison render it unpleasing and cause it to be reject by many neverthelefs it may be use on many occasion with great advantage not only as yellow but by mixing it with blue pigment and form green king  yellow be prepare as follow ei take of arsenic powder and flower of sulphur in the proportion of twenty of the first to one of the yellow class iii common orpiment king s yellow gall stone naple yellow terra di sienna unburnt yellow oker turpeth mieral dutch pink yellow berry be ni english pink light pink turmeric washi zedoary wasn gamboge tincture of saffron fecond and have put they into Ã  sublimer sublime they in sand heat the operation be over the king s yellow will be find in the upper part of the glaf which must be carefully separate from any caput mortuum or foul part that may be find in the glaf with it it must be afterwards reduce to a equal powder by levigation yellow the neighbourhood of naple be say to produce this pigment naturally of the truth of this we be dubious but certain that it be bring from abroad it be yellow rather inelining to the orange seldom use but in oil painting where it be generally find to stand well it be brighter than other yellow at present in use except the king  yellow but if it touch iron along with the least watry moisture it will be change by it for which reason care should be take to employ a ivory spatula instead of pallet knife during the grind of it with oil which be the only preparation practise on it as it do not well bear levigation with water yellow oker the substance of this be mineral earth sound in different place of various degree of purity there be no other preparation necessary but levigation and freeing it properly from dirt and other matter it be valuable colour be true yellow that will not sly in the least and it be texture fuit it for all kind of painting notwitlistand its utility it ought to he of low price dutch pink as this colour will not bear well to be work in oil nor can be depend upon with regard to its standing it be use principally for coarser purpose in water and be sometime prepare in the same manner with starch and white lead but the follow preparation be very cheap and easy and make it to perfection take of french berry one pound and of turmeric root powder four ounce boil they in gallon of water two hour and then strain off the tincture through flannel and boil it again with a ounce of alum till it be evaporate to one quart prepare in the mean time four pound of chalk by wash it over and afterwards drying it and mix the chalk with the tincture by grinding they together and then lay out the dutch pink thus make to dry on board as it should be full gold coloured yellow and very bright any adulteration may be discover by the eyer english pink prepare this in the same manner and with the same in gredient as the dutch only increase the quantity of chalk to render it of a inferior quality it be the same only lighter and coarser light pink the only kind fit for use in oil painting be prepare in the follow manner take of french berry one pound boil they with gallon of water for a hour and have strain off acid of sugar pour on dissolution of martial vitriol produce yellow precipitate superior to dutch pink the fluid add to it two pound of pearl affy dissolve and purify by filter through paper precipitate with alum dissolve in wate by add the solution gradually so long as any ebullition shall appear to be raise in the mixture when the sediment have thoroughly subside pour off the water from it and wash it with several renew quantity of water proceeding as have be before direct in the case of the lake drain off Â« the remain fluid in filter with paper cover with line cloth and lastly dry it on board in small square piece gamboge no yellow be of greater service in water colour eafily dissolve to milky consistence from the state in which it arrive it be gum produce in the east indy and nothing but the addition of water be want to prepare it for use masticot as this be not very bright colour it be little use or it will stand persectly in oil or in water it work with the pencil better than most other pigment and certainly might be make very useful by put slake white or white lead on a earthen or stone dissi before Ã  strong fire and con tinue it there till the colour be sufficiently yellow the calcination be finish the part which be of the desire tint must be pick out from the rest and put together for with the greatest care it be difficult to caleine the whole equally grind with oil be the only preparation necessary to the use of it common orpiment it be generally disagreeable to meddle with this on account of its nauseous smell and poisonous quality be fossil body compose of arsenic and sulphur with mix ture frequently of lead and sometimes other metal in its unrefined state it be only useful to colour the matt bottom of chair or other coarse work but if purify by sublimation it become king  yellow gall stone the real kind be find in the gall bladder or like duct of beast and require nothing more than rub with water as gamboge to dissolve they to dark warm yellow but as these be not always to be procure fictitious kind of equal service may be make as follow take quart of the bile of oxen as freshi as possible put it into properpewter vessel and set it to boil in balneo mariÃ¦ have add to it quarter of a ounce of clear gum arabic evaporate the whole to about a eighth and then remove it into china cup or bason of proper size and evaporate it to dryness collect it into mass as it become of stiff consistence s terra di sienna unburnt mention have be make of this pigment be native ochrous earth bring from italy that calcination change it from yellow to red therefore those that choose to use it as yellow should take care to have it extremely well levigate as it will serve for deeper shade by many degree than any of the other oker and of superior brightness turpeth mineral this for use be much such another colour in yellow as vermillion in red and will stand equally well with that oil of vitriol and be much brighter than any other yellow use in oil except king  yellow the preparation take of pure quicksilver and oil of vitriol each six pound put they into Ã  retort to which be place in fand bath fit on receiver and distil they with strong fire while any fume appear to rise into the can receiver urging it at last with as great heat as the furnace will bear when the retort be again cold remove it out of the sand bathi and have break it take the white maf which will be find at the bottom of it and break it to grof powder and have put it in glass mortar pour water on it which will immediately convert it to yellow colour let it next be thoroughly ground in this mortar with water and afterwards wash with several successive quantity it must then be thoroughly well levigate on stone and dry the yellow wash from the french berry take pound of the french berry and put to they gallon of water with half a ounce of alum boil they a hour in pewter vessel and then filter off the sluid through paper if it be design for nicer purpose or flannel for more ordinary put they again into the boiler and evaporate the fluid till the colour appear of the strength desire or part may be take out while less strong and the rest evaporate to proper body it may be use in water as wash colour and be applicable to many material purpose as it may be make of almost any degree of deepness turmeric wash the gum make from the turmericroot dissolve in water serve for the same purpose of the yellowberrywasn but to procure bright tincture it must be dissolve in spirit of wine instead of water by the follow method take two ounce of proof spirit and add to it one ounce of water be put into proper phial add two dram of turmeric root in powder shake they well together and then let they stand three or four day reeat the shake as often as convenient and strong tincture will be thus obtain tincture of saffron it make good shade for gamboge or other light bright yellow by pour hot water on the best englisn saffron in proper phial or other vessel which should be place for some time in heat next to that which would make water boil and the tincture should then be silter from the dregs through piece of line cloth zedoary wash . take a ounce of zedoaryroot and boil it in quart of water till the water appear sufficiently ting to yellow strain it through line and it will be Ã  stronger colour than can be make of turmeric without spirit of wine and be va luable for many purpose in painting with water colour as flower yellow drapery class iv of green colour verdigrise let the pulp of grape or any such acid remain upon cop per and the rust form by its corro sive action be verdigrise it be bring from france and italy hither and make bluegreen colour in paint but will not stand in oil it should have small admixture of yellow to render it true green chrystal of verdigrise call distilled verdigrise take of the best verdigrise four ounce and of dotill vinegar two quart the verdigrise be well pound let they be put into circulate vessel that may be form of mattrafs which be round body glass with long straight neck and florence flafk which must have its neck invert into the mattrafs the thick end be break off this circulate vessel must be place in gentle sandheat or other warm situation where it must continue be frequently shake till the vinegar have dissolve as much as it can of the verdigrise remove the verdigrise and vinegar then into proper * class iv green prussian green verdigrise terra verte distilled verdigrise or chrystal of verdigrise sap green glass for decant the fluid when it shall become clear from the sediment and when it have stand due time to settle let it be carefully pour off and evaporate to about half pint which be best do with sandheat in glass body or cucurbit have its neck cut off to form wide mouth it may be set to fhoot in the same vessel or in glass receiver with wide neck and when the chrystal be form they must be take out and carefully dry in the shade fresn proportion of vinegar may be add to the remain of the verdigrise and at the same time the sirst quantity leave undissolved and the mother or fluid remain after the chrystal be form may be put into it by which mean the other part of the process be repeat second quantity of the chrystal may be ob tain chrystal make thus be of bright green colour and if use with varnishi so as to stand have fine effect but they will not hold they colour very well in oil be apt to turn black sap green be make of the juice of buckthorn berry and be very useful in water painting as wafh colour make strong and pretty deep stain it be prepare as follow take any quantity of buckthorn berry before they be ripe and press out the juice in such press as be use for make cyder or verjuice or by any other method strain this juice through slannel then let it stand to settle and when it have stand proper time decant off  the clearer part of the fluid srom the sediment put this juice into stone or earthen vessel and evaporate it till it begin to grow of thick consistence then remove it into pewter vessel and finisn the evaporation in balneo mariÃ¦ collect the matter into one maf as it acquire proper consistence prussian green this colour be much neglect and seem almost wholly lay aside or it have nearly all the use in its colour that the prussian blue have only not so bright nor will it stand so well yet it might be of advantage in many kind of painting to make it proceed in all point as in the process give for the prussian blue till the solution of alum and vitriol be mix with that of the pearlashy and sulphur of the coal and the green precipitation make then instead of add the spirit of salt omit any further mixture and go on to be ni the sediment which be the prussian green and afterwards dry it in the same manner as be directed for the blue terra verte this be suppose to be native earth bring from abroad of coarse texture require to be well levigate and wash over but no other preparation be necessary previous to its use class of purple colour the true indian red perhaps it may be no easy matter to procure this colour true for it be native ochrous earth very useful in pclais purple true indian red archal or orchal oil in its compound state as well for force in its effect as certainty of standing but the fictitious kind now fallaci oussy call by its name have no good property as purple in short it be varied into break orange and reject by most colourman and painter the true kind need no other preparation than grind or wash over archal or orchal this may be make in very easy manner by those who can not procure it of the manufacturer and be a extreme bright purple sluid but apt to dry to Ã  reddissi brown and therefore much disus at present to prepare it take a ounce of the archal weed or moss as it be sell at the drysalter and have bruise it well put it into glass phial with half pint of weak spirit of sal ammo niacus distilled with lime stop the phial close and leave the archal to infuse till strong bluish purple tincture be form class vi of brown colour brown pink among the variety of method for prepare this pigment the follow be one of the best take of french berry one pound of fustie wood in chip half pound and of pearl affy one pound boil they in tin boiler with gallon and half of water for a hour and then strain off the tincture through pclass vi brown terra japonica or japan earthbrown pink umbre bistre brown oker asphaltum spaniss juice or extract of liquorice cologn or collin s earth flannel while the sluid be boiling hot have prepare in the mean time a solution of pound and half of alum put it gradually to the tincture so long as a ebul lition shall appear proceed then to be ni the sediment as in the manner direct for the lake and be bring by filter through paper with line cloth to proper consistence dry it on board in square piece its goodness may be judge of by its transparency in every quality but that of standing which can only be know on trial bistre this colour be extremely serviceable in water if proeurgood which may be do dy the follow recipe take any quantity of soot of dry wood but let it be of beech wherever that can be procure put it into water in the proportion of two pound to gallon and boil they half a hour then after the fluid have stand some little time to settle but while yet hot pour off the clearer part from the earthy sediment at the bottom and if on stand longer it form another earthy sediment repeat the same method but this should be do only while the fluid remain hot evaporate then the sluid to dryness and what remain will be good bistre if the foot be of proper kind brown oker after procure this substance of fossil earth from the co lourmen which may be do at very low price care should be take to have it well levigate and wash over when it may be use for foul orange colour and may be depend on for stand well the get research institute the get research insttute where the foreground of water painting require to be pretty strong the cologn earth may be use to advantage it require no preparation suve grind perfectly sine with water it be of fossil substance and dark blackisn broy colour terra japonica or japan earth full brown colour be produce from this gummy substance by dissolve it with water but it will not mix well with oil it be extract from some kind of vegetable and its goodness may be distinguissied by the clearness of its colour umbre it have the quality of the other ochrous earthy substance join to that of drying better which occasion it to be much use in make drying oil japanner  gold size and the black oil lacker in painting some sew use it with wa ter but before it be fit for that purpose it should be burnt levigate and wassy over asphaltum there be a additional advantage in this colour when use in lieu of brown pink it be secure from fly and retain in drying transparent brown if it can be procured pure as it be find in the earth in asia it be certainly very useful but it be bituminous matter of consistence like tar and liable to be adulterate with turpentine and other cheap balsamic substance which fraud be noteasy to be detect unless by the mixture take off the native transparent and deep brown colour which the eye may discover spanish juice to extract liquorice the liquorice root be extract by decoction in water and then evaporate to well know consistence in mi niature painting it be at this time much use it supply the place of bistre in great measure though it be inferior but there be no trouble in procure nor process in preparing the liquorice that be ever want in england class vii of white colour white flake be bring here from italy it be use for oil or varnish painting where very clean white be rejuir and be Ã  kind of ceruss or lead corrod by acid there be great deal sell at the colour shop ready prepared that be the true kind levigate mix with starch or some such substance but ip be best to procure the white flake in lump and then levigate it and if it be think proper add any quantity of starch in the grind that may render it suitable to work with white lead be corrosion by acid from plate of lead prepare by those who be concerned in it at low price it be much pclass vii white pearl white white flake white lead troy white eggshell white calcine hartshornemploy in common purpose of painting and may be use in nicer but will require wash over and then it be little inferior to flake white notwithstanding its cheapnef it be frequently adulterate by the maker or wholesale dealer by add chalk or powder tale which may be see by compare pure piece with fuspect one as the fraud will appear by the difference of the weight but to prove it more exactly use the follow means take a ounce of the white lead suspect and mix it well with about half a ounce of pearl affy or of any fix alkaline salt and about quarter of a ounce of charcoal dust and have put they into crucible give they strong heat the lead will by this means be reduce to its metallic state and be weigh will shew by what it may fall short of the weight of a ounce the proportion of the adulteration about Ã  tenth part be allow for the corrod acid which form part of the white lead calcine to burnt hartshorn take horn or bone and burn they in any common fire till they become coal or be calein to some de gree of whitenef then have freed they carefully from any coal or filth reduce they to gross powder and put they upon vessel make in sorm of common earthen dissi of ground crucible and stourbridge clay and well dry and procure this to be place in tobaccopipemaker  or potter  furnace during the time they keep they pipe or pot in the fire the earth of the horn or bone be thus thoroughly calcine it must be very well levigate with water and it will he yet further improve by be carefully wash over this be pure white nor will change by eitlier air or time for the nicest purpose it be much use in water painting and will not turn black in the manner flake white and white lead sometimes will it be therefore preser by the more experienced painter pearl white be prepare by drying or calein oyster shell at fire and take that part of the powder that be of perfect whiteness levigate it well on stone and wash it over it be serviceable in miniature painting troy white or spanish white may be use in water colour from the follow pre paration take pound of chalk and soak it well in water then wasn over all the fine part and have pour off the first water add another quantity in which two ounce of allum be dissolve let they stand for day or two stir the chalk once in six or eight hour be ni then the chalk again over till it be render perfectly fine and pour off as much of the water as can be sepa rate from the chalk by that means take off the remainder of the dissolve allum by several renew quantity of fresn water aster the last water be pour off put the chalk into one of the cullender filter with line cloth over the paper and and when the moisture have be sufficiently drain off from it lay it out in lump to dry on proper board shell white be make of the clear shell when the inner skin be peel off levigate to powder of proper fineness and wash over it be use by some in water colour and preser to flake white class viii of black colour lamp black there be no other preparation than procure it good from burn oil in confine place and collect the soot it mix well either with oil or water and be esteemed as the principal black in all nicer kind of painting take plate chip or shaving of ivory and soak they in hot linseed oil or iffiling be to be more easily procure they may be use moisten with the hot oil put they into Ã  vessel which will bear the fire cover they with fort of lid make of clay and sand which should be dry and the crack repair besore the vessel be put into the fire procure this vessel to be place in tobaccopipe maker  or potter  furnace or any other fuch fire and let it remain there during one of they heat when it shall be take out the ivory will be burnt properly and must be asterwards thoroughly well levigate on the stone with water or it should indeed to have it perfectly good be also wash over it be not so much use as lamp black ow perhaps to its drying slowly in oil or to the frequent adulteration with charcoal dust which render it of blue cast otherwife it be if genuinely prepare from the ivory full clear black and extremely serviceable indian ink the true indian ink be import from china and be of consistence when dissolve with water extremely well adapt to the pencil it be much use in miniature painting and drawing of small kind there be fort frequently sell for it make as follow take of isinglass six ounce reduce it to size by gissolving it over the fire in double its weight of water take then of spanishi liquorice one ounce and dissolve it also in double its weight of water and grind up with it a ounce of ivory black prepare as above direct in add this mixture to the size while hot and stir the whole together till all the ingredient be thoroughly incorporate then evaporate away the water in balneo mariae and cast the remain composition into lead ed mould grease or make it up in any other form the precede be the chief of the substance there will be occasion to mention in draw and painting but crayou and enamel colour will be treat of in they place those person who be accustom to paint in oil generally purchase they colour ready prepare in bladder compleat set of which with pallette and requisite for painting may be procure at the colourshop compleat set of watercolour be also sell in box with peneil for miniature painting draw the price from eight shilling to three guinea as the oil colour prepare in bladder if they be keep long become useless and as those who be not profess artist seldom paint so much as to use they without great waste it become Ã  desideratum that some method should be find to render they more durablethis mo . blackmen have accomplish and at the same time have make they portable that they can be use with equal ease with the common watercolour cake we give the method of prepare they from vol xii of the transaction of the society for the encouragement of art manufacture and commerce method of prepare blackmans oilcolour cake take of the clearest gum mastick reduce to fine powder four ounce of spirit of turpentine one pint mix they together in bottle stir they frequently till the mastick be dissolve if it be want in haste some heat may be apply but the solution be best when make cold let the colour to be make use of be the best that can be procure take care that by wash they be bring to the greatest degree of finenef possible when the colour be dry grind they on hard close stone porphyry be the best in spirit of turpentine add small quantity of the mastick varnissi let the colour so ground become again dry then prepare the composition for form they into cake in the follow manner procure some of the purest and whitest spermaceti you can obtain melt it over gentle fire in clean earthen vessel when fluid add to it one third of its weight of pure poppy oil and stir the whole well together these thing be in readiness place the stone on which you colour be ground on frame or support and by means of charcoal fire under it make the stone warin next grind you colour sine with muller then add Ã  sufficient quan tity of the mixture of poppy oil and spermaceti work the whole together with the muller to proper consistence take then piece of fit size for the cake you intend to make roll it into ball putit into mould press it and it will be complete when these cake be to be use they must be rub down in poppy or other oil or in mixture of spirit of turpentine and oil as may best suit the convenience or intention of the artist of painting painting be the art of represent to the eye by means of figure and colour every object in nature that be discernable by the sight and of express the various emotion of the mind by a admirable effort of human genius it offer to we vision every thing which be most valuable in the universe its empire extend over every age and country it present to we the heroic deed of ancient time as well as those with which we be more conversant and distant object equally with those we daily see in this respect it may be consider as supplement to nature which give we only view of present object the painter who be distinguished for noble and profound concention who convey to the spectator the sentiment with which he be himself inspire who animate they with he genius and make last impression on they mind this artist be poet and worthy to share in the glory of homer but if he seek only to please or astonisn by the illusion of colour he must rest content with the secondary merit of flatter the eye with variety of tint or make a industrious assemblage of multiplicity of object the poet or the painter who excel in they profefsion deserve all the respect due to genius they be of the number of those man whom nature sparing of she best gift grant but occasionally to the inhabitant of the earth if they be sublime they elevate the human race if tney be agreeable only they excite those sweet sensation necessary to we happiness of the school school in the sine art denominate class of artist who have learn they art from certain master either by receive he instruction or study he work all the painter which europe have produce since the renovation of the art be class under the follow school the school of florence of rome of venice the lombard french german flemisn dutch and englisn school the school of florence be remarkable for greatnef for attitude seemingly in motion for Ã  certain dark severity for a expression of strength by which grace be perhaps exclude and for character of design approach to the gigantic it can not be deny that the production of this school although overcharge possess a ideal majesty which elevate human nature above mortality the tuscan artist satisfied with command admiration seem to have consider the art of pleasing as beneath they notice cimabue noble florentine bear in the year the first who after the destruction of the roman empire practise the art of painting which he learn from some greek workmen who be employ by the tuscan government he picture be as may be ima gine in a ordinary stile but they receive the applause of he countryman so little practise be he in he art that in he picture to prevent the possibility of mistake in the judgment of the spectator respect the subject inscription be add with sentence come out of the mouth of the person represent in they to cimabue succeed giotto he disciple who when shepherd s boy be find by he draw the figure of shieep upon stone he soon become more celebrate than he master and be account one of the founder of the florentine school from this time the number of artist encrease so rapidly that in they establish society under the protection of st . luke towards the commencement of the sisteenth century the work of the florentine possess something of grandeur life and expression and massacio be mention as the first who give force and relief to he picture but michael angelo and leonardo de vinci be the glory of the school of florence the former superior in grandeur in boldness of conception and knowledge of design the latter in all the amiable part of the art leonardo pos sess of fine imagination and full of sensibility devote himself in painting to express the affection of the soul and if in this sublime branch of the art he be afterwards surpass by raphael he have at least the glory not only of surpass all the painter who go before he but of pursue path which none of they have attempt michael angelo lef form to experience sweet affection than violent pafsion seek in nature what the strength of man might accomplisn not that which constitute beauty better acquainted with anatomy than any other artist he seem too eager to display he knowledge of it and to have forget that the muscle be less visible in child female and young man than in confirm and vigorous manhood you never perceive say meng muscle at rest and although he know admirably well how to place they they action be very frequently inconsistent with they situation he never say sir joshua reynold attempt the lesser elegance and grace of the art and if any man have right to look down upon the lower accomplishiment as beneath he attention it be certainly michael angelo artist s assistant roman school have exceed every other in beauty of form grandeur stile and just exprefsion this be to be attribute to the superior advantage they enjoy in have access to those precious remains of ancient art which rome in its prosperity draw from decline greece or which be execute in its own bosom by grecian artist this school be altogether devote to the principal part of the art to those which require genius and vast conception and be no farther occupy with colour than be necessary to establisn difference between painting and sculpture or rather between painting varied with colour and claro obscuro at the head of this school be place raphael sanzio bear at urbino in the early part of he lise he have accustom hiinself to copy nature with great exactness but without be solicitwe about the choice or perhaps ignorant that any choice be necessary when he see the work of leonardo de vinci and michael angelo they give to he genius new direction he perceive that there be something more in the art of painting than simple imitation of truth but the work of those master be not sufficient to enable he to make the best choice and he continue in uncertainty till he see at rome the work of the ancient then he perceive that in imitate they he have only to follow the natural impulse of he genius he design be admirablehe excel in represent the charact er of philosopher apostle and other figure of that kind the greek be superior to he in ideal figure but if he do not succeed in embellish nature in the same high degree he see at least and imitate she in whatever be expressive and beautiful the greek say meng sail with majesty between earth and heaven raphael walk with propriety on the earth composition be in general say the same authorl of two kind raphael  be the expressive kind the other theatrical or picturesque which consist of a agreeable disposition of the figure lanfranc be the inventor of the last and after he pietro de cortona the preference be give to raphael because reason preside over all he work or at least the greatest part of they he never allow himself in common idea nor ever susser he accessary figure to turn the attention from the principal object of the piece the excellency of raphael say sir oshua reynold lay in the propriety beauty and majesty of he character he judicious contrivance of composition correctness of draw purity of taste and the skilful accommodation of other man s conception to he own purpose the school of venice be the child of nature the venetian painter not have under they eye like the roman the remains of antiquity be destitute of the means of form just idea of the beauty of form and of expression they copy without choice the form of nature but be chiefly delighted with the beauty which present themselves in the mixture and variety of colour colour be they chief object and they endeavour by the agreement and opposition of colour and by the contrast of light and shade to produce Ã  vigorwe effect to demand and fix the attention in this they succeed dominico who be the second italian artist who paint in oil have educated before he quit venice giacomo bellino who have two son gentile and giovanni both of whom be painter the latter contribute much to the progress of he art in painting constantly in oil and after nature giorgione and titian he scholar be consider as the founder of the venetian school giorgione distinguished himself by better taste in designing than he master but he chiessy surpass hiin in colour he die in he zad year tiziano vecelli better know by the name of titian be instruct in the school of bellino to copy nature in the most servile manner but when he have see the work of giorgione he begin to study the ideal in colour the truth of history be not to be expect in hipniing or in those of the artist of the same school he paig little attention to the consistance of scene to the costume to expression adapt to the subject or finally to the accom modation of part which characterise the work of those who have study the ancient the artist of the florentine and roman school paint most commonly in watercolour or in fresco and instead of nature they finish they work from they sirst sketch titian paint in oil and finisn from the object in nature and this practice join to he exquisite talent give the greatest truth to he colour he be portrait painter be also of advantage to he as colourist in this department he be accustom to the colour of nature in carnation and drapery he be landfkape painter and here he also take the colour from nature titian have in general little expression in he picture and he sometimes introduce figure which augment the coldness of the piece for if it be true that head even in historical painting ought to be study from nature it be true also that individual nature should not be present but one general and ideal the painter fail in the effect which he ought to produce if when he represent achille hector and cÃ¦sar he personage be familiar to we observation the distinguishing characteristy of the lombard school be grace a agreeable taste for design without great correction mellowness of pencil and beautisul mixture of colour antonio allegri call corregio be the father and greatest ornament of this school he begin by imitate nature alone but as he be chiefly delighted with the graceful he be careful to purisy he designhe make he figure elegant and large and varied he outline by bequent undulation but he be not always pure and correct corregio paint in oil kind of painting susceptible of the greatest delicacy and sweetnef and as he character lead he to cultivate the agreeable he give pleasing captivate tone to all he picture he seek transparent colour to represent shade conformable to nature and adopt manner of glaze which actually render he shadow more obscure it be chiesly in this that he deserve to be imitate for he light be too clear and somewhat heavy and he fleshy part be not sufficiently transparent harmony and grace be connect together and on this account corregio be excellent also in harmony as the delicacy of he taste suffer he not to employ strong opposition he naturally become great master in this part which chiesly consist of easy gradation from one extreme to another delicate taste in colour perfect knowledge of the claro obscuro the art of uniting light to light and shade to snade together with that of detach object from the ground inimitable grave and perfect harmony be the quality which distinguished corregio from all painter and place he near the head of he profefsion the carracci lewis augustin and hannibal form what be call the second lombard school which be bequently distinguished by the name of the school of bologna lewis be the master of the other two he have study the work of titian and paolo veronese of andrea del sarto of corregio and of julio romano but he chiesly endea vour to imitate the manner of corregio hannibal sluctuate between corregio and titian augustin they rival in painting have he mind cultivate by learn and devote part of he time to poetry music and other many exercise these three painter often employ they talent upon the same work and they united labour seem to be animated with the same spirit they establish a academy at bologna call  academia degli desiderosi but it be afterwards know by the name of the academy of the carracci in this school be teach the art of construct model perspective and anatomy lesson be give on the beautiful proportion of nature on the best manner of use colour and on the principle of light and snade the academy separate on hannibal  go to rome to adorn the gallery of the cardinal farnese the work of the carraci be often from the resemblance of they manner confound together nevertheless each of they have decide character distinct from the other two lewis have less fire but more grace and grandeur augustin have more spirit in he conception and more pleasantness in he execution hannibal be characterize by boldness by design more profound by a exprefsion more lucky and by a execution more solid lodovico carracci say sir joshina reynold appear to I to approach nearest to perfection he unaffected breadth of light and shadow the simplicity of colour which hold its proper rank do not draw aside the least part of the attention from the subject and the solemn essect of that twilight which seem diffuse over hie picture appear to I to correspond with grave and dignify subject better than the more artificial brilliancy of sunshine which en lighten the picture of titian hannibal be esteem by the best judge as model for beauty and design those who blame he for become less colourist at rome than he be at bologna ought to recollect that it be he performance at rome which have chiefly secure he reputation severe critic have maintain that he design be too little vair in the figure that he excel only in male beauty and that in imitate ancient statue he excites some resemblance but without arrive at that sublimity of idea and of stile which cha racterise the ancient the success of hannibal and the reputation which he acquire have be pernicious to the art he successor delude by these consideration have make he the object of they imitation without ascend to the source from which he derive he knowledge and which they never could equal the result have be that instead of be come equal to hannibal they have often copy he imperfection the french school have varied so much under different master that it be difficult to characterise it some of its artist have be form on the florentine and lombard manner other on the roman other on the venetian and few have distinguisned themselves by manner which may be call they own in speak in general term of this school it appear to have no peculiar character and it can only be distinguishied by its aptitude to imitate easily any impression and it may be add speak still in general term that it unite in moderate degree the different part of the art without excel in any one of they it be equally dissicult to determine the progress of painting in france miniature painting and painting on glaf be early cultivate in that country and in these two kind the italian have often recourse to french artist cousin painter on glaf and portrait painter be the first who establish any kind of reputation in france he be correct but possess very little elegance of design painting for some time encourage by francis the first fall into state of languor from which it be not recover till the reign of louis xiii jaque blanchard form in the venetian school and call the french titian flourissied about this period but as he leave no pupil to perpetuate he manner he must be regard as Ã  single good artist and not as Ã  founder of the french school in the same manner poussin whom they call the raphael of france educated no pupil and form no school he stile and manner of painting be describe by sir joshua reynold as simple careful pure and correct no work of any modern have so much the air of antique painting as those of poussin he best performance have certain dryness of manner which seem perfectly correspondent to that ancient simplicity which distinguisn he stile in the latter part of he lise he change from this manner into one much soster and richer where there be greater union between the figure and the ground he favorite subject be ancient fable and no painter be ever better quali fie to paint such subject as he be eminenily fkill in the knowledge of the ceremony custom and habit of the ancient and well acquainted with the different cha racter which those who invent they give they allegorical figure poussin more admire than imitate have no manner of insluence in form the french school simon vouet have this honour because he pupil in the happy age of the art in france confer on it the greatest splendour vouet be man of distinguished ability but the school which he erect would have have no continuance if he scholar have pursue he manner of painting he have kind of grandeur and facility but he design be false with regard to colour and without any idea of exprefsion he have the merit of destroy the insipid taste which reign in france and point the way to better if vouet lay the foundation of the french school le brun finishied the edifice he have noble conception and fruitful imagination on no occasion be he inferior to the vast composition he undertake few painter have united greater number of essential quality and accessory of the art he draw well but he design be far from be so elegant as that of raphael or so pure as that of domenichino and it be less lively than that of hannibal carracci whom he have take as model in drapery he follow the roman school but in this part he be not equal to the painter of urbino he have study the expression of the affection of the soul but aft er observe the general character and establish the prin cipal trait of expression he think he have reach the whole extent of this subject which be so infinitely extend he be delighted with great composition and he give they life animation and variety but he want the vigour and inspiration of raphael he composition be found on philosophical principle but those of raphael be create le brun think well raphael poussin and le sueur think most profoundly le brun have elevation but he be not elevate like raphael to the sublime in colour le brun do not follow the painter of the venetian school the sweet attraction and strong and solid colour of the school of rome and lombardy seem rather to have be the object of he imitation and from they also he learn a easy agreeable and bold manage ment of the pencil eustach le sueur be the cotemporary and rival of le brun and no painter approach nearer to raphael in the art of drapery or in dispose the sold in the most artful and the noblest manner he design be in general more slender than that of raphael but like he it be formed on the model of the ancient like raphael he bepresent with art and precision the affection of the soul like he he varied the air of the head accord to the condition the age and the character of he personage and like he he make the different part of every figure contribute to the general effect he intention in compos ing be to express he subject not to make shine con trast or beautiful group of figure not to astonish and bewitch the spectator by the deceitsul pomp of theatrical scene or the splendour of the great machine he tone be delicate he tint harmonious and he colour though not so attractive as those of the school of venice and flander be yet engage they steal peaceably on the soul and fix it without distraction on the part of the art superior to that of colour if le sueur have live longer or if like le brun he have be employ under court fond of the art and of learn to execute the great work of the age the french school would have adopt Ã  disserent and better manner the noble heauty of he head the simple majesty of he drapery the lightness of he design the propriety of he expreffion and attitude and the simplicity of he general disposition would have form the character of this school the deceitful pomp of theatrical decoration would have be more lately introduce or perhaps would never have appear and paris might have be the counter part to rome but as le brun by a accidental concurrence of favourable circumstance be the faffiionable painter to be em ploy or rewarded it be necessary to imitate he manner and as he imitator possess not he genius he fault be come not only current but more deform the french school not long ago change its principle and if they follow the road which they have mark out for themselves they have the chance of become the most rige observer of the law impose on the greek artist the count de caylus pupil of buchardon who by he rank and fortune have the means of encourage the imitator of the ancient and of the master of the i century first sorm the design of restoring pure taste to the art of painting he be seconded by the talent of vien a artist who have only occaston to have he lesson and he example lay before he in this manner commence revolution so much the more wonderful as it be scarcely ever know that any nation substitute system of simple and rigid excellence in place of Ã  salse and glitter taste the history of all nation on the contrary discover Ã  gradual progref froin Ã  rude beginning to perfection and afterwards to a irremediable decay the french have the prospect of stop short in this ordinary course they have begin in manner which promise success and the best consequence may be expect from the study of those master piece of ancient art with which the capital the of french republic be ornament and which to the honour of the government be open to the inspection of every one it be almost needless to mention that these invaluable work be the most capital production of art which be formerly at florence rome turin naple and the city in the austrian netherlands in germany there can hardly he say to be school as it be continuation of single artist who derive they manner from different source of originality and imitation there be some german painter of eminence when the art emerge from its barbarous state first begin to be cultivate in europe as they be totally unacquainted with the ancient and have scarcely access to the work of they contemporary in italy they copy nature alone with the exception of somewhat of that stisfness which form the gothic manner but this be by no means the case with they successor part of whom be educated in flander and part in italy for if mengst or deitrich be comprehend in this school there would be nothing peculiar to its manner discover in they work it be therefore necessary to confine we observation to the more ancient german painter in whom the gothic stile be conspicuous albert durer be the first german who correct the bad taste of he countryman he excel in engrave as well as painting he genius be fertile he composition varied he thought ingenious and he colour brilliant he work though numerous be finish with great exactness but as he owed every thing to he genius and as work of inferior merit be by the salse taste of the time prefer to he it be impossible for he altogether to avoid antonio raphael meng be bear at ausig in bohemia he first patron be augustus id king of poland and he last and most generous be charle king of spain he grand work be the apotheosis of st . eusebius at rome andhis most beautiful picture that of the nativity at madrid there be Ã  great rivalsnip exist between reynold and meng who possess little original genius and be scrupuluus if not servile copyist he be coldly correct and the greater plagiary in the chamber of painter at florence be the portrait of meng and reynold by themselves strongly characterise by the dignify but sull air of the one and the universal in telligence and liberality of the other the fault of he predecessor he be blame for stiffnef and aridity in he outline sor little taste or grandeur in he expression for ignorance of the costume of Ã¦rial perspective and of gradation of colour but he have study lineal perspective architecture and fortification john holbein nearly cotemporary with albert durer paint in oil and watercolour he excel chiesly in history and in portrait painting he colour be fresni and brilliant and he work highly finishied but in he historical subject he drapery be not in so good taste as those of albert durer the flemish school be recommend to the lover of the art by the discovery or at least the first practice of oil painting it have be generally attribute to john van eyck who be accustom to varnisn he distemper picture with composition of oil which be pleasing on account of the lustre it give they in the course of he practice he come to mix he colour with oil instead of water which he find render they brilliant without the trouble of varnishing from this and subsequent experiment arise the art of painting in oil of which wonderful docovery van mand give Ã  very particular account but the truth of it be now very much question and it be even prove that this method of painting be discover long besore the time of jolin van eyck it be admit that joln and he brother eubert be the sirst who bring it into general practice by shew the excellence of which it be susceptible they own painting have acquire all over europe great reputation for the softnef and delicaey of they colour the attention of the italian painter be soon excite and antonio de massina persorm Ã  journey into flander sor the express purpose of acquire the con sidence of john van eyck and of discover the secret john of bruge be the sounder of painting as profeffion in flander peter paul ruben be the founder of the art this extraordinary person produce a immense number of work he excel equally in historical ortrait and landskape painting in fruit flower and in animal he invent and execute with the greatest facility the work of ruben be destitute of that soft inspiration productive of sweet and pleasant effect so con spicuous in the work of raphael but he possess that prightlinef of genius and strength of mind which be ever ready to burst forth in wonderful and astonishing effect he figure appear to be the exact counterpart of he conception and they creation nothing more than simple act of the will he chief merit consist in colouring though in this branch of the art he have not equal titian he be the first among painter eminent for pomp and majesty the first among those who spedk to the eye and the power of the art be often by he carry almost to enchantment ruben say sir joshiua reynold be remarkable instance of the same mind be see in all the various part of the art the whole be so much of piece that one can fcarce be bring to believe but that if any one of they have be more correct and perfect he work would not be so compleat as they appear if we should allow greater urity and correctuess of draw he want of simplicity in composition colour and drapery would appear more grof the flemisn school of which ruben be the greatest master be remarkable for great brilliancy of colour and the magie of the claro obscuro to these may be join prosound design which be yet not found on the most beautiful form composition possess of grandeur certain air of noblenef in the figure strong and natural exprefsion in short kind of national beauty which be neither copy from the ancient nor from the roman or lombard school but which deserve to please and be capable of pleasing to speak in general term and without regard great number of exception the dutch school carry none of the above quality to great perfection except that of colour far from excel in the beauty of head and form they seem to delight in the exact imitation of the lowest and most ignoble they subject be derive from the tavern the smith s shop and from the vulgar amusement of the rudest peasant the exprefsion be sufficiently mark but it be the expression of passion which debase instead of ennoble human nature it must be acknowledge at the same time that the dutch painter have succeed in several branch of the art if they have choose low object of imitation they have represent they with great exactness and truth must always please if they have not succeed in the most difficult part of the claro obscuro they at least excel in the most strike such as be in light confine in narrow space night illuminate by the moon or by torch and the light of smith s sorge the dutch understand the gradation of colour they have no rival in landskape painting consider as the faithful representation of particular scene but they be far from equal titian poussin claude lorrain who have carry to the greatest perfection the ideal landskape and whose picture instead of be the topographical representation of certain place be the combine result of every thing beautiful in they imagination or in nature the dutch distinguisn in so great estimation be some of the landskape by this master that two picture know by the name of the altiere claud from they have be long in the altiere palace at rome be lately purchase by mo . beckford for the almost incredible sum of zooo guinea themselves by they perspective by they cloud sea scene animal fruit slower and infect and they excel in miniature painting in short every thing which require faithful imitation colour and Ã  nice pencil be well execute by the dutch painter holland have also produce history painter as octavius van be and vander hilst the rival of vandyke but it be not in the work of these artist that we find the character of the dutch school neither be the origin of they style to be derive from the the work of luca of leyden though from the time he flourish viz about the end of the fifteenth century he may be consider as the patriarch of the dutch school luca paint in oil in watercolour and on glass and the kind of he painting be history landfkape and portrait if miniature painting be consider as character of the dutch school cornelius polembourg may be regard as the father of it he possess the colour delicacy of touch and disposition of the claro obscuro which chiesly distinguish this school and if any thing be to be add it be want of correctness in he design but if the choice of low figure be its chief characteristic this be to be find in the greatest perfection in the work of the celebrate rembrandt vanryn and it be the more offensive in this artist as he composition frequently require a opposite choice of figure as he father be miller near leyden he education must altogether have depend on the exertion of great talent and the study of nature he study the grotesque figure of dutch peasant or the servant of a inn with as much application as the greatest master of italy would have study the apollo of belvidere or the venus de medicis this be not the manner of elevate himself to the noble conception of raphael but it be acquire the imitation of truth in vulgar painting rembrandt say mo . descamp may be compare to the great artist for colour delicacy of touch and claro obscuro he delighted in great opposition of light and shade and he seem to be chiesly attentive to this branch of the art he workshop be occasionally make dark and he receive the light by hole which fall as he choose to direct it on the place which he desire to be enlighten he painting be Ã  kind of magie no artist know better the effect of different colour mingle together nor could better distinguisn those which do not agree from those which do he place every tone in its situation with so much exactness and harmony that he need not to mix they and so destroy what may be call the slower and fresnness of the colour such be the power of genius that rembrandt with all he fault and they be enormous be place among the greatest artist by mo . descamp who have attentively examine he work and be himself a artist john de laer miniature painter and who make choice of he subject from common life deserve Ã  distinguish place in the dutch school he paint huntscene the attack of robber public festival landikape and sea view he have correct design and employ vigorous and lively colour vanostade although bear at lubeck gerrard dow metzu miris wouverman berghem and the celebrate painter of slower van huysum belong to the dutch school the greater part of the school of which we have treat have no longer any existence italy alone have four school and there only remain at present Ã  very sew italian artist know to foreigner the school of ruben be in vain seek for in flander if the dutch school still exist it be not know beyond the precinct of holland meng german artist have render himself famous in we day but it be in italy that he chiefly improve he talent and exercise he art dietrich another german have make himself know to stranger but two solitary artist do not form school the englisn school have be form in we own time it be connect with the royal academy in london institute in but although as school it do not exist before that time yet ever since the revival of the art and the consequent encouragement give to they by the fovereign of europe england have possess portrait painter of ability and perhaps it have be ow only to the remarkable partiality of the nation for this branch of the art that the more noble one of history painting have be neglect hans holbein be rank by du pile among the german painter yet he paint he most celebrate work in england he be the first painter of eminence encourage by henry the eighth who excite by the fame which he cotemporary francis and charle have gain as pa tron of the art employ he and invite titian to england but merely as portrait painterwhether the reward offer be not think adequate to he merit or for some other cause perhaps the knowledge that he talent for historical design would be depreciate he firmly reject the overture the public work of holbein in england be four only as enumerate by mo . walpole which be rather group of portrait than history nothing could be more unsavourable to female beauty than the dress of those time holbein  man be therefore much more characteristic than he lady even he anna bulleyne be deficient in loveliness as he pourtray she in he likeness of anne of cleve he be say to have sacrifice truth to slattery yet the original which be in the possession of mo . barret of lee in kend be below mediocrity there be in he majesty s collection fery of portrait of person of quality in the reign of henry the eighth sketch upon paper with crayon probably take al single sitting they have lately be engrave by bartolozzi with all the strength and spirit of the original holbein be as celebrate in miniature as in oil colour he make great number of design for engraver sculptor and jeweller he die at he residence at whitehall in those lodging which be afterwards the paperoffice the fame of lsaac oliver who flourish about the latter end of the reign of elizabeth as miniature painter be well know he receive some instruction from bederico zucchero who be in england at that time where among other portrait he paint that of the unfortunate mary queen of scot oliver draw well and make some admirable copy from the italian master greatly as lsaac be celebrate he be afterwards exceed by he son peter who draw portrait of king

but he merit be eclip by vandyke of whom he be jealous and the civil war break out he fleed from england cornelius janson be remarkable for high finisning in he drapery many of which be black which seem to add roundness relief and spirit to he figure and carnation he be say to have use ultra marine in the black colour as well as in the carnation to which may be attribute they lustre even at this day the duke of beaufort have capital portrait of janson by himself but one of he best performance be the rushiout family at northwick in worcestershire daniel myten be popular painter in the reign of jame and charle âhe have study under ruben and be for some time principal painter to chadle but be deprive of he place when vandyke arrive in england charle however continue he pension during lise vandyke have he first instruction from vaubale of antwerp but he soon find in ruben master every way more suite to direct he genius and to ma ture that consummate taste which he very early show mark of possess under the instruction of ruben he acquire such sxill in he art that the portrait of he master s wife which he paint whilst he be yet he disciple be esteem one of the best picture in the low

drawing which he do with such still that many of they be preserve in the cabinet of collector as the original of that master about the year he go to rome to prosecute he study where he remain nearly two year and employ himself rather in make study from than copy the work of the great painter he amused himself with painting caricature particularly one of all the englisn then at rome in the disserent attitude of raphael s celebrate school of athen on he return he resided in newportstreet but shortly after remove to leicesterfield where he continue till the time of he death a ingenious critic thus delineate sir joshua s professional character sir joshua reynold be most assuredly the best portrait painter that this age have produce he possess something original in he manner which distinguished he from those painter who precede he he colour be excellent and he distribution of light and shadow so generally judicious and varied that it most clearly shew that it be not mere trick of practice but the result of principle in history painting he ability be very respectable and he invention and judgment be sufficient to have enable he to have make Ã  very distinguished figure in that very arduous branch of he profession if the exclusive taste of he country for portrait have not discourage he from cultivate Ã  talent so very unproductive and neglect he draw though incorrect have always something of grandeur in it he own picture might well be apply what he use to say respect those of ruben ee they resemble say he et wellchoose nosegay in which though the coloure be splendid and vivid they be never glaring or oppressive to the eye sir joshua be great experimentalist with respect to the composition of he colour at first he use preparation from vegetable which he relinquissied for mineral he be know to have purchase picture by titian or he scholar and to have scrape off the several layer of colour in order to ascertain it and discover he secret the englisn school of painting must acknowledge sir joshiua reynold as its great founder under royal auspices in the establishment of the academy the pure precept which he lay down in he annual oration be exempli fie in he own work he most favourite painting be garrick between tragedy and comedy the ugolino in prison in which he have imitate michael angelo in he the terribil via as it be call by augustino

englisn school they colour be less glaring than that of the flemisn or venetian master they talent be more admirable in portrait than history particularly in those of female examine say french writer picture of french woman paint by a artist of that nation and you will generally find in place of expression fore grin in which the eye and forehead do not partake and which indicate no affection of the soul examine the picture of a english woman do by one of they painter and you observe a elegant and simple expression which make you at once acquainted with the person represent perhaps it might be difficult to assign to the english school as exhibit in the royal academy any perfect discrimination as each painter either implicitly follow he own genius or attach himself to that particular manner of the foreign school which approach nearest to he own idea of excellence but there be other exhibition in which the best painter of the age have exert fuccessful competition alderman boydell  shakespeare gallery macklin  gallery of subject take from the english poet boyer s gallery of those illustrative of englisn history and fuseli  from milton all by he own pencil be very honourable testimony of the spirit of private individual in the cause of the art mo . fuseli s boundless imagination have attempt with surprising effect to embody several metaphysical idea which occur in the

the poetic style in the course of the last twenty year some of the most able artist this country ever produce have flourish and die the great landskape painter of italy have scarcely exceed the smith

last rival even claude himself mortimer who die prematurely in the freedom of he pencil and the savage air of he banditti he favourite subject approach nearly to the boldest effort of salvator rosa we rarely have meet with a artist who be not admirer of some particular school or attach to some favourite manner the difficulty they find in the practice of they art tie they down to the mechanic whilst selflove and va nity lead they into a admiratien of those stroke of the pencil which come nearest to they own of living artist we decline speak with the exception of those whose eminence as man of genius have place they beyond competition in the work of northcote opie and lawrencer we hail the continuance of a englisn school and the happy application of those classical precept which its founder sir joshiua reynold deliver with so much dignity and effect the principle of the art be exemplify in they work and genius so direct will reach degree of perfection of which the modern school painting in europe will aspire to with unsuccessful emu lation lawrence s colossal figure of satan and beelzebub from milton now the duke of norsolk  mr. kemble in coriolanus sir richard worsley  and as rolla in pizarro have gain he unanimous admiration design in painting good taste and correctness of design be so necessary that painter who want they must not hope to attract esteem design be the foundation of all the other part its elegance and correctness be no less necesary in painting than purity of language be in eloquence we be tell by pliny that all the statue before the time of daedalus be represent stiff and motionless with the foot close and arm hang in right line to they side or they have only the head finish the body arm and leg not be express these be the rude essays of design in the progref of the art and in abler hand motion be fashiioned into grace and life be heighten into character beauty of form be no longer confine to mere imitation which always fall short of the object imitate to make the copy equal in its effect it be necessary to give it a advantage over its model the artist therefore observe that nature be sparing of she perfection and that she effort be limit to part avail themselves of she inequality and draw those scatter beauty inte more happy and compleat union rose from a im perfect imitation to perfect ideal beauty we be inform that the painter of greece press in crowd to design the bosom and breast of thais nor be the elegant proportion of phryne less the object of they study by this constant contemplation of the beautisul they enrich they imagination and confirm they taste from this fund they draw they system of beauty and though we should consider they but as imitator of the part we must allow they to have be the inventor in the composition should we doubt the justice of the preference give to invent beauty over the real we need only contemplate the fine proportion and the style of draw in the laocoon and gladiator and mark the expressive energy of apollo and the elegant beauty of the venus de medicis these be the utmost effort of design it can reach no farther than full exertion of grace beauty and character the design of the ancient be distinguishied by a union of proportion fimplicity of contour and excellence of character there be no one excellence of design from which we derive such immediate pleasure as from gracefulness of action if we observe the attitude and movement of the greek statue we shall mark that careless decency and unassected grace which ever attend the motion of man unconscious of observation raphael have be wonderfully happy in imitate this simple elegance of the antique the most courtly imagination can not represent to itself a image of more win grace than be to be see in he sancta cÃ¦cilia indeed a elegant simplicity be the characteristie of he design we no where meet in he the affect contrast of michael angelo or the study attitude of guido the design of raphael be in its beginning dry but correct he enlarge it much on see the drawing of michael angelo of too just a eye to give intirely into the excess of he model he strike out middle style which however be not so happily blend as quite to throw off the inssuence of the extreme hence in the great he be apt to swell into the charge in the delicate to drop into the little he design notwithstanding be beautisul but never arrive to that persection which we discover in the greek statue he be excellent in the character of philosoplier apostle and the like but the figure of he woman have not that elegance which be distinguisned in the venus di medicis of the daughter of niobe in these he convex contour have Ã  certain heaviness by which in seek to avoid he fall into dryness still less pardonable he proportion be esteem excellent yet not have form he manner on the most beautiful antique we do not see in he that elegant symmetry that freedom in the joint which lend all they motion to the laocoon and gladiatorl instead of these the figure of michael angelo be he model in the great style whence have quit the line of nature and not have substitute ideal beauty he become too like he original as may be see in he incendio di borgo would we therefore place raphael in he true point of view we must observe he in the middle age in old man or in the nervous nature in he madonna  he know how to choose as likewise how to vary the most beautiful part of nature but he know not how to express beauty superior to the natural thus in he galatea where he have attempt character of perfect beauty he have fall short of the beauty of he madonna  the cause of this seem to be that he draw the former after he own idea which be im perfect in the latter he copy beautiful nature which be almost perfect Ã  second observation will confirm this opinion of all the object of painting angel call moft for ideal beauty and those of raphael be by no mean distinguished in this particular one of the greatest excellence of design be grace corregio in this be inimitable he constant aim be grace and happy effect of light and shade wave and varied contour be necessary to this end hence he studi oussy avoid right line and acute angles as too simple in they effect thus the habit and necessity of continually varying he outline throw he into little error in drawing which spring not from a ignorance of this branch of he art but from predilection for another and there be few who would wishi those inadvertence away accompany with the charm which give occasion to they we may affirm of hii design where it be not sacrifice to he more favorite aim that it be often masterly and always pleasing quality rarely to be meet with in those servile painter who think they have attain every persection if they keep within the rule of draw such painter say quintilian while they think it sufficient to be free from fault fall into that capital fault the want of beauty we shall close this article with a account of the apollo belvidere and the celebrate groupe of laocoon so long the pride of rome but remove to paris during its ravage by the french republican as describe by the late abbe winckleman the apollo belvidere et of all the production of art which have escape the ravage of time the statue of apollo belvedere be unquetionably the most sublime the artist found this work upon imagination and have only employ substance for the purpose of realize he idea as much as the description which homer have give of apollo be superior to those give of he by other poet in the same degree be this statue superior to any other statue of that deity its stature be above that of man and its attitude breathe majesty a eternal spring such as reign in the delightful field of elysium clothes with youth the manly charm of he body and give brilliancy to the animated structure of he limb endeavour to penetrate into the region of incorporeal beauty try to become the creator of celestial nature in order to elevate you soul to the contemplation of supernatural beauty for here there be nothing mortal neither thie vein nor sinew be too conspicuous kind of celestiai spirit animate the whole figure the god

this statue of he son the peculiar beauty of all the other god be united in this figure in the same manner as in the divine pandora the forehead be the forehead of jupiter impregnate with the goddess of wisdom he eyebrow by they movement declare they wishie he eye in they celestial orbit be the eye of the queen of the goddess and the mouth be that which inspire the beautiful bacchus with voluptuousness like the tender branch of the vine he sine hair play about as if they be slightly ruffle by the breath of zephyr they seem erfume with celestial essence and negligently tie by the hand

the former draw up the eyebrow the latter compress the flesn over the eye and make it descend over the upper eyelid the subject not allow the artist to embellisn nature he have exert himself to display contention and vigour in those place where there be the greatest agony there be also great beauty the left side on which the furious serpent make its attack seem to be in the greatest pain from its proximity to the heart this part of the body may be call prodigy of art laocoon wishie to raise he leg in order to escape no part of the figure be in repose the very flesn by the skill of the artist have the appearance of be benumb of colour colour though subject greatly inferior to many other which the painter must study be yet of sufficient importance to employ considerable share of he attention and to excel in it he must be well acquainted with that part of optic which have the nature of light and colour for its object light however simple and uncompound it may appÃ©ar be nevertheless make up as it be of several distinct substance and the number and even dose of these ingredient have be happily discover by the modern every undivided ray let it be ever so fine be little bundle of red orange yellow green azure indigo and violet ray which while combine be not to be distinguished one from another and form that kind of light call white so that white be not colour perse as the learn de vinci so far it feem the precursor of newton expressly affirm but a assemblage of colour now these colour which compose light although immu table in themselves and endue with various quality be continually however separate from each other in they reflection from and passage through other substance and thus become manifest to the eye graf for example reflect only green ray or rather reflect green ray in greater number than it do those of any other colour one kind of wine transmit red ray and another yellowish ray and from this kind of separation arise that variety of colour with which nature have diversify she various pro duction .. man too have contrive to separate the ray of light by make portion of the sun s beam paf through glass prism for after pass through it they appear divide into seven pure and primitive colour place in succession one by the other like so many colour on painter  pallet now though titian corregio and vandyke have be excellent colourist without know any thing of tliese phyfical subtlety that be no reason why other should neglect they for it can not but be of great service to painter to be well acquainted with the nature of what he be to imitate and of those colour with which he be to give life and perfection to he design not to speak of the plea sure there be in be able to account truly and solidly for the various effect and appearance of light from due temper for example and graduate of the tint in picture from make colour partake of each other becording to the reflection of light from one object to anothe there arise in some measure that sublime harmony which may be consider as the true music of the eye and this harmony have its foundation in the genuine principle of opty now this could not happen in the system os those philosopher who hold that colour do not originally exist in light but be on the contrary nothing else than so many modification which it underwent in be reflect from other substance or in pass through they thus subject to alteration without end and every moment liable to perish be that the case body could no more receive any hue one from another nor this body partake of the colour of that than scarlet for example because it have the power of change into red all the ray of the sun or sky which immediately sall upon it have the power of change into red all the other ray reflect to it from blue or any other colour in its neighbourhood whereas allow that colour be in they own nature imiutable one into another and that every body reflect more or less every sort of coloured ray though those ray in the greatest number which be of the colour it exhibit there must necessarily arise in colour place near one another certain particular hue or temperament of colour nay this influence of one colour upon another may be so far trace that three or you body of different colour and likewise the intenseness of the light fall upon each be assign we may easily determine in what situation and how much they would tinge each other we may thus too by the same principle of optic account for several other thing practise by painter insomuch that person who have carefully observe natural effect with a eye direct by solid learning shall be able to form general rule where another can only distinguish particular case but after all the picture of the best colourist be it be universally allow the book in which young painter must chiefly look for the rule of colour that be of that branch of painting which contribute so much to express the beauty of object and be so requisite to represent they as what they really be giorgio and titian seem to have discover circumstance in nature which other have entirely overlook and the last in particular have be happy enough to express they with pencil as delicate as he eye be quick and pierce in he work we behold that sweetnef of colour which be produce by union that beauty which be consistent with truth and all the insensible transmutation all the soft transition in word all the pleasing modulation of tint and colour when young painter have by close application acquire from titian whom he can never sufficiently dwell upon that art which of all painter he have best contrive to hide he would do well to turn to bassano and paolo on account of the beauty boldnef and elegance of they touch that richnef softness and freshness of colour for which the lombard school be so justly cry up may likewise be of great service to he nor will he reap less benefit by study the principle and practice of the flemissi school which chiesly by means of she varnish have contrive to give most enchant lustre and transparency to she colour but whatever picture young painter may choose to study the art of colour upon he must take great care that they be well preserve there be very sew piece which have not suffer more or less by the length not to say the injury of time and perhaps that precious patina which year alone can impart to painting be in some meafure akin to that other kind which age alone impart to medal inasmuch as by give testimony to they anti quity it render they proportionably beautisul in the superstitious eye of the learn it must indeed be allow that if on the one band this patina bestow as it really do a extraordinary degree of harmony upon the colour of picture and destroy or at least greatly lessen they original rawness it on the other hand equally impair the freshiness and lise of they piece see many year aster it have be paint appear much as it would do imme diately after painting behind dull glass it be no idle opinion that paolo veronese attentive above all thing to the beauty of he colour and what be call strepiro leave entirely to time the care of harmonizing they perfectly and as we may say mellow they but most of the old master take that task upon themselves and never expose they work to the eye of the public until they have ripe and finish they with they own hand and who can say whether the christ of moneta or the nativity of bassano have be more improve or injure if we may so speak by the touching and retouchings of time in the course of more than two century it be indeed impossible to be determine but the studious pupil may make himself ample amend for any injury which he original may have receive from the hand of time by turn to truth and to nature which never grow old but constantly retain its primitive slower of youth and be itself the model of the model before he as soon therefore as young painter have lay proper foundation for good colour by studying the best master he should turn all he thought to truth and nature and it would perhaps be well worth while to have in the academy of painting model for colour as well as design that as from the one the pupil learn to give they due proportion to the several member and mus cle they may learn from the other to make they carnation rich and warm and faithfully copy the different local hue which appear quite distinct in the different part of fine bodv to illustrate still farther the use of such model let we suppose it place in different light now in that of the sun now in that of the sky and now again in that of lamp or candle one time place in the shade and another in reflect light hence the pupil may learn all the disserent efsect of the complection in different circumstance whethe the livid the lucid or transparent and above all that variety of tint and half tint occasion in the colour of the skin by the epidermis have the bone immediately under it in some place and in other greater or less number of bloodvessel or quantity of fat a artist who have long study such model would run no risk of de grade the beauty of nature by any particularity of stile or of give into that preposterous fulness and floridness of colour which be at present so much the taste he would not feed he figure with rose as a ancient painter of greece shrewdly express it but with good beef difference which the learn eye of modern writer could perceive between the colour of barocci and that of titian to practise in that manner be accord to great master no better than inure one  self to the commission of blunder what statue be in design nature be in colour ing the fountain head of that perfection to which every artist ambitious to excel should constantly aspire a accordingly the flemish painter in consequence of they aim solely to copy nature be in colour as excellent as they be wont to be aukward in design the best model for the tone of colour and the degradation of shade be furnishied by means of the cumeraobscura we may form general idea of the various effect of reflection from the follow example if blue be reflect on yellow the latter become greenish if on red the red become purple and so on through variety of combination and as the white be of nature to receive all the colour and to be ting with that of each reflection the painter must he caresul how he carnation may be affect by the several reflection of composition composition which may be consider as branch of invention consist in the proper station of what the inventive faculty have imagine so as to expref the subject in the most lively manner the chief merit of compo sition may be say to consist in that disorder which wearing the appearance of mere chance be in fact the most study effect of art painter therefore be equally to avoid the drynef of those ancient who always plant they figure like so many couple in procefsion and the affectation of those modern who jumble they together as if they be meet merely to fight and squabble in this branch raphael be happy enough to choose the just medium and attain perfection the disposition of he figure be always exactly such as the subject require in the battle of constantine they be confusedly cluster with as much art as they be regularly marshall in christ s commitment of the key to st. peter and constitute he prince of the apostle let the inferior figure of piece be place as they will the principal figure should strike the eye most and stand out as it be from among the rest this may be effect various way as by place it on the foremost line or in some otherconspicuous part of the piece by exhibit it in manner by itself by make the principal light fall upon it by give it the most resplendent drapery or indeed by several of these method nay by all of they toge the for bein the hero of the picturesque fable it be hut just thatit should draw the eye to itself and lord it as it be over al the other object accord to leon batista alberti painter should follow the example of comic writer who compose they fable of as few person as possible for in fact crowded picture be apt to give as much pain to the spectator as crowded road to the traveller some subject it must be grant require Ã  number nay nation as it be of figure on these occasion it depend entirely on the skill of the painter to dispose of they in such manner that the principal one may always make the principal appearance and contrive matter so that the piece be not overcrowded or want convenient rest and pause he must in word take care that he piece be full but not charge in this respect the battle of alexander by le brun be masterpiece which can never be sufficiently study whereas nothing on the other hand can be more unhappy than the famous paradise of tintoret which cover one entire side of the great council chamber at venice it appear no bÃªtter than confuse heap of figure swarm cloud chaos which pain and fatigue the eye what pity it be that he do not dispose this subject aster Ã  model of he own now in the gallery of bevilacqua at verona in this last the several choir of martyr virgin bishop and other saint be judicioussy throw into so many cluster part here and there by Ã  fine sleece of cloud so as to exhibit the innu merable host of heaven draw up in way that make most agreeable and glorious appearance there go story to we purpose of celebrate master who in draw of the universal deluge the better to express the immensity of the water that cover the earth leave corner of he paper without figure be afk if he do not intend to sill it up no say he do not you see that my leave it empty be what precisely constitute the picture the reason for breaking composition into several group be that the eye pass freely from one object to another may the better comprehend the whole but the painter be not to stop here for these group be besides to be so artsully put together as to form rich cluster give the whole composition singular air of grandeur and afford the spectator a opportunity of discerning the piece at distance and take the whole in as it be at single glance these effect be greatly promote by due regard to the nature of colour so as not to place together those which be apt to pain by they opposition or distract by they variety they should be so judicioussy dispose as to temper and qualify each other proper use of the chiaro scuro be likewise of great service on this occasion the group be easily part and the whole picture acquire grand effect by introduce some strong falls of snade and above all one principal beam of light this method have be follow with great success by rembrandt in famous picture of he representing the virgin at the foot of the crof on mount calvary the principal light darting upon she through break of the cloud while the rest of the figure about she stand more or less in the shade tintoret too acquire great repu tation as well by that brifkness with which he enliven bis figure as by he masterly manner of shad they and polidoro de caravaggio though he scarce paint any thing but bassorelievos be particularly famous for introducing with great skill the effect of the chiaroscuro thing first attempt by mantegna in he triumph of julius cÃ¦sar it be by this means that he composition appear so strikingly divide into different group and among they other perfection afford so much delight through the beautiful disposition that reign in they in like manner painter by the help of perspective especially that call Ã¦rial the opposition of local colour and other contrivance which he may expect to hit upon by study nature and those who have best study she before he will be able not only to part he group hut make they appear at disserent distance so as to leave sufficient passage between they but the greatest caution be to be use in the purfuit of the method here lay down especially in the management of the chiaroscuro that the effect attribute to light and shade and to they various concomitant may not run counter to truth and experience this be capital point for this purpose painter would do well to make in little figure as tintoret and poussin use to do model of the subject that he intend to represent and then illuminate it by lamp er candlelight by this means he may come to know with certainty if the chiaro scuro which he have form in he mind do not clasti with the reason of thing by varying the height and direction of he light he may easily discover such accidental effect as be most likely to recommend he performance and so establisn proper system for the illuminating it nor will he afterward find it difficult matter to modisy the quality of he shade by softening or strengthen they accord to the situation of he scene and the quality of the light fall upon it ifit should happen to be candle or lamp light scene he would then have nothing to do but consider he model well and faithfully copy it in the next place to turn groupe elegantly the best pattern be that of bunch of grape adopt by titian as of the many grain that compose bunch of grape someare strike directly by the light and those opposite to they be in the shade whilst the intermediate one partake of botli ight and shade in greater or less degree so accord to titian the figure of groupe should be so dispose that by the union of the chiaroscuro several thing may appear as it be but one thing and in fact it be only from he have pursue this method that we can account for the very grand effect of he piece this way in which it be impossible to study he too much the mannerist who do not follow nature in the track of the master just mention be apt to commit many fault the reason of they figure casting they snade in this or that manner seldom appear in the picture or at least do not appear sufficiently probable they be besides wont to trespass all bound in splafh they piece with light that be enliven those part which we usually term the deaf of picture this method no doubt have sometimes very sine effect but it be however to be use with no small discretion as otherwise the whole lose that union that pause that majestic silence as caracci use to call it which afford so much pleasure the eye be not less hurt by many light scatter here and there over picture than the ear be by the confuse noise of different person speak all together in a asfembly guido reni who have impart to he painting that gaiety and splendour in which he live seem enamour with bright and open light whereas michael angelo de caravagio who be of sull and savage disposition appear sondest of gloomy and cloud sky so that neither of they be qualified to handle indifferently all object the chiaroscuro may likewise prove of great service to painter in give he composition grand effect but neverthelefs the light he choose must be adapt to the situation of the scene where the action be lay nor would he be less faulty who in grottoor cavern where the light enter by chink snould make he shade soft and tender than he wlio should represent they strong and bold in a open skylight but this be by no means the only fault which mannerist be apt to be guilty of in historical piece and particularly in the disposition of they figure to say nothing of they favourite groupe of woman lie on the ground with one child at she breast and another playing about she and the like which they generally place on the first line of they piece nor of those halffigure in the back ground peep ing out from the hollow contrive for they they make Ã  common practice of mixing naked with clothed figure old man with young place one figure with its face towards you and another with its back they contrast violent motion with languid attitude and seem to aim at opposition in every thing whereas opposition never please but when they arise naturally from the sulject like anti theses in discourse as to foreshorten sigure too mucl assectation in use or avoid they be equally blamable the attitude have better be compose than otherwise it very seldom happen that there be any occasion for make they so impetuous as to be in danger of lose they equilibrium thing too much practise by some painter in regard to drapery equal care should be take to avoid that poverty which make some master look as if through mere penury they grudge clothes to they figure and that profusion which albani impute to guido say that he be rather Ã  tailor than painter the ornament of dress should be use with great sobriety and it will not be amiss to remember what be once say to a ancient painter pity you greatly unable to make helen handsome you liave take care to make she sine let the whole in word and all the different part of the composition possess probability grace costume and the particular character of what be to be represent let nothing look like unisormity of manner which do not appear less in the composition than it do in colour drapery and design and be as it be that kind of accent by which painter may be as readily distinguished as foreigner be by pronouneing in the same manner all the different language they happen to be acquainted with crayon painting whether the painter work with oil colour water colour or crayon the grand olject of he purfuit be still the same Ã  just imitation of nature but each species have its peculiar rule and method painting with crayon require in many respects treatment different from painting in oil colour because all colour use dry be in they nature of much warmer complexion than when wet with oil or any other bind fluid let this be prove by matter of factmr. cote paint portrait of sir william chamber which be in lord besborough s collection a ingenious foreigner have discover method of fix crayon picture so that iliey would not rub or receive a injury if auy accident happen to the glass the society for the encouragement of art have before offer premium to any one who should discover so valuable secret for which premium he make application mo . cote be eminent in he prosession be desire to lend picture for the trial and give he judgment which be make on this portrait of sir william chamber tlie crayon he indeed so persectly fix as so resist any ruh or brush without the leust injury which before would have entirely deface or spoiled it but the picture which before have particularly warm brilliant and agreeable effect in comparison become cold and purple and though in one sense the attempt succeed to the design intention of six the colour yet the bind quali ty of whatever sluid be make use of in the process changed the complexion of the colour render the cold teint too predominant for this reason in order to produce rich picture much greater portion of what painter term cool tint must be apply in crayon painting than would be judicious to use in oil without any danger of mistake it be to be suppose the not be acquainted with this observation be one great cause why so many oil painter have no better success when they attempt crayon painting on the contrary crayon painter be so much use to those tint which be of cold nature when use wet be apt to introduce they too much when they paint with oil which be seldom productive of good effect another observation would make which require particular notice from the student who have be conversant with oil painting prior to he attempt with crayon oil painter begin they picture much lighter and fainter than they intend to finish they which present the future co louring clear and brilliant the light underneath greatly assist the transparent glaze and scumble colour which if they be lay over any part already too dark would but increase its heavy effect on the contrary crayon be make of dry colour be difficult to procure fufficiently dark the crayon painter therefore will find a absolute necessity to begin he picture in dark and rich as pos sible except in the strongest light for if once the grey and light tint become predominant it will be next to im ossible for he in the deep shadow especially to restore depth and brilliancy have no opportunity of glaze or scumble to give the effect as the grey tint be mixture with whiting underneath will continually work up and render the attempt abortive shall now endeavour to give the student some direction towards the attainment of excellence in this art the student must provide himself with some strong blue paper the thicker the better if the grain be not too coarse and knotty though it be almost impossible to get any intirefree from knot the knot should be level with penknise or razor otherwise they will prove exceedingly troublesome after this be do the paper must be paste very smooth on line cloth previoussy strain on deal frame the size accord to the artist s pleafure on this the picture be to be execute but it be most eligible not to paste the paper on till the whole subject be first deadco lour the method of do this be very easy by lay the paper with the deadcolour on its face upon fmooth board or table when by means of brush the backside of the paper must be cover with paste the frame with the strain cloth must then be lay on the paste side of the paper after which turn the paint side uppermost and lay piece of clean paper upon it to prevent fmear this be do it may be stroke gently over with the hand by which mean all the air between the cloth and the paper will be force out when the paste be persectly dry the student may proceed with the painting the advantage arise from pasting the paper in the frame accord to this method after that side of the paper should be paste which have the stroke from the wire most evident that the painting may be on the smoothest side otherwise the line which these wire have leave in the paper will prove troublesome and look unpleasant some crayon picture be paint on vellum but the animal salt in the skin very often cause they to mildew it must be confess the vellum give tne picture Ã  foft effect but it be use can not be recommend in we unsavourable climate other make use of smalt grounds le tour lately painter the picture be begin be very great as the crayon will adhere much better than any other way which will enable the student to finish the picture with firmer body of co lour and greater lustre the late mo . cote discover this method by accident and esteem it valuable acquisi tion and remember on particular occasion he bemove sine crayon picture of rozalba  and place it on another strain cloth without the least injury by soak ing the canva with wet sponge till the pafte between the cloth and paper be sufficiently wet to admit of separation when painter want to make very correct copy of picture they generally make use of tiffany or black gauze strain tight on frame which they lay flat on the subject to be imitate and with piece of sketch chalk trace all the outline on the tiffany they then lay the canva to be paint on flat upon the sloor place the tiffany with the chalk line upon it and with a hand kerchief brush the whole over this prefent the exact outline of the pictureon the canva the crayon painter may also make use of this method when the subject of he imi tation be in oil but in copy crayon picture he must have recourse to the follow method on account of the glass the picture be place upon the esel let the outline be draw on the glass with small camel s hair peneil dip ped in lake ground thin with oil which must be do with great exactness after this be accomplishied take Ã  sheet of paper of the same size and place it on the glass stroke of note in paris often use they with great fuccess the method to prepare they be to brush over the paper with gum water which directmy strew with smalt moderately fine the superfluous part of which should be sweep off with painter  brussi when the gum water be perfectly dry on this the picture be to be paint but we have paper now in england to be procure of so excellent texture as to render this preparation perhaps unnecessary over all the line with the hand by which mean the co lour will adhere to the paper which must be pierce with pin hole pretty close to each other the paper intend to be use for the painting must next be lay upon table and the pierce paper place upon it then with some fine pound charcoal tie up in piece of lawn rub over the perforate stroke which will give a exact outline great care must be take not to brushi this off till the whole be draw over with sketch chalk which be composition make of whiting and tobaccopipe clay roll like crayon and point at each end when the student paint immediately from the life it will be most prudent to make correct draw of the outline on another paper the size of the picture he be go to paint which he may trace by the precede method be cause erroneous stroke of the sketch chalk which be not to be avoid without great expertness will prevent the crayon from adhere to the paper ow to certain greasy quality in the composition the student will find the sitting posture with the box of crayon on he lap the most convenient method for he to paint the part of the picture he be immediately painting should be rather below he face for if it be place too high the arm will be fatigue let the window of the room where he paint he darken at least to the height of six foot from the ground and the subject to be paint should be situate in such manner that the light may fall with every advantage on the face avoid too much shadow which seldom have good effect in portrait painting especially if the face he paint have any degree of delicacy before he begin to paint let he be attentive to he subject and appropriate the action or attitude proper to the age of the subject if child let it be childishi if young lady express more vivacity than in the majestie beauty of middle aged woman who also should not be express with the same gravity as person far advanced in year let the embel lishment of the picture and introduction of bird animal be regulate by the rule of propriety and consistency the feature of the face be carefully draw with chalk let the student take crayon of pure carmine and carefully draw the nostril and edge of the nose next the shadow then with the faintest carmine tint lay in the strongest light upon the nose and forehead which must be execute broad he be then to proceed gradually with the second tint and the succeed one till he arrive at the shadow which must be cover brilliant enrich with much lake carmine little break with brilliant green this method will at first offensively strike the eye from its crude appearance but in finish it will be good foundation to produce pleasing effect colour be much more easily sully when too bright than when the first colour be dull to raise the picture into brilliant state the several pearly tint discernable in sine complexion must be imitate with blue verditer and white which answer to the ultramarine tint use in oil but if the part of the face where these tint appear be in shadow the crayon compose of black and white must be substitute in they place though all the face when first coloured should be lay in as brilliant as possible yet each part should be keep in its proper tone by which mean the rotundity of the face will be preserve let the student be caresul when he begin the eye to draw they with crayon ineline to the carmine tint of whatever colour the iris be of he must lay they in brilliant and at first not load with colour but execute lightly no notice be to be take of the pupil yet the stude not must let the light of the eye incline very much to the blue cast cautioussy avoid Ã  stare white appearance which when once introduce be seldom overcome preserve broad shadow throw on its upper part by the eyelashi black and heavy tint be also to be avoided in the eyebrow it be therefore best to execute they like broad glow shadow at first on which in the finish the hair of the brow be to be paint by which method of proceed the former tint will shew themselves through and produce the most pleasing effect the student should begin the lip with pure carmine and lake and in the shadow use some carmine and black the strong vermillion tint should be lay on afterwards he must beware of execute they with stiff harsh line gently intermix each with the neigbour colour make the shadow beneath broad and enrich with brilliant crayon he must form the corner of the mouth with carmine brown oker and green varioussy intermix if the hair be dark he should preserve much of the lake and deep carmine tint therein this may be easily overpower by the warmer hair tint which as observe in painting the eyebrow will produce richer effect when the picture it finish on the contrary if this method be unknown or neglect poverty of colour will be discernable after the student have cover over or as artist term it have deadcoloured the head he be to sweeten the whole together by rub it over with he finger begin at the strongest light upon the forehead pass he singervery lightly and uniting it with the next tint which he must continue till the whole be sweeten together often wipe he finger on towel to prevent the colour be sully he must be cautious not to smooth or sweeten he picture too often because it will give rise to thin and scanty effect and have more the appearance of draw than solid painting as nothing but body of rich colour can constitute Ã  rich effect to avoid this as the student find it necessary to sweeten with the singer he must continually replenisn the picture with more crayon when the head be bring to some degree of forwardnefs let the back ground be lay in which must be treat in different cover it as thin as possible and rub it into the paper with leather stump near the face the paper should be almost free from colour for this will do great service to the head and by its thin give both soft and solid appearance in the back ground also crayon which have whiting in they composition should be use but seldom or never without caution but chiessy such as be the most brilliant and the least adulterate the ground be paint thin next the hair will give the student a opportunity of painting the edge of the hair over in light and free manner when he give the finish touch the student have proceed thus far the face hair and back ground be entirely cover he must carefully view the whole at some distance remark in what respect it be out of keep that be what part be too light and what too dark be particularly attentive to the white or chalky appearance which must be subdue with lake and carmine the above method be properly put into execution will produce the appearance of painting prin cipally compose of three colour viz carmine black and white which be the best preparation painter can make for produce sine crayon picture the next step be to compleat the back ground and the hair as the dust in painting these will sall on the face and would much injure it if that be compleate first from thence proceed to the forehead finish downward till the whole picture be compleate back grounds may be of various colour but it require great taste and judgment to fuit they properly to different complexion in general strong coloured head should have weak and tender tint ground and on the contrary Ã  delicate complexion should be oppose with strong and powersul tint by which proper contrast between the sigure and the back ground the picture will receive great force and strike the spectator much more than it could possibly do be this circumstance of contrast not attend ed to young painter often treat the back grounds of picture as Ã  matter of very little or no consequence when it be most certain great part of the beauty and brilliancy of the picture especially the face depend upon the tint be well suite the dark keep in they proper place and the whole be perfectly in subordination to the face thus Ã  simple back ground require attention but the difficulty be still greater when variety of object be introduce such as hill tree building in these case one rule must be strictly attend to that each grand object be dispose so as to contrast each other this be not mean merely respect they form but they colour they light shade for instance we will suppose the figure receive the strongest light behind the figure and very near at hand be the stem of some large tree these must have shade throw over they either from drive cloud or some other interpose circumstance behind these stem of tree and at distance be see tree on Ã  rise ground these should beceive the light as contrast to the former lf a bechitectural back ground be choose the same rule must be apply suppose building at moderate distance be place behind the figure receive the light column or some other object in shadow should intervene to preserve proper decorum in the piece or what will have the same effect shadow must be throw over the lower part of the building which will give equal fatisfaction or repose to the eye it must be remember the light must be always place against the dark and the weak against the strong in order to produce force and essect and vice versa in painting over the forehead the last time begin the highest light with the most faint vermillion tint in the same place where the faint carmine be first lay keep it broad in the same manner in the next shade succeed the lightest the student must work in some light blue tint compose of verditer and white intermix with they some of the deeper vermillion tint sweeten they together with great caution insensibly melt they into one another increase the proportion of each colour as he ugdment shall direct some brilliant yellow may also be use but sparingly and towards the root of the hair strong verditer tint intermix with green will be of singular service cool crayon compose of black and white should succeed these and melt into the hair be neath the eye the pleasing pearly tint be to be preserve compose of verditer and white and under the nose and on the temple the same may be use beneath the lip tint of this kind also be proper mixing they with the light green and some vermillion the introduction of green and bly into the face in painting have often give surprize to those who be unacquaint with the art but there be reason sufficient for they introduction though it may appear strange at first in order to break and correct the other colour the carmine predominate in the dead colour be as have be observe the best preparation for the succeed tint the crudeness of this preparation must be correct hy varioussy intermix green bly and yellow which of these be to be use be to be determine by the degree this direction be sor the finest complexion but the student must vary nis colour accordin to he subject of carmine in the dead colour and the complexion intend the blue and yellow be of nature diametrically opposite and serve to correct the red and oppose one another the green be compound of both these colour be of peculiar use in many case be the transition be not to be so violent the student attentively consider nature will discover pleasing variety of colour on the furface and discernible through clear and transparent skin this variety will be still increase by the effect of light and shade he will per ceive one part incline to the vermillion red another to the carmine or lake one to the blue this to the green and that to the yellow in order to produce these different effect he will apply those colour to which the tint be most inclined yet in crayon painting it be often best to compound the mix colour upon the picture such as blue and yellow instead of green blue and carmine instead of purple red and yellow instead of orange in other circumstance the compound already mix should be use but in this case there can be no absolute rule give it must be leave to the experience and discretion of the painter though the student may be greatly assist in the commencement of he study by a able master to direct and point out the best method to treat circumstance of this nature as they occur in practice which may at first appear obscure and mysterious but will soon to good capacity become demonstrably clear upon certain and sure principle the circumstance that require different treatment be so various and so many as to render it impossible here to descend to every particular in finish the cheek let the pure lake clear they froin any dust contract from the other crayon then with the lake may be intermix the bright vermillion and last of all if the subject should requre it few touch of the orange coloured crayon but with extreme caution after this sweeten that part with the finger as little as possible for sear of produce hieavy disagreeable essect on the cheek as the beauty of crayon picture consist in one colour shiew itself throughi or rather between another this the student can not too often remark it be the only method of imitate beautiful complexion the eye be the most difficult fcature to execute in crayon as every part must be express with the utmost nicety to appear finishied at the same time that the painter must preserve its breadth and solidity while he be particularize the part to accomplishi this it will be good general rule sfor the student to use he crayon in sweeten as much and he singer as liitle as possible when he want point to touch small part with he may break off little of he crayon against the box which will produce corner fit to work with in the minutest part if the eyelashie be dark he must use some of the carmine and brown oker and the crayon of carmine and black and with these he may also touch the iris of the eye if brown or hazel make broad shadow cause by the eyelasni red tint of vermillion carmine and lake will execute the corner of the eye properly but if the eyelid be too red they will have disagrecable sore appearance the pupil of the eye must be make of pure lampblack between this and the lower part of the iris the light will catch very strong but it must not be make too sudden but be gently diffuse round the pupil tiil it be lose in shade when the eyeball be sufficiently prepare the shine speck must be make with pure white erayon which should be first break to point and then lay on firm but as it be possible they may be desective in neatness they should be correct with pin take off the redundant part by which mean they may be form as neat as can be require the difficulty with respect to the nose be to preserve the line properly determine and at the same time so artfully blend into the check as to express its projection and yet no real line to be perceptible upon close examination in some circumstance it should be quite blend with the check which appear behind it and determined entirely with slight touch of red chalk the shadow cause by the nose be generally the darkest in the whole face partake of no reflection from its furrounding part carmine and brown oker carmine and black and such brilliant crayon will compose it best the student have before prepare the lip with the strongest lake and carmine must with these colour make they compleatly correct and when finish intro duce the strong vermillion but with great caution as they be extremely predominant this if properly touch will give the lip a appearance equal if not superior to those execute in oil notwithstanding the seem supe riority the latter have by means of glaze of which the former be entirely destitute when the student paint the neck he should avoid express the muscle too strong in the stem nor should the bone appear too evident on the chest as both have a un pleasing effect denote violent agitation of the body circumstance seldom necessary to express in portrait painting the most necessary part to be express and which should ever be observe even in the most delicate subject be strong mark just above the place where the collar bone unite and if the head be much throw over the shoulder some notice should be take of the large muscle that rise the method with which painter in oil express transparency in the lip be by painting they first with light vermillion tint and when dry touchint they over with pure lake from behind the ear and be insert into the pit between the collar bone all inferior muscle should be in general quite avoid the student will sind this caution necesary as most subject especially thin person have the muscle of the neck much more evident than would be judicious to imitate as sew neck be too long it may be necessary to give some addition to the stem fault on the other side be quite unpardonable nothing be more ungraceful than short neck in colour the neck let the student preserve the stem of pearly hue and the light not so strong as on the chest if any part of the breast appear its transparency must also be express by pearly tint but the upper part of the chest should be cosour with heautiful vermillion delicately blend with the other of the material hhe perfection of the crayon consist in great meafure in they softnef for it be impossible to execute brilliant picture with they if they be otherwise on which account great care should be observe in the prepare they of prevent they be hardin all composition slake white and white lead should be wholly reject because the slightest touch with either of these will unavoidably turn black the usual objection to crayon painting be that they be subject to change but whenever this happen it be entirely ow to a injudicious use of the abovemention white which will stand only in oil to obviate the bad effect arise from the use of such crayon let the student make use of common whiting prepare in the follow manner take large vessel of water put the whiting into it and mix they well together let this stand about half minute then pour off the top into another vessel and throw the gritty sediment away let what be prepare rest about minute and then pour it off as before which will purisy the whiting and render it free from all dirt and grittiness when this be do let the whiting settle and then pour the water from it after which lay it on the chalk to dry and keep it for use either for white crayon or the purpose of prepare tint with other colour for with this all other tint may be safely prepare the student must be provide with large slexible palletknife large stone and muller to levigate the colour two or three large piece of chalk to absorb the moisture from the colour aster they be levigate piece of flat glaf to prevent the moisture from be absorb too much till the colour be roll into form and vessel for water spirit as necessity and convenience snall direct red carmine and lake it be rather difficult to procure either good carmine or good lake good cermine be inclined to the vermillion tint and should be a impalpable powder and good lake to the carmine tint the carmine crayon be prepare in the sollow manner as they texture be inclinable to hardness instead of grind and roll they take Ã  sufficient quantity of carmine lay it upon the grindstone mix it with levigate knife with spirit of wine till it become smooth and even yet the less friction produce by the knife the better the chalkstone be ready lay the colour upon it to absorb the spirit but be careful that it be lay on in proper shape for painting the simple colour be prepare the next step be to compose the disserent tint by mixture with whiting the proportion to be observe consist of twenty gradation to one which may be clearly understand by the follow direction take some of the simple colour and levigate it with spirit of wine add about one part of wasny whiting to three part of carmine of which when properly incorporate make two parcel the next gradation should be compose of equal quantity of carmine and whiting of which sour crayon may be make the third composition should have one fourth carmine and three fourth whiting of this make six crayon which will be good proportion with the rest the last tint should be make of whiting very faintly ting with carmine of which make about eight crayon which will compleat the abovemention proportion though these tint make with whiting may be roll yet the pure carmine will not bear it but must he lest on the chalkstone till persectly dry lake lave colour very apt to be hard to prevent which the student must observe the follow particular take about half the quantity of lake intend for the crayon and grind it very sine with spirit of wine let it dry and then pulverize it which be easily do if the lake be good then take the other half and grind it with spirit after which mix it with the pulverize lake and lay it out directly in crayon on the chalk the colour will not bear roll the simple colour be thus prepare proceed with the compound crayon as direct before and in the same degree of gradation as the carmine tint vermillion or native cinnabar the best be inclined to the carmine tint to prepare this colour mix it on the stone with soft water or spirit aster which it may be roll into crayon bly prussian blue be colour very apt to bind and be render soft with more difficulty than carmine and lake the same method of preparation be to be follow with this as direct with respect to lake only it be necessary to grind Ã  larger quan tity of the pure colour as it be chiefly use for painting drapery blue verditer be colour naturally gritty and therefore it be necessary to be ni it well its particle be so coarse as to require some bind matter to unite they otherwise the crayon will never adhere together to accomplish this take quantity sufficient to form two or three crayon to which add piece of slack plaister of paris about the size of pea mix these well together and form the crayon upon the chalk this blue be extremely brilliant and will be of great use in heighten drapery brilliant green be produce with great difficulty which may be procure of those who make it they business to prepare they yet the follow composition will be find useful take yellow oker and after grind it with spirit mix it with the powder of prussian blue then temper it with knife and lay the crayon on the chalk without roll they besides this use king  yellow mix with prussian blue brown oker and prussian blue the crayon make of these last may be roll yellow king  yellow be the most useful and the most brilliant levigate with spirit of wine and compose the different tint as before direct yellow oker and naple yellow ground with spirit will make useful crayon orange be produce with king  yellow and vermillion ground together with spirit and the tint form as in other case but no great quantity of they be require brown cullen earth be sine dark brown after six or eight of the simple crayon be prepare several rich compound tint may be roman oker and prussian blue mix in difserent proportion will be useful produce from it by mixture with carmine in various degree black carmine and this colour mix toget ier make useful tint for painting hair several gradation may be produce from each of these by mixture with whiting umber may be treat in just the same manner only it be necessary to levigate it with spirit of wine purple prussian blue ground with spirit and mix with pulve rize lake will produce good purple carmine thus mix with prussian blue will produce purple something different from the former various tint may be make from either of these compound by mixture with whiting black lampblack be the only full black that can be use with safety as all other be subject to mildew cinnabar mix with carminethis be composition of great use and tint make from this with whiting will be find very serviceable carmine and black be another good compound of which five or six gradation should be make some partake more of the black and other have the carmine most predomi nant besides several tint by mixture with whiting cinnabar and black be also very useful compound from which several different tint should be make prussian blue and black be another good compound and will be sound of singular service in painting drapery it be impossible to lay down rule for form every tint necessary composition set of crayon there be many accidental composition entirely dependent on fancy and opinion the student should make it Ã  rule to save the leaving of he colour for of these he may form various tint which will occasionally be useful roll the crayon and dispose they for painting the different composition of colour must be cut into proper magnitude after they be prepare in order to be roll into pastil for the convenience of use they each crayon should be form in the left hand with the ball of the right first form cylindrically and then taper at each end if the composition be too dry dip the finger in water if too wet the composition must be lay upon the chalk again to absorb more of the moisture the crayon should be roll as quick as possible and when finish must be lay upon the chalk again to absorb all remain moisture after the gradation of tint from one colour be form the chalk and the grindstone should be well scrape and cleanse with water before it be use sor another colour when the set of crayon be compleate accord to the rule prescribe they should be arrange in class for the convenience of painting with they some thin drawer divide into number of partition be the most convenient method of dispose they properly the crayon should be deposit accord to the several gradation of light the bottom of the partition must be cover with bran as bed for the colour because it not only preserve they clean but prevent they break the box make use of when the student paint should be about foot square with nine partition in the upper corner on the left hand supposing the box to be in the lap when he paint let he place the black and grey crayon those be the most seldom use in the second partition the bly in the third the green and brown in the first partition on the left hand of the second row the carmine lake vermillion and all deep red the yellow and orange in the middle and the pearly tint next and as these last be of very delicate nature they must be keep very clean that the gradation of colour may be eafily distinguished in the lowest row let the first partition con tain piece of fine line rag to wipe the crayon with while they be use the second all the pure lake and vermillion tint and the other partition may contain those tint which from they complex nature can not be class with any of the former encaustic painting tiis method of painting have be little practise in england for the information of the curious we give the follow direction which will enable they to produce with ease picture in this very curious manner the first method be describe in letter from mo . febroni the inventor publish in maty review for mo . lewis of gottenbrun have lately execute picture accord to my manner it be do upon wood prepare with wax and be remarkable for the vivacity and splendour of its colour believe have already mention to you in what this new manner consist you melt or rather dissolve some good white wax in naptha petrolei without colour till such time as the mixture have acquire by cool ing the appearance of a oil beginning to freeze mix you colour in this and then keep they in small tin box ou dilute they more or less with the same naptha becording as they dry or as you wisn to use they this painting allow time enough to give all the finish you desire and if you wisfi to work in haste you may dry as fast as you please by exposing it to the heat when the picture be finish it be of that fine tone which be preferable to any varnish but if you choose varnisn only warm the picture and the naptha will evaporate when this be do you must wait till the picture cool when you must polishi it by rub it over neatly with cloth if vou wishi to have it still brighter you must melt white wax on the fire without suffer it to boil mix little naptha with this and draw layer of it over the picture already heat by means of brazier which you hold under if the picture be small or before it if it be large the colour at first appear spoiled but you restore they to they first beauty if when the layer of wax be cool you polisn it by rub with cloth it be then that the colour take the high tone of oil lf vou fear the effect of fire for you picture you be to make soap of wax which be to be do by boiling white wax in water in which you have dissolve twentieth part naptha petrolei be bituminous kind of oil issue out of certain rock in the territory of modena there be three fort more or less pure and colourless of the weight of the wax of marine alkali or sel de sourde very pure rub you picture with this soap and when it be dry polish it as beforemention if you do not choose either of these method give you painting its usual varnisn of sandarac and spirit of turpentinc this method have be find preferable to all those that have be try and superior to oil for the beauty of they colour there be many fine colour which can not be use in oil which may be make use of with great success in this method as the naptha entirely evaporate one may be asfure that this be the true method or painting in wax there be likewise much to hope for the duration of the picture paint in this manner as wax be much less liable to altera tion than oil and do not so easily part with its phlogiston the ancient grecian method of painting by emma jane greenland take a ounce of white wax and the same weight of gum mastick in lachrymae that be as it come from the tree which must be reduce to coarse powder put the wax in glaze earthen vessel over very slow fire and when it be quite dissolve strew in the mastick little at time stir the wax continually until the whole quantity gold pallet be on this occasion vote to emma jane greenland november by the society at london for the encouragement of art manufacture and commerce of gum be persectly melt and incorporate then throw the paste into cold water and when it be hard take it out of the water wipe it dry and beat it in one of mo . wedgwood s mortar observe to pound it at first in line cloth to absorb some drop of water that will remain in the paste and would prevent the possibility of reduce it to powder which must be so sine as to paf through thick gauze it should be pound in cold place and little while at Ã  time as after long beat the friction will in degree soften the wax and gum and instead of they become powder they will return to paste make some strong gum arabick water and when you paint take little of the powder some colour and mix they together with the guiwater light colour require but Ã  small quantity of the powder but more of it must be put in proportion to the body and darkness of the colour and to black there should be almost as much of the powder as colour have mix the colour and no more than can be use before they grow dry paint with fair water as be practise in painting with water colour ground on the wood be first paint of some proper colour prepare in the same manner as be describe for the picture walnuttree and oak be the fort of wood commonly make use of in italy for this purpose the painting should be very highly finish otherwise when varnisn the tint will not appear united when the painting be quite dry with rather hard brush pass it one way varnisn it with white wax which be put into a earthen vessel and keep melt over very slow fire till the picture be varnissied take great care the wax do not boil afterwards hold the picture before fire near enough to melt the wax but not make it run and when the varnissi be entirely cold and hard rub it gently with line cloth should the varnisn blister warin the picture again very slowly and the bubble will subside when the picture be dirty it need only be wash with cold water the venetian method of colour by timothy sheldrake efa the method of painting practise in the venetian school ee the cloth be primed with colour in distember of brownisn hue such as would properly enter into the darkest part of the picture the most transparent colour be the properest believe umber be most generally use break with red vellow or blue accord to the tint intend to be produce and dilut with chalk or whiting to the proper degree of strength upon the ground so prepare the subject be correcty draw with umber pure or mix with lake blue or black and with the same colour those shadow that be darker than the ground be then paint in the artist then paint the light with pure white in solid body where the light be brightest or where the full effect of colour be to be produce and where the demitint be afterwards to be scumble it thinner by degree till it united with the shadow in this manner the chiarooscuro be finish as much as possible and the local colour of every object in the picture the greater silver pallet be vote to mo . sheldrake sor this dissertation on painting in oil in by tne society institute at london for the encouragement of art manusacture and commerce glaze over it all the colour use in this part of the work be ground in oil which be absorb into the ground the picture remain flat something like picture in watercolour or crayon it be then varnissied till saturate with varniss and the full of every colour bring out the picture be then complete upon the most superficial view of this process it will be evident that picture paint by it be as to all visible pro perty varnish picture for the small quantity of oil that have be use sunk into the ground and never could rise again to be hurtsul while the varnisn be lay on after the colour give they all the brilliancy and durability they could derive from that vehicle without be liable to the objection that be make to painting in varnissi supposing it to be use in the same manner as oil be in painting with oil it be true that this mode of painting be itself liable to some objection these have endeavour to obviate and shall therefore mention hereafter here it may be observe that as any varnisn may be use it be to this circuistance we must attribute the different degree of durability in picture of the venetian school have see some that would resist the most powerful solvent while other be destroy by the weakest though all possess the apparent property that distinguish the venetian picture from all other as do not pretend to degrade painting to the rank of mechanical art that may be infallibly practise by receipt shall be permit to observe that this be the general system of the venetian school wlich have see variously modify in the work of different artist of that as well as of the flemissi which be derive froi it it be susceptible of a almost infinite number of modification in proportion to the talent the judgment of and the object to be paint by the artist who may adopt it this be the case if it be prove by experiment that effect similar to those of the venetian picture may be produce by this method and that the system have strong tendency to produce that brilliancy and harmony of colour as be so much admire with more certainty and facility than those quality can be obtain by any other mode of painting once afk sir joshua reynold by what circumstance in the management of picture he think the harmony of colour be to be producedp he reply a unity of light and a unity of shadow should pervade the whole he explain to I the difficulty of reduce the various colour of all the object that may be include in picture and the various modification of those colour to the simple harmonious state he describe and illustrate what he have say by this simile picture to possess harmony of colour should look as if it be paint with one colour suppose umber and white and when the chiarooscuro be com plete the colour of each object should be glaze over it observation from such authority be impressed with peculiar force on my mind and if can retrace its peration on fubject which have so long engage my atten tion should say sir joshua s observation be the clue that guide I through all my experiment and hope will enable I to prove that the beautiful and simple practice which he suggest as Ã  simile be literally the practice of that school upon whose work he idea of colour be found at the same time may observe that the fact seem to have elude he observation or he would not have use it as comparison to simplisy he description of practice which he think both difficult and complex in the newfonian doctrine of light and colour it be believe that all colour be inherent in light and be rendered visible by the action of various body which reflect particular ray and absorb the rest without disputing the truth of this doctrine it be to be obser that painter must consider the object he represent as be analogous to the material he use to represent they and in this view of the subject colour be to be consider as property inherent in body which be render visible by the contact of light colourless or at least monocoloured substance and shadow the mere privation light picture may reprefent either groupe of figure or other object in room or any object in the open air whatever the situation may be it reprefent certain object in give space possess individually they peculiar colour and generally expose to the operation of light the quantity of light each can receive must depend upon its form and its position respect that part whence the light come for in proportion as other part recede fromn the light the shadow become visible but shadow be no thing but privation of light and privation of colour in pro portion as the light be diminish some attention to these circumstance will perhaps enable we to demonstrate the truth of sir joshiua s position if globe of one colour be expose in painter  room properly darken that part which be nearest the light will partake of its colour the next part will shew the true colour of the object that which first recede from the light will be Ã  little obscure the next little more and so on progressively till that part which be farthest from the light will lose its colour and appear equally dark with the shadiest part of the room now we know this globe be of one unifori colour the variation we see in disserent part of it be only deception occasion by the accession of light in some part and the privation of it in other what be true of this one object and its part would be equally true of any number of object whatever they colour or relative situation might be if they be place together in the same room each would possess its own indvidual colour each would partake of the general light in proportion to its situation and of the general darkness in proportion as it recede from the light all this may be easily conceive but the difficulty and in the ordinary mode of painting ferious one it be be to represent such object with the appearance of trutÃ  and preserve the harmony necessary to constitute whole the venetian painter however by whatever mean they obtain they knowledge discover method so simple that perhaps no other can produce such brilliant effect and undoubtedly not with facility and certainty at all comparable with they  the artist will remark that in describe the whole of the venetian method of painting have say nothing of the manner of produce those demitint which conduce so much to the brilliancy of picture which be so difficult to execute and in which he most frequently fail those tint be in the ordinary mode of painting produce by the mixture of black grey blue or brown accord to the judgment of the artist with the local colour of the object it be these tint which from they be make with such colour it be difficult to get clear and which never be so clear in any other as in the venetian and in some of the flemisn picture which be paint upon analogous principle the fact be that those painter produce all such tint without the admixture of any colour to represent they and by method so like that by which they be produce in nature that this circumstance alone ensure degree of brightness to they colour and of harmony to they shadow that it be perhaps impossible to produce in a equal degree by any other mode of painting it be Ã  singular fact which have not skill in physie to be able to account for though by numerous experiment have ascertain beyond contradiction that if upon any degree of brown between the deepest and the lightest brown yellow we paint pure white in gradation from the solid body to the lightest tint that can be lay on all the tint between the solid white and the ground will appear to be grey intense in proportion to the depth of the ground and the thin of the white lay upon it but in every case all the tint lay upon one ground will harmonize with each other and form one connect chain if may use the expression which will persectly unite the highest light with the darkest shade if then we examine the component substance of venetian picture we shall sind the lighter part consist only of white to represent the light and of the local colour of the object it represenis the demitint be imitate by a appearance almost as deceptive as the similar appearance in nature but in every other method of painting these demitint be produce by mixing some dusky colour with the local colour and the light the comparison of these inethod will afford demonstrative reason why the venetian must be brighter than any other mode of painting have shew as near to Ã  demonstration as the nature of the subject will perhaps admit why those part of venetian picture that be connect with light and colour be brighter than the corresponding part of any other picture it remain to explain the cause of similar superiority in the darker part of the same picture it have be say with much confidence that as wlite represent light so black be the representative of darkness but though this may be true in physie it certainly be not so in painting for the painter s art be to represent object as they appear in point of colour to be not as they really be thus if know a object be perfectly black and be to reprefent it as it appear to be at the distance of fisty foot black from the pallet will not produce good imitation of it because the interposition of sisty foot of the atmosphere will cause it to appear of colour disserent froi what it really be and vice versa if we go into cavern cellar or room so darken that the colour of no object can be distinctly see and if we there hold any solid black substance near to the eye the disference will be visible at once the black object will be immdiately distinguished by its solidity and colour from the surround space and such remote object as may be obscurely visible through it these object actually possess they individual colour and only appear indistinctly from the absence of light the black object may appear solid and of that colour from its proximity to the eye but the circumjacent one will appear of colour perfectly distinct from it more or less transparent in proportion to they distance from the eye and shew portion of they individual colour accord to the quantity of illdefine light that may be admit thus we see if may venture to mention so notorious Ã  truism that shadow be nothing real they only seem to exist in the absence of light and give to object a illdefine appearance distinct from though in some instance mix with light and colour in disserent degree but as the painter must represent this appearance by something real he choose the colour most analogous viz brown and the most transparent of they class to represent this transparent but imperfectly define appearance in nature it have be suppose that the venetian painter have some peculiarly rich and transparent brown colour which be see to pervade all the work of that school the effect of which no modern artist have be able to imitate and which therefore be suppose to have be lose be it not very probable that colour so common as to pervade the work of the worst as well as of the best artist of that school should be so unaccountably lose and as the effect attribute to it may be easily produce by the mode of painting have describe it be not unreasonable to conclude that this muchlament colour have never exist it be well know that chalk and other earth of the same kind lose when wetter much of they whitenef and become semitransparent it be equally certain that if umber or other earth be mix with chalk and saturate with varnisn after they be lay on the cloth they in like manner become diaphanous and be infinisely more brilliant than the same colour can be when mix with white lead and oil this seem on good grounds to have be the basis of the venetian method of painting and all its peculiar efsect at least if may draw any conclusion srom the numerous experiment have make but if artist whose talent will enable they to repeat those experiment to the hest advantage should be induce to do so the fact will be determine in the most satisfactory manner may now be permit to say it be difficult if not impossible to conceive Ã  theory more simple more beautiful or more true than that of sir joshua reynold it be certainly impossible to form practice more simple or more conformable to that theory than the one have describe as will be evident on recapitulate the particular the artist have determine what hue should pervade he picture form he ground with that colour prepare in distemper upon this the subject be draw and the darker shade paint in with transparent colour which sunk into the ground with pure white he then paint in all the light and demitint and lastly glaze in the colour each in its place upon apply the varnisn the darker shade be as to body incorporate with the ground and thus though different in colour appear thinner and more transparent than any colour could be when lay upon any ground the sull effect of every colour be bring out and the picture be complete whoever have be accustom to paint or to mark the progref of painting in the common way and will reslect on the practice of the method have describe by artisis who have be bring up to it must see that such artist would paint with degree of facility expedition and certainty as to effect that could never be equal in the ordinary way of painting in oil besides it will be evident that a artist would not onsy paint picture himself with more facility but if he have occasion could employ number of subordinate artist upon large work and put those work out of hand with more uniformity as to merit and effect than if he be to employ such affistant in similar work if they be to be paint in the common way be sensible how litile attention will and perhaps ought to be pay to observation on painting if make by those who be not professionally artist for practical man acquire kind of knowledge that can never be obtain in any other way but at the same time they contract prejudice that often prevent they from sully investigate any novelty in practice that may be offer to they notice the speculative man on the contrary who investigate the property of matter unshackle by practical preju dice and with idea purely chemical or philosophical will be more likely to ascertain all the fact relative to any theory that may become the object of enquiry in this way hope have proceed in this investigation have endeavour to consider picture as mass of matter pos sess the property but differ from each other in degree of brilliancy transparency and duration ought perhaps here to take leave of the subject but it may be expect that should give a account of the manner in which the picture be paint have already mention that there be some difficulty in the method of painting have describe as be that of the old artist and which would form objection of considerable force to the practice of it by artist who be well acquainted with the usual mode of painting these difficulty be first the ground absorb the oil from the colour so fast that they be not so manageable as in oilpainting secondly the effect of the picture be not see till the finish varnish be lay on and thirdly as the effect be not see till the picture be finish it will some time disappoint the artist and in that case it will be difficult if at all practicable to alter it as believe the process have describe in the beginning of this paper be similar to that of miss provis the artist who be acquainted with she recipe can afcertain whether my conjecture on this subject be right or not be certain at least that these difficulty occur in my attempt to paint and to obviate they adopt the sol low process prepare the ground in distemper and paint the dark part in the way have describe then varnisn the ground with the copal oilvarnissi till it be fully saturate and by this means the full effect of that part of the picture be see upon this paint the lighter part with white use much of the vehicle where the colour be thin and little in the folid part leave the white in they dead by this means understand the effect of my chiaro oscuro as see the effect of the demitint nearly as well as when the picture be finish upon this glaze the colour in the way have describe in the beginning of this and finish the picture often find probably from want of practice that the effect be different from what intend as the effect of the colour add to that of the chiaro ofcuro produce a essential alteration in the whole as take care in general that the defect do not arise from too much white add more where it be deficient and glaze freshn colour over it which united perfectly with what have be do before and do not give the appearance of mend picture if the defect be from too much white glaze on it colour similar to that of the ground paint with fresn white upon that and glaze the proper colour over it in this way sound could alter the picture but not so well as in the former case find could when necessary increase the effect of the picture by painting on the principal mass or maff of light with the local colour only mix with white as this practice bring those part more forward by make they appear solid and thus contrast they with the transparency of the rest of the picture in this way could use the colour temper with copal varnissi without difficulty and believe that if have be accustom to paint large picture could have paint one as large as lise with the same ease method and process or transfer painting by mo . robert salmon . the first thing to be attend to either for painting on plaster wall or ceiling or from board be that the place in which they be be secure from wet or damp if the painting be on old wall in large building and place where this can not be aftain by art then the summer season should be take for the purpose as the picture would rarely escape damage if the wet or damp get at it while under the process at the same time caution should be take that the room or place be not overheat which would also produce equally bad effect these precaution take the next thing be to examine the face of the painting if there be any hole in the same they must be carefully fill up with paste or putty of glue and whiting this if the hole be large should be twice or thrice do so as to entirely fill up and leave the face even and smooth but if there be any bruise place with paint still remain the great silver pallet be vote to mo . robert salmon sor this discovery by the society sor the encouragement of art manufacture and commerce dec. the face of the bruise part then this stop must not be apply but the secure canvass hereaster describe be press down into these place in the place that be stop there will of course appear blemishie when the picture be transfer but the process be render much more certain and sure by be so do attention must next be pay to lay down any blister or place where the paint be leave the ground this be do by introdue between the paint and the ground some very strong paste of slour and water and the face of the blistered paint be damp with wet sponge or pencil it may then be press with the hand home to the ground to which it will then adhere all the unsound place be thus secure care must be take to clear the face of any grease or dirt as also of any particle of the paste that may happen to be leave on the surface the next thing be to determine the size of the painting mean to be take off and if on plain surface board of the size of the picture must be procure of not less than a inch in thickness and frame together with wellseason wood in small pannel smooth and flushi on one side this do piece of fine open canvass must be provide such as the finest sort use for hanging paper on this canvass to be make somewhat larger than the picture and so sew together and the seam press that it be persectly smooth and even this be what call the securecanvass which be so prepare be then stick on the face of the picture with paste make of strong beer boil till it be half reduce and then mix with sufficient quantity of flour to give it very strong consistence to large picture on wall or ceiling the canvass must for some time be press and rub with the hand as smooth as possible work it from the middle to the outside so as to make it tolerably tight and observe as it dry to press it with the hand or cloth into any hollow or bruise place so that it may adhere to every part of the painting this do it be leave to dry which it will mostly do in day or two when dry second canvass of stronger and closer sort and of the same size as the other be in like manner to be attach on the top of the first this last will want very little attention as it will readily adhere to the first and be dry attention must be pay to the face thereof to take off any small knot or uneven nefs thereon which do the whole should be again cover with thin paste of size and whiting when dry to be pumice over so as to make the whole perfectly smooth and even the painting be thus secure the board already prepare to the size of the picture be to be put with the smooth side against the face thereof so as exactly to cover as much as beintend to be transfer the edge of the canvass which as before direct be leave larger than the painting be then to be pull tight over and closely nail to the edge of the board if the painting be large either on ceiling or wall the board must by proper support be firmly fix against the picture so that it can readily be lower down when the plaster and painting be detach the canvass and board be fix the painting from wall or ceiling be to be freed together with certain portion of the plaster this with proper care and atten tion may be readily do if on ceiling the first thing be to make some hole through the plaster round the outside of the board and painting and with small see to see the plaster from one hole to another till the whole be disunit from the other part of the ceiling this do the workman must get at the upper side of the ceiling where he must free the plaster from the lath by breaking off the key thereof and with chissel cut out the lath whereby the plaster together with the picture will be leave rest on the board and support if there be apartment over the ceiling the readiest way will be to take up sew of the floor board above if next the roof mean may always be find to get into the fame and although at first this operation may appear difficult vet it be presume no difficulty will be find by any ingenious workman if the painting be on brick or stone wall the same must be cut away at top and down the side of the painting and then by means of chissel or saw in wood handle of different length the wall must be cut away quite behind the painting leave the same together with the plaf tering rest on the board this operation may sometimes be do with see or if the wall be not thick nor the other side of much consequence the brick or stone may be take out from that side leave the plaster and painting as before this last method have not practise the other of cut away some part of the wall have and see no difficulty or very great labour in the operation but that of course must be various accord to the texture of the wall and mortar if painting be on curve furface such as the cove of ceiling then the only difference of operation be that some rib of wood must be cut out and boarded smooth to the eurve of the surface of the painting and then fix up thereto in place of the before describe bear board the painting be then to be freed and leave with the plaster rest on the bearer for painting paint on wainscot or board the same secure and process be exactly follow only that as the wainscot or board can always be cut to the size want or lay horizontal the secure canvass be stretch thereon and turn over the edge of the same till it be dry after which the edge be again turn up and nail to the board in the same manner as those from wall have as before describe in any of the aforemention cuse freed the painting from they original place you have then get they secure to two thickness of canvass with they face next and on to the board prepare for that purpose which be the case they can readily be remove to any room or shop to be finishied as sollow have get the painting into the shop or room which should be moderately warm and dry but by no means over heat lay the board on bench or tressel the back of the picture will be uppermost and the plaster or wood as may happen be then to be clear away leave nothing but the body of paint which will be firmly attach to the secure canvass to perform this large rasp narrow plane and chissel will he requisite this operation be difficult to describe but would soon be learn by any one who make the attempt nor be it very tedious and be perform the picture be ready to be attach to its new can vass as follow the painting be clear and lay on the board the back thereof be to be paint successively three or four time over with any good strongbody paint leave each coat to dry before the other come on day or two between each will generally be find sufficient each of these coat and particularly the first should be lay on with great care take but small quantity in the brushi at time and lay it very thin this precaution be necessary to prevent any of the oil or paint from search through any small crack or hole that may happen to be in the face of the picture which would run into the paste and so attach the secure canvass to the picture as to prevent its be afterwards get off if any of these hole or crack be observe they should be stop up with the glue and whiting paste and the painting then repeat till com plete coat be form on the back of the picture and it be then ready for attach to its canvass which be do by spread all over the picture Ã  paste make of copal varnissi mix with stiff white lead and small quantity of any other old fat paint all which be spread equally over with pallet knife such canvass as the first securecanvass be lay thereon and strain and nail round the edge of the board in which state it be leave till it become tolerably dry and then second canvass of stronger fort must be in like manner attach on the first and leave till it be perfectly dry and hard this mostly take about two month and the louger it be leave the more secure the painting will be attach to its canvass and less liable to crack or sly therefrom when sufficiently dry all the four canvass be to be unnailed from the board and the edge turn up the reverse way and nail to proper stretch frame this be do by unnailing from the board part on each side at Ã  time and immediately nail it to the stretch frame so as never to leave the canvass to rack or partially stretch which would damage the picture in this manner by degree the cloths be entirely detach from the board and firmly fix on the stretch frame the superfluous leave larger than the frame may then be cut off and the wedge put in the frame and moderately tightened up there remain then only to clear the face of the painting from the secure canvass which be do by repeatedly wash the face with sponge and moderately warm water in do this no force or violence must be use with frequent and gentle wasning the paste will all work out with the sponge the edge of the outer canvass be then to be cut round and strip off and the other next the face of the picture be to be do in like manner which do there only remain to clear the paste clean off and repair any desect and the picture will be as strong as if paint on the canvass for take picture off wall without take the wall down or cut away more thereof than the plaster the follow process be propose the face of the picture to be first secure in every respect in the manner before describe instead of the plain board bearer should be prepare with convex surface compose of rib hoard over so as to form part of cylinder of not less than five seet radius and as long as the height of the picture this bearer be prepare in order to apply it floor or platform should be erect and place horizontally with its surface level and its edge immediately in contact with thie bottoin of the picture mean to be transfer the use of this platformn be for the abovedescribe bearer to rest and move upon which bearer should be set on its end with one edge in contact with the wall at one side of the picture consequently the other edge will be at some distance from the wall accord to the size of the picture and convexity of the bearer be thus place the superfluous edge of the securecanvass should be turn over and nail to that edge of the bearer that be next the wall this do the operation of cut away the plaster should be begin which may be do with the corner and end of fhort see by saw between the brickwork and plaster leave the thick ness or part of the thicknef of the plaster on to the painting fasten to the bearer and when this edge of the picture be fie the whole height for nine or ten inch under the edge of the bearer that be furthest from the wall must then be gently force nearer consequently the other edge together with the painting and plaster that be freed will leave the wall and give a opportunity of introdue the see behind and cut away the same to certain distance further under and by repeat this the whole of the picture will at last be freed and leave on the bearer each time the bearer be remove and as it be be roll on the vertical surface of the wall care must be take to turn and nail the securecanvass on the top and bottom edge of the bearer so as to secure the freed plaster and picture from move about and lastly before the bearer and painting be move to nail the other edge of the picture in the same way which will secure the whole to the bearer this do the picture and bearer be at liberty to be move to proper place in order to be freed from the remain plaster the edge may then be unnailed and the painting and canvass slip from this bearer on to plain board and the new canvass then put on and remain till dry as in other case it may appear that the bend of the canvass and plastering to the convex bearer will crack the plaster and damage the painting but from experience have observe that to curve of such or even less radius plaster will bend without any visible crack even on the exterior part thereof and that part next the bearer not have occasion in bend ing to extend its part will confequently be much less liable to be disturb by such bend employ in common purpose of painting and may be use in nicer but will require wash over and then it be little inferior to flake white notwithstanding its cheapnef it be frequently adulterate by the maker or wholesale dealer by add chalk or powder tale which may be see by compare pure piece with fuspect one as the fraud will appear by the difference of the weight but to prove it more exactly use the follow means take a ounce of the white lead suspect and mix it well with about half a ounce of pearl affy or of any fix alkaline salt and about quarter of a ounce of charcoal dust and have put they into crucible give they strong heat the lead will by this means be reduce to its metallic state and be weigh will shew by what it may fall short of the weight of a ounce the proportion of the adulteration about Ã  tenth part be allow for the corrod acid which form part of the white lead calcine to burnt hartshorn take horn or bone and burn they in any common fire till they become coal or be calein to some deÂ¬ gree of whitenef then have freed they carefully from any coal or filth reduce they to gross powder and put they upon vessel make in sorm of common earthen dissi of ground crucible and stourbridge clay and well dry and procure this to be place in tobaccopipemakeror potterfurnace during the time they keep they pipe or pot in the fire the earth of the horn or bone be thus thoroughly calcine it must be very well levigate with water and it will he yet further improve by be carefully wash over this be pure white nor will change by eitlier air or time for the nicest purpose it be much use in water painting and will not turn black in the manner flake white and white lead sometimes will it be therefore preser by the more experienced painter pearl white be prepare by drying or calein oyster shell at fire and take that part of the powder that be of perfect whiteness levigate it well on stone and wash it over it be serviceable in miniature painting troy white or spanish white may be use in water colour from the follow preÂ¬ paration take pound of chalk and soak it well in water then wasn over all the fine part and have pour off the first water add another quantity in which two ounce of allum be dissolve let they stand for day or two stir the chalk once in six or eight hour be ni then the chalk again over till it be render perfectly fine and pour off as much of the water as can be sepaÂ¬ rate from the chalk by that means take off the remainder of the dissolve allum by several renew quantity of fresn water aster the last water be pour off put the chalk into one of the cullender filter with line cloth over the paper and and when the moisture have be sufficiently drain off from it lay it out in lump to dry on proper board shell white be make of the clear shell when the inner skin be peel off levigate to powder of proper fineness and wash over it be use by some in water colour and preser to flake white class viii of black colour lamp black there be no other preparation than procure it good from burn oil in confine place and collect the soot it mix well either with oil or water and be esteemed as the principal black in all nicer kind of painting take plate chip or shaving of ivory and soak they in hot linseed oil or iffiling be to be more easily procure they may be use moisten with the hot oil put they into Ã  vessel which will bear the fire cover they with fort of lid make of clay and sand which should be dry and the crack repair besore the vessel be put into the fire procure this vessel to be place in tobaccopipe makeror potterfurnace or any other fuch fire and let it remain there during one of they heat when it shall be take out the ivory will be burnt properly and must be asterwards thoroughly well levigate on the stone with water or it should indeed to have it perfectly good be also wash over it be not so much use as lamp black ow perhaps to its drying slowly in oil or to the frequent adulteration with charcoal dust which render it of blue cast otherwife it be if genuinely prepare from the ivory full clear black and extremely serviceable indian ink the true indian ink be import from china and be of consistence when dissolve with water extremely well adapt to the pencil it be much use in miniature painting and drawing of small kind there be fort frequently sell for it make as follow take of isinglass six ounce reduce it to size by gissolving it over the fire in double its weight of water take then of spanishi liquorice one ounce and dissolve it also in double its weight of water and grind up with it a ounce of ivory black prepare as above direct in add this mixture to the size while hot and stir the whole together till all the ingredient be thoroughly incorporate then evaporate away the water in balneo mariae and cast the remain composition into leadÂ¬ ed mould grease or make it up in any other form the precede be the chief of the substance there will be occasion to mention in draw and painting but crayou and enamel colour will be treat of in they place those person who be accustom to paint in oil generally purchase they colour ready prepare in bladder compleat set of which with pallette and requisite for painting may be procure at the colourshop compleat set of watercolour be also sell in box with peneil for miniature painting draw the price from eight shilling to three guinea as the oil colour prepare in bladder if they be keep long become useless and as those who be not profess artist seldom paint so much as to use they without great waste it become Ã  desideratum that some method should be find to render they more durablethis mo . blackmen have accomplish and at the same time have make they portable that they can be use with equal ease with the common watercolour cake we give the method of prepare they from vol xii of the transaction of the society for the encouragement of art manufacture and commerce method of prepare blackmans oilcolour cake take of the clearest gum mastick reduce to fine powder four ounce of spirit of turpentine one pint mix they together in bottle stir they frequently till the mastick be dissolve if it be want in haste some heat may be apply but the solution be best when make cold let the colour to be make use of be the best that can be procure take care that by wash they be bring to the greatest degree of finenef possible when the colour be dry grind they on hard close stone porphyry be the best in spirit of turpentine add small quantity of the mastick varnissi let the colour so ground become again dry then prepare the composition for form they into cake in the follow manner procure some of the purest and whitest spermaceti you can obtain melt it over gentle fire in clean earthen vessel when fluid add to it one third of its weight of pure poppy oil and stir the whole well together these thing be in readiness place the stone on which you colour be ground on frame or support and by means of charcoal fire under it make the stone warin next grind you colour sine with muller then add Ã  sufficient quanÂ¬ tity of the mixture of poppy oil and spermaceti work the whole together with the muller to proper consistence take then piece of fit size for the cake you intend to make roll it into ball putit into mould press it and it will be complete when these cake be to be use they must be rub down in poppy or other oil or in mixture of spirit of turpentine and oil as may best suit the convenience or intention of the artist of painting painting be the art of represent to the eye by means of figure and colour every object in nature that be discernable by the sight and of express the various emotion of the mind by a admirable effort of human genius it offer to we vision every thing which be most valuable in the universe its empire extend over every age and country it present to we the heroic deed of ancient time as well as those with which we be more conversant and distant object equally with those we daily see in this respect it may be consider as supplement to nature which give we only view of present object the painter who be distinguished for noble and profound concention who convey to the spectator the sentiment with which he be himself inspire who animate they with he genius and make last impression on they mind this artist be poet and worthy to share in the glory of homer but if he seek only to please or astonisn by the illusion of colour he must rest content with the secondary merit of flatter the eye with variety of tint or make a industrious assemblage of multiplicity of object the poet or the painter who excel in they profefsion deserve all the respect due to genius they be of the number of those man whom nature sparing of she best gift grant but occasionally to the inhabitant of the earth if they be sublime they elevate the human race if tney be agreeable only they excite those sweet sensation necessary to we happiness of the school school in the sine art denominate class of artist who have learn they art from certain master either by receive he instruction or study he work all the painter which europe have produce since the renovation of the art be class under the follow school the school of florence of rome of venice the lombard french german flemisn dutch and englisn school the school of florence be remarkable for greatnef for attitude seemingly in motion for Ã  certain dark severity for a expression of strength by which grace be perhaps exclude and for character of design approach to the gigantic it can not be deny that the production of this school although overcharge possess a ideal majesty which elevate human nature above mortality the tuscan artist satisfied with command admiration seem to have consider the art of pleasing as beneath they notice cimabue noble florentine bear in the year the first who after the destruction of the roman empire practise the art of painting which he learn from some greek workmen who be employ by the tuscan government he picture be as may be imaÂ¬ gine in a ordinary stile but they receive the applause of he countryman so little practise be he in he art that in he picture to prevent the possibility of mistake in the judgment of the spectator respect the subject inscription be add with sentence come out of the mouth of the person represent in they to cimabue succeed giotto he disciple who when shepherd s boy be find by he draw the figure of shieep upon stone he soon become more celebrate than he master and be account one of the founder of the florentine school from this time the number of artist encrease so rapidly that in they establish society under the protection of st . luke towards the commencement of the sisteenth century the work of the florentine possess something of grandeur life and expression and massacio be mention as the first who give force and relief to he picture but michael angelo and leonardo de vinci be the glory of the school of florence the former superior in grandeur in boldness of conception and knowledge of design the latter in all the amiable part of the art leonardo posÂ¬ sess of fine imagination and full of sensibility devote himself in painting to express the affection of the soul and if in this sublime branch of the art he be afterwards surpass by raphael he have at least the glory not only of surpass all the painter who go before he but of pursue path which none of they have attempt michael angelo lef form to experience sweet affection than violent pafsion seek in nature what the strength of man might accomplisn not that which constitute beauty better acquainted with anatomy than any other artist he seem too eager to display he knowledge of it and to have forget that the muscle be less visible in child female and young man than in confirm and vigorous manhood you never perceive say meng muscle at rest and although he know admirably well how to place they they action be very frequently inconsistent with they situation he never say sir joshua reynold attempt the lesser elegance and grace of the art and if any man have right to look down upon the lower accomplishiment as beneath he attention it be certainly michael angelo artist s assistant roman school have exceed every other in beauty of form grandeur stile and just exprefsion this be to be attribute to the superior advantage they enjoy in have access to those precious remains of ancient art which rome in its prosperity draw from decline greece or which be execute in its own bosom by grecian artist this school be altogether devote to the principal part of the art to those which require genius and vast conception and be no farther occupy with colour than be necessary to establisn difference between painting and sculpture or rather between painting varied with colour and claro obscuro at the head of this school be place raphael sanzio bear at urbino in the early part of he lise he have accustom hiinself to copy nature with great exactness but without be solicitwe about the choice or perhaps ignorant that any choice be necessary when he see the work of leonardo de vinci and michael angelo they give to he genius new direction he perceive that there be something more in the art of painting than simple imitation of truth but the work of those master be not sufficient to enable he to make the best choice and he continue in uncertainty till he see at rome the work of the ancient then he perceive that in imitate they he have only to follow the natural impulse of he genius he design be admirablehe excel in represent the charact er of philosopher apostle and other figure of that kind the greek be superior to he in ideal figure but if he do not succeed in embellish nature in the same high degree he see at least and imitate she in whatever be expressive and beautiful the greek say meng sail with majesty between earth and heaven raphael walk with propriety on the earth composition be in general say the same authorl of two kind raphaelbe the expressive kind the other theatrical or picturesque which consist of a agreeable disposition of the figure lanfranc be the inventor of the last and after he pietro de cortona the preference be give to raphael because reason preside over all he work or at least the greatest part of they he never allow himself in common idea nor ever susser he accessary figure to turn the attention from the principal object of the piece the excellency of raphael say sir oshua reynold lay in the propriety beauty and majesty of he character he judicious contrivance of composition correctness of draw purity of taste and the skilful accommodation of other man s conception to he own purpose the school of venice be the child of nature the venetian painter not have under they eye like the roman the remains of antiquity be destitute of the means of form just idea of the beauty of form and of expression they copy without choice the form of nature but be chiefly delighted with the beauty which present themselves in the mixture and variety of colour colour be they chief object and they endeavour by the agreement and opposition of colour and by the contrast of light and shade to produce Ã  vigorwe effect to demand and fix the attention in this they succeed dominico who be the second italian artist who paint in oil have educated before he quit venice giacomo bellino who have two son gentile and giovanni both of whom be painter the latter contribute much to the progress of he art in painting constantly in oil and after nature giorgione and titian he scholar be consider as the founder of the venetian school giorgione distinguished himself by better taste in designing than he master but he chiessy surpass hiin in colour he die in he zad year tiziano vecelli better know by the name of titian be instruct in the school of bellino to copy nature in the most servile manner but when he have see the work of giorgione he begin to study the ideal in colour the truth of history be not to be expect in hipniing or in those of the artist of the same school he paig little attention to the consistance of scene to the costume to expression adapt to the subject or finally to the accomÂ¬ modation of part which characterise the work of those who have study the ancient the artist of the florentine and roman school paint most commonly in watercolour or in fresco and instead of nature they finish they work from they sirst sketch titian paint in oil and finisn from the object in nature and this practice join to he exquisite talent give the greatest truth to he colour he be portrait painter be also of advantage to he as colourist in this department he be accustom to the colour of nature in carnation and drapery he be landfkape painter and here he also take the colour from nature titian have in general little expression in he picture and he sometimes introduce figure which augment the coldness of the piece for if it be true that head even in historical painting ought to be study from nature it be true also that individual nature should not be present but one general and ideal the painter fail in the effect which he ought to produce if when he represent achille hector and cÃ¦sar he personage be familiar to we observation the distinguishing characteristy of the lombard school be grace a agreeable taste for design without great correction mellowness of pencil and beautisul mixture of colour antonio allegri call corregio be the father and greatest ornament of this school he begin by imitate nature alone but as he be chiefly delighted with the graceful he be careful to purisy he designhe make he figure elegant and large and varied he outline by bequent undulation but he be not always pure and correct corregio paint in oil kind of painting susceptible of the greatest delicacy and sweetnef and as he character lead he to cultivate the agreeable he give pleasing captivate tone to all he picture he seek transparent colour to represent shade conformable to nature and adopt manner of glaze which actually render he shadow more obscure it be chiesly in this that he deserve to be imitate for he light be too clear and somewhat heavy and he fleshy part be not sufficiently transparent harmony and grace be connect together and on this account corregio be excellent also in harmony as the delicacy of he taste suffer he not to employ strong opposition he naturally become great master in this part which chiesly consist of easy gradation from one extreme to another delicate taste in colour perfect knowledge of the claro obscuro the art of uniting light to light and shade to snade together with that of detach object from the ground inimitable grave and perfect harmony be the quality which distinguished corregio from all painter and place he near the head of he profefsion the carracci lewis augustin and hannibal form what be call the second lombard school which be bequently distinguished by the name of the school of bologna lewis be the master of the other two he have study the work of titian and paolo veronese of andrea del sarto of corregio and of julio romano but he chiesly endea vour to imitate the manner of corregio hannibal sluctuate between corregio and titian augustin they rival in painting have he mind cultivate by learn and devote part of he time to poetry music and other many exercise these three painter often employ they talent upon the same work and they united labour seem to be animated with the same spirit they establish a academy at bologna callacademia degli desiderosi but it be afterwards know by the name of the academy of the carracci in this school be teach the art of construct model perspective and anatomy lesson be give on the beautiful proportion of nature on the best manner of use colour and on the principle of light and snade the academy separate on hannibalgo to rome to adorn the gallery of the cardinal farnese the work of the carraci be often from the resemblance of they manner confound together nevertheless each of they have decide character distinct from the other two lewis have less fire but more grace and grandeur augustin have more spirit in he conception and more pleasantness in he execution hannibal be characterize by boldness by design more profound by a exprefsion more lucky and by a execution more solid lodovico carracci say sir joshina reynold appear to I to approach nearest to perfection he unaffected breadth of light and shadow the simplicity of colour which hold its proper rank do not draw aside the least part of the attention from the subject and the solemn essect of that twilight which seem diffuse over hie picture appear to I to correspond with grave and dignify subject better than the more artificial brilliancy of sunshine which enÂ¬ lighten the picture of titian hannibal be esteem by the best judge as model for beauty and design those who blame he for become less colourist at rome than he be at bologna ought to recollect that it be he performance at rome which have chiefly secure he reputation severe critic have maintain that he design be too little vair in the figure that he excel only in male beauty and that in imitate ancient statue he excites some resemblance but without arrive at that sublimity of idea and of stile which chaÂ¬ racterise the ancient the success of hannibal and the reputation which he acquire have be pernicious to the art he successor delude by these consideration have make he the object of they imitation without ascend to the source from which he derive he knowledge and which they never could equal the result have be that instead of beÂ¬ come equal to hannibal they have often copy he imperfection the french school have varied so much under different master that it be difficult to characterise it some of its artist have be form on the florentine and lombard manner other on the roman other on the venetian and few have distinguisned themselves by manner which may be call they own in speak in general term of this school it appear to have no peculiar character and it can only be distinguishied by its aptitude to imitate easily any impression and it may be add speak still in general term that it unite in moderate degree the different part of the art without excel in any one of they it be equally dissicult to determine the progress of painting in france miniature painting and painting on glaf be early cultivate in that country and in these two kind the italian have often recourse to french artist cousin painter on glaf and portrait painter be the first who establish any kind of reputation in france he be correct but possess very little elegance of design painting for some time encourage by francis the first fall into state of languor from which it be not recover till the reign of louis xiii jaque blanchard form in the venetian school and call the french titian flourissied about this period but as he leave no pupil to perpetuate he manner he must be regard as Ã  single good artist and not as Ã  founder of the french school in the same manner poussin whom they call the raphael of france educated no pupil and form no school he stile and manner of painting be describe by sir joshua reynold as simple careful pure and correct no work of any modern have so much the air of antique painting as those of poussin he best performance have certain dryness of manner which seem perfectly correspondent to that ancient simplicity which distinguisn he stile in the latter part of he lise he change from this manner into one much soster and richer where there be greater union between the figure and the ground he favorite subject be ancient fable and no painter be ever better qualiÂ¬ fie to paint such subject as he be eminenily fkill in the knowledge of the ceremony custom and habit of the ancient and well acquainted with the different chaÂ¬ racter which those who invent they give they allegorical figure poussin more admire than imitate have no manner of insluence in form the french school simon vouet have this honour because he pupil in the happy age of the art in france confer on it the greatest splendour vouet be man of distinguished ability but the school which he erect would have have no continuance if he scholar have pursue he manner of painting he have kind of grandeur and facility but he design be false with regard to colour and without any idea of exprefsion he have the merit of destroy the insipid taste which reign in france and point the way to better if vouet lay the foundation of the french school le brun finishied the edifice he have noble conception and fruitful imagination on no occasion be he inferior to the vast composition he undertake few painter have united greater number of essential quality and accessory of the art he draw well but he design be far from be so elegant as that of raphael or so pure as that of domenichino and it be less lively than that of hannibal carracci whom he have take as model in drapery he follow the roman school but in this part he be not equal to the painter of urbino he have study the expression of the affection of the soul but aft er observe the general character and establish the prin cipal trait of expression he think he have reach the whole extent of this subject which be so infinitely extend he be delighted with great composition and he give they life animation and variety but he want the vigour and inspiration of raphael he composition be found on philosophical principle but those of raphael be create le brun think well raphael poussin and le sueur think most profoundly le brun have elevation but he be not elevate like raphael to the sublime in colour le brun do not follow the painter of the venetian school the sweet attraction and strong and solid colour of the school of rome and lombardy seem rather to have be the object of he imitation and from they also he learn a easy agreeable and bold manageÂ¬ ment of the pencil eustach le sueur be the cotemporary and rival of le brun and no painter approach nearer to raphael in the art of drapery or in dispose the sold in the most artful and the noblest manner he design be in general more slender than that of raphael but like he it be formed on the model of the ancient like raphael he bepresent with art and precision the affection of the soul like he he varied the air of the head accord to the condition the age and the character of he personage and like he he make the different part of every figure contribute to the general effect he intention in composÂ¬ ing be to express he subject not to make shine conÂ¬ trast or beautiful group of figure not to astonish and bewitch the spectator by the deceitsul pomp of theatrical scene or the splendour of the great machine he tone be delicate he tint harmonious and he colour though not so attractive as those of the school of venice and flander be yet engage they steal peaceably on the soul and fix it without distraction on the part of the art superior to that of colour if le sueur have live longer or if like le brun he have be employ under court fond of the art and of learn to execute the great work of the age the french school would have adopt Ã  disserent and better manner the noble heauty of he head the simple majesty of he drapery the lightness of he design the propriety of he expreffion and attitude and the simplicity of he general disposition would have form the character of this school the deceitful pomp of theatrical decoration would have be more lately introduce or perhaps would never have appear and paris might have be the counter part to rome but as le brun by a accidental concurrence of favourable circumstance be the faffiionable painter to be emÂ¬ ploy or rewarded it be necessary to imitate he manner and as he imitator possess not he genius he fault beÂ¬ come not only current but more deform the french school not long ago change its principle and if they follow the road which they have mark out for themselves they have the chance of become the most rige observer of the law impose on the greek artist the count de caylus pupil of buchardon who by he rank and fortune have the means of encourage the imitator of the ancient and of the master of the i century first sorm the design of restoring pure taste to the art of painting he be seconded by the talent of vien a artist who have only occaston to have he lesson and he example lay before he in this manner commence revolution so much the more wonderful as it be scarcely ever know that any nation substitute system of simple and rigid excellence in place of Ã  salse and glitter taste the history of all nation on the contrary discover Ã  gradual progref froin Ã  rude beginning to perfection and afterwards to a irremediable decay the french have the prospect of stop short in this ordinary course they have begin in manner which promise success and the best consequence may be expect from the study of those master piece of ancient art with which the capital the of french republic be ornament and which to the honour of the government be open to the inspection of every one it be almost needless to mention that these invaluable work be the most capital production of art which be formerly at florence rome turin naple and the city in the austrian netherlands in germany there can hardly he say to be school as it be continuation of single artist who derive they manner from different source of originality and imitation there be some german painter of eminence when the art emerge from its barbarous state first begin to be cultivate in europe as they be totally unacquainted with the ancient and have scarcely access to the work of they contemporary in italy they copy nature alone with the exception of somewhat of that stisfness which form the gothic manner but this be by no means the case with they successor part of whom be educated in flander and part in italy for if mengst or deitrich be comprehend in this school there would be nothing peculiar to its manner discover in they work it be therefore necessary to confine we observation to the more ancient german painter in whom the gothic stile be conspicuous albert durer be the first german who correct the bad taste of he countryman he excel in engrave as well as painting he genius be fertile he composition varied he thought ingenious and he colour brilliant he work though numerous be finish with great exactness but as he owed every thing to he genius and as work of inferior merit be by the salse taste of the time prefer to he it be impossible for he altogether to avoid antonio raphael meng be bear at ausig in bohemia he first patron be augustus id king of poland and he last and most generous be charle king of spain he grand work be the apotheosis of st . eusebius at rome andhis most beautiful picture that of the nativity at madrid there be Ã  great rivalsnip exist between reynold and meng who possess little original genius and be scrupuluus if not servile copyist he be coldly correct and the greater plagiary in the chamber of painter at florence be the portrait of meng and reynold by themselves strongly characterise by the dignify but sull air of the one and the universal in telligence and liberality of the other the fault of he predecessor he be blame for stiffnef and aridity in he outline sor little taste or grandeur in he expression for ignorance of the costume of Ã¦rial perspective and of gradation of colour but he have study lineal perspective architecture and fortification john holbein nearly cotemporary with albert durer paint in oil and watercolour he excel chiesly in history and in portrait painting he colour be fresni and brilliant and he work highly finishied but in he historical subject he drapery be not in so good taste as those of albert durer the flemish school be recommend to the lover of the art by the discovery or at least the first practice of oil painting it have be generally attribute to john van eyck who be accustom to varnisn he distemper picture with composition of oil which be pleasing on account of the lustre it give they in the course of he practice he come to mix he colour with oil instead of water which he find render they brilliant without the trouble of varnishing from this and subsequent experiment arise the art of painting in oil of which wonderful docovery van mand give Ã  very particular account but the truth of it be now very much question and it be even prove that this method of painting be discover long besore the time of jolin van eyck it be admit that joln and he brother eubert be the sirst who bring it into general practice by shew the excellence of which it be susceptible they own painting have acquire all over europe great reputation for the softnef and delicaey of they colour the attention of the italian painter be soon excite and antonio de massina persorm Ã  journey into flander sor the express purpose of acquire the conÂ¬ sidence of john van eyck and of discover the secret john of bruge be the sounder of painting as profeffion in flander peter paul ruben be the founder of the art this extraordinary person produce a immense number of work he excel equally in historical ortrait and landskape painting in fruit flower and in animal he invent and execute with the greatest facility the work of ruben be destitute of that soft inspiration productive of sweet and pleasant effect so conÂ¬ spicuous in the work of raphael but he possess that prightlinef of genius and strength of mind which be ever ready to burst forth in wonderful and astonishing effect he figure appear to be the exact counterpart of he conception and they creation nothing more than simple act of the will he chief merit consist in colouring though in this branch of the art he have not equal titian he be the first among painter eminent for pomp and majesty the first among those who spedk to the eye and the power of the art be often by he carry almost to enchantment ruben say sir joshiua reynold be remarkable in Â¬ stance of the same mind be see in all the various part of the art the whole be so much of piece that one can fcarce be bring to believe but that if any one of they have be more correct and perfect he work would not be so compleat as they appear if we should allow greater urity and correctuess of draw he want of simplicity in composition colour and drapery would appear more grof the flemisn school of which ruben be the greatest master be remarkable for great brilliancy of colour and the magie of the claro obscuro to these may be join prosound design which be yet not found on the most beautiful form composition possess of grandeur certain air of noblenef in the figure strong and natural exprefsion in short kind of national beauty which be neither copy from the ancient nor from the roman or lombard school but which deserve to please and be capable of pleasing to speak in general term and without regard great number of exception the dutch school carry none of the above quality to great perfection except that of colour far from excel in the beauty of head and form they seem to delight in the exact imitation of the lowest and most ignoble they subject be derive from the tavern the smith s shop and from the vulgar amusement of the rudest peasant the exprefsion be sufficiently mark but it be the expression of passion which debase instead of ennoble human nature it must be acknowledge at the same time that the dutch painter have succeed in several branch of the art if they have choose low object of imitation they have represent they with great exactness and truth must always please if they have not succeed in the most difficult part of the claro obscuro they at least excel in the most strike such as be in light confine in narrow space night illuminate by the moon or by torch and the light of smith s sorge the dutch understand the gradation of colour they have no rival in landskape painting consider as the faithful representation of particular scene but they be far from equal titian poussin claude lorrain who have carry to the greatest perfection the ideal landskape and whose picture instead of be the topographical representation of certain place be the combine result of every thing beautiful in they imagination or in nature the dutch distinguisn in so great estimation be some of the landskape by this master that two picture know by the name of the altiere claud from they have be long in the altiere palace at rome be lately purchase by mo . beckford for the almost incredible sum of zooo guinea themselves by they perspective by they cloud sea scene animal fruit slower and infect and they excel in miniature painting in short every thing which require faithful imitation colour and Ã  nice pencil be well execute by the dutch painter holland have also produce history painter as octavius van be and vander hilst the rival of vandyke but it be not in the work of these artist that we find the character of the dutch school neither be the origin of they style to be derive from the the work of luca of leyden though from the time he flourish viz about the end of the fifteenth century he may be consider as the patriarch of the dutch school luca paint in oil in watercolour and on glass and the kind of he painting be history landfkape and portrait if miniature painting be consider as character of the dutch school cornelius polembourg may be regard as the father of it he possess the colour delicacy of touch and disposition of the claro obscuro which chiesly distinguish this school and if any thing be to be add it be want of correctness in he design but if the choice of low figure be its chief characteristic this be to be find in the greatest perfection in the work of the celebrate rembrandt vanryn and it be the more offensive in this artist as he composition frequently require a opposite choice of figure as he father be miller near leyden he education must altogether have depend on the exertion of great talent and the study of nature he study the grotesque figure of dutch peasant or the servant of a inn with as much application as the greatest master of italy would have study the apollo of belvidere or the venus de medicis this be not the manner of elevate himself to the noble conception of raphael but it be acquire the imitation of truth in vulgar painting rembrandt say mo . descamp may be compare to the great artist for colour delicacy of touch and claro obscuro he delighted in great opposition of light and shade and he seem to be chiesly attentive to this branch of the art he workshop be occasionally make dark and he receive the light by hole which fall as he choose to direct it on the place which he desire to be enlighten he painting be Ã  kind of magie no artist know better the effect of different colour mingle together nor could better distinguisn those which do not agree from those which do he place every tone in its situation with so much exactness and harmony that he need not to mix they and so destroy what may be call the slower and fresnness of the colour such be the power of genius that rembrandt with all he fault and they be enormous be place among the greatest artist by mo . descamp who have attentively examine he work and be himself a artist john de laer miniature painter and who make choice of he subject from common life deserve Ã  distinguish place in the dutch school he paint huntscene the attack of robber public festival landikape and sea view he have correct design and employ vigorous and lively colour vanostade although bear at lubeck gerrard dow metzu miris wouverman berghem and the celebrate painter of slower van huysum belong to the dutch school the greater part of the school of which we have treat have no longer any existence italy alone have four school and there only remain at present Ã  very sew italian artist know to foreigner the school of ruben be in vain seek for in flander if the dutch school still exist it be not know beyond the precinct of holland meng german artist have render himself famous in we day but it be in italy that he chiefly improve he talent and exercise he art dietrich another german have make himself know to stranger but two solitary artist do not form school the englisn school have be form in we own time it be connect with the royal academy in london institute in but although as school it do not exist before that time yet ever since the revival of the art and the consequent encouragement give to they by the fovereign of europe england have possess portrait painter of ability and perhaps it have be ow only to the remarkable partiality of the nation for this branch of the art that the more noble one of history painting have be neglect hans holbein be rank by du pile among the german painter yet he paint he most celebrate work in england he be the first painter of eminence encourage by henry the eighth who excite by the fame which he cotemporary francis and charle have gain as paÂ¬ tron of the art employ he and invite titian to england but merely as portrait painterwhether the reward offer be not think adequate to he merit or for some other cause perhaps the knowledge that he talent for historical design would be depreciate he firmly reject the overture the public work of holbein in england be four only as enumerate by mo . walpole which be rather group of portrait than history nothing could be more unsavourable to female beauty than the dress of those time holbeinman be therefore much more characteristic than he lady even he anna bulleyne be deficient in loveliness as he pourtray she in he likeness of anne of cleve he be say to have sacrifice truth to slattery yet the original which be in the possession of mo . barret of lee in kend be below mediocrity there be in he majesty s collection fery of portrait of person of quality in the reign of henry the eighth sketch upon paper with crayon probably take al single sitting they have lately be engrave by bartolozzi with all the strength and spirit of the original

paperoffice the fame of lsaac oliver who flourish about the latter end of the reign of elizabeth as miniature painter be well know he receive some instruction from bederico zucchero who be in england at that time where among other portrait he paint that of the unfortunate mary queen of scot oliver draw well and make some admirable copy from the italian master greatly as lsaac be celebrate he be afterwards exceed by he son peter who draw portrait of king jame the first prince henry prince charle and most of the court about this period cornelius janson fkilful portrait painter come to england from amsterdam and paint the king and many of the nobility but he merit be eclip by vandyke of whom he be jealous and the civil war break out he fleed from england cornelius janson be remarkable for high finisning in he drapery many of which be black which seem to add roundness relief and spirit to he figure and carnation he be say to have use ultra marine in the black colour as well as in the carnation to which may be attribute they lustre even at this day the duke of beaufort have capital portrait of janson by himself but one of he best performance be the rushiout family at northwick in

arrive in england charle however continue he pension during lise vandyke have he first instruction from vaubale of antwerp but he soon find in ruben master every way more suite to direct he genius and to maÂ¬ ture that consummate taste which he very early show mark of possess under the instruction of ruben he acquire such sxill in he art that the portrait of he master s wife which he paint whilst he be yet he disciple be esteem one of the best picture in the low country he paint for he master two admirable piece one represent christ seize in the garden and the other the crow he with thorn when

leicesterfield where he continue till the time of he death a ingenious critic thus delineate sir joshua s professional character sir joshua reynold be most assuredly the best portrait painter that this age have produce he possess something original in he manner which distinguished he from those painter who precede he he colour be excellent and he distribution of light and shadow so generally judicious and varied that it most clearly shew that it be not mere trick of practice but the result of principle in history painting he ability be very respectable and he invention and judgment be sufficient to have enable he to have make Ã  very distinguished figure in that very arduous branch of he profession if the exclusive taste of he country for portrait have not discourage he from cultivate Ã  talent so very unproductive and neglect he draw though incorrect have always something of grandeur in it he own picture might well be apply what he use to say respect those of ruben ee they resemble say he et wellchoose nosegay in which though the coloure be splendid and vivid they be never glaring or oppressive to the eye sir joshua be great experimentalist with respect to the composition of he colour at first he use preparation from vegetable which he relinquissied for mineral he be know to have purchase picture by titian or he scholar and to have scrape off the several layer of colour in order to ascertain it and discover he secret the englisn school of painting must acknowledge sir joshiua reynold as its great founder under royal auspices in the establishment of the academy the pure precept which he lay down in he annual oration be exempliÂ¬ fie in he own work he most favourite painting be garrick between tragedy and comedy the ugolino in prison in which he have imitate michael angelo in he the terribil via as it be call by augustino caracei in he fonnet on painting it be sir joshua s triumph in the art the nativity the infant hercule the death of

beautiful manner of treat that very frequent sulject to speak generally of the englisn school they colour be less glaring than that of the flemisn or venetian master they talent be more admirable in portrait than history particularly in those of female examine say french writer picture of french woman paint by a artist of that nation and you will generally find in place of expression fore grin in which the eye and forehead do not partake and which indicate no affection of the soul examine the picture of a english woman do by one of they painter and you observe a elegant and simple expression which make you at once acquainted with the person represent perhaps it might be difficult to assign to the english school as exhibit in the royal academy any perfect discrimination as each painter either implicitly follow he own genius or attach himself to that particular manner of the foreign school which approach nearest to he own idea of excellence but there be other exhibition in which the best painter of the age have exert fuccessful competition alderman boydellshakespeare gallery macklingallery of subject take from the english poet boyer s gallery of those illustrative of englisn

of living artist we decline speak with the exception of those whose eminence as man of genius have place they beyond competition in the work of northcote opie and lawrencer we hail the continuance of a englisn school and the happy application of those classical precept which its founder sir joshiua reynold deliver with so much dignity and effect the principle of the art be exemplify in they work and genius so direct will reach degree of perfection of which the modern school painting in europe will aspire to with unsuccessful emuÂ¬ lation lawrence s colossal figure of satan and beelzebub from milton now the duke of norsolkmr. kemble in coriolanus sir richard worsleyand as rolla in pizarro have gain he unanimous admiration design in painting good taste and correctness of design be so necessary that painter who want they must not hope to attract esteem design be the foundation of all the other part its elegance and correctness be no less necesary in painting than purity of language be in eloquence we be tell by pliny that all the statue before the time of daedalus be represent stiff and motionless with the foot close and arm hang in right line to they side or they have only the head finish the body arm and leg not be express these be the rude essays of design in the progref of the art and in abler hand motion be fashiioned into grace and life be heighten into character beauty of form be no longer confine to mere imitation which always fall short of the object imitate to make the copy equal in its effect it be necessary to give it a advantage over its model the artist therefore observe that nature be sparing of she perfection and that she effort be limit to part avail themselves of she inequality and draw those scatter beauty inte more happy and compleat union rose from a imÂ¬ perfect imitation to perfect ideal beauty we be inform that the painter of greece press in crowd to design the bosom and breast of thais nor be the elegant proportion of phryne less the object of they study by this constant contemplation of the beautisul they enrich they imagination and confirm they taste from this fund they draw they system of beauty and though we should consider they but as imitator of the part we must allow they to have be the inventor in the composition should we doubt the justice of the preference give to invent beauty over the real we need only contemplate the fine proportion and the style of draw in the laocoon and gladiator and mark the expressive energy of apollo and the elegant beauty of the venus de medicis these be the utmost effort of design it can reach no farther than full exertion of grace beauty and character the design of the ancient be distinguishied by a union of proportion fimplicity of contour and excellence of character there be no one excellence of design from which we derive such immediate pleasure as from gracefulness of action if we observe the attitude and movement of the greek statue we shall mark that careless decency and unassected grace which ever attend the motion of man unconscious of observation raphael have be wonderfully happy in imitate this simple elegance of the antique the most courtly imagination can not represent to itself a image of more win grace than be to be see in he sancta cÃ¦cilia indeed a elegant simplicity be the characteristie of he design we no where meet in he the affect contrast of michael angelo or the study attitude of guido the design of raphael be in its beginning dry but correct he enlarge it much on see the drawing of michael angelo of too just a eye to give intirely into the excess of he model he strike out middle style which however be not so happily blend as quite to throw off the inssuence of the extreme hence in the great he be apt to swell into the charge in the delicate to drop into the little he design notwithstanding be beautisul but never arrive to that persection which we discover in the greek statue he be excellent in the character of philosoplier apostle and the like but the figure of he woman have not that elegance which be distinguisned in the venus di medicis of the daughter of niobe in these he convex contour have Ã  certain heaviness by which in seek to avoid he fall into dryness still less pardonable he proportion be esteem excellent yet not have form he manner on the most beautiful antique we do not see in he that elegant symmetry that freedom in the joint which lend all they motion to the laocoon and gladiatorl instead of these the figure of michael angelo be he model in the great style whence have quit the line of nature and not have substitute ideal beauty he become too like he original as may be see in he incendio di borgo would we therefore place raphael in he true point of view we must observe he in the middle age in old man or in the nervous nature in he madonnahe know how to choose as likewise how to vary the most beautiful part of nature but he know not how to express beauty superior to the natural thus in he galatea where he have attempt character of perfect beauty he have fall short of the beauty of he madonnathe cause of this seem to be that he draw the former after he own idea which be im perfect in the latter he copy beautiful nature which be almost perfect Ã  second observation will confirm this opinion of all the object of painting angel call moft for ideal beauty and those of raphael be by no mean distinguished in this particular one of the greatest excellence of design be grace corregio in this be inimitable he constant aim be grace and happy effect of light and shade wave and varied contour be necessary to this end hence he studi oussy avoid right line and acute angles as too simple in they effect thus the habit and necessity of continually varying he outline throw he into little error in drawing which spring not from a ignorance of this branch of he art but from predilection for another and there be few who would wishi those inadvertence away accompany with the charm which give occasion to they we may affirm of hii design where it be not sacrifice to he more favorite aim that it be often masterly and always pleasing quality rarely to be meet with in those servile painter who think they have attain every persection if they keep within the rule of draw such painter say quintilian while they think it sufficient to be free from fault fall into that capital fault the want of beauty we shall close this article with a account of the apollo belvidere and the celebrate groupe of laocoon so long the pride of rome but remove to paris during its ravage by the french republican as describe by the late abbe winckleman the apollo belvidere et of all the production of art which have escape the ravage of time the statue of apollo belvedere be unquetionably the most sublime the artist found this work upon imagination and have only employ substance for the purpose of realize he idea as much as the description which homer have give of apollo be superior to those give of he by other poet in the same degree be this statue superior to any other statue of that deity its stature be above that of man and its attitude breathe majesty a eternal spring such as reign in the delightful field of elysium clothes with youth the manly charm of he body and give brilliancy to the animated structure of he limb endeavour to penetrate into the region of incorporeal beauty try to become the creator of celestial nature in order to elevate you soul to the contemplation of supernatural beauty for here there be nothing mortal neither thie vein nor sinew

subject not allow the artist to embellisn nature he have exert himself to display contention and vigour in those place where there be the greatest agony there be also great beauty the left side on which the furious serpent make its attack seem to be in the greatest pain from its proximity to the heart this part of the body may be call prodigy of art laocoon wishie to raise he leg in order to escape no part of the figure be in repose the very flesn by the skill of the artist have the appearance of be benumb of colour colour though subject greatly inferior to many other which the painter must study be yet of sufficient importance to employ considerable share of he attention and to excel in it he must be well acquainted with that part of optic which have the nature of light and colour for its object light however simple and uncompound it may appÃ©ar be nevertheless make up as it be of several distinct substance and the number and even dose of these ingredient have be happily discover by the modern every undivided ray let it be ever so fine be little bundle of red orange yellow green azure indigo and violet ray which while combine be not to be distinguished one from another and form that kind of light call white so that white be not colour perse as the learn de vinci so far it feem the precursor of newton expressly affirm but a assemblage of colour now these colour which compose light although immuÂ¬ table in themselves and endue with various quality be continually however separate from each other in they reflection from and passage through other substance and thus become manifest to the eye graf for example reflect only green ray or rather reflect green ray in greater number than it do those of any other colour one kind of wine transmit red ray and another yellowish ray and from this kind of separation arise that variety of colour with which nature have diversify she various pro duction .. man too have contrive to separate the ray of light by make portion of the sun s beam paf through glass prism for after pass through it they appear divide into seven pure and primitive colour place in succession one by the other like so many colour on painterpallet now though titian corregio and vandyke have be excellent colourist without know any thing of tliese phyfical subtlety that be no reason why other should neglect they for it can not but be of great service to painter to be well acquainted with the nature of what he be to imitate and of those colour with which he be to give life and perfection to he design not to speak of the pleaÂ¬ sure there be in be able to account truly and solidly for the various effect and appearance of light from due temper for example and graduate of the tint in picture from make colour partake of each other becording to the reflection of light from one object to ano Â¬ the there arise in some measure that sublime harmony which may be consider as the true music of the eye and this harmony have its foundation in the genuine principle of opty now this could not happen in the system os those philosopher who hold that colour do not originally exist in light but be on the contrary nothing else than so many modification which it underwent in be reflect from other substance or in pass through they thus subject to alteration without end and every moment liable to perish be that the case body could no more receive any hue one from another nor this body partake of the colour of that than scarlet for example because it have the power of change into red all the ray of the sun or sky which immediately sall upon it have the power of change into red all the other ray reflect to it from blue or any other colour in its neighbourhood whereas allow that colour be in they own nature imiutable one into another and that every body reflect more or less every sort of coloured ray though those ray in the greatest number which be of the colour it exhibit there must necessarily arise in colour place near one another certain particular hue or temperament of colour nay this influence of one colour upon another may be so far trace that three or you body of different colour and likewise the intenseness of the light fall upon each be assign we may easily determine in what situation and how much they would tinge each other we may thus too by the same principle of optic account for several other thing practise by painter insomuch that person who have carefully observe natural effect with a eye direct by solid learning shall be able to form general rule where another can only distinguish particular case but after all the picture of the best colourist be it be universally allow the book in which young painter must chiefly look for the rule of colour that be of that branch of painting which contribute so much to express the beauty of object and be so requisite to represent they as what they really be giorgio and titian seem to have discover circumstance in nature which other have entirely overlook and the last in particular have be happy enough to express they with pencil as delicate as he eye be quick and pierce in he work we behold that sweetnef of colour which be produce by union that beauty which be consistent with truth and all the insensible transmutation all the soft transition in word all the pleasing modulation of tint and colour when young painter have by close application acquire from titian whom he can never sufficiently dwell upon that art which of all painter he have best contrive to hide he would do well to turn to bassano and paolo on account of the beauty boldnef and elegance of they touch that richnef softness and freshness of colour for which the lombard school be so justly cry up may likewise be of great service to he nor will he reap less benefit by study the principle and practice of the flemissi school which chiesly by means of she varnish have contrive to give most enchant lustre and transparency to she colour but whatever picture young painter may choose to study the art of colour upon he must take great care that they be well preserve there be very sew piece which have not suffer more or less by the length not to say the injury of time and perhaps that precious patina which year alone can impart to painting be in some meafure akin to that other kind which age alone impart to medal inasmuch as by give testimony to they antiÂ¬ quity it render they proportionably beautisul in the superstitious eye of the learn it must indeed be allow that if on the one band this patina bestow as it really do a extraordinary degree of harmony upon the colour of picture and destroy or at least greatly lessen they original rawness it on the other hand equally impair the freshiness and lise of they piece see many year aster it have be paint appear much as it would do immeÂ¬ diately after painting behind dull glass it be no idle opinion that paolo veronese attentive above all thing to the beauty of he colour and what be call strepiro leave entirely to time the care of harmonizing they perfectly and as we may say mellow they but most of the old master take that task upon themselves and never expose they work to the eye of the public until they have ripe and finish they with they own hand and who can say whether the christ of moneta or the nativity of bassano have be more improve or injure if we may so speak by the touching and retouchings of time in the course of more than two century it be indeed impossible to be determine but the studious pupil may make himself ample amend for any injury which he original may have receive from the hand of time by turn to truth and to nature which never grow old but constantly retain its primitive slower of youth and be itself the model of the model before he as soon therefore as young painter have lay proper foundation for good colour by studying the best master he should turn all he thought to truth and nature and it would perhaps be well worth while to have in the academy of painting model for colour as well as design that as from the one the pupil learn to give they due proportion to the several member and musÂ¬ cle they may learn from the other to make they carnation rich and warm and faithfully copy the different local hue which appear quite distinct in the different part of fine bodv to illustrate still farther the use of such model let we suppose it place in different light now in that of the sun now in that of the sky and now again in that of lamp or candle one time place in the shade and another in reflect light hence the pupil may learn all the disserent efsect of the complection in different circumstance whethe the livid the lucid or transparent and above all that variety of tint and half tint occasion in the colour of the skin by the epidermis have the bone immediately under it in some place and in other greater or less number of bloodvessel or quantity of fat a artist who have long study such model would run no risk of deÂ¬ grade the beauty of nature by any particularity of stile or of give into that preposterous fulness and floridness of colour which be at present so much the taste he would not feed he figure with rose as a ancient painter of greece shrewdly express it but with good beef difference which the learn eye of modern writer could perceive between the colour of barocci and that of titian to practise in that manner be accord to great master no better than inure oneself to the commission of blunder what statue be in design nature be in colour ing the fountain head of that perfection to which every artist ambitious to excel should constantly aspire a accordingly the flemish painter in consequence of they aim solely to copy nature be in colour as excellent as they be wont to be aukward in design the best model for the tone of colour and the degradation of shade be furnishied by means of the cumeraobscura we may form general idea of the various effect of reflection from the follow example if blue be reflect on yellow the latter become greenish if on red the red become purple and so on through variety of combination and as the white be of nature to receive all the colour and to be ting with that of each reflection the painter must he caresul how he carnation may be affect by the several reflection of composition composition which may be consider as branch of invention consist in the proper station of what the inventive faculty have imagine so as to expref the subject in the most lively manner the chief merit of compoÂ¬ sition may be say to consist in that disorder which wearing the appearance of mere chance be in fact the most study effect of art painter therefore be equally to avoid the drynef of those ancient who always plant they figure like so many couple in procefsion and the affectation of those modern who jumble they together as if they be meet merely to fight and squabble in this branch raphael be happy enough to choose the just medium and attain perfection the disposition of he figure be always exactly such as the subject require in the battle of constantine they be confusedly cluster with as much art as they be regularly marshall in christ s commitment of the key to st. peter and constitute he prince of the apostle let the inferior figure of piece be place as they will the principal figure should strike the eye most and stand out as it be from among the rest this may be effect various way as by place it on the foremost line or in some otherconspicuous part of the piece by exhibit it in manner by itself by make the principal light fall upon it by give it the most resplendent drapery or indeed by several of these method nay by all of they togeÂ¬ the for bein the hero of the picturesque fable it be hut just thatit should draw the eye to itself and lord it as it be over al the other object accord to leon batista alberti painter should follow the example of comic writer who compose they fable of as few person as possible for in fact crowded picture be apt to give as much pain to the spectator as crowded road to the traveller some subject it must be grant require Ã  number nay nation as it be of figure on these occasion it depend entirely on the skill of the painter to dispose of they in such manner that the principal one may always make the principal appearance and contrive matter so that the piece be not overcrowded or want convenient rest and pause he must in word take care that he piece be full but not charge in this respect the battle of alexander by le brun be masterpiece which can never be sufficiently study whereas nothing on the other hand can be more unhappy than the famous paradise of tintoret which cover one entire side of the great councilÂ¬ chamber at venice it appear no bÃªtter than confuse heap of figure swarm cloud chaos which pain and fatigue the eye what pity it be that he do not dispose this subject aster Ã  model of he own now in the gallery of bevilacqua at verona in this last the several choir of martyr virgin bishop and other saint be judicioussy throw into so many cluster part here and there by Ã  fine sleece of cloud so as to exhibit the innuÂ¬ merable host of heaven draw up in way that make most agreeable and glorious appearance there go story to we purpose of celebrate master who in draw of the universal deluge the better to express the immensity of the water that cover the earth leave corner of he paper without figure be afk if he do not intend to sill it up no say he do not you see that my leave it empty be what precisely constitute the picture the reason for breaking composition into several group be that the eye pass freely from one object to another may the better comprehend the whole but the painter be not to stop here for these group be besides to be so artsully put together as to form rich cluster give the whole composition singular air of grandeur and afford the spectator a opportunity of discerning the piece at distance and take the whole in as it be at single glance these effect be greatly promote by due regard to the nature of colour so as not to place together those which be apt to pain by they opposition or distract by they variety they should be so judicioussy dispose as to temper and qualify each other proper use of the chiaro scuro be likewise of great service on this occasion the group be easily part and the whole picture acquire grand effect by introduce some strong falls of snade and above all one principal beam of light this method have be follow with great success by rembrandt in famous picture of he representing the virgin at the foot of the crof on mount calvary the principal light darting upon she through break of the cloud while the rest of the figure about she stand more or less in the shade tintoret too acquire great repuÂ¬ tation as well by that brifkness with which he enliven bis figure as by he masterly manner of shad they and polidoro de caravaggio though he scarce paint any thing but bassorelievos be particularly famous for introducing with great skill the effect of the chiaroscuro thing first attempt by mantegna in he triumph of julius cÃ¦sar it be by this means that he composition appear so strikingly divide into different group and among they other perfection afford so much delight through the beautiful disposition that reign in they in like manner painter by the help of perspective especially that call Ã¦rial the opposition of local colour and other contrivance which he may expect to hit upon by study nature and those who have best study she before he will be able not only to part he group hut make they appear at disserent distance so as to leave sufficient passage between they but the greatest caution be to be use in the purfuit of the method here lay down especially in the management of the chiaroscuro that the effect attribute to light and shade and to they various concomitant may not run counter to truth and experience this be capital point for this purpose painter would do well to make in little figure as tintoret and poussin use to do model of the subject that he intend to represent and then illuminate it by lamp er candlelight by this means he may come to know with certainty if the chiaro scuro which he have form in he mind do not clasti with the reason of thing by varying the height and direction of he light he may easily discover such accidental effect as be most likely to recommend he performance and so establisn proper system for the illuminating it nor will he afterward find it difficult matter to modisy the quality of he shade by softening or strengthen they accord to the situation of he scene and the quality of the light fall upon it ifit should happen to be candle or lampÂ¬ light scene he would then have nothing to do but consider he model well and faithfully copy it in the next place to turn groupe elegantly the best pattern be that of bunch of grape adopt by titian as of the many grain that compose bunch of grape someare strike directly by the light and those opposite to they be in the shade whilst the intermediate one partake of botli ight and shade in greater or less degree so accord to titian the figure of groupe should be so dispose that by the union of the chiaroscuro several thing may appear as it be but one thing and in fact it be only from he have pursue this method that we can account for the very grand effect of he piece this way in which it be impossible to study he too much the mannerist who do not follow nature in the track of the master just mention be apt to commit many fault the reason of they figure casting they snade in this or that manner seldom appear in the picture or at least do not appear sufficiently probable they be besides wont to trespass all bound in splafh they piece with light that be enliven those part which we usually term the deaf of picture this method no doubt have sometimes very sine effect but it be however to be use with no small discretion as otherwise the whole lose that union that pause that majestic silence as caracci use to call it which afford so much pleasure the eye be not less hurt by many light scatter here and there over picture than the ear be by the confuse noise of different person speak all together in a asfembly guido reni who have impart to he painting that gaiety and splendour in which he live seem enamour with bright and open light whereas michael angelo de caravagio who be of sull and savage disposition appear sondest of gloomy and cloud sky so that neither of they be qualified to handle indifferently all object the chiaroscuro may likewise prove of great service to painter in give he composition grand effect but neverthelefs the light he choose must be adapt to the situation of the scene where the action be lay nor would he be less faulty who in grottoor cavern where the light enter by chink snould make he shade soft and tender than he wlio should represent they strong and bold in a open skylight but this be by no means the only fault which mannerist be apt to be guilty of in historical piece and particularly in the disposition of they figure to say nothing of they favourite groupe of woman lie on the ground with one child at she breast and another playing about she and the like which they generally place on the first line of they piece nor of those halffigure in the back ground peepÂ¬ ing out from the hollow contrive for they they make Ã  common practice of mixing naked with clothed figure old man with young place one figure with its face towards you and another with its back they contrast violent motion with languid attitude and seem to aim at opposition in every thing whereas opposition never please but when they arise naturally from the sulject like antiÂ¬ theses in discourse as to foreshorten sigure too mucl assectation in use or avoid they be equally blamable the attitude have better be compose than otherwise it very seldom happen that there be any occasion for make they so impetuous as to be in danger of lose they equilibrium thing too much practise by some painter in regard to drapery equal care should be take to avoid that poverty which make some master look as if through mere penury they grudge clothes to they figure and that profusion which albani impute to guido say that he be rather Ã  tailor than painter the ornament of dress should be use with great sobriety and it will not be amiss to remember what be once say to a ancient painter pity you greatly unable to make helen handsome you liave take care to make she sine let the whole in word and all the different part of the composition possess probability grace costume and the particular character of what be to be represent let nothing look like unisormity of manner which do not appear less in the composition than it do in colour drapery and design and be as it be that kind of accent by which painter may be as readily distinguished as foreigner be by pronouneing in the same manner all the different language they happen to be acquainted with crayon painting whether the painter work with oil colour water colour or crayon the grand olject of he purfuit be still the same Ã  just imitation of nature but each species have its peculiar rule and method painting with crayon require in many respects treatment different from painting in oil colour because all colour use dry be in they nature of much warmer complexion than when wet with oil or any other bind fluid let this be prove by matter of factmr. cote paint portrait of sir william chamber which be in lord besborough s collection a ingenious foreigner have discover method of fix crayon picture so that iliey would not rub or receive a injury if auy accident happen to the glass the society for the encouragement of art have before offer premium to any one who should discover so valuable secret for which premium he make application mo . cote be eminent in he prosession be desire to lend picture for the trial and give he judgment which be make on this portrait of sir william chamber tlie crayon he indeed so persectly fix as so resist any ruh or brush without the leust injury which before would have entirely deface or spoiled it but the picture which before have particularly warm brilliant and agreeable effect in comparison become cold and purple and though in one sense the attempt succeed to the design intention of six the colour yet the bind qualiÂ¬ ty of whatever sluid be make use of in the process changed the complexion of the colour render the cold teint too predominant for this reason in order to produce rich picture much greater portion of what painter term cool tint must be apply in crayon painting than would be judicious to use in oil without any danger of mistake it be to be suppose the not be acquainted with this observation be one great cause why so many oil painter have no better success when they attempt crayon painting on the contrary crayon painter be so much use to those tint which be of cold nature when use wet be apt to introduce they too much when they paint with oil which be seldom productive of good effect another observation would make which require particular notice from the student who have be conversant with oil painting prior to he attempt with crayon oil painter begin they picture much lighter and fainter than they intend to finish they which present the future coÂ¬ louring clear and brilliant the light underneath greatly assist the transparent glaze and scumble colour which if they be lay over any part already too dark would but increase its heavy effect on the contrary crayon be make of dry colour be difficult to procure fufficiently dark the crayon painter therefore will find a absolute necessity to begin he picture in dark and rich as posÂ¬ sible except in the strongest light for if once the grey and light tint become predominant it will be next to imÂ¬ ossible for he in the deep shadow especially to restore depth and brilliancy have no opportunity of glaze or scumble to give the effect as the grey tint be mixture with whiting underneath will continually work up and render the attempt abortive shall now endeavour to give the student some direction towards the attainment of excellence in this art the student must provide himself with some strong blue paper the thicker the better if the grain be not too coarse and knotty though it be almost impossible to get any intirefree from knot the knot should be level with penknise or razor otherwise they will prove exceedingly troublesome after this be do the paper must be paste very smooth on line cloth previoussy strain on deal frame the size accord to the artist s pleafure on this the picture be to be execute but it be most eligible not to paste the paper on till the whole subject be first deadcoÂ¬ lour the method of do this be very easy by lay the paper with the deadcolour on its face upon fmooth board or table when by means of brush the backside of the paper must be cover with paste the frame with the strain cloth must then be lay on the paste side of the paper after which turn the paint side uppermost and lay piece of clean paper upon it to prevent fmear this be do it may be stroke gently over with the hand by which mean all the air between the cloth and the paper will be force out when the paste be persectly dry the student may proceed with the painting the advantage arise from pasting the paper in the frame accord to this method after that side of the paper should be paste which have the stroke from the wire most evident that the painting may be on the smoothest side otherwise the line which these wire have leave in the paper will prove troublesome and look unpleasant some crayon picture be paint on vellum but the animal salt in the skin very often cause they to mildew it must be confess the vellum give tne picture Ã  foft effect but it be use can not be recommend in we unsavourable climate other make use of smalt grounds le tour lately painter the picture be begin be very great as the crayon will adhere much better than any other way which will enable the student to finish the picture with firmer body of coÂ¬ lour and greater lustre the late mo . cote discover this method by accident and esteem it valuable acquisiÂ¬ tion and remember on particular occasion he bemove sine crayon picture of rozalbaand place it on another strain cloth without the least injury by soak ing the canva with wet sponge till the pafte between the cloth and paper be sufficiently wet to admit of separation when painter want to make very correct copy of picture they generally make use of tiffany or black gauze strain tight on frame which they lay flat on the subject to be imitate and with piece of sketch chalk trace all the outline on the tiffany they then lay the canva to be paint on flat upon the sloor place the tiffany with the chalk line upon it and with a handÂ¬ kerchief brush the whole over this prefent the exact out Â¬ line of the pictureon the canva the crayon painter may also make use of this method when the subject of he imiÂ¬ tation be in oil but in copy crayon picture he must have recourse to the follow method on account of the glass the picture be place upon the esel let the outline be draw on the glass with small camel s hair peneil dipÂ¬ ped in lake ground thin with oil which must be do with great exactness after this be accomplishied take Ã  sheet of paper of the same size and place it on the glass stroke of note in paris often use they with great fuccess the method to prepare they be to brush over the paper with gum water which directmy strew with smalt moderately fine the superfluous part of which should be sweep off with painterbrussi when the gum water be perfectly dry on this the picture be to be paint but we have paper now in england to be procure of so excellent texture as to render this preparation perhaps unnecessary over all the line with the hand by which mean the coÂ¬ lour will adhere to the paper which must be pierce with pin hole pretty close to each other the paper intend to be use for the painting must next be lay upon table and the pierce paper place upon it then with some fine pound charcoal tie up in piece of lawn rub over the perforate stroke which will give a exact outline great care must be take not to brushi this off till the whole be draw over with sketch chalk which be composition make of whiting and tobaccopipe clay roll like crayon and point at each end when the student paint immediately from the life it will be most prudent to make correct draw of the outline on another paper the size of the picture he be go to paint which he may trace by the precede method beÂ¬ cause erroneous stroke of the sketch chalk which be not to be avoid without great expertness will prevent the crayon from adhere to the paper ow to certain greasy quality in the composition the student will find the sitting posture with the box of crayon on he lap the most convenient method for he to paint the part of the picture he be immediately painting should be rather below he face for if it be place too high the arm will be fatigue let the window of the room where he paint he darken at least to the height of six foot from the ground and the subject to be paint should be situate in such manner that the light may fall with every advantage on the face avoid too much shadow which seldom have good effect in portrait painting especially if the face he paint have any degree of delicacy before he begin to paint let he be attentive to he subject and appropriate the action or attitude proper to the age of the subject if child let it be childishi if young lady express more vivacity than in the majestie beauty of middle aged woman who also should not be express with the same gravity as person far advanced in year let the embelÂ¬ lishment of the picture and introduction of bird animal be regulate by the rule of propriety and consistency the feature of the face be carefully draw with chalk let the student take crayon of pure carmine and carefully draw the nostril and edge of the nose next the shadow then with the faintest carmine tint lay in the strongest light upon the nose and forehead which must be execute broad he be then to proceed gradually with the second tint and the succeed one till he arrive at the shadow which must be cover brilliant enrich with much lake carmine little break with brilliant green this method will at first offensively strike the eye from its crude appearance but in finish it will be good foundation to produce pleasing effect colour be much more easily sully when too bright than when the first colour be dull to raise the picture into brilliant state the several pearly tint discernable in sine complexion must be imitate with blue verditer and white which answer to the ultramarine tint use in oil but if the part of the face where these tint appear be in shadow the crayon compose of black and white must be substitute in they place though all the face when first coloured should be lay in as brilliant as possible yet each part should be keep in its proper tone by which mean the rotundity of the face will be preserve let the student be caresul when he begin the eye to draw they with crayon ineline to the carmine tint of whatever colour the iris be of he must lay they in brilliant and at first not load with colour but execute lightly no notice be to be take of the pupil yet the stude not must let the light of the eye incline very much to the blue cast cautioussy avoid Ã  stare white appearance which when once introduce be seldom overcome preserve broad shadow throw on its upper part by the eyelashi black and heavy tint be also to be avoided in the eyebrow it be therefore best to execute they like broad glow shadow at first on which in the finish the hair of the brow be to be paint by which method of proceed the former tint will shew themselves through and produce the most pleasing effect the student should begin the lip with pure carmine and lake and in the shadow use some carmine and black the strong vermillion tint should be lay on afterwards he must beware of execute they with stiff harsh line gently intermix each with the neigbour colour make the shadow beneath broad and enrich with brilliant crayon he must form the corner of the mouth with carmine brown oker and green varioussy intermix if the hair be dark he should preserve much of the lake and deep carmine tint therein this may be easily overpower by the warmer hair tint which as observe in painting the eyebrow will produce richer effect when the picture it finish on the contrary if this method be unknown or neglect poverty of colour will be discernable after the student have cover over or as artist term it have deadcoloured the head he be to sweeten the whole together by rub it over with he finger begin at the strongest light upon the forehead pass he singervery lightly and uniting it with the next tint which he must continue till the whole be sweeten together often wipe he finger on towel to prevent the colour be sully he must be cautious not to smooth or sweeten he picture too often because it will give rise to thin and scanty effect and have more the appearance of draw than solid painting as nothing but body of rich colour can constitute Ã  rich effect to avoid this as the student find it necessary to sweeten with the singer he must continually replenisn the picture with more crayon when the head be bring to some degree of forwardnefs let the back ground be lay in which must be treat in different cover it as thin as possible and rub it into the paper with leather stump near the face the paper should be almost free from colour for this will do great service to the head and by its thin give both soft and solid appearance in the back ground also crayon which have whiting in they composition should be use but seldom or never without caution but chiessy such as be the most brilliant and the least adulterate the ground be paint thin next the hair will give the student a opportunity of painting the edge of the hair over in light and free manner when he give the finish touch the student have proceed thus far the face hair and back ground be entirely cover he must carefully view the whole at some distance remark in what respect it be out of keep that be what part be too light and what too dark be particularly attentive to the white or chalky appearance which must be subdue with lake and carmine the above method be properly put into execution will produce the appearance of painting prinÂ¬ cipally compose of three colour viz carmine black and white which be the best preparation painter can make for produce sine crayon picture the next step be to compleat the back ground and the hair as the dust in painting these will sall on the face and would much injure it if that be compleate first from thence proceed to the forehead finish downward till the whole picture be compleate back grounds may be of various colour but it require great taste and judgment to fuit they properly to different complexion in general strong coloured head should have weak and tender tint ground and on the contrary Ã  delicate complexion should be oppose with strong and powersul tint by which proper contrast between the sigure and the back ground the picture will receive great force and strike the spectator much more than it could possibly do be this circumstance of contrast not attendÂ¬ ed to young painter often treat the back grounds of picture as Ã  matter of very little or no consequence when it be most certain great part of the beauty and brilliancy of the picture especially the face depend upon the tint be well suite the dark keep in they proper place and the whole be perfectly in subordination to the face thus Ã  simple back ground require attention but the difficulty be still greater when variety of object be introduce such as hill tree building in these case one rule must be strictly attend to that each grand object be dispose so as to contrast each other this be not mean merely respect they form but they colour they light shade for instance we will suppose the figure receive the strongest light behind the figure and very near at hand be the stem of some large tree these must have shade throw over they either from drive cloud or some other interpose circumstance behind these stem of tree and at distance be see tree on Ã  rise ground these should beceive the light as contrast to the former lf a bechitectural back ground be choose the same rule must be apply suppose building at moderate distance be place behind the figure receive the light column or some other object in shadow should intervene to preserve proper decorum in the piece or what will have the same effect shadow must be throw over the lower part of the building which will give equal fatisfaction or repose to the eye it must be remember the light must be always place against the dark and the weak against the strong in order to produce force and essect and vice versa in painting over the forehead the last time begin the highest light with the most faint vermillion tint in the same place where the faint carmine be first lay keep it broad in the same manner in the next shade succeed the lightest the student must work in some light blue tint compose of verditer and white intermix with they some of the deeper vermillion tint sweeten they together with great caution insensibly melt they into one another increase the proportion of each colour as he ugdment shall direct some brilliant yellow may also be use but sparingly and towards the root of the hair strong verditer tint intermix with green will be of singular service cool crayon compose of black and white should succeed these and melt into the hair beÂ¬ neath the eye the pleasing pearly tint be to be preserve compose of verditer and white and under the nose and on the temple the same may be use beneath the lip tint of this kind also be proper mixing they with the light green and some vermillion the introduction of green and bly into the face in painting have often give surprize to those who be unacquaint with the art but there be reason sufficient for they introduction though it may appear strange at first in order to break and correct the other colour the carmine predominate in the dead colour be as have be observe the best preparation for the succeed tint the crudeness of this preparation must be correct hy varioussy intermix green bly and yellow which of these be to be use be to be determine by the degree this direction be sor the finest complexion but the student must vary nis colour accordin to he subject of carmine in the dead colour and the complexion intend the blue and yellow be of nature diametrically opposite and serve to correct the red and oppose one another the green be compound of both these colour be of peculiar use in many case be the transition be not to be so violent the student attentively consider nature will discover pleasing variety of colour on the furface and discernible through clear and transparent skin this variety will be still increase by the effect of light and shade he will perÂ¬ ceive one part incline to the vermillion red another to the carmine or lake one to the blue this to the green and that to the yellow in order to produce these different effect he will apply those colour to which the tint be most inclined yet in crayon painting it be often best to compound the mix colour upon the picture such as blue and yellow instead of green blue and carmine instead of purple red and yellow instead of orange in other circumstance the compound already mix should be use but in this case there can be no absolute rule give it must be leave to the experience and discretion of the painter though the student may be greatly assist in the commencement of he study by a able master to direct and point out the best method to treat circumstance of this nature as they occur in practice which may at first appear obscure and mysterious but will soon to good capacity become demonstrably clear upon certain and sure principle the circumstance that require different treatment be so various and so many as to render it impossible here to descend to every particular in finish the cheek let the pure lake clear they froin any dust contract from the other crayon then with the lake may be intermix the bright vermillion and last of all if the subject should requre it few touch of the orange coloured crayon but with extreme caution after this sweeten that part with the finger as little as possible for sear of produce hieavy disagreeable essect on the cheek as the beauty of crayon picture consist in one colour shiew itself throughi or rather between another this the student can not too often remark it be the only method of imitate beautiful complexion the eye be the most difficult fcature to execute in crayon as every part must be express with the utmost nicety to appear finishied at the same time that the painter must preserve its breadth and solidity while he be particularize the part to accomplishi this it will be good general rule sfor the student to use he crayon in sweeten as much and he singer as liitle as possible when he want point to touch small part with he may break off little of he crayon against the box which will produce corner fit to work with in the minutest part if the eyelashie be dark he must use some of the carmine and brown oker and the crayon of carmine and black and with these he may also touch the iris of the eye if brown or hazel make broad shadow cause by the eyelasni red tint of vermillion carmine and lake will execute the corner of the eye properly but if the eyelid be too red they will have disagrecable sore appearance the pupil of the eye must be make of pure lampblack between this and the lower part of the iris the light will catch very strong but it must not be make too sudden but be gently diffuse round the pupil tiil it be lose in shade when the eyeball be sufficiently prepare the shine speck must be make with pure white erayon which should be first break to point and then lay on firm but as it be possible they may be desective in neatness they should be correct with pin take off the redundant part by which mean they may be form as neat as can be require the difficulty with respect to the nose be to preserve the line properly determine and at the same time so artfully blend into the check as to express its projection and yet no real line to be perceptible upon close examination in some circumstance it should be quite blend with the check which appear behind it and determined entirely with slight touch of red chalk the shadow cause by the nose be generally the darkest in the whole face partake of no reflection from its furrounding part carmine and brown oker carmine and black and such brilliant crayon will compose it best the student have before prepare the lip with the strongest lake and carmine must with these colour make they compleatly correct and when finish introÂ¬ duce the strong vermillion but with great caution as they be extremely predominant this if properly touch will give the lip a appearance equal if not superior to those execute in oil notwithstanding the seem supeÂ¬ riority the latter have by means of glaze of which the former be entirely destitute when the student paint the neck he should avoid express the muscle too strong in the stem nor should the bone appear too evident on the chest as both have a unÂ¬ pleasing effect denote violent agitation of the body circumstance seldom necessary to express in portrait painting the most necessary part to be express and which should ever be observe even in the most delicate subject be strong mark just above the place where the collar bone unite and if the head be much throw over the shoulder some notice should be take of the large muscle that rise the method with which painter in oil express transparency in the lip be by painting they first with light vermillion tint and when dry touchint they over with pure lake from behind the ear and be insert into the pit between the collar bone all inferior muscle should be in general quite avoid the student will sind this caution necesary as most subject especially thin person have the muscle of the neck much more evident than would be judicious to imitate as sew neck be too long it may be necessary to give some addition to the stem fault on the other side be quite unpardonable nothing be more ungraceful than short neck in colour the neck let the student preserve the stem of pearly hue and the light not so strong as on the chest if any part of the breast appear its transparency must also be express by pearly tint but the upper part of the chest should be cosour with heautiful vermillion delicately blend with the other of the material hhe perfection of the crayon consist in great meafure in they softnef for it be impossible to execute brilliant picture with they if they be otherwise on which account great care should be observe in the prepare they of prevent they be hardin all composition slake white and white lead should be wholly reject because the slightest touch with either of these will unavoidably turn black the usual objection to crayon painting be that they be subject to change but whenever this happen it be entirely ow to a injudicious use of the abovemention white which will stand only in oil to obviate the bad effect arise from the use of such crayon let the student make use of common whiting prepare in the follow manner take large vessel of water put the whiting into it and mix they well together let this stand about half minute then pour off the top into another vessel and throw the gritty sediment away let what be prepare rest about minute and then pour it off as before which will purisy the whiting and render it free from all dirt and grittiness when this be do let the whiting settle and then pour the water from it after which lay it on the chalk to dry and keep it for use either for white crayon or the purpose of prepare tint with other colour for with this all other tint may be safely prepare the student must be provide with large slexible palletknife large stone and muller to levigate the colour two or three large piece of chalk to absorb the moisture from the colour aster they be levigate piece of flat glaf to prevent the moisture from be absorb too much till the colour be roll into form and vessel for water spirit as necessity and convenience snall direct red carmine and lake it be rather difficult to procure either good carmine or good lake good cermine be inclined to the vermillion tint and should be a impalpable powder and good lake to the carmine tint the carmine crayon be prepare in the sollow manner as they texture be inclinable to hardness instead of grind and roll they take Ã  sufficient quantity of carmine lay it upon the grindstone mix it with levigate knife with spirit of wine till it become smooth and even yet the less friction produce by the knife the better the chalkstone be ready lay the colour upon it to absorb the spirit but be careful that it be lay on in proper shape for painting the simple colour be prepare the next step be to compose the disserent tint by mixture with whiting the proportion to be observe consist of twenty gradation to one which may be clearly understand by the follow direction take some of the simple colour and levigate it with spirit of wine add about one part of wasny whiting to three part of carmine of which when properly incorporate make two parcel the next gradation should be compose of equal quantity of carmine and whiting of which sour crayon may be make the third composition should have one fourth carmine and three fourth whiting of this make six crayon which will be good proportion with the rest the last tint should be make of whiting very faintly ting with carmine of which make about eight crayon which will compleat the abovemention proportion though these tint make with whiting may be roll yet the pure carmine will not bear it but must he lest on the chalkstone till persectly dry lake lave colour very apt to be hard to prevent which the student must observe the follow particular take about half the quantity of lake intend for the crayon and grind it very sine with spirit of wine let it dry and then pulverize it which be easily do if the lake be good then take the other half and grind it with spirit after which mix it with the pulverize lake and lay it out directly in crayon on the chalk the colour will not bear roll the simple colour be thus prepare proceed with the compound crayon as direct before and in the same degree of gradation as the carmine tint vermillion or native cinnabar the best be inclined to the carmine tint to prepare this colour mix it on the stone with soft water or spirit aster which it may be roll into crayon bly prussian blue be colour very apt to bind and be render soft with more difficulty than carmine and lake the same method of preparation be to be follow with this as direct with respect to lake only it be necessary to grind Ã  larger quanÂ¬ tity of the pure colour as it be chiefly use for painting drapery blue verditer be colour naturally gritty and therefore it be necessary to be ni it well its particle be so coarse as to require some bind matter to unite they otherwise the crayon will never adhere together to accomplish this take quantity sufficient to form two or three crayon to which add piece of slack plaister of paris about the size of pea mix these well together and form the crayon upon the chalk this blue be extremely brilliant and will be of great use in heighten drapery brilliant green be produce with great difficulty which may be procure of those who make it they business to prepare they yet the follow composition will be find useful take yellow oker and after grind it with spirit mix it with the powder of prussian blue then temper it with knife and lay the crayon on the chalk without roll they besides this use kingyellow mix with prussian blue brown oker and prussian blue the crayon make of these last may be roll yellow kingyellow be the most useful and the most brilliant levigate with spirit of wine and compose the different tint as before direct yellow oker and naple yellow ground with spirit will make useful crayon orange be produce with kingyellow and vermillion ground together with spirit and the tint form as in other case but no great quantity of they be require brown cullen earth be sine dark brown after six or eight of the simple crayon be prepare several rich compound tint may be roman oker and prussian blue mix in difserent proportion will be useful produce from it by mixture with carmine in various degree black carmine and this colour mix toget ier make useful tint for painting hair several gradation may be produce from each of these by mixture with whiting umber may be treat in just the same manner only it be necessary to levigate it with spirit of wine purple prussian blue ground with spirit and mix with pulveÂ¬ rize lake will produce good purple carmine thus mix with prussian blue will produce purple something different from the former various tint may be make from either of these compound by mixture with whiting black lampblack be the only full black that can be use with safety as all other be subject to mildew cinnabar mix with carminethis be composition of great use and tint make from this with whiting will be find very serviceable carmine and black be another good compound of which five or six gradation should be make some partake more of the black and other have the carmine most predomiÂ¬ nant besides several tint by mixture with whiting cinnabar and black be also very useful compound from which several different tint should be make prussian blue and black be another good compound and will be sound of singular service in painting drapery it be impossible to lay down rule for form every tint necessary composition set of crayon there be many accidental composition entirely dependent on fancy and opinion the student should make it Ã  rule to save the leaving of he colour for of these he may form various tint which will occasionally be useful roll the crayon and dispose they for painting the different composition of colour must be cut into proper magnitude after they be prepare in order to be roll into pastil for the convenience of use they each crayon should be form in the left hand with the ball of the right first form cylindrically and then taper at each end if the composition be too dry dip the finger in water if too wet the composition must be lay upon the chalk again to absorb more of the moisture the crayon should be roll as quick as possible and when finish must be lay upon the chalk again to absorb all remain moisture after the gradation of tint from one colour be form the chalk and the grindstone should be well scrape and cleanse with water before it be use sor another colour when the set of crayon be compleate accord to the rule prescribe they should be arrange in class for the convenience of painting with they some thin drawer divide into number of partition be the most convenient method of dispose they properly the crayon should be deposit accord to the several gradation of light the bottom of the partition must be cover with bran as bed for the colour because it not only preserve they clean but prevent they break the box make use of when the student paint should be about foot square with nine partition in the upper corner on the left hand supposing the box to be in the lap when he paint let he place the black and grey crayon those be the most seldom use in the second partition the bly in the third the green and brown in the first partition on the left hand of the second row the carmine lake vermillion and all deep red the yellow and orange in the middle and the pearly tint next and as these last be of very delicate nature they must be keep very clean that the gradation of colour may be eafily distinguished in the lowest row let the first partition conÂ¬ tain piece of fine line rag to wipe the crayon with while they be use the second all the pure lake and vermillion tint and the other partition may contain those tint which from they complex nature can not be class with any of the former encaustic painting tiis method of painting have be little practise in england for the information of the curious we give the follow direction which will enable they to produce with ease picture in this very curious manner the first method be describe in letter from mo . febroni the inventor publish in maty review for mo . lewis of gottenbrun have lately execute picture accord to my manner it be do upon wood prepare with wax and be remarkable for the vivacity and splendour of its colour believe have already mention to you in what this new manner consist you melt or rather dissolve some good white wax in naptha petrolei without colour till such time as the mixture have acquire by coolÂ¬ ing the appearance of a oil beginning to freeze mix you colour in this and then keep they in small tin box ou dilute they more or less with the same naptha becording as they dry or as you wisn to use they this painting allow time enough to give all the finish you desire and if you wisfi to work in haste you may dry as fast as you please by exposing it to the heat when the picture be finish it be of that fine tone which be preferable to any varnish but if you choose varnisn only warm the picture and the naptha will evaporate when this be do you must wait till the picture cool when you must polishi it by rub it over neatly with cloth if vou wishi to have it still brighter you must melt white wax on the fire without suffer it to boil mix little naptha with this and draw layer of it over the picture already heat by means of brazier which you hold under if the picture be small or before it if it be large the colour at first appear spoiled but you restore they to they first beauty if when the layer of wax be cool you polisn it by rub with cloth it be then that the colour take the high tone of oil lf vou fear the effect of fire for you picture you be to make soap of wax which be to be do by boiling white wax in water in which you have dissolve twentieth part naptha petrolei be bituminous kind of oil issue out of certain rock in the territory of modena there be three fort more or less pure and colourless of the weight of the wax of marine alkali or sel de sourde very pure rub you picture with this soap and when it be dry polish it as beforemention if you do not choose either of these method give you painting its usual varnisn of sandarac and spirit of turpentinc this method have be find preferable to all those that have be try and superior to oil for the beauty of they colour there be many fine colour which can not be use in oil which may be make use of with great success in this method as the naptha entirely evaporate one may be asfure that this be the true method or painting in wax there be likewise much to hope for the duration of the picture paint in this manner as wax be much less liable to alteraÂ¬ tion than oil and do not so easily part with its phlogiston the ancient grecian method of painting by emma jane greenland take a ounce of white wax and the same weight of gum mastick in lachrymae that be as it come from the tree which must be reduce to coarse powder put the wax in glaze earthen vessel over very slow fire and when it be quite dissolve strew in the mastick little at time stir the wax continually until the whole quantity gold pallet be on this occasion vote to emma jane greenland november by the society at london for the encouragement of art manufacture and commerce of gum be persectly melt and incorporate then throw the paste into cold water and when it be hard take it out of the water wipe it dry and beat it in one of mo . wedgwood s mortar observe to pound it at first in line cloth to absorb some drop of water that will remain in the paste and would prevent the possibility of reduce it to powder which must be so sine as to paf through thick gauze it should be pound in cold place and little while at Ã  time as after long beat the friction will in degree soften the wax and gum and instead of they become powder they will return to paste make some strong gum arabick water and when you paint take little of the powder some colour and mix they together with the guiwater light colour require but Ã  small quantity of the powder but more of it must be put in proportion to the body and darkness of the colour and to black there should be almost as much of the powder as colour have mix the colour and no more than can be use before they grow dry paint with fair water as be practise in painting with water colour ground on the wood be first paint of some proper colour prepare in the same manner as be describe for the picture walnuttree and oak be the fort of wood commonly make use of in italy for this purpose the painting should be very highly finish otherwise when varnisn the tint will not appear united when the painting be quite dry with rather hard brush pass it one way varnisn it with white wax which be put into a earthen vessel and keep melt over very slow fire till the picture be varnissied take great care the wax do not boil afterwards hold the picture before fire near enough to melt the wax but not make it run and when the varnissi be entirely cold and hard rub it gently with line cloth should the varnisn blister warin the picture again very slowly and the bubble will subside when the picture be dirty it need only be wash with cold water the venetian method of colour by timothy sheldrake efa the method of painting practise in the venetian school ee the cloth be primed with colour in distember of brownisn hue such as would properly enter into the darkest part of the picture the most transparent colour be the properest believe umber be most generally use break with red vellow or blue accord to the tint intend to be produce and dilut with chalk or whiting to the proper degree of strength upon the ground so prepare the subject be correcty draw with umber pure or mix with lake blue or black and with the same colour those shadow that be darker than the ground be then paint in the artist then paint the light with pure white in solid body where the light be brightest or where the full effect of colour be to be produce and where the demitint be afterwards to be scumble it thinner by degree till it united with the shadow in this manner the chiarooscuro be finish as much as possible and the local colour of every object in the picture the greater silver pallet be vote to mo . sheldrake sor this dissertation on painting in oil in by tne society institute at london for the encouragement of art manusacture and commerce glaze over it all the colour use in this part of the work be ground in oil which be absorb into the ground the picture remain flat something like picture in watercolour or crayon it be then varnissied till saturate with varniss and the full of every colour bring out the picture be then complete upon the most superficial view of this process it will be evident that picture paint by it be as to all visible proÂ¬ perty varnish picture for the small quantity of oil that have be use sunk into the ground and never could rise again to be hurtsul while the varnisn be lay on after the colour give they all the brilliancy and durability they could derive from that vehicle without be liable to the objection that be make to painting in varnissi supposing it to be use in the same manner as oil be in painting with oil it be true that this mode of painting be itself liable to some objection these have endeavour to obviate and shall therefore mention hereafter here it may be observe that as any varnisn may be use it be to this circuistance we must attribute the different degree of durability in picture of the venetian school have see some that would resist the most powerful solvent while other be destroy by the weakest though all possess the apparent property that distinguish the venetian picture from all other as do not pretend to degrade painting to the rank of mechanical art that may be infallibly practise by receipt shall be permit to observe that this be the general system of the venetian school wlich have see variously modify in the work of different artist of that as well as of the flemissi which be derive froi it it be susceptible of a almost infinite number of modification in proportion to the talent the judgment of and the object to be paint by the artist who may adopt it this be the case if it be prove by experiment that effect similar to those of the venetian picture may be produce by this method and that the system have strong tendency to produce that brilliancy and harmony of colour as be so much admire with more certainty and facility than those quality can be obtain by any other mode of painting once afk sir joshua reynold by what circumstance in the management of picture he think the harmony of colour be to be producedp he reply a unity of light and a unity of shadow should pervade the whole he explain to I the difficulty of reduce the various colour of all the object that may be include in picture and the various modification of those colour to the simple harmonious state he describe and illustrate what he have say by this simile picture to possess harmony of colour should look as if it be paint with one colour suppose umber and white and when the chiarooscuro be comÂ¬ plete the colour of each object should be glaze over it observation from such authority be impressed with peculiar force on my mind and if can retrace its peration on fubject which have so long engage my attenÂ¬ tion should say sir joshua s observation be the clue that guide I through all my experiment and hope will enable I to prove that the beautiful and simple practice which he suggest as Ã  simile be literally the practice of that school upon whose work he idea of colour be found at the same time may observe that the fact seem to have elude he observation or he would not have use it as comparison to simplisy he description of practice which he think both difficult and complex in the newfonian doctrine of light and colour it be believe that all colour be inherent in light and be rendered visible by the action of various body which reflect particular ray and absorb the rest without disputing the truth of this doctrine it be to be obser that painter must consider the object he represent as be analogous to the material he use to represent they and in this view of the subject colour be to be consider as property inherent in body which be render visible by the contact of light colourless or at least monocoloured substance and shadow the mere privation light picture may reprefent either groupe of figure or other object in room or any object in the open air whatever the situation may be it reprefent certain object in give space possess individually they peculiar colour and generally expose to the operation of light the quantity of light each can receive must depend upon its form and its position respect that part whence the light come for in proportion as other part recede fromn the light the shadow become visible but shadow be noÂ¬ thing but privation of light and privation of colour in pro portion as the light be diminish some attention to these circumstance will perhaps enable we to demonstrate the truth of sir joshiua s position if globe of one colour be expose in painterroom properly darken that part which be nearest the light will partake of its colour the next part will shew the true colour of the object that which first recede from the light will be Ã  little obscure the next little more and so on progressively till that part which be farthest from the light will lose its colour and appear equally dark with the shadiest part of the room now we know this globe be of one unifori colour the variation we see in disserent part of it be only deception occasion by the accession of light in some part and the privation of it in other what be true of this one object and its part would be equally true of any number of object whatever they colour or relative situation might be if they be place together in the same room each would possess its own indvidual colour each would partake of the general light in proportion to its situation and of the general darkness in proportion as it recede from the light all this may be easily conceive but the difficulty and in the ordinary mode of painting ferious one it be be to represent such object with the appearance of trutÃ  and preserve the harmony necessary to constitute whole the venetian painter however by whatever mean they obtain they knowledge discover method so simple that perhaps no other can produce such brilliant effect and undoubtedly not with facility and certainty at all comparable with theythe artist will remark that in describe the whole of the venetian method of painting have say nothing of the manner of produce those demitint which conduce so much to the brilliancy of picture which be so difficult to execute and in which he most frequently fail those tint be in the ordinary mode of painting produce by the mixture of black grey blue or brown accord to the judgment of the artist with the local colour of the object it be these tint which from they be make with such colour it be difficult to get clear and which never be so clear in any other as in the venetian and in some of the flemisn picture which be paint upon analogous principle the fact be that those painter produce all such tint without the admixture of any colour to represent they and by method so like that by which they be produce in nature that this circumstance alone ensure degree of brightness to they colour and of harmony to they shadow that it be perhaps impossible to produce in a equal degree by any other mode of painting it be Ã  singular fact which have not skill in physie to be able to account for though by numerous experiment have ascertain beyond contradiction that if upon any degree of brown between the deepest and the lightest brown yellow we paint pure white in gradation from the solid body to the lightest tint that can be lay on all the tint between the solid white and the ground will appear to be grey intense in proportion to the depth of the ground and the thin of the white lay upon it but in every case all the tint lay upon one ground will harmonize with each other and form one connect chain if may use the expression which will persectly unite the highest light with the darkest shade if then we examine the component substance of venetian picture we shall sind the lighter part consist only of white to represent the light and of the local colour of the object it represenis the demitint be imitate by a appearance almost as deceptive as the similar appearance in nature but in every other method of painting these demitint be produce by mixing some dusky colour with the local colour and the light the comparison of these inethod will afford demonstrative reason why the venetian must be brighter than any other mode of painting have shew as near to Ã  demonstration as the nature of the subject will perhaps admit why those part of venetian picture that be connect with light and colour be brighter than the corresponding part of any other picture it remain to explain the cause of similar superiority in the darker part of the same picture it have be say with much confidence that as wlite represent light so black be the representative of darkness but though this may be true in physie it certainly be not so in painting for the painter s art be to represent object as they appear in point of colour to be not as they really be thus if know a object be perfectly black and be to reprefent it as it appear to be at the distance of fisty foot black from the pallet will not produce good imitation of it because the interposition of sisty foot of the atmosphere will cause it to appear of colour disserent froi what it really be and vice versa if we go into cavern cellar or room so darken that the colour of no object can be distinctly see and if we there hold any solid black substance near to the eye the disference will be visible at once the black object will be immdiately distinguished by its solidity and colour from the surround space and such remote object as may be obscurely visible through it these object actually possess they individual colour and only appear indistinctly from the absence of light the black object may appear solid and of that colour from its proximity to the eye but the circumjacent one will appear of colour perfectly distinct from it more or less transparent in proportion to they distance from the eye and shew portion of they individual colour accord to the quantity of illdefine light that may be admit thus we see if may venture to mention so notorious Ã  truism that shadow be nothing real they only seem to exist in the absence of light and give to object a illdefine appearance distinct from though in some instance mix with light and colour in disserent degree but as the painter must represent this appearance by something real he choose the colour most analogous viz brown and the most transparent of they class to represent this transparent but imperfectly define appearance in nature it have be suppose that the venetian painter have some peculiarly rich and transparent brown colour which be see to pervade all the work of that school the effect of which no modern artist have be able to imitate and which therefore be suppose to have be lose be it not very probable that colour so common as to pervade the work of the worst as well as of the best artist of that school should be so unaccountably lose and as the effect attribute to it may be easily produce by the mode of painting have describe it be not unreasonable to conclude that this muchlament colour have never exist it be well know that chalk and other earth of the same kind lose when wetter much of they whitenef and become semitransparent it be equally certain that if umber or other earth be mix with chalk and saturate with varnisn after they be lay on the cloth they in like manner become diaphanous and be infinisely more brilliant than the same colour can be when mix with white lead and oil this seem on good grounds to have be the basis of the venetian method of painting and all its peculiar efsect at least if may draw any conclusion srom the numerous experiment have make but if artist whose talent will enable they to repeat those experiment to the hest advantage should be induce to do so the fact will be determine in the most satisfactory manner may now be permit to say it be difficult if not impossible to conceive Ã  theory more simple more beautiful or more true than that of sir joshua reynold it be certainly impossible to form practice more simple or more conformable to that theory than the one have describe as will be evident on recapitulate the particular the artist have determine what hue should pervade he picture form he ground with that colour prepare in distemper upon this the subject be draw and the darker shade paint in with transparent colour which sunk into the ground with pure white he then paint in all the light and demitint and lastly glaze in the colour each in its place upon apply the varnisn the darker shade be as to body incorporate with the ground and thus though different in colour appear thinner and more transparent than any colour could be when lay upon any ground the sull effect of every colour be bring out and the picture be complete whoever have be accustom to paint or to mark the progref of painting in the common way and will reslect on the practice of the method have describe by artisis who have be bring up to it must see that such artist would paint with degree of facility expedition and certainty as to effect that could never be equal in the ordinary way of painting in oil besides it will be evident that a artist would not onsy paint picture himself with more facility but if he have occasion could employ number of subordinate artist upon large work and put those work out of hand with more uniformity as to merit and effect than if he be to employ such affistant in similar work if they be to be paint in the common way be sensible how litile attention will and perhaps ought to be pay to observation on painting if make by those who be not professionally artist for practical man acquire kind of knowledge that can never be obtain in any other way but at the same time they contract prejudice that often prevent they from sully investigate any novelty in practice that may be offer to they notice the speculative man on the contrary who investigate the property of matter unshackle by practical preju dice and with idea purely chemical or philosophical will be more likely to ascertain all the fact relative to any theory that may become the object of enquiry in this way hope have proceed in this investigation have endeavour to consider picture as mass of matter posÂ¬ sess the property but differ from each other in degree of brilliancy transparency and duration ought perhaps here to take leave of the subject but it may be expect that should give a account of the manner in which the picture be paint have already mention that there be some difficulty in the method of painting have describe as be that of the old artist and which would form objection of considerable force to the practice of it by artist who be well acquainted with the usual mode of painting these difficulty be first the ground absorb the oil from the colour so fast that they be not so manageable as in oilpainting secondly the effect of the picture be not see till the finish varnish be lay on and thirdly as the effect be not see till the picture be finish it will someÂ¬ time disappoint the artist and in that case it will be difficult if at all practicable to alter it as believe the process have describe in the beginning of this paper be similar to that of miss provis the artist who be acquainted with she recipe can afcertain whether my conjecture on this subject be right or not be certain at least that these difficulty occur in my attempt to paint and to obviate they adopt the solÂ¬ low process prepare the ground in distemper and paint the dark part in the way have describe then varnisn the ground with the copal oilvarnissi till it be fully saturate and by this means the full effect of that part of the picture be see upon this paint the lighter part with white use much of the vehicle where the colour be thin and little in the folid part leave the white in they dead by this means understand the effect of my chiaro oscuro as see the effect of the demitint nearly as well as when the picture be finish upon this glaze the colour in the way have describe in the beginning of this and finish the picture often find probably from want of practice that the effect be different from what intend as the effect of the colour add to that of the chiaro ofcuro produce a essential alteration in the whole as take care in general that the defect do not arise from too much white add more where it be deficient and glaze freshn colour over it which united perfectly with what have be do before and do not give the appearance of mend picture if the defect be from too much white glaze on it colour similar to that of the ground paint with fresn white upon that and glaze the proper colour over it in this way sound could alter the picture but not so well as in the former case find could when necessary increase the effect of the picture by painting on the principal mass or maff of light with the local colour only mix with white as this practice bring those part more forward by make they appear solid and thus contrast they with the transparency of the rest of the picture in this way could use the colour temper with copal varnissi without difficulty and believe that if have be accustom to paint large picture could have paint one as large as lise with the same ease method and process or transfer painting by mo . robert salmon . the first thing to be attend to either for painting on plaster wall or ceiling or from board be that the place in which they be be secure from wet or damp if the painting be on old wall in large building and place where this can not be aftain by art then the summer season should be take for the purpose as the picture would rarely escape damage if the wet or damp get at it while under the process at the same time caution should be take that the room or place be not overheat which would also produce equally bad effect these precaution take the next thing be to examine the face of the painting if there be any hole in the same they must be carefully fill up with paste or putty of glue and whiting this if the hole be large should be twice or thrice do so as to entirely fill up and leave the face even and smooth but if there be any bruise place with paint still remain the great silver pallet be vote to mo . robert salmon sor this discovery by the society sor the encouragement of art manufacture and commerce dec. the face of the bruise part then this stop must not be apply but the secure canvass hereaster describe be press down into these place in the place that be stop there will of course appear blemishie when the picture be transfer but the process be render much more certain and sure by be so do attention must next be pay to lay down any blister or place where the paint be leave the ground this be do by introdue between the paint and the ground some very strong paste of slour and water and the face of the blistered paint be damp with wet sponge or pencil it may then be press with the hand home to the ground to which it will then adhere all the unsound place be thus secure care must be take to clear the face of any grease or dirt as also of any particle of the paste that may happen to be leave on the surface the next thing be to determine the size of the painting mean to be take off and if on plain surface board of the size of the picture must be procure of not less than a inch in thickness and frame together with wellseason wood in small pannel smooth and flushi on one side this do piece of fine open canvass must be provide such as the finest sort use for hanging paper on this canvass to be make somewhat larger than the picture and so sew together and the seam press that it be persectly smooth and even this be what call the securecanvass which be so prepare be then stick on the face of the picture with paste make of strong beer boil till it be half reduce and then mix with sufficient quantity of flour to give it very strong consistence to large picture on wall or ceiling the canvass must for some time be press and rub with the hand as smooth as possible work it from the middle to the outside so as to make it tolerably tight and observe as it dry to press it with the hand or cloth into any hollow or bruise place so that it may adhere to every part of the painting this do it be leave to dry which it will mostly do in day or two when dry second canvass of stronger and closer sort and of the same size as the other be in like manner to be attach on the top of the first this last will want very little attention as it will readily adhere to the first and be dry attention must be pay to the face thereof to take off any small knot or unevenÂ¬ nefs thereon which do the whole should be again cover with thin paste of size and whiting when dry to be pumice over so as to make the whole perfectly smooth and even the painting be thus secure the board already prepare to the size of the picture be to be put with the smooth side against the face thereof so as exactly to cover as much as beintend to be transfer the edge of the canvass which as before direct be leave larger than the painting be then to be pull tight over and closely nail to the edge of the board if the painting be large either on ceiling or wall the board must by proper support be firmly fix against the picture so that it can readily be lower down when the plaster and painting be detach the canvass and board be fix the painting from wall or ceiling be to be freed together with certain portion of the plaster this with proper care and attenÂ¬ tion may be readily do if on ceiling the first thing be to make some hole through the plaster round the outside of the board and painting and with small see to see the plaster from one hole to another till the whole be disunit from the other part of the ceiling this do the workman must get at the upper side of the ceiling where he must free the plaster from the lath by breaking off the key thereof and with chissel cut out the lath whereby the plaster together with the picture will be leave rest on the board and support if there be apartment over the ceiling the readiest way will be to take up sew of the floor board above if next the roof mean may always be find to get into the fame and although at first this operation may appear difficult vet it be presume no difficulty will be find by any ingenious workman if the painting be on brick or stone wall the same must be cut away at top and down the side of the painting and then by means of chissel or saw in wood handle of different length the wall must be cut away quite behind the painting leave the same together with the plafÂ¬ tering rest on the board this operation may sometimes be do with see or if the wall be not thick nor the other side of much consequence the brick or stone may be take out from that side leave the plaster and painting as before this last method have not practise the other of cut away some part of the wall have and see no difficulty or very great labour in the operation but that of course must be various accord to the texture of the wall and mortar if painting be on curve furface such as the cove of ceiling then the only difference of operation be that some rib of wood must be cut out and boarded smooth to the eurve of the surface of the painting and then fix up thereto in place of the before describe bear board the painting be then to be freed and leave with the plaster rest on the bearer for painting paint on wainscot or board the same secure and process be exactly follow only that as the wainscot or board can always be cut to the size want or lay horizontal the secure canvass be stretch thereon and turn over the edge of the same till it be dry after which the edge be again turn up and nail to the board in the same manner as those from wall have as before describe in any of the aforemention cuse freed the painting from they original place you have then get they secure to two thickness of canvass with they face next and on to the board prepare for that purpose which be the case they can readily be remove to any room or shop to be finishied as sollow have get the painting into the shop or room which should be moderately warm and dry but by no means overÂ¬ heat lay the board on bench or tressel the back of the picture will be uppermost and the plaster or wood as may happen be then to be clear away leave nothing but the body of paint which will be firmly attach to the secure canvass to perform this large rasp narrow plane and chissel will he requisite this operation be difficult to describe but would soon be learn by any one who make the attempt nor be it very tedious and be perform the picture be ready to be attach to its new canÂ¬ vass as follow the painting be clear and lay on the board the back thereof be to be paint successively three or four time over with any good strongbody paint leave each coat to dry before the other come on day or two between each will generally be find sufficient each of these coat and particularly the first should be lay on with great care take but small quantity in the brushi at time and lay it very thin this precaution be necessary to prevent any of the oil or paint from search through any small crack or hole that may happen to be in the face of the picture which would run into the paste and so attach the secure canvass to the picture as to prevent its be afterwards get off if any of these hole or crack be observe they should be stop up with the glue and whiting paste and the painting then repeat till comÂ¬ plete coat be form on the back of the picture and it be then ready for attach to its canvass which be do by spread all over the picture Ã  paste make of copal varnissi mix with stiff white lead and small quantity of any other old fat paint all which be spread equally over with pallet knife such canvass as the first securecanvass be lay thereon and strain and nail round the edge of the board in which state it be leave till it become tolerably dry and then second canvass of stronger fort must be in like manner attach on the first and leave till it be perfectly dry and hard this mostly take about two month and the louger it be leave the more secure the painting will be attach to its canvass and less liable to crack or sly therefrom when sufficiently dry all the four canvass be to be unnailed from the board and the edge turn up the reverse way and nail to proper stretch frame this be do by unnailing from the board part on each side at Ã  time and immediately nail it to the stretch frame so as never to leave the canvass to rack or partially stretch which would damage the picture in this manner by degree the cloths be entirely detach from the board and firmly fix on the stretch frame the superfluous leave larger than the frame may then be cut off and the wedge put in the frame and moderately tightened up there remain then only to clear the face of the painting from the secure canvass which be do by repeatedly wash the face with sponge and moderately warm water in do this no force or violence must be use with frequent and gentle wasning the paste will all work out with the sponge the edge of the outer canvass be then to be cut round and strip off and the other next the face of the picture be to be do in like manner which do there only remain to clear the paste clean off and repair any desect and the picture will be as strong as if paint on the canvass for take picture off wall without take the wall down or cut away more thereof than the plaster the follow process be propose the face of the picture to be first secure in every respect in the manner before describe instead of the plain board bearer should be prepare with convex surface compose of rib hoard over so as to form part of cylinder of not less than five seet radius and as long as the height of the picture this bearer be prepare in order to apply it floor or platform should be erect and place horizontally with its surface level and its edge immediately in contact with thie bottoin of the picture mean to be transfer the use of this platformn be for the abovedescribe bearer to rest and move upon which bearer should be set on its end with one edge in contact with the wall at one side of the picture consequently the other edge will be at some distance from the wall accord to the size of the picture and convexity of the bearer be thus place the superfluous edge of the securecanvass should be turn over and nail to that edge of the bearer that be next the wall this do the operation of cut away the plaster should be begin which may be do with the corner and end of fhort see by saw between the brickwork and plaster leave the thick ness or part of the thicknef of the plaster on to the painting fasten to the bearer and when this edge of the picture be fie the whole height for nine or ten inch under the edge of the bearer that be furthest from the wall must then be gently force nearer consequently the other edge together with the painting and plaster that be freed will leave the wall and give a opportunity of introdue the see behind and cut away the same to certain distance further under and by repeat this the whole of the picture will at last be freed and leave on the bearer each time the bearer be remove and as it be be roll on the vertical surface of the wall care must be take to turn and nail the securecanvass on the top and bottom edge of the bearer so as to secure the freed plaster and picture from move about and lastly before the bearer and painting be move to nail the other edge of the picture in the same way which will secure the whole to the bearer this do the picture and bearer be at liberty to be move to proper place in order to be freed from the remain plaster the edge may then be unnailed and the painting and canvass slip from this bearer on to plain board and the new canvass then put on and remain till dry as in other case it may appear that the bend of the canvass and plastering to the convex bearer will crack the plaster and damage the painting but from experience have observe that to curve of such or even less radius plaster will bend without any visible crack even on the exterior part thereof and that part next the bearer not have occasion in bendÂ¬ ing to extend its part will confequently be much less liable to be disturb by such bend
