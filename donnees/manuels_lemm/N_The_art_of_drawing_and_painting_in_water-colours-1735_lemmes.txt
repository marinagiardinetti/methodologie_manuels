take off you impreffion as aforefaid nv the reafon why the back of the leaf be the proper fide to make the impreffion from be becaute the rib or veffel rife on that side above the flethy part of it and therefore when they be colourwith any of thefe ink will give a impreffion but in the front forefide of leaf the flethy part rife and thefe fine fibre be funk below they memorandum where vermillion be ute blue bice may be ufe either with butter or with oyl as follow fine red or blue printer ink for make impression of this fort grind either vermillion or bluc bice with some burnt linfeeoyl and

ifinglaf will appear like gold medal and if we would imitate copper medal we should mix carmine with the water we diffolve we linglat in whe prefcribe water for this end it be becaufe it will do well and may be have any where but brandy or spirit of wine will give glue much greater strength of as to be less subject to fofren by damp air when mention this tis from a experiment make for preferve the

will produce fharp and correct mould to caft another from in plaifter but this should not be ufe on silver of paris medal becaufe it will change they colour if the medal be silver nfe the same method of bind they round with paper and oyle she mix little plaifter of paris with water and fill the hoop with it then immediately fill the cafe in prinkling manner with the same plaifter till it harden and when it be dry take it from the mcdal bor from the mould caft in brimffone which be concave we again caft fuch medal in plaifter of parisa be convex oyle the mould as before and uting the plaiffer of paris as above direct of you may take off any medal or fine bassrelie with great deal of exactness even of as to form ricdal from they in any fort of metal bur there be no one that know of curious

then bind they about either with cardspaper or other pafte= board and pour on fome of the finelt plaifter of paris and water you can get and finithing the work with plaifter till it become dry and harden you will then have fine impreftion if one may to call it of the line of the place in the plaifter which will ferve to draw from when you have occation we may add htill the manner of take off any fine engraving from the top of snuffbox of watchcafe which be only hold they over the smoak of candle till they be quite black then wipe off the black with the foft part of the palm of the hand and lay on the engrave piece of white paper little weit with spunge and over that thin piece of flannel or piece of brown paper hold hard down over the engrave part and be hard rub the paper next the will receive fine impreftion as if it have be paft through roll pref we may yet recommend another method of take off medal in great perfection which be by get thin piece of lead and place the mcdal horizontally on the top of firm poft or any fleddy place lay over the lead flat piece of harder Ital and over that place piece of round turnstick fuch as be ute in the staff of broom fawn off about five of fix inch in length and hold that tight with you leave hand on the lead and flat piece of mctal frike the top of the stick fmart blow with large tiammer and the lead will be perfectly impret

thin sheet blocktin otherwife call foyle which be fold at the same place where the plaifter of paris be to be have or at fome pewtcrer shop and rub it hard upon the mcdal it will give we very good likeness of whatever medal we rub it upon the blockfin sheet mean be fuch as be lay on the back of glaffe when they be to be filverto render they lookglaffe we may alfo take impreffion from medal with putty fuch as the glazier ufe although the medal or bassreliess be underwrought another way of take off medal be to provide the scrap of shaving of white paper which you may have at the bookbinder you muft boil they well in common water till they be tender then bruife they well in mortar till they come like pafte and boil they again in springwater with little crumarabick and let this mixture fettle while pourthe water from it through sieve or linnencloth and what remain be extraordinary good to either pref into any mould or upon any medal and when the pafte be dry it will come off very fharp some medal that be underwrought can not be take off this way therefore in such cafe we muft take common glue with water melt it and when we have fixt hoop of pafteboard round the edge of we medal pour on the glue hot have firft oylthe medal with lump of greaty cotton when the glue be dry and hard we must take off the hoop and the glue will fly from the edge of the medal and it will then eafily come off be subject to bend and give way which the other thing before mention will not do we should mind to make we glue flrong enough and pour it on one third of a inch thick whe we have take the impreffion by this means we muft hoop round we mould of glue with cardpaper or pafteboard as before and oyl it of that no bubble or blifter may be feen that be to fay juft make it greaty then we may caft fome plaifter of paris in it and we shall have good copy of the medal when this be dry the gilue will fiy off or may be break off and we shall have good pattern to caft from we may likewife make

and fucceed very well anoway moboyle propofe to make tranfparent vellow which be to take the root of the mulberry which afford very yellowish uice to wath it well from the earth in common water and boil it in the lixivium peak of make with pearlafh and water from this we may take out ftrong tincture much deeper than the former but the root of the mulberry be much harder to be have than thofe of the barberrie for mulberrytree be very fcarce and the barberry be in almoff every hedge in esex about littlebury especially wirh regard to the barberryroot think it would be worth while to plant they on purpofe for the advantage that one might make from they by die the fruit in my opinion being of little or no signification but the root and the wood think will nearly antwer the jame end in produce fine yellow kellow oker will make another good pale yellow but for illuminating of print it be colour rather of too much body however be well ground with gum water it be of ufc after it have be well wathanother good yellow may be make from the plant callcelandine infute it in water and preft it gently and then boiling the li quor with little allum this yellow will be little incline to green bur the yellow which like the beft and may be ufe in feveral capacity of light and strength be that make of french berric prepared as follow take of french berry a ounce whole and boil they in pint of the lixivium make of pearlash and water till the liquor will give fine tinge of vellow to bit of paper dippin it then pour it off from the berry and when t cool put it in bottle for ofe but if we only put french berry to infufe in common wa ter they will produce good vellow but then it will not be durable then again add half pint of the same lix ivium to the berry and half a ounce of fresh berry and boil they till the liquor be as deep as gallftone which will ferve to shade all the yellow you can ufe of any fort you may boil this even to produce brown colour and with little oxgall it will ferve to shade any leafgold that have be lay on paper as direct before and be much preferable to gallftone in imitate any goldcolour it anfwer well upon tincture of gamboge or any of the former fellow nex to this be the tincture of saffron which with common water only afford bright reddith yellow fuch as one would have to cover the thadow s part of print for a orange or beldk goldcolour however there be nothing more high when we ufe saffron than when we infufe it in rectify spirit of wine but then the colour fly unless we load it with crumarabick as have tryas for deep yellow with body dutch pink come the neareft to the aforefaid itrong yellow make of french berry in point of cofour and of lighter vellow be the engliff pink which be ftill make of french berry and in body likewife can not help obferve that one may extract good yellow colour for illuminating of print from the freth root of ginger if one can sct by beld be mean the boiling of pure gold in liquor which will take away the vellow of it and bring it to be of reddith or higher colour nothing elfe fpeak this becaufe fometime one want good vellow and any one may find this any where if gamboge can be have and it make fine

cafily have during four of the summer month that be the cyanus or blue cornbottlefower which abound in almoff every cornfield child may gather it without hurt any thing about the skirt or verge of the cornfield this flower have two bly in it one of pale colour in the larger outward leave and the other deeper blue which lie in the middle of the flower both thefe will do if they be feparate from the button or canfes they grow in but the deep blue of the micddie produce much the beft colour as one may try by rub it while it be fresh to hard upon piece of good writing paper as to press out the juice and it will yield a excellent colour which will not fade as the experience of two of three year have shew I this part of the flower be therefore the principal and what be to be depend upon therefore the fame day that people gather the flower or the next at the lateff employ fome child to pick that part clean from the reft and when you have good quantity pret what juice you can from it and by add to that little allum you will have lat tranfparent blue of as bright stain colour as you would defire and in my opinion it be not inferior in beauty to uultramarine but for the other part of the flower which be paler muft obferve that when have buthel of they gather and have not a opportunity of preffing they immediately they change white to that can not commend they leave the allum should not fix they but as for the middle of the flower it be certainly as good bluc as can be defirnd and be durable be if any one should object that twill be trous blefone to make it let he confider

worth four or five pound per ounce especially when it stain to well as this do therefore should think it worth while when any one have make this experiment as have do to have piece of ground on purpofe for this uofe where ho other thing but this cornbottle or cyanus should be fown and as this flower be plentiful enough in the field between twittenham and thedington in middlefex to there may be seed enough gather of it in quarter of a hour by one hand to fow a hundred acre there be like = wife abundance of it in the large cornfield in cambridgesbire but how valuable be many thing that we daily trample under foot if we know they virtue we should ufe they pro vide we could bring they to proper market but let that be as it will gather the flower about the beginning of tune or in july or hus guft and fome you may find in may thefe be for you immediate work to make the colour of and muft be difpatch as saffron be do or it will lofe it be perfection and as happen to mention saffron which very well know the management of by drying it on kiln do not fee why thefe chife of flower may not be cure in the same manner they would certainly produce much greater body of colour and incture might be draw from they with more cafe than if we be to pressthem raw or freth from the field the way then that would have they drylike saffron be to provide in the first place fuch kiln as be ufe for cure saffron within which make fimall charcoalfire which comin nicate a hieat to the top of the kiln which be cover with a hair cloth and upon that lay on four or five street of white paper mean fuch as we ule fof cure of saffron then lay on the paper parcel of the pick flower till you have the thickness of two or three luch lay clofe and flat with knife and prinkle it with some thin cumwater then cover the cake of flower with two or three more sheet of papery and lay upon they board with little werght upon it for few minute then take off the board and take hold of all the papers with both hand turn you cake of flower upon the kiln and when tis rightly place take off the upper papers and fprinkle the cake again with tome thin gumwater and with knife fet = tle you cake of flower and lay on again you and board with weight upon it for minute of two and then turn you papers again and again till the flowercake become united and of the thickness of cake of saffron in this you will find the flower grow darker ty time they be turn till at length the cake willlook of deep blue tend to black from whence we cafily draw fuch tincture as fpeak off durinc this operation great care muft be take of the fire that it do not fcorch the flower let it be gentle and as constant as may be which will be fure way to bring you flowercake to good colour wovt advite in this cafe that whoever attempt this they should fee the management of saffron or read account that be publiffy of the curingit ir any one be defirous of fee the cure of saffron with the manner of the kiln the boff artiff that way be about chesterford and little bury in effex though think it can be of no great morent fince there be publiff large account of its preparation in mobradley montbly treatife of husbandry and gardening and in the prefent cafe of the blue have make the neceffary alceration and think give what be fufficient for fuch as be acquainted already with the cure of flower by kilndrying bur come now to fpeak of the culture of this valuable flower for muft now to call it fince be well affure of its perfection every knob or head of seed muft be openbefore we fow it for each head contain great number of seed the preparation of the ground for the reception of this seed need not be more troublefome or expenfive than common ploughing require which be do fow the seed which will come up either at the knd of auguft foon enough to ftand the winter and blofforn early the may follow or effe fow it at the end of mareh and it will begin flower the wwhen the ground be freffy follow june plowat either of thefe seafon fow the seed and harrow it in with buthe and it will prefently come up in the choice of the seed should obferve that it be gather opply in fuch field where wc be fure there grow no cornbottle of any other colour but blue and then one may expect all the plant which rife from fuch seed to produce blue flower but if they should be gather itn fuch place where there be variety of they we muft expect various sort as white red or purple although we be fure we gather the seed from fuch as be truly of the blue sort for becording to the dectrine of the generation of plant which have be explain to the world in sicat great mary inftance if there be red flower of the fame tribe with this grow near it the difference of colour will be of intermixbetween both that the seed of both will bring

all to depend upon the fellow and the blue and by the help of one and the other colour may be frame any green co= lour we pleafe the gamboge be one of we firft vellow which with the preparation of

the liquor it be boyl in be more or lef ftainwith it when it be very thin it make good glaze all over the verdigreafe ald as it sory nearer to durch pitik of gallftone coim mand almoft any colour we want be agreeably mixwith the tranfparent verdigreafe and hill be tran parent so the yellow draw from the root of barberry and thofe draw from the root of the mulberrytree will produce in great meafure the like effect be mixwith the tranfparent verdigrealc as for the verdigreafe itfelf it produce fine blucish green flow eafy in the pencil and may even ferve as a ink to write with the prepare of this colour be yet very little know and shall therefore inform my reader how to do it take of common verdigreafe three ounce break it little and boil it gently in pint of whitewine vinegar fir it continually when you perceive it to boil add little tartar break and keep you mixture ftir till you find the clear liquer of fuch colour as you would with that be of fine tranfparent green with blue calt which you may do by dip in stick and touch piece of paper with it when you have colour to you mind pour it through linnencloth into a open veffel and fet it to cool when it be quite cold keep it in clofe veffel for ofe pour out little at time as you want it for when it be expote to the air it will foon dry but be reducible again by common water when we prepare this liquid colour do not ufe the diftil verdigreafe for it will notanfwer the end we propofe hr liquid should be touch upon part of the light and shade of print and the shade afterwards coloured with sapgreenin the make this green take care you make it trong enough for it be not to be frengthiicd afterwards without the trouble of boiling afresh but may at any time be render as faint as we pleafe by mixing common water with it sapgreen be colour like that of a oakleaf if it be ufe thin with common water for this as well as the former want no crum but it will if we ufe it frong produce as dark green as any we can imagine we may try we colour firft on white dutch tile and by thin it with water render it of what strength we picafe and brighten it very much with add to it little of the liquid verdigreafc saptreen be make two way viz firf take the flower of the blue flagiris or flowerdeluce and pref they while there be any juice to be get from they boil this gently in glaze pipkin till it grow thick add little allum to it and it will make very ufeful and lafting greenin the boyling of any juice of the colour heretofore mention ufe a earthen glaze pipkin for if you boil they in veffel of metal they will fometime change from the design we intend secondly another way there be of producing sapgreen for wath or illuminating of print which be to take the juice of buckthornberry and though that juice fimply will yield only dark purple of very bafe hue yet by add tartar to it it will turn to good sapgreen and may be bring to good contiffence by boiling eyther of thefe colour will mik with the liquid verdigreafe above mention as well as make delicate shade for it there be yet one green more which be afmired by fome and carry good body with with degree of tranfparency as make it though as it be commonly yie it be fullbody colour fit only for miniature painting for this end they mix dutch pink with indigg to what degree of colour they pleafe but in the place of dutch pink my high preparation of french berry with indigo ithink much to be preferras this anfwer all the intent of dutch pink and carry tranfparency with it which the dutch pink have not and thus have give fuch a

of altey the fine defign of the work bvt we muft firft provide a indifferent coarfe paper of the colour of white brown paper for the colour of the paper be little dark give better opportunity of thew the light or white stroke of we crayon and will give good res lief to the tender part of we work again the little roughness of such paper will make the crayon of every colour express thems felve much

the field where you should take thefe prospect from these crayon be of of eaty ufe may encouage we to colour we prospect after the life where we shall difcover the different colour of the feveral field which be very different from one another accord as they happen to be croppor fituare and then the wood which be in view commonly confift of variety of tree which have every one of they they different colour which at once we may fee in we crayon and mark it as it happen to be upon we drawing but if we wood should prove all of one sort of tree we shall fill find great variety of colour in the tree produce by they dificrent situation and if we match we crayon well with the colour of we tree and other part of the prospect we shall learn by it what be natural reprefentation of thing bur to do this effectually if you can not furnith draught in colour at once take the fame hour the next day to do it in becaute as the sun happen to be at one point at one hour of the day to the next day it will be about the same point at the fame hour and if you be to miss that time the shade of all you object will be alter and you colour would be varys you fhould likewife take either the morning or
