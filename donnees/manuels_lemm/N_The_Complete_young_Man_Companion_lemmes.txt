the artist s assistant comprising the art of draw perspective etch engrave mezzotinto scrape painting color map the artist assistant part of miniature painting it be scarcely necessary for I to remark that the first and grand essential towards perfection in this art be though rough and well grounded knowledge in the art of draw both from the round and from lise and although do not sit down to write treatise on draw still bez leave to advise my reader whio wishi to arrive at perfection in the pleasing art of painting in miniature carefully to attend to vorrectness of draw as without that however brisliantly celour they picture may be still the eve of the experience ariist or connoisseur will not he impose upon by such gaudy trap hut will instantly condemn it and there by cast a indelible

certain degrae of mechanical attention to be pay to the management of the water colour to preserve they clear and free from muddine hich be much more difficult to attain than the management hy he observe the style of penciling and management of the mark of he feature and colour of he picture from the person sit to he in the management of back grounds the young painter be proper value and on the other hand of harmonizing the what of similitude in the back ground to teint in the face which otherwise in course of work to express particular part might apncar too prevalent the liighest degree of perfection we esteem in miniature pattinx be to sce fine effect produce to the naked eve and a examine it with magnifving glass to discover that tinwork in it so certain have the artist be or he toitat every stroke of he pencil tell as much as twentv secin a inserior in the art would very particularly recommend it to person who commence miniature painting and who have formerly be copy either

smaller figure ale egin hp de hend on en ont nie or loyse sih should be bring as near as possible to the center of the ivory unless the person be very tall in wliich case it must be rather higher up and if very low the contrary shall now conclude with advise the young miniature painter to be modest and attentive not by overleaping the bound prescribe by the former argue himself into too high a opinion of he ability or for want of à due observance of the latter prevent the world from perceive he be ever possess of any of the requisite necessary to constitute a artist of colour use in miniature painting in painting tlie face the yellow that be use be five viz gall stone terra sienna nottingham oker roman oker and naple yellow the latter three of which be opaque colour the other tiansparent the green be confine to one which be sap green thie bly be verditer prussian indigo smalt uitramarine and antwerp the red be carmine drop lake chinese vermillion and indian red under the class of red may also be put burnt terra sienna its colour incline much that way though more to the orange the only brown if any be use the face and burnt umber and terra de cassell and they be only to be use in the mixture of dark shadow under the nose for drapery we shall only add to the above colour lamp black king yellow and flake white of the nature and quality of colour yellow we shall first begin with gall stone genuine kind of which be very difficult to be have in london spurious kind be manu sacture from dry ox gall to which colourman put gum water and so impose it on they customer for colour wliich be one of the finest and brightest in the world and last one although in face painting it should be sparingly use its worrderful brilliancy be apt to drow all the other colour and make the workit be use in too warm in its tint to get it genuine apply to the slaughtermen who will examine the gail hladder of the oxen in many of which gall stone tb concrescence form in the bladder be find by this mode only will the artist or amateur attain possession of this unrivall colour in its pure state terra sienna be à bright vellow earth somewhat of foul greasy nature it be use by some miniature painter as warm yellow hut when burn it be beautiful colour partake of three tint yellow red and brown nottingham oler be bright yellow earth it work well and be much in use amongst the painter in london but on account of its heavy quality it must be use with caution it certainly be last colour and of much service in the fleshy tint of the face roman oler be reddishi yellow earth of very great body some painter have use it with success in miniature painting as it work when properly portion with guin water extremely sharp and neat and be in itself warm colour it communicate that quality to the tint it be work in naple vllow although mention under the head of yel low be colour whicn though adopt by some artist be not by any means in general use for miniature painting it be pale gritty yellow very hard to grind and prepare be of very fickly hue and have this very bad quality that itsabsorb all colour that be either work on it or mix with it bly it be scarcely necessary to inform we reader that of all bly ever in use none can in the smallest degree be set in competition with ultramarine its wonderful brightness and permanency by far excel they but the misfortune artist labour under be that like every other valuable article import from foreign country it be generally so adulterate that it be next to a impossibility to meet it genuine the ingredient that it be mix with be smalt sinely gruund in water and then dry but the way to detect the impnsition be to put small quantity of what you should buy for ultramarine on hroad case knise and hold it over candle keep tlie smoke from tonch it wlien if adulterate it will apnear in grey spot hut if puie it will remain brilliant as before tlie trial prussian blue be good colour and for which thcic be no substitute in miniature painting on account of its strenech of effect and transparency of it there be several kin seme very light coloured other dark the former be on com pound of the good kind and be either whiting er some such thing the best and purest sort be dark and brittle smalt be à very sine bright blue inelininz to purple hut so exccssively hard that nothing burt a agate flag and mulle will sufficiently pulverize it for sine use in sume thing it may be use when ultramarine be not to he have it be colour that do not work well nor be it to he denend on as to permianency indigo be useful blue though it must be sparingly use on account of its extrene depth of colour nearly approachitig to black the best be call the rock indigo the way to judge of its quality be to bieak it and if good it will have copperish hue hut if bad it will he of dead blackissi cast erditer be sine blue and much use by miniature painter not onsy in they sky grounds but likewise in the

variety of tint under the tiile of sap green some being of yellowish cast other darker and some very dark the last be best the berry at that time be at its full growth and persection carmine be very fine bright crimson inelining to the scar let and be rather a opaque colour fromit variety of sine tint may he make hut it be be such very hiigh red render it unfit to be use in delicate subject such as child or sine woman there be various kind of it prepare by chemisis but the deep kind be the best the lighter sort be frequentlv make so by adulteration if any crimson colour stand in water it be this drop lake be make from the shearing of scarlet cloth and be pleasing crimson colour its inelining to tlie purple make it partieularly useful for tlie carnation tinit in painting delicate subject there be many kind of it at various price some be nearly as bright and high coloured as carmine lake he of rather purple crimson be more transparent than carmine and therefore by miniature painter more generally use chinese vermiilion when good be charming bright red and useful in miniature picture though not to be freely use its opacity render it dangerous to mix much with other colour but by itself in touch the under lip and other part tliat require extreme brightness it be of wonderful service lt be very difficult to find the real kind the common vermillion mix with lake or carmine be general substitute but the spurious and the genuine kind very materially differ in tle work the former be thick and hieavy the other the contrary it come from china in small parcel of fourteen ounce each with chinese character mark on the cover but although this be the only mode of come at the genuine kind still there be description of people who contrive to baffse artist in that particular by counterfeiting the character on the cover of the packet indian red be of deep purple cast and be most excellent colour not only for touch the deep red part but likewise in the fleshy tint of mens picture it be colour difficult to prepare be very hard and gritty but it be to be buy in the capital colour shop in london ready for use in a im¬ palpable powder and work extremely well it be useful in bright back grounds and also in drapery brown umber be yellowishi brown very greasy and mix un kindly with water colour and in miniature painting useful only for drapery and even for they can be dispense with but when properly burnt be charming reddisn brown very useful in many part of miniature painting and work ex tremely shiarn and neat terra de cassl or vandyke brown so call from the very great estimation the inimitable painter of that nanie hold it in be the finest rich brown in tne world in itself produce mure heautiful colour than can he form by the junction of any clour whatever it be in general use amongst the oil and water painter in london it be in its natural state rather coarse and sandy but when prepare it amply repay the artist for he labour in do so lamp black be the smoke of burn rosin and be useful for mark the pupil of the eve for mixing in hair colour the smoke of candle receive and in painting drapery on plate be find the best be blacker than the common lamp black king yellow be fine bright opaque colour and be admira bly calculate for painting lace gill button but be rank poison therefore should be cautioussy use flake white or refine white lead be useful in the cloth drapery of man s picture but not to be use by itself as white for it will turn black which circumstance should be nicely attend to by all the artist if use in miniature painting for line it should be immediately cover with glass which method be the only one which stand chance of preserve its purity of the prcharation of colour amongst the number of necessary colour just mention there be three which require to be burnt viz terra sienna umber and lamp black the method be as follow the colour be to be put into crucible which be to be cover and place in hot fire and when you think that the lump of colour be red hot through take the crucible off the fire and let the colour cool but the lamp black be to be prepare in different manner you take some of the com mon kind put it on clean fire shovel or plate of iron over the fire it will immediately on receive the heat begin to smoke on the cease of which you lamp black be freed from the oily substance it originally contain and fit for im ¬ mediate use gum water chuse the large white piece of gum arabic which be brittle and easily come to piece in you finger also that which wiich be clear put it into clean vial and pour some water on it which be well strain and divest of all sandy particle make vour gum water about the thickness of barley gruel that be so thick that vou can feel it in you finger note the freshier make you gum water always be the better to grind colour and firepare they for the pallet you must provide yourself if possible with a agate flag and muller but if that can not conveniently be have glass one may answer though not quite so well the glass muller and flag must be lightly roughen with fine flour emery which will give it à furface that will continue long time after be particularly careful that you flag be quite clean you lay some of thie colour to be ground on it brusing it whilst dry gently with the muller then put few drop of water on it and grind it very carefully not make it too wet as that will prevent it from keep sufficiently under the muller when you think it be finely ground in the water take you pallet knife or thin edg picce of ivory scrape you colour together in little heap on you flag which let dry for short time then add you gum water to it gradually have piece of ivory near you on which you be frequently to lay some of the colour with camel hair peneil thin and when you perceive the colour in the smallest degree to shine when dry it be gum enough when you be to scrape it off you flag and transser it to you pallet note there be some colour which will not bear suf ficient quantity of gum to make they shine without injure they quality as smalt ultramarine and verditer bly of hair pencil manner of choose they pencil for painting in miniature be not make of camel s hair but of the tip of squirrel tail and of these there be two kind the dark brown and yellowisni red pencil make of the latter kind be call sable pentil and be of stiffer nature than the other and bear more than double the price they certainly be useful kind of pencil as long as the sine flue at the end of the hair remain on account of they elasticity but the instant the flue be wear off they froin they harshness become useless however they may be dispense with as nopencil can be superior to one make of the common kind of hair we here caution we reader against a error too prevalent amongst young miniature painter which be that of prefer very small pencil for they work vainly hope by the assistance of such one to execute they picture with more neatness and accuracy but in this as before observe they will not only by they own experience but by they intercourse with eminent miniature painter find themselves egregioussy mistaken the finest and most highlv finish picture be execute with middle size pencil the point of which be not only sufficiently neat but from its body contain quantity of colour in fluid enable the artist to give that melsow firm touch wliich be so generally admire by connoisseur in the art the young artist be there fore advise to choose middle size pencil with good spring and point both of which he will know by draw the peneil lightly through liis mouth and touch it on he thumb nail if he find it on be moderately wet to spring again into its form after be bend it be good sign but as there be manv peneil possess of that quality which be desicient in another material one namely that of good point that must be very cautioussy look to by turn the peneil round on the nail in every direction observe the hair at the point keep equally together of length and none shoot out on either side swhich be often occasion by the peneil maker put the hair into the quill with twist in it all these defect be carefully guard against you be sure of be in possession of very principal material for miniature painting ivory method of choose bleach and prepare it of lvory there be various kind the distinction of which in this art be of very material consequence but must first inform my reader that lvory newly cut and full of sap be not easily to be judge of the general transparency it exhibit in this state almost preelude the possibility of discover whether it be coarse grain or sine streaky or the contrary unless to tiie artist who by long course of experience be familiarize to it the best way to discover the quality of it be by hold it grainways to the light then hold it up and look through it still turn it from side to side and very nafrowly observe whether thete be any streak in it this you will unless the ivory be frelhly cut easily discover and in this you can not be too particular as it be a observation of manv experience painter that good piece of lvory be half the work do there be à species of lvory which be very bad for painting on although it have no streak in it be of horny coarse nature wliich will never suffer the colour to be throw out in the brilliant manner finer species of ivory will you be therefore not oily to be cautious in choose ivory free from streak but likewise that which have the finest grain and close have instruct in the mode of choose ivory we now procce to treat on the manner of prepare it for painting on you be to heat à fmooth iron in so sinall degree that you can hold you hand on the face of it so long as you can reckon three or four in moderate time then put you ivory between clean piece of fold paper on which place the hot iron turn vour ivory frequently until it become transparent white for you be to observe that very particu larly a opaque whit not answer for face painting in miniature as it would give harssiness and unpleasant appear ance to you picture when you think you ivory be suffici ently white for you purpose lay it under some flat weight until it cool as thiat will prevent it be warping you then proceed to prepare it for which purpose you must pound some pumice stone in mortar as clear and fine as you can which put into fine line or cambrick bag ty it about midway tight but leave room for the pumice dust to sift through the bottom then get long mustard bottle perfectly clean and dry in which suspend the pumice dust cover the top with the muzzle of the bag so as nothing can come out then shake the bottle smartly in you hand when the fine particle of the pumice will fift out and remain at the bottom of the boitle there by prevent any coarse grain from be amongst what you be go to use wliich would very materially injure you ivory you pumice dust be prepare scrape the leave of ivory with sharp pen knise uiitil the scratch of the cutting see be entirely obliterate then take either piece of dutch polish russi or piece of middle fine patent glass paper the latter of which be the handiest and carefully polish you lvory with it not by pass you hand backward and forward but in circular manner until you have it pretty level then strew some of you pumice dust on the ivory and put few drop of water on it which do with you muller work on it in circular manner as before until you find every part have equally receive the puniice which you will know by its exhibit à dead grave appearance thofe part which have not receive the pumice continue to fhine in spot which you must still labour to do away with vour pumice and muller when you find it pumice to you satis faction take clean sponge and fair water with which gently to rub it hard for fear of give the ivory gloss that would prevent vour colour from take on it so pleasant as you could wish after this lay you ivory to dry and in few hour it will be fit for use then you be to paste it on piece of wove paper by touch the back of it merely at the edge as gum water or any other cement he put near the center of you ivory will cause dark unpleasant spot perhaps to appear through in the very part where you face be to be paint purple be form of either ultramarine prussian blue smalt or indigo mix with either carmine or drop lake of uitramarine although the most beautiful and brilliant colour by itself yet in any mixture it lose that perfection but it still retain sufficient share of brightness to render it desirable teint in the purplishi grey shadow of tlie face prussian blue mix as before miention make bright or dark purple accord as the quantity of either colour be portion but indigo make still darker ow to its great natural depth of colour smalt and carmine or lake form nearly the same tint as uitramarine and may be use nearly for the same purpose grey of grey tint there be various kind aceord to the subject they be require for and the part they be to be place in warin grey tint may be make by duly portien burnt terra sienna prussian blue and drop lake the more tetra sienna in it tlie warmer the tint the more prussian blue and lake the colder another grey tint which have heen use with success by some eminent miniature painter be compose of prnssian blue and chinese vermillion but on account of the unkind manner with which vermillion incorporate with any other colour it require greater portion of gum than ordinary to make they work or keep together third grey tint which be a excellent one be form of drop lake sap green and prussian blue olive tint very sine ofive tint be form of gall stone not ham oker and carmine or lake and another of sap green and lake simply beautiful hair colour either dark or light accord to the quantity of colour be make of carmine lamp black and sap green thie manner of form it be only to be aquire by practice but the knowledge of make it when once attain will be find worth the time dispose of in tte trial that very difficult tint which be often to be meet with in child s hair by the proper junction of these colour will be produce to perfection other hair tint may be make of terra de cassel simply or by the addition of lamp¬ black somc excellent painter make all they hair tint of burnt terra sienna lamp black and nottingham oker the latter be add onlvwhen there be light hair want to be represent burn umber have be substitute for terra sienna along with the lamp black and form good tint but care must be take to avoid either the greenisn or reddisn cast which it be apt to produce tint for sine line gauze of all teint in transparent painting such as the miniature work of the prefent day thiere be none more difficult to ascer tain than the one at present we be about to treat on for this reason the delicacy not only of mixture but tlie delicacy of touch would require painter to be what no man ever be purpose which man might hit on this day to morrow he might not be so fortunate in nor might he be so happy in that exquisite touch which convey the idea of beauty in the thinness and fold of sine line or gauze the true painting of which often stamp the character of a artist and in the general opinion throw veil over the defect in other part of the picture which the more experienced connoisseur would readily point out we shall therefore only observe that any of the teint under the head of grey will properly manage answer the purpose have now point out the manner of prepare the delicate transparent teint for miniature painting we shall proceed to treat on the grosser one namely those for drapery of colour proper for man drapery we shall under the above head make some general obser vation the first of which be that in all cloth drapery for man s portrait it be necessary to add some flake white as it not only give the colour the dead appearance which cloth exhibit exhibit but likewise its be incorporate with the flake hite give it body which bear well against the face gire value to it and make the flesh teint appear to more advantage the next observation be that in grind up you drapery you be to make they appear several degree lighter in colour than vou want they to be when dry for this reascal the flake white be colour so very heavy that after you sloat in vour coat it will sink to the bottom and leave jour colour several degrec darker than when it be wet and finally you be not to be too heavy or thick in float in xour drapery but merely to see that you colour be evenly sjread over the part whereon you coat be to appear it be necessary to inform the young artist that there be four rechnical term in miniature painting namely float wafh in handle and maik the first procef which be float and be chiefly use for drapery be thus drapery be to be grind up you colour on you flag suot puiine quantity of gum water that would make it fhine as it would frustrate you purpose then take large soft hair peneil and have previoussy lay you ivory on very level table sill vour pencil plentifully with the colour and lay it quick all over the part of the ivory vou want cover see that it run on every part equally which if keep in proper fluid state it will readily do then lay it in some place to dry wliere it be not likely to receive dust when you will have with colour and give very broad stroak rather faintly as in begin the hair back grounds and likewise on lay on the general flesh tint of the sace it be also use in the first touch of the dark shadow which ever ought to be begin faint and broad handling be the manner in which all the wash in and lastly mark consist in the sharp spirite touch give to the different fcature in order to give that animated appearance so necessary to constitute fine picture plack diapery be ferm of lamp black burnt and flake white and must be lay in with good deal of the latter as otherwise it would be very difficult to manage the shadow so as to produce pleasing effect blue drapery may be make of either prussian blue or antwerp blue mix with white indigo be too much inclined to blackish cast and as before observe of the black good deal of the flake white must be mix with it for the same reason green drapery be well make of king yellow and prus sian or antwerp blue and it be scarcely necessary to observe the more blue tlie darker tlie green and the more yellow the contrary yellow for officer facing or the like can not be so well represent by any colour as king yellow as above menti oned lay thin with moderate quantity of gum in it drab colour be well represent by judicious mixture of umber in its raw state and flake wliite queen brown as it be call be make of burnt roman oker little lamp black and lake with flake white amongst it claret colour may be well represent hy mixture of terra de cassel little lamp black and lake the more black and lake the deeper the colour dark brown can be form by junction of nottingham oker lake and lamp black lilac be make of carmine prussian blue and flake white grey can be form only of lamp black flake white and the smallest quantity of lake lay in very thin reddissi brown be best make of indian red very little lamp black and flake white scarlet for officer picture be colour very difficult to lay down rule for make as in some picture it be dange¬ rous to make it too bright for fear of hurt the effect of the face by its brilliancy catch the eye too readily conse quently if the subject you be painting from life be very pale you run very great risk indeed by annexing very bright scarlet to he picture the management in that point we must therefore leave to the young artist himself to judge of and only mention that very bright scarlet be make of chinese vermilsion and carmine ground together swithout any flake white and if you want it still render brighter when it be dry fill you peneil with plain carmine mix with thin gum water and glaze over it nicely but if on the con trary you wish to sadden or take away share of its brilliancy add little flake white to it and that will have the desire effect of painting the face in miniature you be first to provide yourself with mahogany delk for painting on which be box about fourteen inch high and foot broad on the top there be to be lid cover with green cloth which be to have pair of small hinge at the front and to lift occasionally with support rail at the back and notch so as readily to adjust it to any height you may choose it in the same manner as music desk about the middle of the green cloth there be to be slip of very thin mahogany glew at each end but the centre of it leave free to fasten you ivory by slipping it between tlie mahogany and green cloth hhe next thing vou be to observe be the choice of you light which in this kind of painting can not be too particularly attend to it not lee like oil painting where the ray of the sun may be keep out with blind without cause any material inconvenience north light or as nearly as possible to it ust be attain if there be more than on window in the room the second must be close so as to admit no light and the one you sit at be to have green baize curtain against the lower part of it to reach about foot higher than you head as you fit at you painting desk with leave hand towards the light place you setter at thie distance of about yard and half from vyou in that point of view by which the shadow will not only have they proper effect in mark the fcature of as pleasing one for the young artist may rely on it that no person of any description ever yet sit for likeness but would wisn to have that likeness as favourable as possible this outline of the face and in this be very particular as much depend on it when you have they draw cor rectly and that even in such state there appear to vour own eye degree of likeness to the subject sitting for you begin to lay in the colour faintly of the iris of the eye thel shiadow under the eye brow in grey teint and under the nose rather warm purple in broad faint wash ever keep this in you mind that you must in the process the of painting face of miniature picture go on faintly at the beginning and niot hurry in you colour as such conduct will to certaintv inake vour taint look dirty and you picture harsh and do have as before observe lay in you grey agrceable teint where you ihadow be to fall go on heighten they by degree work in hatch with middle full pencil not too wassiy nor too dry as the former would be the means of muddve you colour and the latter would make they raw when you think you have pretty strongly mark out and work up the shado ys mix wassi of either gall stone er nottingham oker and drop lake with which faintly go over the fleshy part of the face where the shadow do not come and then proceed to heighten the carnation on the check the colour of the beard if any such appear still work in the handling manner as already mention in various direction so as that after some time work the intersection appear like so many nice point or dot which appearance in fine picture lead the inexperieneed artist to imagine that the picture be entirely dot in and be there by lead into thousand error and difficulty there be general rule you be to observe that it be much easier to warm the teint of you face than to cool it by work proper colour over it it be therefore adviscable to begin with cool grey and purple and towards the finish of the picture to add warmth if necessary by gradually work such colour as gall stone terra sienna or the like over in addition to the carmine or lake that may be necessary to produce the teint of nature on the subject of manage the colour in painting miniature it be unnecessary to say any thing more shall therefore onsy advise the amateur or young artist to procure good miniature picture paint by some eminent artist and to closely copy it call these observation often to he aid a attention to which we dare venture to say will favilitate he improvement instruction for painting in wax crayon painting in wax crayon be a art at present scarcely know and when properly manage produce very pleasing effect it differ very materially from the former stile of instead of pipe clay which be the basis of dry crayon it also hinute drawing and not moulder away or rub off the paper but it require the assistance of wash in water colour to improve its effect as from the nature of the wax the frequent working over of the crayon would cause glassiness that would prevent they taking hold in the latter part of the finish so as to produce the strength require therefore it be to be observe that the water colour be to be use on begin the picture and in finish it the crayon to be judicioussy work on the water colour when they produce the appearance of a elegantly finish stip engrave coloured in the plate the tooth or grain of the paper catch ¬ ing the crayon in dot when work gradually with light hand in wonderfully pleasing manner we shall now proceed to the instruction which we shall nse in make the crayon the colour fit to be incorporate with it the choice of paper and the mode of use the crayon the wax proper to be use in make crayon must be bleach bee wax entirely free from adulteration either by spermaceti or tallow it must not only be pure but likewise of the hardest kind of which the russian wax be the best although in colour not quite so fine as the american or english wax but its hardnef give firmness to the crayon and preyent greasiness which softer wax would create follow viz for yellow king vellow or yellow oker for nese vermillion for brown umber burnt and uuburnt for black lamp black only as to compound teint they be to be produce by judicious management of tlie water colour over thie crayon and this rule with respect to the colour proper none be fit for the purpose but such as in they dry unmixed state will mark on paper pretty freely for the reader may prevent any hard colour from work that be incorporate with it have procure the kind of wax mention vou be to have nice glaze white pipkin perfectly clean and free fromn any greasy particle and have previously ground you colour on flag with you muller perfectly fine in fair water and dry put sinall quantity of wax into the pipkin which you be to place over very slow fire when the wax be entirely dissolve by the gentle heat lfor if it bubble it be spoiled gradvally sprinle in you colour stir it with a ivory pen cil handle until you find it perfectly mix at the same time observe that you do not overload the wax with colbur as it will make the crayon too brittle nor be you to put in too little colour as it make they faint and work greasy so medium be be observe to ascertain wliich practice only will conduce there be some colour such as vermillion which if it receive too great heat turn black and that must be very cautioussy observe as vermillion in this kind of painting be highly useful colour as be also lamp black harder kind of crayon from which it be to be make by mixing some of it in its raw state with strong glue let it unstruction for calein colour for miniature painting then pulverize it on you flag and mixing it with vour wax as lean for give shaip touch in dark part and for make sketch to refresn the memory be much superior to italian chalk as nothing will cause it to rub or spoil it remain ing as immoveable as writing ink and work extremely pleasant the paper fit to be use in wax cravon painting must be of the wove or vellum kind but as of this there be several fort it be necessary to mention that it must be of middle fine ness for if too coarse the grain will catch the cravon in dot so remote from each other as to make you work look unplea fant and if the paper be too fine it will not catch the cray on as it ought but clog you painting without produe any effect the only rule therefore for choose you paper be to go to the stationer and take small piece of soft black crayon in you pocket inquire for wove paper and by gently rub the crayon on few sheet of different kind you will then become judge of what paper be the best for you purpose which experience you will attain without any expence worth niention have procure this necessay article to you satis faction you then proceed to work the desk you be to work on must be much larger than the one mention for miniature painting this kind of work be often use for larger size than that stile of painting be have you sitter place in the same manner as point out in the treatise on miniature painting with soft piece of charcoal sketch faintly the distance and form of the feature then touch they in more strongly with vour crimson or black crayon still alter until you be perfectly certain you have correct outline which in this kind of painting be absolutely neceffary for if in you fair draw you commit a error in we outline you never can alter it the crayon be in they nature so adhesive that nothing will remove they have on you first sheet make you outline correct rub the back of tlie face part with crimson crayon thie hair part with suitable coloured one and the drapery if white with black then lay the paper on fair sheet go over the line of you sketch with tracer when you will transfer in very neat manner vour outline ready to colour in you be then to mark in the seature of you sitter more strongly with crayon

as to the teint for you line shade the black crayon will produce that in every degree the paper answer for the light of any coloured drapery for then you be to wash in and shadow it with the crayon you paper be to be perfectly dry otherwise the work will appear glazy but even should that be the case hold it before the fire and the shine appearance will instantly vanisn with respect to vour back grounds as this stile of painting be intend to be light and fketchy sky and back grounds be den prelit aty colour to whatever taint you find pleaf which will give proper value to the appearance of you wax cravon you draw either of portrait or landscape be finish have ready large flat board on which you be to stretch sheet of royal paper and have paste the back of vour draw with some flour paste mix with isinglass lay it on the royal paper and carefully pref it in all direction with soft towel or handkerchief wlien you work be complete of gild upon glass the art of gild upon glass which be revival and improvement upon attempt make many year ago be chiefly use for decorate the border of print in execute name plate and inscription for various purpose as also for orna mental decoration in variety of elegant work with different colbure grounds but as black be the most general one in demand ishall first proceed to treat on that in two way of perform it you be to procure some of the finest isinglass which vou will distinguissi by hold between you and the light when that which be white and transparent be the best and the contrary be totally unfit for this purpose you be to dissolve it in very clean water pretty thick and strain it through line cloth then into tea cup of very clean milk warm water put about the size of small pea of the isinglass jelly which let gently incorporate with the water then have you glass that be to be gill quite clear and free from any dirt or grease get some leaf gold the lef porous in the beating the better put it on agild cushion and cutit in piece size for the purpose accord ing to the breadth you want to have you work gill then touch with hair pencil dip in the thin isinglass water on the glass and while moist lay on you leaf gold piece by piece until you have the part you want cover the leaf will instantly adhere to the glass then place it withiin air of the fire in slanting position until it dry which will be in few minute while it be gently warm take piece of clean cotton wool and rub the gold to the glass smartly until you not only find the superfluous piece of leaf gold go but that likewise the back of the part gill receive kind of polisn then proceed to lap on second coat of gold in the same manner as the first drving it as before and polish it and so third coat which be full sufficient and to gild properly can be dispense with then take the size of the print or dra ing which be to be frame and lay it on the gill part of the glass mark where the corner be to come with hair pencil and some dark colour after which be provide with long wooden ruler and point picce of ivory draw two parallel line out of you gold and with mahogany or deal stick point cautioussy work away the superfluous part leave the gold fillet which be to encompass you picture sharp and neat when if you have mind to ornament it by any other line to appear black in the centre lay on you ruler and with vour ivory point scribe they and then varnisn have some black japan to which little burnt lamp black have be add to deepen its colour paint it all over part of you glass and the space between it and the edge then set it to dry which will take place in few hour when you be to lay out the breadth of the black line that be to be inside you gild seribe it with sharp point and cut away the waste black with graver or some sharp instrument lf you want to cut figure or any kind of ornament out of vour gold after you glass be gill have draw of you design on paper at the black of which rub some powder red chalk and the smallest quantity of fresh butter lay the paper on the gold and with bluntish ivory point go over the line of the draw and they will be nicely transfer on tlie gold when vou can with a ivory point trace they from the draw you have by you and then by mixing any but the most important secret in the glass gild be in a instant after you glass be black take away the part where vour gold be to appear and the remainder of the black to stand fast by which mean the black gild work be do in one half the time and with half the gold leaf the process be simple and be thus perform you be to get the very best black asn baesgieganie pae ervegy egan which you must add very small share of burn lamp black very finely ground in spirit of turpentine then with large flat varnisn brush give vour glass one even thin coat hold it between you and the light observe that it do not appoar thick dead black but exhibit degree of transparency and not too much so as to prevent its appear good black at the right side of the glass aster this you be to have you letter or ornament draw on paper as before mention and trace it in the same manner on you black varnifh when it be per fectly dry the draw will be very critically transfer to the black you be then to get fine needle and fix it in wooden handle firmly with which you be to scribe the out¬ linc of what black be to come out through the varnisn so as not a edge hang to the main body of the black then take some thick brown paper dipit in water and squeeze it gently and spread it over the part of the varnish you want to detach from the glass and in few minute by raise one edge of tlie black it will all peel away as elean from the glass as if it never be on it in a instant when all the black you want be take out lay vour glass to the fire and the remain part of the vamnisn will instantly become hard as ever and ready to have the gold put on the art of dye the theory of dye be far from be thoroughly know or establish though many fact and observation and particular process have be offer for this purpose we shall collect the principle of they in the sequel of this article the basis of just history of dycing must be theory of light and colour .. two thing it may be observe be chiefly aim at in the enquiry of colour the first to increase the materia tinctoria the second to six those colour we have in order to these it may be remember that soie colour be afisiarent as those of flower the juice of fruit and those of animal other be latent and only discover by the effect which the several species of salt and other thing have on they concern the afsarent colour of vegetable and animal and the effect of different salt in change they srom one colour to another we have many instance in mo . boyle collect and range in new order by dr. lister as that acid salt advance the colour of flower and berry thus they make the infusion of balaustia or pomegranate flower red rose clove july flower mezereon peas bloom violet and cvanus flower of very fine red and the juice of the berry of lirrustrum of black cherry and buckthorn berry of much fairer red to the same purpose it be observe that acid salt make no great alteration upon the white flower of jasmine and fnow drop urinous salt and alcaly on the contrary quite alter the colour of the flower last name as well as the juice of the berry above mention from red to green urinous salt and alcaly advance at least they do not hurt the colour of the juice of vegetable leave wood and root thus urinous spirit and alcaly make the vellow infu sion of madder root red of brasil wood purplisn of lig num nephrilicum blue the red infusion of log wood purple and that of the leave of sena red acid salt quite alter the say infusion from red or blue to yellow cochineal which of itself be red upon the infufion of oil of vitriol a acid salt strike the most vivid crimson that can be imagine and with urinous salt and alcaly it will be again change into a obscure colour betwixt violet and purple all red blue and white flower be immediately upon the effusion of a alcali change to green colour and thence in no long process of time they tunn yellow all the part of vegetable which be green will in like manner strike yellow with a alkali what flower be already yellow be not much change if at all by a alkali or urinous spirit the blue seed husk of glastum sylvestre old gather and dry dilut with water stain blue which upon the effusion of ley strike green which say green or blue be touch with oil of vitriol dye purple and all these three colour stand on the top of the funge tubulose be certain red knot which upon the effusion of ley will strike purple and stand as for the latent colour in animal and vegetable discover to we by effusion of salt they likewise be very numerous we will only mention few the milky juice of the lactuca sylvestris costa spinosa fonchus asper lavis upon the effusion of ley will strike vivid flame colour or crimson and after some time quite degenerate into dirty yellow the milk of the cataputia major upon the effusion of ley especially if it be draw with knife and have anv time stand upon the blade thereof will strike purple or blood red colour and soon after will change into dull yellow the common hawthorn caterpillar will strike purple or carnation with ley and stand the head of beetle primrose will with ley strike the same carnation colour and stand the amber coloured scolopendra will give with ley most beautiful and pleasant azure or amethystine and stand it remain to be observe that in all the instance above mention whether vegetable or animal there be not one colour truly fix though there may be some use make of they as they be by not truly fix we mean not proof against salt and fire for what seem to stand and be ley proof be either wholly destroy by different salt or change into much different colour which must need prove à stain and blemisn when it shall happen in the use of any of they that both the apparent and latent colour of vegetable be fixable a instance whereof we may observe in the seed hulk of glastum and the use dyer make of the leave of that plant after due preparation it be probable from the same instance that we may learn from the colour of some part of the fruit or seed what colour the leave of any vegetable and the whole plant might be make to yield for we use that the latent colour of vegetable be pre existent and nôt produce from tlie same instance of woad and likewise from this that the milky juice of lactuca silveris afford of itself red serum that the change of colour in flower be gradual and co no sait that the colour of flower which will not stand with ley seem to be wholly destroy by it and irrecoverable thus one part of violet leaf under the affusion of ley be change very soon into yellow and will never be revive into à red by a acid salt but if anothier part of the same leaf be still green it will be revive the dryness seem to be à mean if not of fix yet of bring the vegetable colour into condition of not wholly and suddensy perish by the otherwise destroy alcali that those plant or animal which will strike different yet vivid colour upon the affusion of different salt and stand as the cochineal and glastum be of all other to be reckone the best many more valuable colour may be draw from the vege table kingdom if the world would be at the pain of enquire more minutely into the property of plant with respect to the theory of dye it be farther to be observe that all the material wliich of themselves give colour be either red yellow or blue so that out of they and the primitive fundamental colour white all that great variety which we see in dyed stuff arise that sew of the colour material as cochineal soot wood wax or woad be in they ontward and first appearance of the same colour wliich by the slightest solution in the weakest menstrua they die upon cloth silk that many of the colour ing material will not yield they colour without much grind ing steep boiling ferment or corrosion by powerful menstrua as red wood weld woad arnotto that many of the say colour material will of themselves give no colour at all as coppera or gall or with much disad vantage unless the cloth or other stuff to be dyed be first cover or incrustate as it be with some other matter though colourless aforehand as madder weld and brazil with alum that some of the colour material by the help of other colourless one do strike different colour from what they would alone and of themselves as cochineal and brazil that some colour as madder indigo and woad by reiterate tincture will at last become black that though green be the most frequent and ommon of natural colour yet there be no simple ingredient which be now use alone to mye green with upon any material sap green the condense juice of the thamnus or buckthorn berry be the nearest and this only use by country people there be no black thing in use wliich dye black though both the coal and the blacker by how much the matter before it be burnt be whiter as in the famous instance of ivory black the tincture of some dye stuff will fade even with lie or with the air or will stain even with water hut very much with wine vinegar urine some of the dyer niaterial be use to bind and strengthen colour some to brighten it some to give lustre to the stuff some to discharge and take off the colour either in whole or in nart and some out of fraud to make the material dyed if costly to be heavier sonie dye ingredient or drug by the courseness of they body make the thread of the dyed stuff seem coarser and some by shrink they smaller and some by levigate they asperi tie finer many of the same colour be dyed upon dif ferent stuff with different material as red wood be use in cloth not in silk arnotto in silk not in cloth so that they may be dyed at several price scour and wass of stuff to be dved be to he do with apptopriate material as sometimes with ox gall sometimes with fuller earth some time with soap this latter however be pernitious in some case where pot ash will stain or alter the colour great quantity of stuff be to be dyed together or piece be very long hroad thick they be to be differ ently handle both in respect to the vessel and ingredient in some colour and stuff the tingent liquor must be boil ing in other case only blood wari in some it may be cold some tingent liquor be fitted for use by long keeping and in some the virtue wear away by the fame some colour or stuff be best dyed by reiterate dipping ever into the same liquor at several interval of time and some by co no sone case the mattet of the vessel wherein the liquor be heat and the tincture prepare must be regard as that the kettle be peuter for the bow dye liitle regard be have how much liquor be use in proportion to the dye drug the liquor be rather adjust to the bulk of the stuff as the vessel be to thie breadth of the same the quantity of dye drug be proportion to the colour higher or lower and also to the stuff as likewise the salt be to thie dye drug concern the weight which colour give to silk for in they it be most take notice of as be sell by weiglit and he commodity of great price it be observe that one pound of raw silk lose four ounce by wash out the gum and natural sorde that the same scower silk may be raise to above thirty ounce from the remain twelve if it be dyed black with certain material that the reason why black colour may be dyed the heaviest be that all ponderous drug may be dyed black be all of colour lighter than it whiereàs perhaps there seem to be sen or no material wherewith to increase the weight ofsilk which will consist with fair light colour such as will have be use as white arsenie to carnation of thine

production of nature and art and of enlarge and contracting object in the most exact propor tion this art recal to we memory thing long since past and rescue from oblivion the deed of we illustrious ancestor at the same time that it revive they image in we mind by pre serve they feature for many generation in short it may be say to be the silent but most expressive language of nature which speak to the eye be understand by all nation and convey a idea where even word themselves would prove deficient after give some general direction for the attainment of this truly polite and rational amusement which be the basis on which all the rest of the art depend we shall con sider it more particularly under the follow head and lay down the most copious and intelligible rule for each respectively viz copying of draught enlarge and contracting imitation of life drapery landscasie light and shade history the implement necessary for draw be ruler com pass charcoal black lead pencil penknife port crayon black white and red chalk crayon indian ink crow quill pen camel hair pencil fitch paper of several fort and porte solio general rule for draw the first thing to be observe be the choice of proper ori ginal and here we would recommend le clerc s principle of draw as the easiest and best calculate for the instruction of beginner this may be have price at most of the bookseller in great britain have provide this begin with the outline of the several feature as the eye nose mouth car as they occur in the book pactise these often over till you be quite master of they then proceed to profile or side face after that to a oval or full face always remember that each of these must be perfectly attain before you venture to proceed further when vou can copy face correctly the next thing be to draw the several limb or part of the body as the hand arm leg foot then go to the body itself which have do you will be able to undertake whole figure observe care fully the exact proportion and bearing of one part with the other the learner ought to be particularly cautious that he do not attempt whole figure before he have make himself master of the several part for this be begin he work at the wrong end and be almost similar to man attempt to raise build ¬ ing without foundation as for beast bird plant we deem it useless to give direction for draw they as it be well know that he who have so far improve he idea as to be able to draw human figure cotrectly will find it no difficulty to perform every other branch of this art sketch or draw all you outline faintly with piece of soft charcoal swhich may be knoin by the pith in the middle cut to point like pencil and when vou see any thing amiss whisk it out with handkerchief or feather correct you error with black lead pencil and compare you work with the original till every part of they correspond this do finifh you outline with black lead or indian ink this ad vice properly attend to will save you a infinite deal of trouble in draw over and over again to you no small disconragement if you prefer indian ink rub it with water upon marble and with crow quill pen perfect you outline then rub out the mark of the pencil with bread keep three or four dif ferent shade of ink in the hollow of you stone to distinguish you distance reserve one of the hole for water when vou be thoroughly verse in the outline you next business will be to learn to shadow but of this hercafter under thie article of light and shade be not too hasty at first set out which will but impede you progress and hinder you improvement whereas by bestow litile more time you will attain perfection sooner than you can well imagine and expedition will come of itself as you become more experienced of cohy of draught when you would copy print or draw exactly of the same size rub the back of it with the dust of red chalk or black lead lay this upon you paper and pin it down at the four corner then with blunt point trace the outline and breadth of the shadow which do have carefully ex amine it to see that nothing be omit take it off and finish it with the pencil or pen another way to make a exact copy and at the same time to preserve the original be to lay piece of transparent paper upon it and draw the outline thereon with black lead pen¬ cil then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon place piece of thin post paper redden or blacken at the back after which proceed to trace and finish it accord ing to the forego rule lf you would reverse you original you need only turn the transparent paper with the draw you have make upon it downwards upon the post paper and trace it as above of enlarge and contracting divide you original with pair of compass into any num ber of square and rule they across with black lead pencil from side to side and from top to bottom then have you paper of the size vou intend divide it into the same number of square either bigger or less as you enlarge or contract it place you original before you and draw square by square the several part observe to make the part you be draw fall into the same part of the square as it do in you original to prevent mistake number the square both of the original and copy then outline it with indian ink rub out the mark of the pencil with bread and shade it at pleasure of imitation of life let the person you draw after be of proportionable size and well shape place he in the easiest and most natural at titude then with you charcoal sketch faintly the head or any of the limb separately which have carefully do pro ceed to finisn with you pencil when you have sufficiently practise the several part or limb you may draw the whole figure in whatever attitude you think proper to place it begin with the easiest and proceed by degree to the more difficult posture as time and experience shall enable vou be sure to finish you ontline so correctly mark all the muscle as they occur that even before you give it any shadow it may have some resemblance of the person the true proportion which one part of human figure bear to another will be see in the figure you draw from which may serve as standard to examine you draw by except where the figure be to be fore shorten in which case nature will be the best guide in draw of likeness care must be take to express the passion in the most lively manner which be to be do by observe the peculiar cast and disposition of every feature with the exactest nicety and as this be of all the part of draw ¬ ing by far the most difficult it will require more than ordi¬ nary attention and should be last attempt of drapery drapery be the art of cloath you figure with elegance and propriety when you naked figure be outline first draw the outline of the draperv lightly then the greater fold and afterwards the lesser observe never to let they crof each other particular regard be to be have to the quality of the drapéry as the fold of stuff or wooll cloth be more abrupt and harsh and those of silk more slow and easy line cam brick ganze as they substance be lighter than either re quire à still greater delicacy in express the wave of the fold by the faintness of they shadow the drapery should not stick too close to the body but must seem to flow round as it be yet in such manner as that the motion of the figuie may be fiee and easy great lightness and motion of the drapery slinuld only be use when the sigure be suppose to he in iuch agitation or expose to the wind hut in calm place and fice from violent action they drapery should be large and flow in order to give they more graceful appearance let the loose part of the drapery blow by the wind all flow one way and draw that part which lie closost to the body before vou draw those which sly off suit you garment to the body and make they bend with it the closer the garment stick to the body the narrower and smaller must be the fold and if it fit quite close there will be no fold at all but must only have faint shadow to be pesent the part of tlie body which lie under it by observe diligently in what manner the drapery flow upon any person stand or sit before you for that purpose you will s see in what manner do dispose you fold and shadow accord to the unerring rule of nature of landscahe landscape represent the face of the country as it appear to we view with all the vatious object analogous tlereto as town castle church house tree hiill cattle river rock be careful to augment or lessen every object accord to its distance make the most remote object fainter and lef distinct as they appear to the eye and enlarge they pro¬ portionably as they draw nearer shew the sky cloudy or clear as occasion require and if you introduce the sun let it be rife or set either of which representation will give a additional grace to you picture as they represent nature in its liveliest and most agree able appearance adapt every part of you landscape to the season of the year and the time of the day vou intend it to represent and dispose you light and shade with consistent propriety lastly we would recommend it to practitioner in this noble art to rise early in fine morning that they may have better idea of the harmony and beauty of the work of the great creator which would wonderfully replenissi they mind as to colour and effect of light and shade the true distribution of light and shade in picture be abso lutely necessary to be know as it not only determine the proper distance of one object from another without which the whole would be a undistinguishable maf of confusion but it give likeness to each respective object its substance roundness and effect shadow be perform with the pen or peneil in either of which great judgment be require have make vour outline correct the first thing be to ob serve from which side of the original the light come in which if natural be either from the right hand or leave for whenever the light appear in the middle of the picture and seem to glare more than ordinary it be cause by candle lamp or some other luminous bodr which be call a artificial light lay on you little tint first dispose they as you see they be do in the original and then proceed to the deeper one till you come to the darkest part of all for yon may at any time darken you shadow when you can not lighten they let all vour shadow in the same place fall on the same side that be if the right side of man s face be dark so must the right side of he body arm leg thigh but if the light side be darken by the opposition of some other body inter cept the light it must receive contrary shadow make vour shadow fainter as they grow towards the light break they gradually that they may not appear too sudden orharsh if you shade with black lead or with crayon vou may blend you shadow and soften they one into another as you require with stump make of paper or glove leather roll and tie hard and cut almost to the point with which vou may also weaken you shade where they be too strong when part of the body project over or before another the part project must receive stronger light those part that bend inward must be make so much the darker and sha dow deepest next the light two equal light must never be make in the same picture the strongest light should fall upon the middle of the piece where the principal figure ought to stand diminish gra¬ dually towards the extremity by frequently examine into nature vou will have a op portunitv of improve you idea of light and shade and will be enable to form proper judgment of the effect which the different ray or degree of light will produce in picture for which reason you should never let slip a opportunity of re mark the various appearance you meet with of history this branch of draw present to we view tling past present and future a historical picture must describe the transaction repre sent in manner so clear and conspicuous as to convey a idea of it to we mind as fully as could be do by ver hal description and care must be take to preserve such ana logy or connection between the figure that not one may seem to be introduce but for some end or purpose and as in dramatie writing it be essential to make every person speak consistently with the part he represent so here it will be equally necossary to observe the same propriety of character and make every figure look the sentiment it be intend to express of perspective perspective be the art of delineating olject as they appear in nature upon plain surface accord to they distance and height perpendicular to the horizon between the object and the eye this art be of great consequence to those who would excel in draw etch engrave carving in bas relief or paint ing for be well understand the artist will be enable to know when to adhere to the strictest rule and when to depart from they with propriety exhlanation of the term use in pershective base or fundamental line be the bottom line of the draw ing on which the person be

the bafe horizon be the most distant part of plain where the cloud seem to touch the earth limit the sight the ho¬ rizontal line give the height of the eye for we can not see any thing above the horizon which do not exceed this height yet the summit of mountain may be above the horizon though it be foot be far beneath it point of sight be that pait of the horizontal line where all the visual

the line where the diago nal intersect or crof the visual ray and must always run parallel to the base it be only make where the sight be limit by perpendicular as the farther end of church hall room and supposing person to stand thereon parallel line draw through the point of sight will seem to paf through the eye and will consequently shew what height that person ought to be¬ point of direct view this be nothing more than the front view of house church or in other word geo metrical elevation raise from plan or ground plot and comprehending a equal space on both side of the point of sight point of oblique view be when we see the object side way or aslant example suppose person be to draw view of canal with some remarkable building he be desirous the shew more distinct he must place himself on the base or fundamental line opposite to that building that the ray of light may be more oblique by which mean the admire building will be less foreshorten and appear to greater ad vantage the point of sight be still before he though not in the middle of the picture accidental point be those where object end in the horizontal line but neither in the point of sight or distance and serve for street house chair road which take different direction as for example suppose street lead to the point of sight and from it two other branch the one on the right hand the other on the leave and take different direction these two last street make what we call accidental point terminate in some part of tlie horizontal line on each side of the point of sight the same be to be observe in grove park where the walk you be in direct imme diately to the point of sight and the avenue branch out on either side terminat also in different part of the horizon lchnography be the plan or ground plot of any object that be to be raise in perspective scenography be the art of bring any thing raise in per spective from a ichnographic plan to its due proportion be cording to the distance in which it

etch etch be method of work on copper wherein the line or stroke instead of be cut with graver be eat with aqua fortis this art be execute with greater case and freedom than engrave represent curious subject better and more agree ably to nature as landscape ruin and small faint or remote object building the principal inaterial for this art be the plate hard and soft ground the first for winter and the other for summer dabber turpentine varnish lamp black soft wax and aqua fortis the tool be a oil rubber burnisher scraper hand vice etch board esch needle a oil stone and parallel ruler the plate may be have of any size and well polisn fit for use of the copper smith in london direction for lay the ground have provide yourself with plate of the size of the print or draw you intend to copy rub it well with a oil rubbert mave van hie rsl ien eos rob it vel wie a on charcoal use in polish it entirely disappear then wipe off the dirty oil with line rag dip vour singer in some clean oil and touch it over every part of the plate after which with you burnisher polisn the plate till you can see you face in it and in case any sand hole flaw appear the scraper will assist you in take they out the mark leave by the scraper be to be take out by the burnisher till nothing appear have fix you hand vice at one end of the plate with rag and whiting clear the plate carefully from grease then heat it over charcoal fire or light paper till it will melt the ground which be to be lay on thinly and dab all over with the dabber till it be persectly smooth and even then warm the plate again and hold it up with the ground downwards smoke it all over with large candle take care that the snuff of it do not touch the ground and wave the candle continually over every part so that the ground may not be burnt by heating it more in one place than another if the plate be large you may bind four penny candle to gether direction for trace the first thing to be do swhile the plate be cool after the ground be lay be torub the back of you print or draw all over with bit of rag or cotton dipt in the scraping of red chalk and shake off the loose dust or wipe it off gently with clean rag place the red side upon the plate make it fast at eaeh corner witha little bit of foft wax lay you etch board under you hand to prevent bruising the ground then with blunt etch needle trace lightly the outfine and breadth of the fhadow till the mark of they appear apon the ground which you must take care not to penetrate by trace too hard as great nicety be require in this part of you work it will be necessary now and thon to lift up one corner of you origi nal and examine whether every part be trace before you take it off as it will be extremely difficult to lay it down again in na¬ former pofition direction for etch have carefully trace you original take it off and lay silk or line handkerchief next the plate and over that you etch board then proceed to the etch for which ob serve the follow direction which be adapt to every par ticular branch as landscape shipping portrait history be chitecture distance in landscape or the faint part of any other pic ture be the first to be do and these be to be work closer and with sharpet point needle the darker part must be etch wider and with blunter needle but to prevent mistake the needle may be mark accord to they different degree and the uie for which they be intend as for the very faintest part of all they be to be leave for tlie graver or dry needle of which hereafter ruler till frequent practice enable you to do they well enough without the needle may when necessary be whet upon you oil stone keep they turn in you hand so as to whet they equally all round the oil stone will be further useful in whet the scraper which be to be rub flat upon the stone and with steady hand keep vil constantly upon the stone of bite or eat in the work with aqua fortis pirst examine you work carefully to see that nothing be omit and if any scratch appear upon the ground or mis¬ take be commit in the etching they be to be stop out which be do by cover they with mixture of lamp black and varnish lay on thinly with hair pencil which when dry will resist the aqua fortis but it will be best to stop out these as they occur to you in the course of you work for by this means they will be less liable to escape you notice and when the varnish be dry you may etch over it again if require the next thing be to inclose the work with rim or border of soft green or other coloured wax about half a inch high bend the wax in the form of spout a one corner to pour off the aqua fortis and that it may not run out at any other part take care to lay you wax so close to the plate that no vacancy be leave you aqua fortis must be single and if too strong as will be see in the biting take it off and mix it with little water shake they together in bottle and when by often use it become too weak it may be strenghen by mixing it in bottle with little double aqua fortis the bottle which contain the aqua fortis should have large mouth and glass stopple let the aqua fortis lie on the plate fhort time wipe off thie bubble as they arise with feather which may remain upon the plate while it be bite after which take it off and wash the plate with water and then let it dry by scrape off part of the ground from the faintest part of the work try if it be bit enough and if not stop out the part you have try with the lamp black and varnish and when that be dry pour on the aqua fortis again when the faint part of you work be bit enough stop they out and proceed to bite the stronger part stop they out as occasion require till the whole work be suffici ently bit then warm the plate and take off the soft wax after which heat the plate till the ground melt pour on little oil and wipe the whole off with rag when the ground be take off rub the work well with the oil rubber and wipe the plate clean then proceed to finish it with the graver accord to the follow direction of engrave the tool necessary for engrave be the oil rubber bur nissier scraper oil stone needle and ruler alrcady mention to be use in etch also graver compass and sand bag graver be of two fort square and lozenge three of each sort should be provide fhe first be use in cut the broader stroke the other for the fainter and more delicate no graver should exceed the length of five inch and half the handle include except the strait line the sand bag or cushion be use to lay tlie plate on for the conveniency of turn it about the oil stone must be of the turkey sort of whet and temher the graver as great pain be require to whet the graver nicely par ticularly the belly of it care must be take to lay tlie two angles of the graver which be to be hold next the plate flat upon tlie stone and rub they steadily till they be polish like mirror and till the belly rise gradually above the plate as that when you lay the graver flat upon it you may just perceive the light under the point otherwise it will dig into the coppet and it will be impossible to keep apoint or execute thie work with freedom in order to this keep you right arm close to you side and place the fore finger of vour leave hand upon that part of the graver which lie uppermost on the stone when this be do in order to wliet the face place the flat part of the handle in the hollow of you hand with the belly of the graver upwards upon moderate slope and rub the extremity or face upon the stone till it have a exceed sharp point which vou may try upon you thumb nail the oil stone wliile in use must never be keep without oil when the graver be too hard as be usually the case when first buy and may be know by the frequent breaking of the point the method of temper the steel be as follow heat poker red hot and hold the graver upon it within half a inch of the point wave it to and for till the steel change to light straw colour then put the point into oil to cooi or hold the graver close to the flame of candle till it be of thie colour and cool it in the tallow but be careful either way not to hold it too long sor then it will be too soft and in this case the point which will then turn blue must be break off and whet afresn and temper again if re quire but be not too hasty in temper for sometimes little whet will bring it to good condition of hold the graver cut off that part of the handle which be upon the same line with the belly or sharp edge of the graver make that side flat that it may be no obstruction hold the handle in the hollow of you hand and extend ing vour fore finger towards the point let it rest upon the back of the graver that you guide it flat and parallel with the plate take care that vour finger do not interpose between the plate and the graver for they will prevent you from carry the graver level with the plate and from cut you stroke so clean as they ought to be direction for engrave let the table or board vou work at be firm and steady upon which place you sand bag with the plate upon it and hold the graver as above direct proceed to business in thie follow manner for straight stroke hold you plate firm upon the sand bag with you left hand move you right hand forward lean¬ ing lighter where the stroke should be fine and harder where you would have it broader for circular or crook stroke hold the graver stedfast move you hand or the plate as you see convenient learn to carry you hand with such sleight that you may end you stroke as finely as you begin it and if you have occasion to make one part deeper or blacker than a other do it by degree and that you may do it with greater exactness take care that you stroke be not too close nor too wide in the course of you work scrape off the barb or rough ness which arise with the belly of you graver but be care ful in do this not to scratch the plate and that vou may see you work properly as you go on rub it with the oil rubber and wipe the plate clean which will take off the glare of the copper and shew what you have do to the best advantage any mistake or scratch in the plate may be rub out with the burnisher and the part level with the scraper polish it again afterwards lightly with the burnisher have thus attain the use of the graver accord to the forego rule you will be able to finish the piece you have etch by grave up the several part to the colour of the original original beginning as in the etch with the fainter part and advancing gradually with the stronger till the whole be complete the dry needle so call because not use till the ground be take off tlie plate be principally employ in the extreme light part of water sky drapery architecture for you first practice copy such print as be openly fhade the more finish one be too difficult till you have gain farther experience to prevent any obstruction from too great à degree of light we would recommend the use of sashi make of transparent fan paper paste on ftame and place sloping at convenient distance between you work and the light this will not only preserve the sight but when the sun shine can not possibly be dispense with of mezzotinto scrape this art which be of late date be recommend to the practice of the ingenious reader for the amazing ease with which it be execute especially by those who have any notion of draw mezzotinto print be those which have no etch or stroke of the graver but whose light and ihade be blend together and appear like draw of indian ink the material use in this art be the copperplate oil stone grounding tool scraper bur nisher and needle direction for lay the mezzotinto ground mark off upon the bottom of the plate the distance you intend to leave for the writing coat of arm then lay vour plate with piece of swanskin flannel under it upon you table hold the grounding tool in you hand perrpendicu larly lean upon it moderately hard continually wave you hand in right line from end to end till you have wholly co ver the plate in one direction next crof the stroke from side to side afterwards from corner to corner work the tool each time all over the plate in every direction almost like the point of compass take ass possible car not to let the tool cut in one direction twice in place this do the plate will be full or in other word all over rough alike and would if it be priut appear completely black have lay the ground take the scraping of black chalk and with piece of rag rub it over tlie plate or you may with two or three candle smoke it as before direct for etch now take vour print or draw and have rub the back with red chalk dust mix with white lake proceed to trace it as before direct direction for whet the grounding tool lf tooth of the tool should break it may be perceive in the working by particular streak or gap which will appear in the ground in straight line in which case the tool must be whet on the back hold it sloping and in circular manner like the bottom of the tool direction for scrape the picture take blunt needle and mark the outline only then with scraper scrape off the light in every part of the plate as clean and as smooth as possible in proportion to the strength of the light in you picture take car not to hurt you out line and that you may the better see what you do with the thumb and fore finger of the left hand hold piece of tran parent paper sloping just over you right hand and you will soon be à judge of the different tint of the work you be do scrape off more or less of the ground as the dif ferent strength of light and tint require the use of the burnisher be to soften or rub down the ex treme light part after the scraper be do with such as the tip of the nose forehead line which might otherwise when prove rather appear misty than clear another method use by mezzotinto scraper be to etch the outline of the original as also of the fold in drapery mark the breadth of the shadow by dot which havingbit of pro per colour with aqua fortis accord to the direction before give take off the ground use in etch and have lay the mezzotinto ground proceed to scrape the picture as above four or five day before you think the plate will be ready for prove notice must he give to the roll press printer to wet some french paper as no other will do for this work and as that time be necessary for it to lie in wet when the proof be dry touch it with white chalk where it should be lighter and with black chalk where it should be darker and when the print be re touch proceed as before for the light and for the shade use small grounding tool as much as you judge necessary to bring it to the proper colour and when you have do as much as you think expedient prove it again and so proceed to prove and touch till it be entirely to you mind when the plate tarnissy in the part where you be at work little vinegar and salt keep by you in phial will take it off wipe it dry with clean rag avoid as much as poffible over scrape any part before the first prove as by this caution the work will appear more elegant of painting upon glass painting upon glass be a art which have generally ap pear difficult yet there be no representation can be more elegant than that of picture do well in this manner for it give all the softnef that can be desire in picture and be easy to work as there be no outline to draw nor any shade to make but the colour be put on without the trouble of either the picture be those do in mezzotinto for they shade be rub down on the glass the several line which be present the shady part of any common print be by this means blend together and appear as soft and united as in draw of indian ink provide such mezzotinto as vou like cut off the margin then get piece of fine crown glass the size of you print as flat and free from knot or scratch as possible clean the glass and lay some venice turpentine quite thin and smooth on one side thereof with brusn of hog s hair lay the print flat in water and let it remain on the surface till it sink tis then enough take it carefully out and dab it between somc papers that no water may be see yet so as to be damp next lay the damp print with it s face uppermost upon flat table then hold the glass over it without touch the turpentine till it be exactly even with the print let it fall gently on press tlie glass down carefully with you finger in several part so that the turpentine may stick to the print after which take it up then hold the glass towards you press the print with you finger from the centre towards the edge till there be no blister remain when this be do wet the back of you print with sponge till the paper will rub off with you finger then rub it gently and the white paper will roll off leave the impre sion only upon the glass then let it dry and with camel s hair pencil dipt in oil of turpentine wet it all over and it will be perfectly transparent and fit for painting colour prosier for painting upon glass the several sort of colour

present use with drop or two of nut oil upon you pallet with you pallet knife the pallet and knife may be have at most of the colour shop and ivory turner to get the colour out of the bladder prick hole at the bottom of each and press it till you have enough upon you pallet for present use because the colour be apt to dry and skin over then lay sheet of white paper upon the table and take the picture in you left hand with the turpentine side next you hold it sloping the bottom rest on the white paper and all the outline and tint of the print will be see on the glaf and nothing remaitis but lay on tlie colour proper for the different part as follow the method of use the colour as the light and shade of you picture open lay the lighter colour first on the lighter oart of you print and the darker over the shade part and have once lay on the brighter co lour it be not material if the darker fort be lay à little over they for the first colour will hide those lay on afterwards rad lay on

strain some coarse scotch or lrish cloth draw and fastening it withi small tack round the edge till it be quite smooth after which with sponge and fair water gently wet the blue paper and then with brush or rag paste the paper all over and lay it carefully on the cloth exactly even with the strain frame after which take it up and lay white paper on the table place the blue paper downwards with one hand keep the strain frame steady and with the other keep the cloth close to the paper do this very caresully and take it up lay it on the table with the blue paper up¬ ward and piece of paper under you hand and rub it close to the strain frame without touch any other part then let it stand to dry after which set it on a easal which mnay be have at the colour shop and proceed as follow make

work so faint that they may seem to lose themselves in air bring you colour forward as you distance decrease painting you first ground next the horizon downwards of bluish sea green and as you advance forward of reddisni or darker green till you come to the fore ground itself which as it be to be the darkest part of all do with dark green shade with dark brown or yellow which rule of shadow will also serve for the tree on each respective ground all distant object be to be iade imperfect as they appear to the eye as have be already observe under the article of light and shade in colour tree bough and branch touch in all the darker shade first raise the lighter leave above the darker by add masticot to the dark green which may be make with bice pink and indigo for the uppermost of all which be to be do last touch lightly the extremety of the leave with little green masticot and white and set off the darkest shadow with sap green and indigo these rule be adapt to general appearance but the learner may deviate from they as nature shall dictate with regard to drapery fruit flower and other branch of painting the best observation be to be take from the object themselves or the most curious and exact representa receipt for those who paint in water colour to make gum water dissolve one ounce of pure white gum arabic and half a ounce of double refine sugar in quart of spring water strain it through fine sieve or piece of muslin and bottle it off for use keep it free fromdust another way take some gum arabic of the whitest sort bruise it and tie it up in piece of wooll cloth and steep it in spring water in glass or earthen vessel till the whole be dissolve if it be too stiff add more water and if too thin more gum with this water you may temper most of you colour use such quantity that be touch when dry the colour will not come off if the colour shine there be too much gum in it to keep the fly from you work when you have make you gum water accord to either of the forego direction add thereto little coloquinida which will preserve you work when expose from be spoiled by the fly the make liquid gold for vellum painting fan grind the finest leaf gold with strong gum water very fine add as you grind it more gum water as you see necessary when vou have ground it as fine as you can wash it in large shell then temper it with little mercury sublimate bind it in the shell with little dissolve gum shake and spread it equally all over the shell and use it with fair water only to make liquid silver for the fame purhiose the process for this be the same with that of liquid gold only observe in the use it to temper it with glare of egg instead of water to make the glare of egg take the white and beat they with spoon till they all rise in foam let they stand all night and they will be cla rify into good glare to recover liquid silver that have contract rust if you silver by length of time or bad weather become rusty cover that part of you work with juice of garlick which will effectually recover it to keep the colour from sink boil four ounce of roch allum in pint of spring water tillit be thoroughly dissolve then silter it through brown pa¬ per and keep it for use before you lay on you colour take sponge and wet the back of vour paper with this water while it be hot this will not only prevent the colour from sinking but will also give they a additional beauty and lustre and preserve they from fad if you paper be not good it must be wash three or four time with this water drying it every time if you print be to be varnish wash they all over with white starch before you begin to lay on you colour to make size for painting scene and other candle light piece steep quarter of pound of the cutting of white glove leather in water for some tine then take they out and boil they in three quart of water till it waste to pint and strain it through cloth into a earthen pan when the size be cold if it feel firm under you hand it be strong enough you may prepare any colour in this size while it be warm and it will take off the glare which would appear upon they by candle light if mix with gum water to recover coloar when decay rosemary and with few drop of it temper you colour which however dead and fad will recover they bloom and brilliance this water or spirit will prevent tlie bubble in white and umber which be troublesome in grind pink the single pink do not admit of so great variety as the carnation but be nevertheless so variegate as to make it a agreeable slower for sattin silk the most com mon be either white or crimson other be stripe white and red other be white spot with red other edg with red all which may be work accord to the rule for the other flower so diversify with the same colour the leave and stalk be bluishi green only at the joint there be for the most part vellowissi tinge which be also at the bottom of the cup and scale painting on silk sattin when the outline be make accord to the artist s fancy wasn of isinglass should with care be lay on to take away the glare and sleekiness of the sattin otherwise the colour will not work freely the isinglass to be melt in very clear water over the fire so as not to be very glutinous otherwise it will discover the sattin and consequently spoil the colour in the forego rule we have recommend for the most part the leave the paper for the light part of flower and work with colour mostly transparent but here the light be to be make by small tincture of the colour of the in tend flower mixt with the flake white so much as just to make degree from the colour of the sattin if white or of any other colour to be mix proportionably to the colour of the flower for instance if blue flower the bice or verditer very small quantity of it with the white use less of it pro portionally as the shade grow darker and in the most dark indigo alone may be use it be by that tine render opaque enough but great care must be use not to lay the colour on too thick otherwise they will crack litile sugar candy will be find necessary when mix with guin water as preventative to that inconveniency if flower happen to be of so deep colour as not to admit of any pure white in the lightest of the part sort of priming of white should be lay on after which when dry begin with the ground colour of the flower proceed gradually with the shade as in the above direction which with the select example we have annex peculiarly choose from nature for the purpose we hope will be sufficient for we ingenious stu dent in this most delightful amusement of colour map and other print in water colour vave as yet see nothing publish upon this sub¬ hject that be authentic have think fit for the sake of those who be ineline to ingenuity to set forth the way and manner of do this work it be a excellent recreation for the gentry and other who delight in the knowledge of map which by be coloured and the several division do tinguish one from the other by colour of different kind do give better idea of the country they describe than they can possibly do uncoloured now to perform this work after the best manner there must be provide in the first place lye make with tartar and gum water to make the tartar lye do thus take two ounce of the best white tartar which be stony substance that stick to the side of wine vessel and be sell by the druggist wrap it up hard and tight in half sheet of cap paper wet it thorouglly in water and put it into clear sire either of iood or sea coal let it remain therein till it be red hot quite thirough then talte it out withi pair of tong andeput it im no mediately into apint of water and with vour singer rub it well to piace put it ini » long narrow glass and in day or two the black will all settle and the lve will become pure and clear pour oit tlie lye into clean glass and keep it cluse stop for use to muke gunn water take three ounce of the best and clearest gumn arabic wliich be sell at tlie druggist and heat it as small as yon can bruise it thien put it into pint of fair spring water and let it dissolve therein which will be much hasten hy shake tle botile two or three time day very well thit tlie gum that be dissolve may mix the better with the water that be ahote it and wie it be all dissolve if there appear anv foulness in it sirain it through rag into clean earthen dissi and put it into glass and stop it for use remember that too much of this ought not to be make at tinie for if tlie gum he keep too long dissolve in tlie water it will rot and be of no use you must therefore always olserve to make it fressi once in two montlis or tliree at the farthest in the next place vou mest prepare or make you colour for uie and tlie best for this work be those that sol low naniely copper green and that be make thus take pound of right french verdigrease make at montpelier this be thie best for the verdigrease make at any otlier place will fade to this add three ounce of cream of tartar beat they both into sine poiyder and take care uhile tlie verdigrease be in the in we mouth to breailie tiirnugh else the subtle powder of the verdigicase will he apt to offend and when this be do mix hothi the powder into two quaris of wate and boil it in a earthen pirkin tiil it boil away quart then strain it nut when coid and put the liquor into glass stop it up and let it stand to settle till tne liquor be very clear so you will have à delicate green but sometimes the verdigrease not be al¬ way of geodncss thie colour may not he deep enough fur some use in this case put some of it into broad earilien dith and set it over chare dish of coal and by à gentle lieat diminissi so much of the siquor till by try on paper and let it dry tlie colour please you and liere you be to note that if it shine toe much wlien dry it be not right for it be not rightly make except it just shine and if you can not make the colour deep enough by evaporate by heat the abound liquid without make it shine too much it be better to add some more verdigrease and boil it up again till it become deep transparent green lf vou would make but pint of this you must take but half the quantity of each and you be also to take notice that this be colour that will keep many year without decay if the glass that contain it be the next colour needful to be make be stone colour or liquor of myrrh which be thus do ne take pint of you tartar lye and add to it one ounce of the best myrrh in pow ¬ der which vou can get at the druggist and boil it till the myrth be dissolve which will be do in little time let it settle and pour off the clear for use wliich you must close stop up this be also tincture that will never decay and may be make fainter or deeper by boiling more of the liquor away to make it deeper or by add water the make it fainter and in the last place there be require crimson colour which be speedily make thus buy at the druggist some good cochineal about half a ounce will go great way take thirty or forty grain bruise they in gallipot to fine powder then put in they as many drop of the tartar lye as will just wet it and make it give forth it be colour and immiediately add to it half spoonful or more if the colour be yet too deep and you will have delicate purple liquor or tincture then take bit of allum and with knife scrape very finelv very little of it into the tincture and this will take away the purple co lour and make it delicate erimson strain it through fine cloth into clean gallipot and use it as soon as you can for this be colour that always look most noble when soon make use of as it will decay if it be make too long indigo be another colour use in colour of map this be buy at the shop that sell paint and it must be ground very fine on stone as you do oil colour with little tartar lye to niake it give it be colour and look the brighter when it be ground perfectly fine like thick syrup add gum water to it till it he thin enough for you purpose and keep it in glass close stop up but it will seitle so that when you use it vou must stir it exceed well up from the bottom for yellow gamboge be the best it be sell at the drug gist in lump and they way to make it fit for use be to make little hole with knise in lump and put some water into the hole stir it well with peneil till the water be either deeper or fainter yellow as you occasion require then pour it int gallipot and temper up more till you have enough for you purpose red lead be also colour much use in this work and so be orpiment both which you may buy at the colour shiop very well ground so tliat they need only to be temper with gum water to be fit for use blue bice be also often use which need only to be tem pered with gum water and when man design to be curious they may uie instead thereof ultramarine wliich be the best and most glorious of all bly vet extremely dear though small papers of it at about two shilling price may be buy at some colour shop which if carefully use will go great way it need only be temper in very small gally pot with some gum water till it lie on the paper with sine and almost transparent colour there be likewise a exceed glorious red or crimson colour name carmine which be exceed dear yet about half crown worth will go great way in the use to which it be put it be temper with guin water and give several degree of colour accord as it be thick or thin temper vermillion be also use in some cafe this be glorious scarlet that need only to be temper with gum water for it may be buy very finely ground to powder at the colour shop only it be to be note that this colour shew much brighter when dry if glaze over with some thick gum water wliich be make by puit two ounce of gum arabie to half pint of water or lel and for some use burnt umber ground very sine with water as thick as possible and then temper with gum water to à due thickness and then it make good transparent colour there be another colour needful in this work which be most pleasant grass green and that be make thus take lump of gamboge and make hole in it then put therein some copper green stir it about with pencil and from willow copper green it turn to grass green which you may make deeper or lighter as you stir it about longer or lesser time of the practice of colour map the colour be prepare as before direct the only way to colour map well be by pattern do by some good workman of which the dutch be esteem the best three or tour such map coloured by good aitist be sufficient to guide man in tlie right do of hii work but if he can not obtain this he may by few trial grow good artist in short time for this be only attain by practice and be man spoil half score map in order to get the knack of colour map well at last there be no man that be ingenious will grumble at it thie art of colour right may be attain by practice as be say but the hardest thing be to know rightly how to make and prepare the colour properly without suffer they to sink into it all that be here mention will lie fair and pleasant to the eye and it be the fairneis of the colour be this art of mappain but if the paper be not gend and strong no art can make the colour lie well therefure in buyieig map chuse those that be print on tlie thickest and strongest paper the practice of work oil colour and painting timber work after the manner of comnon painting that which ihere call common painting be only the way and manner of colour all kind of wainscot door window post rail pail gate border board for garden or any other material that require either beautv or preservation from the violence of rain or injury of weathier the method of do which shall lay down in the plainest manner possible suppose then that there he set of pallisadoes or pair of gate or some post and rail to paint and would finish tliem in stone colour first look over tlie work and take notice wliether the joint be open in the gate or whether there be any large cleft in the post for it these be nor well sccure the wet will insinuate itself into those desect and make the quicker dispatch in ruin the whole work let the first businel therefore be to stop up these place smooth and even with putty make of whiten and linseed oil well heaten together on the grind stone with wooden mallet to the consistence of very thick dough and with this let all the cranny cleft and other defect be perfectly fill you that it may he equal to the surface of the stuff then proceed to the priming of the work with some spanissi browni well ground and mix with very thin linseed oil with this do over the work give it as much oil as it will drink up this in about two day will be tolerably dry then if you would do this woik substantially do it over again with the same priming colour when this be thoroughly dry then take the white lead well ground and temper up not too thin for the stiffer you work it tlie better body will be lay on and the thicker coat of co lour that you timber be cover withal the longer it will last let this colour be well rub on and the whole surface of the work be so entirely cover that there remain no creek nor corner bare which you may easily perceive by job in the point of bristle brush let this first colour dry and then go over it à second time and if you please third also the charge will be à little more but the advantage will be much greater this course be sufficient for any kind of timber work that require onsy plain colour wliether you thus cover the work with stone colour or else with timber colour in umber and white or lead colour in indigo and white that of the white be the cheapest of the three by much nay have know some lay over they work only with coat of spanissi brown by temper it up more stiffthan be do for the two sirst priming which in some respects be cheapest of all and pre serve the timber perhaps as well as any now he that be able to bring the work thus far on have proceed to the highest pitch of that common painting that aim at preservation beyond beauty though something of beauty be necessarily in clude in this also but this be not all for he that be arrive thus far be in fair way to other perfection in the art of paint ing but for the pannelling of wainscot with its proper shadow and for imitate olive and walnut wood marble and such like these must be obtain by ocular inspection it be impossible to deliver the manner of the operation by precept without example and be bold to affirm ghat man shall gain more knowledge by one day s experience than by hundred spend to acquire it in souie other way advise therefore all those that desire a insight into this business to be little curious if opportunity offer in ob serve the manner of painter work not only in grind he colour but also in lay they on and work they in in all these observe the motion of he hand in manage of any kind of tool and by this means with little imitation oin to the direction here give ldoubt not but in fhois tine you may arrive to great proficiency in the business of common painting note that when vou have make use of you colour if there be occasion for small cessation till the work be finish in this caseit be best to cover you colour in pot with water for that will prevent they drying even in the hottest time and for you pencil they ought as soon as you have do work to be well wash out in clean linseed oil and then in warm sud for if either oil or colour be once dry in the brusn or pencil it be spoiled for ever it have be observe that timber lay over with white when it have stand some time in the weather the colour will crack and slirink up together just as pitch do if lay on any thing that stand in the sun the cause be that the colour be not lay on with stiff body able to bind itself on firm and fast lf you shall at any time have occasion to use either brush or pencil that be very small as in many case there will he occasion vou ought then to dispose of the colouis you use upon pallet which be wooden instrument easy to be have at any colour shop and there work and temper thiem about with you pencil that the peneil may carry away the more colour for vou be to note that if apencil be only dip in à pot of colour it bring out no more than what hang on the outside and that will work but very little way whereas if vou rub the pencil about in the colour on the pallet good quantity of colour will be take up in the body of the peneil and besides all this you may work pencil better to point on pallet than you can do in apot the point of pencil be of the greatest use in diver case especially in draw of line and all kind of flourishing catalogue of the several colour use in haint with oil white the principal of all white be white lead of this colour there be two fort the one call ceruse which be the most pure and clean part the ntlier be call by the plain name white lead besides white lead and ceruse there be another fort to be meet with sometimes which they call flake white blackslamp black lamp or candle black ivory black willow charcoal red . vermillion be the most delicate of all light red be of itself most perfect scarlet colour lake especially the richest sort be the best of all dark red be most pure crimson red lead be the lightest of all red now in use it be fandy harsh colour and such one as be not easily ground very fine although you bestow much labour on it spanish brown be dark dull red of a horse fleshi colour it be anearth but there be some of it of very good colour and pleasant enough to the eye consider the deepness of its colour it be of very great use amongst painter be generally use as the first or priming colour that they lay first upon any kind of work be cheap and plentiful and colour that work well if it be ground fine as you may do with less labour than some better colour require the first fort be the deepest colour and most free fram stone the other sort be not so good to give colour to the eye but yet they serve as well as any other for prim ing colour vellow yellow oker be of two fort one call plain oker the other spruce oker the one be much lighter colour than the other pink yellow orpiment be that colour which some call yellow arsenic masticot be good light yellow for most use especially in make green of which several sort may be frame out of this colour be mix with blue green verdigrease be the best and most useful green of all other green bice be of fandy nature and therefore not so much use green verditer be also sandy colour neither of they bear any good body and be seldom use but in land scape where variety be require bly . blue bice bear the best body of all bright bly use in common work but it be the palest colour blue verditer be of no good body something sandy and of no very good colour itself be apt to turn greenisn and be mix with yellow make very good green indigo be dark blue if work by itself to remedy which white be usually mix and then it make bui faint blue note that the longer this colour be ground the more beautiful and fair it look smalt be the most lovely blue of all other notethat of thiis colour there be two fort the finest be that which be call oil smalt umber be colour that really have no affinity with the other before mention be neither white black red yellow blue or green yet it be colour of as great use as any of the what colour be most suitable and set off best one with by set off best mean they make each other dlook most pleasant for two of some particular colour put together or one next the other shall add much to the beauty of each other as blue and gold red and white and such like but green and black put togethier look not so pleasant neither do black and umber or haw colour and such like all yellow then set off best with black with bly and with red all bly set off best with white and yellow green set off well with black and white white set off well enough with any colour red set off best with yellow white and black gold look well enough upon white ground especially if the matter to be gill be carve gold and black shew very well gold on timber colour shew also very well so do gold and horse flesn colour make with the finest spaniss brown but the most glorious ground of all other for gold be the vermillion red the smalt blue and the lake lay on light ground of some colour that arise from mixture as ni colour be make of wliite lead and lamp black if deep asn colbur then take more black if light one then take but little black and must white lead colour be make of indigo and white colour resemble new oake timber be make of umber and white lead flesn colour be compound of lake white lead and little vermillion buff colour take yellow oker and white lead for willow green take verdigrease alone for light willow gie take verdigrease and white for grass green take verdigrease and pink carnation be make of lake and white orange colour yellow oker and red lead light timber colour mix spruce oker and white and very little umber brick colour red lead little white and yellow oker for straw colour take white and little yellow oker olive wood be imitate with oker and little white vein over with burnt umber walnut tree be imitate with burnt umber and white vein over with the sane colour alone and in the deepest place with black pail and post be sometimes lay over with white which they call stone colour sometimes post and pail be lay over with indigo and white wlich be call lead colour window frame be lay in white if the building be new but if not then they be generally lay in lead colour or indigo and white and the bar with lead door and gate if paint in pannel then the shadow of white ground be umber and white but if lay in lead colour then the shadow be list with black it be impossible to set down all those variety of colour that may be produce by mixture they that would see more may peruse dr. salmon polygrafice where they will find great variety but those which have here give a account of will sufficiently seive for common painting some direction for mixing of oil colour for diver purpose in the art of colour print with oil colour colour for several face for face that be account fair take white lead little vermillion and small touch of lake for the lip take more of the vermillion and lake than you do for the face for brown face take burnt oker and white for tawiiy moor take cullen earth little burnt oker and little white colour for hair for brown hair mix umber and little black and white for yellow hair take stone oker white lead and little vermillion for flaxax hair take white lead stone oker and little cullen earth line be do with white lead or ceruse silver be do with white little smalt and some white masticot gold be do with red orpiment and white masticot of each a equal quantity colour for garment for blue garment the best smalt and white lead for grass gréen mix verdigrease and little pink yelloiv for willow green mix verdigrease and very little white sea green be make by mixing green verditer pink and white lead french green be make by mixing pink and indigo carnation by mixing lake and white lead crimson be make by mixing vermillion lake and white fcarlet be only vermillion lay on alone cherry colour be make by mixing vermillion and white lead for vellow lay on either yellow orpiment or yellow maf¬ ticot if you yellow be more pale then mix white with the former for a orange colour mix red orpiment and little ver million for purple mix smalt lake and white for violet mix bice and lake straw colour be make with white and yellow oker and very little umber a afhi colour be make by mixing black and white achesnut colour be make by mixing umber lake and white dove colour or the wing of a angel take white little lake and little smalt colour for tree for body of tree take pink yellow white lead yellow oker and little black for the leave of they that be near the eye take verdi grease and pink or if dark coloured then take indigo and pink for leave of tree farther off take green verditer pink and white lead for they that be farthest of all take terra verd and white colour for grounds behind picture nore that light hair require dark ground and dark hair light ground ground colour for picture with light hair be make with umber white and black ground colour with dark hair be make with umber and white for ground in landscape take pink oker and white with little green verditer for country house at distance take white lead yellow oker and smalt the same colour serve also for house of stone for brick house or wall take yellow oker burnt and white lead if the work be far off but if near then indian red and little white for pail of wood or other timber work of what kind so ever in country cottage take umber white and little oker sky colour be make of smalt and white for the highest sky more white for the lower and yellow mixt with little vermillion for the lowest of all how to make size for gild both with gold and silver the operation be thus for the making of gold size take yellow oker and grind it on stone with water till it be very fine and afterwards lay it on chalk stone to dry this be the common way or you may wash you oker for when it be wash to be sure nothing but the purest of the colour will be use and besides it be do with less daub when you oil and oker be thus prepare you must grind they together as you do other oil colour only with fat dry ing oil but it be somewhat more laborious and must be ground very fine even as oil itself for the finer it be the greater lustre will you gold carry that be lay on it here note that you must give it such quantity of vour fat oil that it may not be so weak as to run when you have lay it on nor so stiff that it may not work well but of such competent body that after it be lay on it may settle itself smooth and glossy which be chief property of good size silver size be make by grind white lead with fat drying oil some add little verdigrease to make it bind how to gild with gold or a oily size either letter or figure whatsoever vou would gild must first be draw with gold fize the making of which have be man tion accord to the true portion you would have gill whether figure letter or whatever else it be when you have thus draw the true proportion of what you would have gill let it remain till it be sufficiently dry to gild upon which you shall know by touch it with the end of you singer for if vour finger stick little to it and yet the colour come not off then it be dry enough but if the colour come off on you finger thenit be not dry enough and must be let alone longer for if you would then lay vour gold on it would so drow it that it would be worth nothing but if vour size should be so dry and the gold will not take sor wliich there be no re medy but new size therefore you must watch the true time that it be not too wet or too dry both extreme be not at all convenient when you size be ready for gild take vour book of leaf gold and open loaf of it take it out with you cane ply er and lay it on you gild cushion and if it lie not smooth blow on it with you breath which will lay it flat and plain then with knife of cane or for want of it a ordinary poeket knife that hath smooth sharp edge with this sbe wipe very dry on vour sleeve that the gold stick not to it let you leaf of gold be cut into such piece or form as you judgment shall think most suitable to you work when you have thus cut you gold into convenient form then take you gild pallet tis flat piece of wood about three inch long and a inch broad upon which be to be glew piece of sine wooll cloth of the same length and breadth and breathe upon it to make it dampisn that the gold may stick to it with this tool take you gold by clapping it down on the several piece you have before cut into forin and transser it to you size upon which clap it down accord to discretion and you gold must afterwards press down smooth with bunch of cotton or hare s foot and this you must do piece hy piece till you have cover all you size gold and after it be fully dry then with you hare s foot brush off all the loose gold so will you gild remain fair and beautiful if you work to be gill be very large open you book of leaf gold and lay you leaf down on you work without cut it into piece and so do leaf by leaf till vou have cover quite over what you intend to gild and if some particular place should miss take up with small bunch of cotton piece of leaf gold cut to fit size and clap it on that the work may be entirely cover and if the gold be to be lay in the hollow of carve work you must take itup on the point of camel hair pencil and convey it in and with the say pencil dab it down till it lie close and smooth how to gild with silver in lay on silver upon a oily size the same method in all respects require as for gild with gold save only in this that the size upon which silver be lay ought to be com¬ pound of very little yellow oker and much white lead for the size be of light colour the silver lay on it will look more natural and retain its own colour better the whiter the size be note that the common painter do now generally in gild ing use more silver than gold in most work that be not much expose to the air to wliich they afterwards give the colour of gold by means of the lacker varniss whose use be now so common that if they gild any thing that stand free from the weather they only gild with silver and so give it the colour of gold with lacker varnist make of gum lake do solve in spirit of wine and lay over it
