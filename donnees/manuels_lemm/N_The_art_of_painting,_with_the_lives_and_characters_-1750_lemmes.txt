that which be natural to each object in whatever place tis find which diftinguithe it from other and which perfectly mark its character the claro obfcuro be the art of diftribute light and fhadow advantageoully as well on particular object as on picture in general on particular object to give they convenient relievo and roundnel and in the picture in general to expofe the object with pleafure to the view of the spectaror by give the eye a occation to reft which be do by a ingenious diftribution of great light and great fhadow which lend each other murual affiftance by they oppofition thus great light be repofe for great fhadow as great tha dow be for great light though as have be faid the claro obfcuro comprehend the art of place all light and fhadow well yet tis more particularly underftand to be the knowledge of rightly difpoting great light and great thadow they distribution in this laft fenfe may be make four way firtt by the natural fhadow of the body secondly by croupe that be by difpofing the object in fuch manner that the light may be join ' all rogether and the fhadow the same as one may imperfectly perceive in grape whofe grain on the fide of the light make mat of brightness and on the oppofite fide mat of art of paintin darkness yet all together form but one groupe and be as one object this muft be do of artificially that no affectation may appear in it the object muft feem of fituate naturally and as by chance thirdly by the accident of suppote light and fourthly by the nature and the body of the colour which the painter may give to he object without alter they character this part of painting be the beft and fureft way for painter to add force to he work and to render he object as well in general as in particular don find that the way of the claro obfcuro be know in the roman school before polidoro do caravagio time who difcover it and make it one of the principle of the art of painting and wonder the painter who come after he do not perceive that the great effect of he work on the spectator proceed from the reft which he give the fight in group he light on one fide and he shadow on another which he do only by the knowledge of the claro obfcuro wonder fay how they could let of neceffary part of they art elcape without take notice of it however the claro obfcuro be to be find among fome of the roman painter yet tis not to be efteem as any thing more than happy effect of genius or chance and not as proceed from a eftablifh ' principle of the art andrew bofcoli florentine painter have right notion of the claro obicuro as may be feen by he work but the reeftablishment of this principle be ow to giorgione whofe competitor titian perceive it make ufe of it ever after in flander otho veniuslaid it down as funda= mental in painting and communicate it to ruben he pupil the latter render it more fenfible to the spectator and shew ' the neceffity of it of aparenily that the beft flemish painter follow ' he in the art of paintin in it and have recommend they painting by this part of perfection for without it all the care they have take to imitate the particular object of nature with the utmoft faithfulness have not be worth we confideration in the distribution of colour there ought to be a agreement or harmony which have the fome effect on the eye as mufick have on the ear if there be feveral groupe of the claro obfcuro in picture one of they should be more fenfible than the reft and be predominant over the other that there may be unity of object as in the compofition there should be unity of fubject the pencil if poffible muft be bold and light but whether it feem all of piece like that of corregio or unequal and uneven like that of rembrant it ought always to be foft and caty if painter be forc ' to make ufe of the licece they should be imperceptible judicious advantageous and juftifiable the three firft fort belong to the painter art and the laft to hiftory whatever painter be mafter of he art in all the part we have mention he may depend upon it he be arrive to great degree of perfection and picture will infallibly be fine yet not enturely perfect if beauty be not accompany with grace grace muft feafon the part we have fpoken of and every where follow genius grace fupport and perfect it but it be not to be of thoroughly acquire as by any rule to be demonftrate painter have it from nature only and do not know that he have it nor in what degree nor how he communicate it to he work it furprife the spectator who feel the effect without penetrate into the true caufe of it but this grace do not rouch he otherwife than accord to the difpolition aet of painting wherein he find it we may define it thus se tis what pleafes and gain the heart without concern itfelf with the underitanding grace and beauty be two different thing beauty pleafes by the rule only and grace without they what beautiful be not always graceful but grace join with beauty be the heighth of perfection we have give this idea of perfect painter in as few word as we could that we might not be tedious to thofe who be in no doubt about the thing it contain but for thofe that defire proof of it we have endeavour to fatisfy they in the follow remark in which both the one and the other will find we have treat of fuch thing as naturally prefent themfelves to we and perhaps will not be indifferent to they the follow remark anfwer in chapter to the feveral part of the idea of perfect painter of which we have speak in the forero treatife and the reader in all the chanter should by he nemory lupply the part where we have treat of they to explain they dnsi ie it art of pain nc hap remark and instruction on the precede ide of gen in vain for man to endeavour with all they might to reach the point of perfection in the art of painting or any other art if they be not bear with particular talent for the fcience they profef they will always be uncertain of attain the end they propofe to themfelves rule and example may shew they the means of reaching it but that be not fufficient if thefe example and rule be not eafy and agreeable to they they will never be fure this facility be only find in thofe who before they learn the rule of art or fee the work of other man have confult they own inclination and examin ' whether they be put upon the choice of they profeffion by fome inward light which be indeed genius and be what guide they by the neareft and eafieft way to perfection rendering they infallibly hap both in the means and in the end genius therefore be that light of the mind which conduct we to the end by the moft eafy mean prefent which nature make to man at the hour of he birth and though the commonly give it for one thing only the be fometime of liberal as to make it general in one perfon there have be feveral man on whom the have beftow this plenitude of influence who have with eafe perform ' wwhatart of painting they attempt and always fucceed in what they undercook particular genius tis true do not extend its force to all fort of knowledge as general one do but then it penetrate farthe into that over which tis predominant painter in the firft place should have ge nius but that genius muft be correct by rule reflection and induftry he muft have see much read much and ftudy ' much to direct he genius that it may produce thing worthy pofterity but fince he can not fee or fludy every thing he would defire to know in the way to the perfection he aim at he may without fcruple make ufe of and the man udy ap ii that man may without scruple make use of anotber man study impoftible for painter to reprefent well not only all the object he have not feen but alfo thofe he have not defign ' if he have not feen alion he can never paint one and if he have see one he will always paint it imperfectly unless he firft defign it after nature or after another man 's wotk for this reafon we ought not to blame painter who have never feen or fludy ' the object he be to reprefent make ufe of another man htudy rathe than draw fomething falfe out of he own head tis neceffary he should have he example in he memory or he tablebook he own fay of thofe of another man when painter have furnish ' he mind with images of the beautiful thing he have feen he add to of the art of painting i diminithe they accord to he gout or as he judgment direct this change arife by comparing the idea of what he have feen one with the other and chufe that which he think beft for example raphael in he youth while he live with he mafter perugino have only the idea of the work of that painter in he mind but afterwards compar they with thofe of michael angelo and with the annque he chofe that which feem ' beft to he and we of it form ' refin ' gufto fuch as we fee now in all he production thus genius make ufe of the memory as veftel wherein it keep all the idea that prefent themfelves to it the painter choofe thofe that be for he purpofe by the help of he judgment and treafure they up in magazine out of which he take they as occafion require iwas out of fuch magazine if may of expret myfelf that raphael take all thofe high idea which he have draw from the antique and thus albert durer and luca van leyden draw from theirs thofe gothic idea with which the practice of they time and the nature of they country furnifh ' they perfon that have genius may invent subject in general but if he have not rudy ' particular object he will be embarals ' in the execution of he work unlefs he have recourfe to the work of another if painter have neither time nor opportunity to fee nature yet have fine genius he may fludy after the picture the defign and the print of thofe mafter who know how to choofe they subject well and to draw they with judgment he who

when to make ufe ingeniouly of the licence either in the effence of the art or in hiftory the latter be the more difficult work and require we attention we shall speak further of it in the follow chapter the art of painti xxiii by what authorit the painter bave reprefent under buman figure thing divine spiritual and inanimate ipture tell we in feveral place of god appear to man either by the miniftry of he angel or in dream and vifion there be fine delcription of god under the form of a old man in the feventh chapter of daniel and the ninth verfe the fame holy writ inform we of feveral apparition of angel under human form for this reafon the church in the council of nice make no fcruple to allow painter to reprefent god the father under the figure of venerable old man and angel under human figure painter be alfo juftify ' on the fame account to give life to inanimate thing when they follow exactly the idea the fcripture give we of they the spectator should not prefently be fcandaliz ' if he fee facr thing mixt with poetical fiction as if fiction and poetry be indifpentibly profane the book of job the plalm of david the apocalyple be all poetical and full of figurative expreftion without reckon all the parable which be in the other part of the cripture iwas in copy the facr text that raphael painting the paffage of jordan give that river human figure and draw he puth back he water to they fource he be warrant to do this by holy writ which to pro portion its expreffion to man underftanding often reprefent divine thing in the shape of human and for the instruction of the faithful make ufe of the moft palpable and fenfible comparifon and idea we have paffage relate to the subject of the art of paintin river in the pfalm where it be faid can let co the flood clap they hand letthe hill be joyful can together the painter who have the fame intention to instruct and to edify can not follow berter pattern pouffin in he picture of the finding of mofe have obferve the same conduct in reprefent the river nile for which he have be blame by some perfon who alledge thefe reafon againtt he they fay that painter should not mingle falfe god with thing relate to we religion that river be falfe divinity whom the hleathen worthip and whom we ought not to introduce in facr hiftory and further that painter may well enough reprefend river as river but not do it under human figure to all this one may eafily antwer that as the holy fcripture when it introduce river under human figure have no intention to speak of thote the pagan adore and though it might have expret 's itfelf fimply and naturally yet it make ufe of figurative ftile without fear to feduce the faithful to alfo chriftian painter who ought to imitate the fcripture be very far from endeayour to alter the truth of hiftory he rather strife conform himfelf to he original to thew it more livelily and elegantly not to a infidel but to chriftian as he be who be prejudice againft the falfe divinity ought not to find out another meaning than that of the holy scripture but with respect to pagan divinity which be introduce as fuch and with the character that thew what they be tis more difficult to admit they in fuch kind of compofition the learn have handle that matter by its relation to poefy and the caufe remain still to be decide however the painter who have no other way to express hepfal xcvil art of painting than by thefe fort of figure inttead of be blame will always be commend by the beft judge when they find they bring in prudently and ingenioutly for the falfe divinity may be confider ' two way either as god or as fymbolical figure as god the painter muft never reprefent they except it be in subject entirely pro fane and as fyribolical figure he may incroduce they with difcretion on all occafion where he think they neceffary ruben who of all painter mmade ufe of thefe fymbol the moft ingenioully and the moft learnedly as may be feen in the book of the cardinal infant entrance into antwerp and by the picture of the gallery of raixemburg have be cenfure for if he should not fay they have bring allegorical figure into he compofition nor have mix table with truth fs to which we may antwer tuai as ruben have manage it he have not confound fable with truch he rather have employ ' the fymbol of the fable to expret the fame truch in the picture of the birth of lewis xliith on the top of it in cloud at diftance he have reprefent caffor on he wing horfe and on the fide apollo in he chariot mountingon high to thew that the prince be bear in the thorn and that he mother 's delivery be happy from whence we may infer that the painter have thought of reprefent the god as god but caftor only as conftellation that render ' event fortunate and the chariot of apollo mount upward to mark the time of the morning if the painter with a intention to express himfelf the better have think it neceffary or convenient to reprefent the diviniry of the fable among hiftorical figure thofe fymbol muft be look ' upon as invifible and as not there any otherwife than by they fighification d art of painting in this fenfe the fecond council of nice authoriz ' in what they do by the scripture allow the reprefentation of god the father and the angel under human figure for there would have be greater inconvenience in painting the perfon of the holy trinity and the angel than in introduce pagan divinity in picture if the fenfe that the former should be take in be pot explain ' chriltian be fufficiently prepoffeft againft thefe falfe appearance which be intend only for they instruction to profit by they should have the fame notion of they as the painter and look upon they a not there the authority for painting the angel with wing be take from the ark of the covenant and from the chapter of daniel the verfe however thefe paftage do not indifpenfibly oblige paintersto draw angel always with wing they may do it or not do it as they art good fenfe and the inftruction of the faithful require the reader will easity perceive tis papift that argue thus for the idolatrous cuftom of represent the boly trinity and the angel under buman figure be argument be so mean it deserve no answer and the peron so weak it need no antidote or we might quote against he the verse of the pfalm the same be have quote above where be these word can confound be all they that ferve grave ima cc ges that boaft themfelves of idol worship he ye god x xv ap art of paintinc ap xxiv of naked figure and how they may be make ise of thihe painter and fculptor who underfland defign very well commonly feek after occafion to thew the naked to gain efteem and di ainction for which they be certainly praifeworthy provide they keep themfelves within the bound of the truth of hiftory of verifimility and modetty there be some subject in which man may more reafonably reprefent nakedness than in other as for example in table when the fcene lie in hot country and we know nothing of the mode of the people or when the labourer of the firft age be reprefent cato the cenfor as plutarch relate work naked among he labourer when he come from the fenate and st peter be naked when we saviour appear to he after he refurrection and find he fithing with the other apoftle nakednet may alfo be make ufe of in the reprefentation of allegorical subject the pagan god or hero in thort on all occafion where we may fuppofe we look upon fimple nature where cold or impudence be not predominant for clothes be only invent to keep man from cold and fhame there be at this day great many people in feveral part of the world who go ftark naked either becaufe they dwell in hot country or that cuftom have take away the indecency and shame of hakednet in word the general rule which should be obferve in this cafe be as we have al ready faid that there be nothing againtt modefty or verifimility the painter draw moft of they figure with they head and foot naked wherein they follow the the art ofaint dictate of fimple nature which eafily accultom thofe two part to nakedness we fee example of this kind not only in hot country but in the midft of the cold mountain of the alp where even the child go with they feernake in fummer among the ftone and flint and in winter over the ice and fnow but with regard to the truth of hiftory though nakedness be licence which painter be poffet ' of and wfe to the advantage of they aft yet they often abufe it go except either raphael or pouffin they have reprefent the apoftle with they foot rake centrary to what be pofitively faid in the gofpel where we saviourordering they to take no care for what they should put on command they to be content with the shoe they have on they foot without carry other with they and in the act of the apoftle when the angel dilver st peter he bid he put on he girdle and tie he shoe from whence we may conclude they be commonly wear the fame with mofe who in the viftion of the burn bufh be warn to leave he shoe and yet raphael paint he feer naked in all the other action of he life as if wofe have never any thoe on but when he be keep he fatherinlaw theep might here give many more inrance wherein raphael and feveral other painter after he have draw they figure without thee and flocking againft hiftony and verifimility do not think what have faid fufficient obferve that the grecian culptor more commonly make they figure pake than the romian but know no other reafon for it than that the creck chofe subject more agreeable to the defire they have to have the depth of they art admird in they reprefent the conftruction and union of the part of man body in they ftatue they beprefent god rather than man and in they baffe tcthe art of paint in eacchanal and facrifice rather than hiffery the roman on the contrary who by they ftatue and baffo relievo armed at tranfmiting the memory of they emperor to pofterity be neceffarily oblige to de nothing againtt the truth of hiffory but to dresstheir figure accord to the mode then in fathion hap x xv of gr a ee ffyhie necefficy of grace in painting generally peaking be thing that need no proof there be only one difficulty in the matter the wit if this grace be neceffary in all fort of fubjeus in bactel as well as feftival in foldier as well as woman grant it be and my reafon for it be that though ' grace thew infelf firft in the face yet it be not in part only that it refide it confift chiefly in the turn the paipntergive he object to render they even fuch be inanimate from whience it follow that there may be ggrace in the fiercrness of foldier by the turn which may be give to he air and he pofture and even in drapery or any thing elfe by the manner in which it may be dif pofe have give this idea of perfect painter and proof of the feveral part that go to the form one there only remain a application to the work of the painter and to put they as it be in the fcale not to reject entirely thefe that have not all the quality which we have eftablish but to value they accord to they weight this the art of painting idea may help we to judge of the defign of different mafter mean of the degree of they goodness for tis almoft impoffible to write with uftness of the originality of defign or the name of the author or to lay down rule how he may be know ch xxvi of design ahie defign of which we intend to fpeak here be thofe thought that painter commonly expret on paper for the execution of fome work they be go about we should place among defign the hudy of reat mafter that be thofe part which they have defign after nature as head foot and entire figure drapery animal tree plant flower and in thort every thing that may enter into the composition of picture for whether you confider good defign by its relation to the picture of which it be antidea or by relation to fome part of which it be the htudy it always deserve the attention of the curious though the knowledge of defign be not of eftiinable nor of of large extent as that of picture it be however delicate and pleafant becaufe the great number of they give thofe that love they more opportunity to exercife they criticifins and the work be all the production of the mind defign denote beft the character of the mafter and thew if he genius be lively or heavy if he thought be elevare or common in thort if he have good manner and good gout of all the part which may be expreft upon paper painter who would finish picture endeavour if one may of fay to go out of the art of painting himfelf that he may acquire praife for fome part of he art which he know very well he be not poffeav of but in make defign he give loofe to he genius and thew what he be for this reafon it be that in the collection of the great we find the delign of the beft mafter preferve as well as the picture and yet there be few perfon who be curious about delign and among thofe few if some know the manner fcarce any one know the end the half crity have no inclination towards this curiofity becaufe have no fufficient notion of the meaning of defign they have no relifh of the performance and take more pleafure in print carefully engrave from good picture which may be occafion fometime thro fear of be deceive and of take as it often happen copy for original for want of experience there be three thing in general to be obferve in defign learn fpirit and freedom by learn underfland good compofition defign correct and of good go with laudable knowledge of the claro obfcuro by the word spirit comprehend lively and natural expreffion thro the whole work of the subject in general and the object in particular freedom be no more than habit which the hand have contract to express readily and boldly the idea in the painter 's mind and as there be more or less of thefe three thing in defign tis the more or less valuable though free defign be generally accompany with good deal of fpirit yet all the defign that be make with freedom be not for all that fenfibly touch ' and if the learn defign be not always free they be thofe generally which have the moft pirit in they might here name abundance of painter whofe defign have great deal of freedom without any spirit whofe bold hand produce nothing but rambling the art of paintin petformance might alfo name feveral able man whofe delign appear fliff though otherwife and fentible becaute they hand be reftrain by they judgment and they rudy above all thing to make they outline correct and they expreftion juft avoid name they not to offend any body let every one judge as he think fit this muft be faid of freedom tis to agreeable that it hide and often excufe great many fault which in fuch cafe be rather attribute to a impetuofity of genius than to infufficiency but we mult own alfo that freedom of hand do not seem to be freedom when tis confine within the bound of great regularity thus in the moft correct defign of raphael there be delicate free dom which be only vifible to the eye of the learn in word there be fome delign which be not over correct and which yet be not without they merit have good deal of fenfe and character of this fort be the defign of william baur rembrant benedetti and fome other defign that be butjuft rouch ' and not finith ' have more pirit and pleafe more than thofe that be perfect provide they character be good and they pur the idea of the spectator in good way the reafon be that the imagination fupplies all the part which be want or be not finith and each man fee it accord to he own gout the defign of thofe mafter who have more genius than learn often give occafion to experience the truth of this affertion but the defign of excellent mafter who join folidity to fine genius lofe nothing by be finith ' and fuppoting every thing elfe be antwerable delign be to be efteem becording as they be finith ' though we ought to value moft thofe defign wherein moft part be find yet should we not bejeet thele wae there be no more than one provide the arf of pain ting tis of fuch manner that it shew some principle of the art or carry with it any fenfible fingularity which pleafes or instruct neither ought we to reject thofe that be but fketch by which one fee very faint idea only and but a eftay of the fancy fince tis curious to remark how skilful painter at firft conceive they thought before they digeft they and tkerch thew we further what touch great mafter make ufe of to characterife thing with few stroke to tatisfy one 's curiofity therefore it would be well if one have defign of all kind of the fame mafter to wit not only of he firft second or laft manner but even he lighteft kerch as well as he moft finith defign confess however the curieus who be purely speculative don of much find they account in it as thofe who know how to prabtice be more capable of relifh this curiofiry there be one thing which be as the falr of defign that feafon it and give it its relifh withour which ifisworth little or nothing and which canr expret better than by be the word character this character confift then in the manner in which the painter think thing the feal that diftinguithe he work from thofe of other man and which imorint on they the image of he mind be this character that agitate we imagination and tis by this that ikilful painter after have ftudy under good mafter or after the work of other feel themfelves conftrain by sweet violence to let they gemis loofe and fly with they proper wing exclude out of the number of good defign all that be infipid of which there be three fort firft thofe of painter who though they produce great compofition and be exact and correct yet pread over they work certain coldnel which freeze the fpectator secondly thofe of painter who have more menmory than genius be always playin art of painting the plagiary and work by the idea they have ftor up from other mens production which they have feen or elfe make ufe of fuch as be before they with too little induftry and too much fervility and thirdly thofe of painter who tie themfelves up to they mafter manner without ever quit or enrich it the knowledge of delign as well as of picture confift in two thing viz to find out the name of the mafter and the goodness of the delign to know that defign be of fuch mafter man muft have view with attention great many other of the fame hand and have have in he mind juft idea of the character of he genius and of the character of he practice the knowledge of the character of genius require great extent and great clearnel of mind to keep the idea without confound they and the knowledge of the character of practice depend more on great habitude than great capacity and for this reafon tis that the moft ikilful painter do not always decide this point the mott juftly to know if defign be fine if it be a original or copy great deal of delicacy and penetration be requifite togetherwith much exercile that way and question whether it can be do withour fome knowledge of manual practice and yet after all man may be deceive it feem to I tis eafy to infer from what have be faid that the comparifon of the work of the painter with the idea we have eftablifh of per foot painter be the beft way to know what efteem be due to they but fince man have not always great number of picture at he difpofal nor enough finish defign to exercife he judgment and of to acquire in short time habit of judge well good print may ferve inftead of picture for except the local colour they be fulcepriple of all the part of painr and befide that they will shorten the time the art of painting and be very proper to fill the mind with the knowledge of a infinity of thing the reader hope will not be difpleat to find here what have difcover in this matter ch xxvii of the ufefulness and use of print be bear with defire to know and a nothing to much hinder he inform he as the trouble of learning and the eafiness of forget two thing of which the greateft part of mankind complain with great deal of reafon for fince the art and fcience have be fight after and to penetrate far into they a infinity of volume have be publifh at the fame time be bring to light a object terrible enough to frighten we from look into they and capable to thock we mind and dithearten we memory however we have more reafon than ever to exercife both the one and the other or at leave to find out means to help they in they feveral function that which we be about to treat of the invention of print be very powerful one and one of the happielt production of latter age they be in we age arrive to to high degree of perfection and good graver have give we of many on all fort of marter that it may truly be faid they be the depolitory of all that be fine and curious in the world they origin be in the year and arofe from one mufo finiguerra goldfimith of florence who grave he plate when caft fome of it in melc fulphur he perceive that what come out of the mould be mark with the same print as he plate the art of paintin by the black which the fulphur have take from he grave he try to do as much on filver place with wet paper by roll it fmoothly with roller which alfo succeed this novelty tempte baccio baldini goldfmith of the fame city to try whether he could do the same and he fuccess occafion he to engrave feveral plate of sandro boricello invention and delign and upon this andrew mantegna who be at rome at that time fet about engrave fome of he own piece the knowledge of this invention get into flander martin of antwerp then famous painter engrave abundance of place of he own invention and fend feveral print into ltaly which be mark thus vafari in the life of marco antonio painter give a account of the greateft part of he fubject of which there be one among the reft the vifion of st anthony that pleated michael angelo then very young to well for the invention of it that he coloured it after martin of antwerp albert durer begin to appear and give the world a infinite number of fine print as well in wood as in copper all which he fend to venice to be fold marco antonio who happen at that time to be there be of ravithed with the beauty of thefe print that he copy fix and thirty of they which reprefent we saviour paftion and thefe copy be receive at rome with of much the more admiration by how much the more they be finer than the original at the fame time hiugo du carpl a italian painter of mean capacity but of wit apt for invention find out by means of feveral plate of wood the way how to make print retemble delign of claro

the skilful painter who work for glory be willing to ufe they to pread they work over the world raphael among other employ the famous marco a tonio to engrave feveral of he picture and defigne and thofe admirable print be of renowned that they carry the name of raphael through the world valt number of graver have make theyfelve famous fince marco antonio in germany italy france and the

fculptor architect graver lover of the fine art all that be curious in hiffory or antiquity and in thort all who have no particular profeftion but that of man of honour would adorn they mind with the

demonftrative figure be the greateft part for traveller the particular view of palace of city and confiderable place to prepare they for the thing they be to fee or to preserve the idea of thofe they have feen for geographer the map and chart neceitary in they profeffion for painter every thing that may ftrengthen they in the feveral part of they art as the antique piece and thofe of raphael and

they to imitate either nature when they do fomething of they own invention or picture of different manners when they only aim at the faithfulness of imitarion in compare thus the work of all thefe matter they may judge which of they underffood beft the man nagement of they tool of light and the utefulnet of tone as it relate to the claro obfcuro which art of painting they in they operation reconcile delicacy and force beft and in they production be moft fenfible and exact that make good ufe of thefe light they may have the laudable ambition to equal or furpat thefe skilful mafter for

gentlemanlike would form they gout by the hudy of good thing and have reafonable tincture of the fine art nothing be more necelfary than good print they fight with little reflection will readily and agreeably inform they of every thing that may exercile they reafon and ftrengthen they judgment they may fill they memory with the moft curious thing of all time and all country and in learn the different hiftory learn the feveral manners of painting they will judge readily by the facility with which they may open few leave and to compare the production of one mafter with thofe of another and by this means in ipare they time they will pare they expence alfo for it be almoft impoftible to put the picture of as many mafter together in room as will fuffice to form perfect idea of the work of each mafter and when at valt charge man have fill large chamber with picture of different manners he can not have above two or three of each which be not enough to enable he to make nice judgment of the character of the painter or the extent of he capacity where as by means of print one may eafily fee the work of feveral mafter on table one may form art of painting idea of they judge by compare they one with another know which to choole and by practifing it often contract habit of good tafte and good manner especially if we do it in the company of any body that have difcernment in thefe thing and can diftingith what be good from what be but indifferent but as for the critic in and lover of the fine art we muft prefcribe they no rule all thing if we may ufe the phrafe be subject to the empire of they knowledge they entertain themfelves by they fight fometime in look on one thing and fometime on another becaufe they reap profit by it and take pleafure in it among other thing in fee what have be engrave from the moft famous mafter of painting they perceive the origin pro gret and perfection of they work they follow they from giotto and andrea mantegna down to raphael titian and the caracci they examine the different fchool of thofe time they fee into how many branch they have be divide by the multiplicity of difciple and how many way the mind of man be capable of conceive the same thing what imitation be and that as many different manhers have come from she as country age mind or nature by they diverfity have produce among all the good effect that may arife from the ufe of print we shall content ourfelves to name fix by which we may eafily judge of the reft the firft be to divere we by imitation in reprefenting vifible thing to we by they painting he second be to instruct by more forcible and ready manner than by peech thing lay horace that enter at the ear go more about to come at we and touch we less than those that enter by the eye which be the more sure and more faithful witneff the third be to fhorten the time we employ in thofe thing that have efcape art of painting and to refreth it with glance of the eyc the fourth be to reprefent abfent and diftant thing as if they be before ourey which otherwife we could not fee without troublefome voyage and great expence the fifth be to afford we by this means a eaty way of compare feveral thing together print take up to little room that we may make ufe of to great number and to different and the fixth be to give one tafle of good thing and tincture of the fine art which no gentleman should be ignorant of thefe effect be general but every one may imagine the particular ufe and benefit of they according to he underftanding and he inclination and by thefe parricular benefit or effect he may make he collection for it be eafy to guet that in the va riety of condition of which we have be peak the curicfity of print the order and choice that be to be obferve depend on every man gout and view thofe for example that love hiffory feek after thofe subject only that belong it and that nothing may efcape they curiofity they follow this method which can not be enough commend all that relate to particular country and age be put into one or more cover where they may be readily come the picture of the fovereign that have go vern country the prince and princeff descend from they thofe that have hold any confiderable office in the flate in the church in the army or court of juftice thofe that have diftinguith themfelves in different profeffion and particular perfon who have have any share in hiftorical thofe picture be accompany with cvent some line in writing which denote the character of the art of painting the perfon he birth he remarkable action and the time of he death secondly the general and particular map of he country the plan and elevation of city caftle palace and other place worthy the knowledge of the public thirdly every thing that have any relation to hiftory as entry into city and feftival funeral proceffion and pompous ceremony mode and cuftom in thort all particular print which be hifforical the collection thus make for one country be in the same manner do for all the reft the invention of this order be very ingenious and we be indebt for it to gentleman otherwife well enough know by he extraordinary merit and the number of he friend such as have any paffion for the fine art take another method in they collection they do it by the painter and they difciple in the roman school they place raphael michael angelo they difciple and they cotemporary in that of havenice giorgione titian the baffani paolo veronefe tintoret and other venetian in that of parma corregio parmegiano and thofe that follow they gour in that of bologna the

practife they rule in the fame manner they put the mafter of the french fchool and thofe of other country in they feveral claff other collect they print by the graver without respect to the painter other by fuch and such subject and other by other fathion and monficur de ganicre indeed the art of painting it be reafonable that every one should have liberty to do in this what feem to he to be ufeful and agreeable though one may at any time and in any age be nefit one felf by the fight of print yet youth be more proper for it than any other part of man 's life becaufe memory be the gift of childhood and while perfon be young they ought to make ufe of it as of magazine to lay up thing that can con tribure towards form they judgment but if the ufe of print be profitable to youth it be pleafant and agreeable entertainment to old age which be the proper time for repofe and refection and in which we thought be no longer diffipate by the amufement of we firtt year we may with the greater leifure relifh the pleafure that be to be receive by print whether it be by they inform we of fomething new or bring fome thing to we mind that we know before whether it be that have gufto for the art we judge by they of the different production which the painter and graver have leave we or have no knowledge of thofe thing we flatter ourfeive that we shall acquire it or in thort if we aim at nothing by it but to pleafe ourfelves by agreeably exciting we attention in obferve the beaury and fingularity of the print that we meet with for there we fee country town and all the confiderable place that we have read of in hiftory or have feen in we travels in fuch fort that the great variety and the great number of rare thing which we find there may ferve inftead of travelling and this may be do with eafe by the curious who have no ftrength leifure or convenience to travel it be certain therefore from what we have faid that the fight of fine print by which youth be instruet and the knowledge of old perfon revive and confirm muft be ufeful to all the world have the art of painting do not think it neceffary to enter into detail of all the feveral thing that might recommend the ufe of print we believe we have faid enough to induce the reader to draw confequence from it conformable to he view and he occafion if the ancient have have the fame advantage in this as we have and if they have by the means of print tranfmit what they have do that be fine and curious to poftericy we should have diffinctly know abundance of thing of which we have but confuled idea in hiftory we should fee the ftately monument of memphis and babylon and the temple of jerufalem which solomon build with to much magnificence we should make judgment of the building of athen corinth and old rome with more ground and with more certainty than we can now by the poor remains that be leave of they paufa nias who have make fuch a exact description of greece and who lead we through all place as it be by the hand would have accompany he difcourf with demontrative figure which might have be hand down to we and we might have see with pleafure not only the temple and place as they be in they perfection but we should alfo have inherite from the ancient workmen the art of vitruvius whofe demonftration good building be loft would not have fuffer we to be ignorant of all the inftrument and machine which he have describe and we should not find in he book to many obfcure place if the figure have be preferve by print for in art thofe figure be the light of difcourfe and the true means by which a author can communicate he meaning it be for want of thefe means that the machine of archimed and the el der hiero be loft and the knowledge of diofcorides plant as alfo of feveral animal and of great many of the curious production of nature which the ftudy and meditation of the antient dit the art of paint ing difcover but not to trouble ourfeive any longer in grieve for the loss of thing which we can not becover let we profit ourfelves by print that we have amongft we the idea which have give the world of perfett painter may in my opinion affift the curious in make judgment of painting bowever since to know picture perfectly require something more think my self oblige to add what have appear to I necesfary in that matter kxviii of the knowledge of pict ure wviiere be three feveral fort of knowledge relate to picture the firft confift in difcover what be good and what be bad in the fame picture the second have respect to the name of the author and the third be to know whether it be a original of cop know what be good and what be bad in pic ture firft of thefe two fore of knowledge be without doubt the moft difficult to be bequire it fuppofe penetration and fineness of wit with the principle of painting and on the meafure of thefe thing the knowledge of the art depend penetration and fineness of wit ferve to make judgment of the invention of the expreftion of the fubect in general of the paftion of the foul in particular the art of painting of allegory and of what depend on coftume and poefy the knowledge of principle help one to find time and place out the caufe of the effect that we admire whether they proceed from good relifh from the correctness or elegance of defign or whether the object appear advantageouly difpot or the colour light and fhadow be happily manage thole that have not cultivate they mind by the knowledge of principle or at leave have fome speculation of they may however be fentible of the effect of fine picture but can never give reafon for the judgment they make have endeavour by my idea of perfect painter to affift the natural light of the lover of painting however do not pretend to make they penetrate into the detail of the part of the art that be rather the bufiness of the painter than of the curious would only put they mind in good way towards knowledge that they may in general be able to know what be good and what bad in picture the lover of the art only who have genius and inclination be permit if we may of fay to en ter into the fanctuary and acquire the knowledge of this whole detail by the light which they infenfibly gain by ferious reflection the gout of the art be to much in fathion in the time of alexander the great that to know the bottom of they little young gentleman be teach to defign by this means thofe that have talentcultivare it by exercife they make ufe of it upon occafion and diftinguithed themfelves by the luperiority of they knowledge irefer thofe acleaft who have not any experience of this manual practice to the idea have give of its perfection term of art which ignify manners art know who be the author of picture tii knowledge of the name of the author be get by long practice and the fight of great many picture of all the fchool and of the principal mafter that compofe they there be fix of thefe ichool to which we may give particular name as the roman the venetian the lombard the german the flemish and the french and after have by much application acquire diftinct idea of each of thefe fchool if we would find out to which of they picture belong we muft compare it with that to which we think it have the neareft affi nity and when we have find we the fchool we muft apply the picture to that painter whofe manner agree moft with that work but to know this particular manner be in my opinion the greateft part of the difficulty there be some curious man who form a idea of mafter by the fight of three or four of he picture and who after this believe they have fufficient authority to decide what he manner be without confider what care the painter take about they and what age he be of when he draw they it be not from particular picture of painter but from he work in general that we judge of he Irit for there be no painter that have not make fome good and fome bad picture accord to he care or the motion of he genius there be none alfo that have not he begin he progress and he end that be to fay three manner the firft he take from he mafter the second he form by he gotir in which he capacity and genius be to be find and the third commonly dezeart of painting degenerate into what we call manner for painter who have long time ftudy after nature be willing without any more trouble to make ufe only of the experience he have get when curious perfon have well confider the different picture of mafter and have form parfoot idea of he stile he may then judge who be the author of picture without be condemned for rathnel through critic who have talent and have udy and practife the art may fometime be deceive in the name of a author yet he will at leave never be deceive in the juftness and folidity of he fentimentsiz therevare picture make by disciple who have copy they mafter very exactly in they judgment and they manner some painter have follow the golt of another country and not they own and there be fome who leave one manner for and the and who have by this means make fome picture which will purzle the beft judge to guet the name of they author neverthelefs this inconvenience be not without for fuch ias not fatisfying themfelves in know malter hand have penetration enough to difcover the character of he mindskilful man may eafily communicate the manner in which he execute he defign but not the delicacy of he thought it be not to find out the author of picture enough therefore to know the motion of the pencil if the curious can not penetrate that of the mind and though it be very much to have juft idea of painter golt in he delign yet it be neceffary to enter into the character of he genin and the turn which he be capable of give to he conception do not pretend however to ftop the mouth of thofe lover of painting who have not see nor examine this great number of picture by talk of it they may acquire and increafe knowthe art of paintin knowledge would only that every one should give we the fenfe in which he speak by the meature of he experience modefty which be to become in beginner agree alfo with the moft experience especially in difficult cafe iii if picture be a original or copy be not my intention to difcourfe here of in= different copy which the curious will find out at firft fight much less of bad one which be think to by all the world fuppofe then copy make by good matter which deferve ferious reflection and make one doubt for fome timerat leave whether it be copy or a original there be three fort of fuch copy the firft be do faithfully but fervilely the second be light eafy and not faithful the third faithful and eaty the firft which be fervile and faithful include the defign the colour and the touch of the original but the fear of paft beyond the bound of this exactnet and to err againft fidelity make the hand of the copift fliff and if it be never of little examine thew it to be what it be the second be more likely to impofe on the spectator becaufe of the lightness of the pencil but the unfaichfulness of the contour or weline undeceive the beft judge and the third which be faithful and eafy make by learn and light hand and above all in the time of the original purzle the greateft critic and often hazard they pronouncing againft the truth though it may be agreeable to verifimility as there the afr of painting be fome thing which feem to favour the ori= ginality of piece to there be other that feem to deftroy it as the repetition of the fame picture its have be forget long time or cofting little money but though thefe confideration may have weight they be fometime very trivial for want of be well examine that picture be forget proceed often from the hand into which it fall the place where it be put the perfon that fee it or the little value that the owner have for painting the cheapnet of it proceed commonly from the neceffity or ignorance of the feller the repetition of picture which be more spe cious caule be not always fubltantial reafon there be fcarce painter but have repeat fome one of he work either becaufe he be pleafed with it or becaufe he be defire to draw one like it have feen two madonnas of raphael which be out of curibfity place by one another would perfuade the crity that they be both original tirian have repeat the fame picture feven or eight time as play that fucceed be play great many night together and we fee feveral picture of the beft mafter of lialy repeat which dispute with they other piece for goodness and originality there have be fome that have deceive the moft skilful painter among many example of this kind shall think it fufficient to relare one which be that of julio romano and be take from valari frederic duke of mantua go through florence towards rome where he go to pay vifit to pope clement vil in the palace of medici over one of the deor faw the picture of leo between the cardinal of medici and cardinal di roffi the head be of raphael the drapery of julio romano and all together admirable the duke look upon it earneltly and become of in love with it hit the art of paint ing that he could not forbear beg it of the pope when he come to rome he holinel very graci oully give it he and order he secretary to write to octavian di medici to put the picture up in cafe and fend it to mantus octavian who be great lover of painting and lothe to deprive florence of fuch rarity invent a excufe to defer tend it pretend that the frame be not rich enough and he would get one fitted up for it this delay give octavian time to have it copy which be do by andrea del sarto who imifate even the little fpot that be upon it this piece be of like the original that octavian himfelf could hardly diftinguith the ope from the other and that he might not be deceive he put private mark upon the copy and few day after fend it to mantua the duke receive it with all poffible fatistaction not doub but it be the work of raphacl and julio romano the latter who be then in the service of that prince have no fuspicion that what be he part of the picture be not do by hefelf and have think it he own do as long as he live if vafari who have feen the copy while it be draw have not difabufe he for come to mantua he be mighty well entertained by julio romano who shew he all the duke rarity that the fineft thing be still to be feen name the picture of leo do by raphael it be very fine and shew it he vafari faid romano look co but it be not raphael how be it not on it more attentively reply can raphael ' do not know my own work in it co do not fee the stroke of my pencil and remet antwer co fou ber the ftrike they do not oblerve it clofely enough affure you law andrea del sarto draw this very picture becc hind the canva you will fee mark which be upon it to diftinguith it from the original julio the art ef paintin romano turn about the picture and perceive it be matter of fact hold up he hand with aftonishment fay oc value if as much as if it be raphael and even more for it be very to fee of excellent mafter of well imitate as to deceive ofe now fince julic romano with all he skill after have have notice give he and examine the picture paffionacely perfift in the deceit of he judgment as he proper work we muft not think it rrange that other painter lef ikilful should tometimes be miltaken about the workss of other for the truth may have thus hide to the profoundeff knowledge and though man may be out as to the fact he may not always be out in he judgment however let picture be never to well copy good critic will perceive exterier token enough upon it to juttify he fay boldly what he think without run the rifque of cenfure of rafhnel if he do not lay it down in politive tone but as a opinion found on folid knowledge it remain for I to fay fomething of thofe picture that be neither original nor copy which the italian call paltici from pafte becaufe as the feveral thing that feafon pafty be reduce to one tafte of coun terfeit that compofe paftici tend only to effect one truth painter that would deceive in this way ought to have in he mind the manner and prin ciple of the mafter of whom he would give a idea whether he take any part of picture which that mafter have make and put it in he own work or whether the invention be he own and he imitate lightly not only he touch but even he gout of defign and colour it often happen that thefe painter who propofe the counterfeiting another ' manner aim to imitate fuch as be more skilful than themfelves they make better picture of this the art of painting kind than if they be to do fomerh of they owin among thofe who take delight in counterfeiting the manner of other painter shall content myfelf with name david tenier only who have deceive and ever will deceive the curious who be not prepoffeft of he dexterity in transform hefelf into baffano and paolo veronefe there be some of he paftici make with of much cun that the eye of the moft judicious be furprized by they at firft fight but after have examine they nearer they foon diftinguith the one colour and the one pencil from the other for example david tenier have particular tolean in imitate the balfan but the light and eafy pencil which he employ in this artifice be the very proof of he deceit for he pencil though eafy and light be not of lively nor to proper to characterize object as that of the baffan efpecially as to animal it be true tenier underftand the union of colour but there be certain grey predominant in he and he colour have not the vigour and fweetnets of giacomo baffano it be the fame with all paftici and if we would not be deceive by they we should examine they go of defign they colouring and the character of they pencil with the original from whence they be take dnancn he of eminen the orioin of paintinc for gh the author who have efn any thing of the origin of painthave differ among themfelves be they agree however in this that shadow give the firtt occafion to the birth of this art upon which pliny tell we ftory of one corinthia girl of sicyone who be in love with certain youth and find he afleep near lamp that be burn the shadow of he face which appear on the wall feem of like he that the be incite to draw the extremity of it and thus make portrait of she lover if as it be likely fhadow be the rife of the invention of painting imitation be of natural to mankind that they would not have ftaid till the tile ves of of corinthia without draw figure after thadow which be as old as man himfelf but not to enlarge on this thought or feek after to uncertain fource as be that of painting we may with good grounds aver that this art and fculpture have they birth at one and the fame time the one and the other have the fame principle which be defign and ever fince the day of braham when fculpture be in ufe painting be confequently practife in the fame degree it have appear and difappear accord to the revolution of age war be a art that deftroy all other and painting be to much the more expose to it by how much the more it be do for pleafure however the fine art be like the phoenix they revive out of they ath wherefore we have feafon to believe that painting be feveral time extinguished and renew again in the firtt age though it be in very poor degree and that thefe to whom we attribute the invention of that art be only the renewer of it but to peak like orher author after have compare they one with another we shall in the main find that gyge the lydian invent painting in egypt euchir in greece and bularchus bring it out of greece into italy in the reign of romulus this painter reprefent the bartle of the magnefian to well in one of he picture that candaulus king of lydia think it worth prodigious fum and to purchafe it cover it with gold by which we may conclude that painting be highly in efteem in thofe day it be needlet to relate in this abridgment the little that have be faid by the antient author of the firtt rainter who live before the declention of the empire there be none of they work leave no man have much curioficy to know any thing of they or to trouble himfelf ro remember they name we mult however except tome of they who be

the fine art be in they vigour and though we have none of they production we may notwithflanding judge of the perfection of they by the fculpture of the fame age which be preserve to this day and by the price that thofe anti ent painter have for they piece tamanthe and after he apelles have have roo talent near pound of englith money for one picture it be true there be fome small remains of the

and much of the grecian sculpture and baffo relievo fer it be dry and there appear in it no knowledge of groupe or the claro obfcure but we muft not believe that all the piece paint in greece be of this fort becaufe what we read of zeuxis and parrhafius that by they pencil they deceive even animal and painter theytelf be enough to convince we that they penetrate farther into the principle of they art than the author of that picture we confel they do not ufe oil yet perhaps they might have fome other fecret of which we be ignorant that give to much rrength to they colour as be report of

what remain of he great compofition to judge of the ex tent of he genius however what hiftorian have write of he work which be now almoft entirely ruin be fufficient to inform we that he vein be rich he movement lively he fenfe folid adorn with variety of knowledge and he invention very beautiful we may fee that by he defign which be sill in the hand of the curious and what we have leave of he

judicious enquiry into the effect of nature and attribute to she not of much she common production as the perfection of which the be capable lconardo do vincis expreftion be very lively and fenfible have in my cuftody defign of he own hand of the famous fupper which he paint at milan which defign only be fufficient proof of he have penetrate far into the heart of man of he vivacity and with what variery and juftnet he reprefent all kind of action but rather than peak my own opinion in this matter it will be more to the purpofe to give the reader ruben on the merit of this great man he tb write thus of he in laim manuscript the eriginal of robicb have by I and which have faithfully transtate as follow do vinei begin by examine all can as thing accord to the rule of a exact can theory

confult feveral author we of whofe co writings he make commonplace of what be oc moft remarkable and nothing efcape he that to the expresfion of he subject and by so the heat of he fancy as well as by the folidity of ec he judgment he raif divine thing by human underftand how to give man thofe different that elevate they to the character of cc heree the beft of the example which he have oe leave we

have feen among the curiofity of pompeio leoni at be he talk of the anatomy of horfe and the observation that lconardo have make on phifiognomy of which ruben have alfo feen he defign and end he difcourfe by the method which this painter take in meafure human body if may be allow to add any thing to what ruben have faid would take notice that he have not poke of leonardo colour becaufe have carry he remark no farther than to thing relate to the perfection of he profeftion and find nothing good in leonardo colour he paff by that part of painting leonardo carnation have too much of the leecolour in they and the union in he picture be too much tincture with the violet which be there predominant this in my opinion proceed from the painter of he time not know = ing well enough the ufe of oil and from the negligence of the florentine in the part of colour pietro pe rug ino or at peroufa he parent be poor and ad put he at firft to painter of that town who teach he very little and ufe

raphael be not ignorant of this part yet we muft confel that thofe who have frudy anatomy as it relate to painting may obferve more exactness in the antique and more delicacy in the action of the mufcle in the ancient picture than in not only raphael but in any other modern painter ' whatfoever allow that this great juftnet and great delicacy in the action of the mufcle regulate the exaltness of the outline but do not fee that raphael be to much out of the way as to be reckone a ass in comparifon of the antique it be true raphael form the grandeur of he gout from the fine ftatue of antiquity and that when he come from he mafter perugino they put he into right way he follow they implicitly at firft but at laft perceive that the road of painting be difterent from that of fculpture he take from the m no more than be jutt proper for he art and as he grow older and wifer he leave off the reft this difference be eafily to be perceive in the pieture which he paint at different time the latter of which come neareft the character of nature on the contrary pouffin and annibal caracci quit they character of nature accord as they grow more and more fond of the antique they should

nor the caracci ever faw and that be grace which gift of nature be give he of plentifully that he pread it over every thing that come out of he hand and no body can dispure the preference with he in

be that notwithttand he great application to antique fculpture he perceive the neceffity of the claro obicuro in painting and be almoft the only painter of the roman chool who make it principle of the art and put it in practice indeed the great maff of light and fhadow which be in he picture thew he be convinced that the eye of the spectator want repofe to view picture with eafe it be from this principle that in the freze which he paint with whice and black he object be group of artfully that it be impoftible for any to be more beautiful he love of the anrique do not hinder he hudyingnature

polidoro alway make ufe of the contralt as the moft powerful means to give life and motion to he work polidoro genius appear alfo to be more natural more pure and more regulate than julio romano ndr

be bear in the city of parma a no he learne painting of two of he coufin and by the vivacity and readinet of he wit in little while advanced greatly in the art the character of raphael and michael angelo work incire he to go to rome at twenty year of age he audy the beft thing and tbe li ves particularly raphael painting with great carneftness he draw feveral piece which get he reputation and the favour of pope clement vil he minded he bufiness of ftrenuoully that the very day on which the spaniards enter rome and pillage it the foldier find parmegiano work quietly as protogene be of old at the fiege of rhode this fecurity furprized the spaniards who firft enter he houfe and they be to touch with the beauty of he painting that they leave he without do he any harm but fome of they comrade come afterwards and take away all he have upon this he return into he own country and paff through bologna be stop there good while by bufiness that fall in he way which have finifh he go to farma and paint there very much he play well on the lute and often spend more time on it than on he painting he be jultly blame for give himfelf over of much to chymiftry that he not only leave off he profeffion but alfo the care of he perfon and become perfect lavage he engrave fome of he defign in wood with the claro obfcuro and fome he etch be the firtt that practife that fort of grave at leave in italy he keep one antoniofrontano graver in he houfe whorobb he of all he plate as well of copper as of wood and alfo of all he defign which make parmegianorun almoft mad though the beft part of they be recover at laft he of abandon himself to chymiftry that he walt he time he money and he health and die in miferable condition of diarrhcea accompany with fever in the g year of he age a noon the work of parmegiano armegiano genius be altogether gay and elegant and though he invent thing with cale yet he do not strive of much to fill he compofition with agreeable object as to defign he figure with graceful air and to give they attiuude which might show the beautiful part and infufe life and action into the wholebut he understanding be of no great extent he intentiveness to finith every particular figure leffen very much the beauty of he exprestion in general he thought be befide too common and we do not find that he have perietrate very far into the heart of man or underffood the paffion however though the grace of he work be but fuperficial yet it neverthelel furprifing and charming he invention be ready he attitude be very graceful to be he head and it be vitible that he endeavour more to pleafe this way than by the juft expreftion of he subject he do not confult nature much who be the mother of variety he reduce she to habit which he contract graceful it be true but it be he own and funk into what we call manner the painter who look upon nature as he object ought to confider she in the variety as well as in the number of she effect and if we forgive he any reiteration in the fame piece it muft be only in he defign for which there be no need of confult nature to exactly nor to take the fame care as in picture know alfo that whatever draft the painter in they ftudy make after nature they particular gout confines they to certain thing which they fall upon infenfibly it can not be deny but parmegiano have often reiterate the fame air and the fame pro portion yet he choice be to fine that what have pleated the li ves of we in any one of he work will always pleafe we whereever we meet with it he goit of defign be loofe and learn but have too much of idea and manner in it he affect to make the extremity of he member delicate and fomewhat lean he attitude be noble lively and agreeably contraft he air of the head rather graceful than of great gufto he expreffion general and without character he drapery light and well contraft it be true the stuff be almoft always the fame and the fold be very carelef yet be but few they give godt of grandeur to the part they cover they be often loofe and flow which add great deal of motion to he figure but the caufe of it be not always juft notwithftanding the vivacity of he wit and the agility of he pencil he draw very few picture spend moft of he time in make defign and engrave they upon plate the little have see of he painting give I clear idea of tolerable claro obfcuro but he local colour be very ordinary and common it be this parmegiano who by the means of two copper plate find out the secret of printing on mezzotinto paper the black and white and thus to give more roundness to he print yet he do not continue the ufe of this inveation long it require too much care befide he ordinary print be of much value by every body and even by feveral able mafter of painting that he do not think it worth he while to be at the trouble of make other pierino del bear in tufcany where he be poorly breed and be hardly two year old when he mother die he father be foldier and he nurfe thegoar he come

yet among he capricious imagination if there be fome thing extravagant there be other fingularly beautiful and of what kind foever he thought be they be always great the crity of that age prefer the excellence of defign to all the other part of painting michael angelo ftudy it with incredible affiduity and arrive to great knowledge of that art as may be feen by he picture and fculpture yet he do not join the purity and elegance of the contour or outline to he grand gufto for have make he observation on the body of man as it be in its greateft force he draw the member of he figure t powerful

very natural yet as wild as he production be thereis elevation in he thought and noblenet in he figure in thort the grandeur of he gufto be proper remedy for the meanness of the flemith it be even of ufe to raphael as we have faid already to cure he of that drynel which he learn of pictro perugino michael angelo know very little of colour he carnation have too much of the brickcolour for the light and of black for the shadow though it be not certain whether he coloured he picture himself or whether he employ fome florentine painter whom he fend for to help he in he great undertakings the picture which fra baltiano draw after michael angelo defign be not like the other the colour be better and have fomething of the venetian gufto to return to the defign of michael angelo which be the moft valuable part of he production if they be not entirely perfect there be of much fcience in they that he work will contribute great deal towards make ftudent mafter if they have difcernment enough to ufe they as they ought nevertheless it would be matter of wonder if michael angelos reputation have live till now in cafe he knowledge of fculpfure and of civil and military architecture have not

choice fra baltiano have make of he for he mafter rather than raphael for the painter of rome be at that time divide fome be for raphael and some for ni chael angelo fra baftiano would not only not

which titian become he rival in he art and be to careful to copy the life exactly that by he care and reflection he excell giorgione in difcover the delicacy of nature however giorgione be ftill in reputation for gufto to which no body have hitherto arrive the moft part of he performance be at venice and have paint very much in frefco and not live long enough to do many other picture he cabinet piece be extremely rare he die in the year when he be carce year of age reffecliv on the work of gforgfone be but thirty two year old when he die and have do few grand compofition one can not well judge of the greatness of he genius the beft of he performance be at venice on the front of the houfe wherein the german merchane have they meeting on that fide which look tewards the grand canal he do this piece of painting in competition with titian who paint another fide of that building but both of thefe two piece be almoft entirely ruin by age it be difficult to make right judgement of they or of gforgione talent by that performance to we muft reft fatisfied with few cafelpiece and fome portrait that he draw every man painting himfelf in what kind of picture foever he employ he pencil about we may perceive by thofe of giorzione that he have facility of understanding and vivacity of imagination he gufto of defign be delicate and have fomething in it like the roman fchool though it be not of much expreft as be neceffary for the perfection of he art he always be more careful to give roundnel to he figure than to make they correct he gufto be grand picquant and he hand eaty he be the firft who find out the admi rable effect of flrong light and fhadow and make ufe of bold colour and it be matter of wonder to confider how all of fudden he foar from the low manner of bellino

to comprehend either the white which ferve inftead of light nor the black which be the privation of it it appear by he work that the principle of the art which he have find out be fimple that he be perfect mafter of they and that he greateft artifice be to thew the value of thing by compatifon the guft of he landskip be exquifite both for the colour and the oppofition and befide give force to he colour unknown before he time he have way to keep they freth especially he green titian obferve to what degree of elevation giorgione have carry he art think he have paff beyond the bound of truth and though he imitate in fome thing the boldness of he colour yet as one may fay he tame the fierceness of he colour which be too favage he temper they by the variety of tint to the end that he might render he object the more natural and the more palpable but notwithftanding all he effort to excel he rival giorgione htill maintain he post of which no body have hitherto be able to dispoffee he and it be certain that if titian have make feveral painter good colourift giorgione firft shew they the way to be of it ano ec el sbear at cadore in friuli province in the ftare of venice a no he be of noble extraction be defcend from the ancient family of the vecelli at about ten year old he parent fend he to one of he uncle that live at venice who take notice of he inclination to painting put he to giovanni bellino he ftudy moftly after nature whom he copy fervilely with have of without add to she or take from she but in the year rgo obferve the great effect of giorgione work he follow he manner to far that without make line he imitate the living bequtie of nature whom he look on with other eye than before and ftudy she with extraordinary application yet this do not hinder he defign carefully at other time by which he alfo become a able deligner giorgione perceive what progress titian have make in he profeffion by follow he manner break off all correspondence with he and ever

innumerable quantity of portrait he draw the emperor charle versus picture three time and that monarch ufe to fay on this occafion of that he have be make immortal by the hand of tireward he he knight he created he count palatine and affign he confiderable penfion henry iii come from poland to france could not go through venice without vi fit titian and all the poet of he time fung he praif he eafelpiece be fcatter up and down throughout enrope the fineft of they be at venice in france and spain there never be painter who live of long as titian nor to eafily and happily except only he jealouty of pordehone which neverthelefs turn to he advantage he be univerfally beloved and efteem and full of year honour and wealth he die at laft of the plague anno be fourfcore and nineteen year of agc he have great many difciple the chief of they be he brother francefco vecelli he fon horatio vecelli tintoret and other venetian befide whom he have three flemish difciple that he valued viz john calcar diteric barent and lambert luftrus who all die young reflection on the work of ti ia hough titian genius be not brilliant and lofty it be however fruitfulenough to treat of great subject of all kind there never be more univerial painter nor one who know better how to give each object its true character he be have up in the school of giovanni bellino where he education he frequent giorgione company he refolure fiudy of nature for ten year together and above all the folidity of he underftanding and reflection difcover to he the myftery of he art and make he penetrate farther than any other painter into the effence of painting if gieorgione thew he the end that he ought to aim at he lay the way to it on folid bafis wherein all that have follow he have acquire efteem and be indebted to he for they fcience and reputation have there never be titian there have never be balfan tintoret paolo veronefe nor abundance of painter who have give glorious mark of they capacity in all part of chriftendom vet though titian be very faithful in he imitation of nature he want fidelity in he reprefentation of hiffory have hardly do any thing of that kind wherein he have not commit some fault or other there be not it be true much fire in he dispofition yet they be well fill and very regular he be very exact in give thofe attitude to he fi gure which might thew the moft beautiful part of the body he be to careful to have the wholetogether of he piece judicioutly concerted that he often bepear they to fave himfelf the trouble of thinking again thus there be feveral magdalen of he feveral venus and adonis wherein he have only change the ground to have it believe that they be all original we may fuppofe that he be help fometime by he difciple elpecially the three flamand who be excellent painter and of whom diteric barent be he favourite afterthefe difciple have do they beft to make they copy like the orignial and they mafter have touch they over again with freth view why should not they eminent be value as much as if they have be all of tirian hand and why be not the copy as eftimable as the original titian form he guft of defign after nature he do as polyclerus of old fearch after what be fine in she and he fucceed in woman and child he defign they with delicate gufto he imprint on they noble air accompany with certain pleat negligence of the headdreff the drapery and ornament of habit that be wholly peculiar to he he be not of happy in the figure of man which he do not always defign with correctnet or elegance however in this he do like michael angelo he propof in he guft of defign they to imitate nature in she greateft vigour and make the mufcleing flrong to give the greater character to he figure the difference between he and michael angelo be the latter be more profound in he defign and mingle fenfible expresfion of the mufcle with guft of the antique whereas titian neglect the anrique and in he work rather increafed than diminithed the tendernel of nature whom he only imitate there be no exaggeration in he attitude they be fimple and natural and in he head he feem to bufy himself rather in faithful imitation of exterior nature if may be allow the phrafe than in lively expreftion of the paftion he drapery be fometime mean and favour of little gufto and if he have imitate the htuft perfectly he have often difpot of they ill the fold seem rather to fall by chance than to be fet by good order and good principle of art all the painter allow that none of they profeftion ever come up to titian for landlkip he figure be compofe of few object but thofe be admirably well choofe the form of he tree be varied they touch light mellow and without manner but heive of he carefully obferve in all he landlkip to thew tome extraordinary effect of nature and move one by its fenfiblenet fingularity and truth he colouring in all part of it be wonderful and though he be not quite of bold in it as giorgione he be more exact and more delicate he be very faithful in he local colour and place they always of as to raife the merit of one object by compare it with another and thus he in fome meafure by the force of he art fupply the defect of colour which of themfelves can not anfwer to all the effect of nature the truth that be to be find in he lo cal colour be to great that they leave no idea of the colour which be on the pallet and when we look on he piece we ought not to fay he carnation be make of fuch and fuch colour but rather that they be really ffeth and that he drapery be the real htuff of nicely do every thing maintain its character and not one of the colour in the compofition of they all be to be diftinguithed from the other we can not deny but that titian underftand the claro obfcuro and when he do not thew it by group of light and shadow he do it fufficiently by the nature of the colour of he drapery and the diftribution of he object whofe natural colour alays agree with the place where it be lay whethe forward or backward or wherever he think it molt advantageous to place it he oppofition be at once bold and fwect and he learn of nature the harmony of the colour rathe than from the participation of the claro and the brown as paolo veronefe do he finith he piecesextremely and have no very particular manner in the manage of he pencil becaufe he ffudy and the care he take to temper one colour by another take away the appearance of free hand though he hand be really free it be cer= tain cain the fenfible mark of that freedom have they merit they be gay and pleafant to the fight when they be the refult of refine habit and warm imagination but there be in titian work fuch lively touch of agreeable to the character of the object that they flatter the rafte of the true critic much more than the fentible stroke of bold hand titian have in he time four manners the firft that of giovanni bellino he mafter the second that of giorgione he competitor third which be very much ftudy and be properly he own and fourth which degenerate into habit and be always folid he firft manner be little dry he second very bold as be to be feen by he picture of se mark which be at venice in the veftry of the la salute by that of the five saint in st nicholas church and by other he third manner confift in juft and beautiful imitation of nature and be very much labour by he exactnet in touch he piece over again here and there and fometime with virgin tint in the light and fometime with glaze in the fhadow hismanner on account of thefe thing as trival as they be feem the less free but it be the more ftrong and the more finish the fourth be free manner which he prac cife towards the latter part of he life either not be able to fatigue himfelf of much as he could before or believe he know way how to pare himself the trouble and do as well without it of this laft manner be he picture of the annunciation and the transfiguration which be at san sal vador the st jame of san lio the st laurence at the jefuit church the st jerome of santa mantia nova the pentecoft of la salute and feveral other there art fifty picture to be feen in public at venice in which titian have thewn all the manner have poke of to ves of to conclude if the painter of the roman fchool furpaff titian in vivacity of genius in grand compofition and in gufto of defign no body will difpute with he

grandeur more grace more fweetness than augustino or annibale augultino have more gaity and nnibale more boldness and fingularity of think than either of the other two he defign be more profound he expreffion more lively and he execution more firm the carracci take from the ancient fculpture and the beft mafter of they art as much as they could to form good manner but they have not drain the

treat some of the latter kind very patheticly especially the rory of st francis but lodovico fucceed in thele picture better than annibale he give graceful air to he madonnal after corregio manner annibale genius inclined he rather to fiercenet than delicacy and more to gallantry than modefty as for augultino he ffudy of painting be often interrupt by thofe of grave of which he be perfect

if they do not let the yorld fee how far they be mafter of that part of they art and that the spectator would forgive they for what they fall short in other part fatif fy themfelves with the
