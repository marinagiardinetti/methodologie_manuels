colour and the fhade teint we should make out all the fieth dsaon like claro obfcuro or metzotinto we should alfo remember that this colour will grow darker becaufe it be in its nature too ftrong for the white therefore we should b art of painting in oil it by mixing vermillion and white with it in proportion to the fairness of the complexion and though it be thus mix yet shall call it the light red teint in all the courfe of this work becaufe would not have the vermillion teint confound with it as if there be no difference vermillion feimt be only vermiltion and white mix to middle teint it be the moft brilliant light red that can be it agree beft with the white light red and yellow teint iii carmine teint be carmine and white only mix to middle teint it be of all colour the moft

will fympathize and mix kindly fellow teint be often make of naple yellow and white but it be as well to ufe light oker and white which be good work colour remember the oker be too frong for the white therefore we should make allowance in ufe it it follow the light red teint and yellow should always be lay before the bly if we lay too much of it we may recover the ground it be lay on with the light red teint vi blue teint be make of ultramarine and white mix to lightith azure it be pleafant work colour with it we should blend the gradation it follow the yellow and with they it make the green and

of ivory black and little indian redonly he celour mix very kindly with the red shade and blend agreeably with the middle teint in the dead colour it be charming glaze colour for the eyebrow and darkeff fhadow it be of all the moff excellent thadowcolour and one of the fineff ork colour we have first painting the colour and teint that be necessary for the first paintinc of the flesh fine

make of indian red and white shade teint jx red thade warm shade art of paintinc in oil the finithing pallet for complexion require fix hore viz carmine and it be teint lake brown pink ivoryblack and pruffian blue the layingon of dead colour divide into two partone call the first lay or ground the other the lay on virgin teint the firft lay of colour confift of two part the one be the work of the fhadow only and the other that of the light the work of the hadows be to make out all the drawing very correctly with the fhade teint in the same manner as if it be to be do with this colour only remember to drive or lay the colour paringly the light should be all lay in with the light red teint in different degree as we fee they in nature thefe twocolour united produce clean tender middle teint for mixing with the fhadeteint they turn to pearly hue and by flrengthening they with the light red we may work to very good refemblance in uniting the light and fhade we should ufe long foftener about the fixe of large fwan quill which will help to bring the work into character and leave the colour more delicate then go over the darkeft fhadow with the red of warm hade which will finith the firft lay the warm shade be lay on the shade teint improve it to warmer hue but if lay inflead of the fhade teint it will dirty and fpoil the colour it mix with and if the red thade be lay firft inftead of the shade teint the fhadow would then appear too red and bloody therefore notwithflanding thefe two colour be the beft that can be for the fhadow yet they be too ftrong to be lay alone which be proof of the great ufe and ert of painting in ote and merit of the fhad teint here we may obferve that the shade and light red teint be of friendly and delicate in they nature that they will not dirty though we be continually change they how proper then and agreeable to we purpofe be they for make the moff principal part of the likenet when in alter and change they always produce clean colour of the invire pearly hue thesecond part of the first painting in order to finish the firft painting improve the red and yellow to the complexion and after they the bly obferve that the bly on the red make the purple and on the yellow produce the green the same Ithod be to be underftand of the fhadow but be fure to leave they clean and not too dark therefore allowance should be make in the grounds with the lightred becaufe glaze they will make they darker when the cloth be of dark or bad colour there muft be ftrong body of colour lay all over the fhadow fuch as will not fink into the ground but appear warm and little lighter than the life to that it may be of the fame forwardness to finith as if it have be light ground therefore the bufinet of dead colour be that we leave it always in the same order for finifh though the colour of the cloth be quite the reverfe be convinced by experience that the grounds of thadow in what we call the deadcolour should be fich the art of painting in otl fuch as will support the character of the finithing colour which ground muft be clean and little lighter than the finifh colour fay little lighter becaufe the finishing of the fhadow be glaze and no other method but glaze can leave fuch brilliancy and beauty as they ought to have for find that glaze the fhadow in the firtt painting be not of proper as lay body of shadow colour that be very near to the life though little lighter thefe may be glaze and touch upon whendry with great deal of eafe but if we begin the firft painting with glaze we shall find it will fare and be of no ufe and the folid colour which be lay on it will look heavy and dull therefore all shadow and colour that be to be glaze should be do with colour of clean folid body becaufe the glaze be more lafting and have the beft effect on fuch colour remember to leave no roughnel mean fuch as will appear rough and interrupt or hurt the character of the finifh colour which by examine the work whilft it be wet with foft tool or when it be dry with knife may be avoid as it will eafily take off the knot and rougheft part the light red and white improve be fuperior to all other colour for the firft lay or ground which should be always do with full pencil of ffiff colour make brighter than the light becaufe it will fink little in drying the greater the body and quantity of colour and the hiffer it be lay the let it will fink every colour in drying will fink and partake in proportion to its body of the colour it be lay on therefore all the light of the fieth if not lay on light ground muft confequently change little from the life if there be no allowance the art of paintinc in otl make the fhade teint for the fhadow should fall into the rofe teinr as the complexion grow delicate all which should be ligntly united with foft long point hogtool to the light make out the whole metzotinto believe the great mafter very feldom tab loucn or fzcerened the colour but in uniting the firft lay they be very careful in preferve the brightnet of they colour and therefore do not work they below the complexion for to force or keep up brilliancy grounds can only be do with the white red in the and yellow which method will make up for the deficiency of the white grounds therefore the firft painting should be leave bright and bold and the less the colour be we should forbearulingany colour break the better that will produce they and be content to add what be want in the next painting where if we fail clean rag will resfore the firft ground second painting the second painting begin with lay on the leave quantity that can be of poppy oil then pe it almoft all off with dry piece of filk handkerchief the second painting be alfo divide into two part call the firr lay of the second painting which be scumble the light and glaze the fhadow the other finish the complexion with the virgin teint and improve the likenet as far as we can without laub scumble t art of painting in oil scumble be go over the light where they be to be change with the lightr teint or fome other of they own colour fuch as will always clear and improve the complexion with fhort ffiff pencil but fuch part only as require it otherwife the beauty of the firft painting will be spoiled and we make ourfelves double wwork the light red teint improve be the very best colour that can be for fcumble and improve the complexion in general where the thadow and draw be to be correct we should do it with the shade teint by drive the colour very ftiff and bare that we may the eafier retouch and change it with the finithing teint some part of the shadow should be glaze with some of the tranfparent thadowcolour fuch as will improve and come very near to the life but be fure not to lay on too much of it for fear of loting the hue of the firtt painting the ground of which should always appear through the glaze be very careful in uniting the light and shade that they do not mix dead and meally for the more the light mix with the shade the more meally thofe fhade will appear thus far the complexion be prepare and improve in order to receive the virgin teint and finithing touch c art of paintinc in oil the second part of the second painting be to go over the complexion with the virgin teint thefe be the colour which improve the colour to the greatelt perfection both in the light and hadows this should be do in the fame manner as we lay they in the second part of the firft painting that be with the red yellow and bly blend they with delicate light touch of the tender middie teint without fofen we should leave the teint and they grounds clean and diffinet and be content to leave off whilft the work be fafe and unfullied leave what be farther require for the next fitting for in attempt the finithing touch before the other be dry we lofe the pirit and draw and dirty wherever we touch the third painting or finish i be to be fuppof the complexion now want very little more than few light touch therefore there will be no occation for oil begin with correct all the glaze firft where the glaze ferve as ground or under part then we should determine what should be do next before we do it art of painting in oil to that we may be able to make the alteration on the part with one flroke of the pencil by this method we preferve both the glaze and the teint but if it happen that we can not lay fuch variety of teint and finithing colour as we intend it be much better to leave off while the work be fafe and in good order becaute thofe few touch which would endanger the beauty of the colour may eafily be do if we have patience to ftay till the colour be dry and then without oil add thofe finithing with free light stroke of the pencil believe that rembrandt touch upon he beft picture great many time let they dry between it be this method moft certainly which give they that furprifing force and spirit which be of inimitable find it much eafier to foften the over firong teint when they be dry than when they be wet becaufe we may add the very colour that be want without endangering the dry work if any of the colour of the pallet want to be little change to the life when we be painting it be much better to do it with the knife on the pallet than with the pencil becaufe the knife will mix and leave it in good order for the pencil of bace grounds vandyke make out the keeping in he backgrounds more from the different opposition and harmony of the colour than from he knowledge of the claro obfcuro confess can not find in he picture that intelligence of the ert of paintinc in oil light and shade which be to ftrike and beautiful be rembrandr vandy ke general method be to be very still and mellow and to break the colour of the ground with thofe of the drapery this will certainly produce farmony the principle of which method belong only to the art of colour but it be the knowledge of light and shade that give that furprifing force and ftrength which at firft fight we find in rembrandr work have feen picture of lady where he have make the ground light enough to thew she complexion and hair which be dark brown and in the greateft perfection the ground be wall which near to the face be lighter than the thadow of the ffeth and the light diminify to artfully in the gradation that though the part round the head be much darker yet it appear to be of the fame colour with that near the fleth muft own like this method of relieve the head from the ground better than vandyke method where he have make the ground almoft of the fame colour with the hair and though admire this way of break the colour of the ground with thofe of the drapery yet be not of much pleated where there appear too near famenet as have feen in fome of he picture where he have carry this principle of near that it be almoft imperceptible in rembrandt picture at farmouth the light and fhade be as vifible as thofe in he print and be remarkably broad clear and still the fhadow be very warm and thin and look as if they be paint all at once with plenty of colour which appear tranfparent which tranfparency be do by glaze the dead colour to the aywtenc in oil the art oe principal colour that be neceffary for painting back grounds in portraiture as wall building or the like be white black indian red light and brown oker pruffian and burnt umber from which the eight principal teint be make as follow pearl be make of black white and little indian red lead of black and white mix to dark lead colour fellow of brown oker and white olive of light oker pruffian and white plesss

only here the lead teint ferve for the bly the fiesh teint mix agreeably with the lead and the murrey be very good blend colour and of great ufe where the olive be too ftrong the umber white and dark shade will produce fine variety of ftone colour the dark shade and umber ufe plentifully with drying oil make charime warm fhadowcolour all the colour should be lay with drying oil only becaufe they mix and fer the better with the foftner where the mark of the trowel be of ftrong in the priming of the cloth that one body of colour will not be fufficient to conceal it we should lay colour to prevent it which should be dry before we begin with thofe part we expect to finith at once painting the the art of painting in oil method of painting back grounds divide into two part the firtt part be the work of the firft lay the second be to follow on that with the finithing teint of the first lay we should always begin from the fhadow fide of the head and paint the light firft from they go into the gradation and thadow which should be do with fiffith tool very paringly with the dark shade and white litle change with the colour that will give it more of the require hue but very near in regard to tone and firength leave they like metzotinto the dark and warm thadow should be lay before the colour that join they this we should do with the dark shade and umber drive with drying oil fay before the colour that join they becaufe if thofe colour be lay on firft they would interrupt and spoil the tranfparency which be they greateft beauty the more the firft lay be drive the eafier and better we may change it with the finithing teint therefore we may lay they with the greater body the second part be to follow directly whilft the firft lay be wet with thofe teint that we think be the moft proper to harmonize and finith with begin with the light firft and remember as we heighten and finith they we do it with warmer colour and let thofe be accompany with fine tender cold teint the lighteft part of the ground be always neareft to the thanow art of painting in otl lhadow fide of the head this be the part which govern all the reft and should be paint with variety of light warm clear colour which vanish and lofe they firength imperceptibly in they gradation thefe should be lay with kind of cloudy touch rather than potted and we muft take care that we do not cover too much of the firft lay but confider it as the principal colour from the light we go to the gradation and fhadow for when the light be well adapt to produce and support the head it be eaty think to fall from they into whatever kind of shadow we shall find moft proper for we work then foften and blend the whole with long large hogtool which with the ftrength and body of the drying oil will mell and fweeten altogether in tuch flatter manner as will seem furprifingly finish remember the teint will fink and lofe little of they rrength and beaury in drying all the grounds as wall exc should be finish at once painting but if they want to be change we may glaze they with little of the dark fhade and drying oil drive very bare on which with few light touch of the colour that be want we may improve they hue the dark hadows may alfo be ftrengthen and improve by glaze which should be do after the figure be nearly finith for fear of make they too frong obferve rembrandl grounds be rather brighter in the light and have more variety of reint than any other painter for he have obferve and juftly t that thofe teint diminith in proportion with the light therefore he fhadow have but faint appearance ofteint he underftand the gradation in perfection by the rrt of paintinc in oil mixing and break the firft lay of colour of artfully that they fiatter we in regard to they real ftrength frefnoy fay let the field or ground of the picture be pleatant free trantent light and well united with cojour which be of friendly nature to each other and of fich mixture as that there may be fomething in it of every colour that compofe you work as it be the contents of you pallet lle alfo obferve that variety of teint very near of the fame tone emplope in the fame figure and often upon the fame part with moderation contribute much to the harmony aill the curtain should be deadcoloured when we paint the ground and should be do with clean colour of near hue to the intend curtain fuch as will fupport the finithing colour do it with tender fort of keeping and near in regard to they tone in the light but much fofter in the fhadow all which should be mix and break with the colour of the ground and as . elnoy obferve body that be biack in the ground should be paint with colour ally to thofe of the ground itfelf ir will often happen for want of the life or fome defign teat we can not make the iold the firft painting we should then leave the mafte of light and thadow in regard to the keeping of the picture broad and well unired together tuch as may feem eaty to finith on the colour of the landicap in backgrounds should be break and foften allo with thofe of the part which jomthem this method bring they into keep which will make all the part of the ground as it be of one to that the diffcrent part do not fiare nor cut at extremity the the art of paintinc in otl sky should be break with the lead and the ffeth teint the murrey teint be of great ufe in the grounds of diftant object and the umber and dark fhade in the near grounds the green should be more beautiful than we intend they becaufe they will fade and grow darker after all be paint we should go over the whole very lightly with the foftener as we do the grounds which will make it look agreeably finith copy the author of the nalyfis of beauty the late nir william hogarth have give he opinion of copy in he true fpirit and genin treat with ridicule one of the moft ufeful part of painting but this impute to he purfue a originality of idea peculiar to himfelf which do not render it neceffary for he to have recourfe

in oil it be furprifing that fince the age of thefe great mafter we have not have man able to make fine copy from any one of they picture and believe if such genius should hereafter arife it be to be fear the deftroyer of the art if they be fuffer to go on will fcour off the remains of they beauty of that very little will be leave for he to ftudy and by the end of this century there will be none fit for copy it be in vain for man to think of make fine imitation of any of the great mafter without be thoroughly acquainted with the nature of colour and of colour and without be clearly convinced at fight of the picture he be go to copy of the method and principle on which it be paint it be the want of this knowledge and conviction which lead we into to mahy error and miftake painter that have acquire any fort of manner will always tincture he copying with the fame now we be apt to fall into manner before we underftand the nature of colour which be the cafe where fome predominant colour or hue appear in all the complexion alike for this reafon painter whole carnation be too red will certainly make he copy bluth or if he colour and fhadow be heavy they will of courfe fall into the obfcuro by the same rule whatever teint in foot he colour the fame will unavoidably taint he copying for which there be no cure becaufe he himself be infect it be very rare to change bad manner in colour for better that raphael michael angelo lconardo do vinci julio romano and other great mafter spend they whole life without truly underftanding good colour art of pairting in oil colour nd though colour be the principal excellence in copy yer it be necelfary that every artiff should avoid particular manner with he pencil otherwife it will certainly be feen in he work from whar have be faid on this subject apprehend that it appear that the art of copying which be practife by the great mafter in order to catch each other excellency and perfection and by which they noble work have be to often repeat and as it be renewe be of far from deferve contempt that it ought to be enccurage as thing highly ufeful and worthy of elteem of painting drapery in order to underfland the nature and different degree of colour or teint ufe in painting drapery firff determine how many divition be abfolutely necelfary to make the firtt lay of colour and after that the reffec tion and finithing teint the right method of painting drapery or fatin ingeneral be to make out the whole or what call the firft with three colour only viz the light middle teint thade tent we should obferve that the light should rather incline to warmith hue and the middle teint should be make of friendly working colour fuch as will always mix of clean tender coldith hue the shade teint should art of painting in oil should be make of the fame colour as the middle teint only with let light therefore this teint will allo mix of tender clean colour it be with thefe three colour we should make out the whole like metzotinto and we should underftand that all the beauty and character of the fold the shape attitude and principal light and shade be all to be confider and make with thefe three colour only which should be do to we fatisfaction before we add any of the reffect or finish teint the reflection of drapery and fatin be generally production of they own and be always lighter than the shadow on which they be find and be pro duce by light will confequently have light warm colour mix with the local colour that receive they here it will be neceffary to obferve the general method and secret in manage the colour of the firft lay and thofe of the refiection and finish teint in the firft lay the high light should be lay with of ffiff colour and then fhape and foften into character with the middle teint very correctly where the gradation of the light be flow as in the large part it will be proper to lay the middle teint firft at they extremity with tool that will drive the colour and leave it fparingly becaufe the light will mix and lie the better upon it next be to make out all the part of the fhadow with the thade teint drive bare fter this come the middle teint which fill up and ferve as the second light and gradation and should be manage together very nicely to character without touch any of the high light which finith the firft lay the art of painting in ofl reffect and finithing teint be in general the antipathy of the firft lay they will without great care poifon and dirty the colour on which they be lay and therefore should be lay with delicate light touch without foften if it be overdone we muft endeavour to recover it with the golour of the part on which it be lay this may be do directly or when it be dry we should alfo obferve whether the reffect proceed from the same colour or any other that the method of uing they be the fame before proceed to the particular colour it will be proper to make fome obtervation on they grounds it often happen that the colour of the cloth be very improper for the ground of the drapery and when it be we should change it with thofe colour which we think be moft proper to improve and fupport the finithing colour this method of dead colour muft consequently preferve they in the greateft luftre in deadcolour we should lay the light and shade in manner of as only to thew faint idea of they with regard to the shape and rounding of the figure if we have defign to work from then it will be proper to make all the large and principal part in they place which should always be do with colour that be clean and lighter than the intend drapery though in general of the fame hue and let the fhadow be no darker than middle teint thefe should be mix and break in tender manner and then foften with large tool to that nothing rough and uneven be leave to interrupt or hurt the character of the finithing colour white the art of paintinc in otl satin all white should be paint on white grounds lay with good body of colour by reafon this colour fink more into the ground than any other there be four degree of colour in the firft lay to white fatin the firft be the fine white for the light the second be the firft teint which be make of fine white and little ivoryblack mix to a exact middle degree between the white and middle teint this colour follow the whire and it be with this we should fhape the light into character before we lay on any other and take care that this firft teint appear diftinctly between the white and the middle teint otherwife the beauty and the character of the fatin will be spoiled the middle teint should be make of white black and little indianre thefe three colouy be very friendly and mix to beautiful clear colour of pearly hue which have the true brightness and warmth of the general hue of the fatin remember to allow for the red huc change little to the lead if there be occafion to make any part in the middle teint lighter we should do it with the firft teint only this colour should alfo be lay paringly before the white in all the little light that happen in the middle teinr and fhadow on which we should lay the white with one light touch and be fure not to cover all the part that be make with the firft teint if we do it will fpoil the character and look like spot for want of the foften edge or border which muft be between the white and the middle teint the lhade teint should be make of the fame colour as the middlg reint but with let white to that it be dark enough the art of painting in ote for thadow in general with which we should out all the part of the shadow nicely to character which be the work of the firft lay have next follour the rencus and hrith teint drow oker mix with the colour of the light be the molt afeful colour in general for all reffect in dra pery that be produce from they own colour all reney be make with the colour of the part from which they be produce and the local colour that receive they there be but two reflect teint want for drapery in general mean to any one particular colour one should be lighter than the middle teint the other darker thefe colour may be little change on the pallet with the firft and middle teint as occafion require or lightly break on the part that receive they but this laft method be not to fafe as the other the teint fufficient for blend the dark fhadow to the mellow tender hue be make with the fhade teint and little brown oker which should be lay on very paringly with foft light touch for fear of make they dull and heavy if it should be over do we may recover it with the colour it be lay upon weoften fee little bine ufe in the firft teint of white fatin van indecken who be the beft drapery painter we ever have in england do of and fometime inftead of the blue he uye blueblack till he find it to be pernicious colcur and be therefore oblige to ufe blue becaufe he middle teint wnich be only of black and white be to very coid that no other colour but blue would make colder teint yet he manage thefe cold colour in all the light and middle teint to agreeably and to light and eaty be he rouch that we can not help art of painting in ote admire and may learn fomething from he though he be not of lucky in he thadow which be generally of heavy dirty hue this be ow to the colour he ute and the method of uting they which will always have fuch a effect when warm or dirty colour be mix with clean light one for be mix together they will form dirty colour that muft confequently appear of in the work bur if he lead or thade teint have be mix with indian red inftead of the oker and then follow with few light blend touch of the oker teint it would have leave they clean and mellow it be the want of the red hue which make the white fatin appear of often like pewter blue satinn blue fatin be make of pruffian blue and fine white the beft ground for blue be white for the light and black and white for the shadow the firft lay of colour for blue be divide into three degree or teint we should firft make the middle teint of beautiful azure then mix the colour for the light about middle degree between that and white make the shade teint dark enough for the fhadow in general all the broad light should be lay with plenty of colour and shape to character with the middle teint before we lay on any other colour remember the let colour be mix the better they will appear and fland for the light of blue should be manage with as much care as thofe of white fatin next be to follow with the reft of the middle teint and then make out all the fhadow the more we drive the shade tent the better it will art of il the reffect and finithing teint the fhadow should be firengthen and blend with ivoryblack and tome of they own colour which will mix with they into tender mellow hue the refiect be make as thofe of white fatin that be with oker and some of the light which should be per= fecily do as we inrend ii at once painting the thadow when dry may be little improve if there be occafion to alter they with the colour they be make with the pruffian proper to pe ufe be that which look of the moff beautiful azure before it be ground and the fooner it be ufe after it be ground the better it will work and appear velvet may be paint at once the method be to make out the firft lay with the middle teint and thade teint on which we should lay the high light with light touch and finith the thadow as we do thofe of the fatin but the neareff imitation of velvet we can make be do by glaze which be to prepare ground or deadcolour with fuch colour as will when dry bear out and fupport the glaze colour in its higheff perfection the nature of the glaze colour be to be of fine tranfparent quality and ufe fimply with oil only of that whatever ground it be lay on the whole may appear diffinctly through it the beft ground for blue be make with white and ivoryblack the white be for the high light which with the middle teint and ihade teint make out the firft lay like metzotinto remember to make the middle teint lighter in proportion to the glaze becaute that will make it the darker it be often necesfary to cover all but the high light with glaze do not mean with plenty of oil in the coloury the art of paintinc in otl but lay with less quantity than if it be to he do once only if any of it touch the light we should wipe it off with clean ray the very high light should be improve and make of fine white and leave to dry the glaze colour be pruffian ground very fine with nut oil and should be lay with large fiffith tool that will drive the colour as occafion require it be on the laft glaze we should firengthen and finith the thadow the greateft fault in the colour of drapery be the painting the thadow with flrong glaring colour which deftroy the beauty of the light this be not only the reverfe of art but of nature whofe beauty always di minifh in proportion with the light for this reafon we should take care to blend and foften the fhadow with fuch friendly colour as will agree with they local character and obfcurity here we may obferve that glaze the middle teint which be make of black and white will not produce colour to blue as if it have be prepare with pruffian and white yet this colour will preferve the beauty of the light in the higheff perfection by reafon of its tender obfcure hue when the bluenet of the other would only diminith they this method of glaze the blue be the general rule for all glaze when we be glaze blue the light may be glaze with ultramarine though all the other part be do with pruffian this method fave great quantity of that valuable colour and anfwer we purpofe as well as if it have be do with ultramarine though this general method of painting fatin be to make the firft lay of colour with three degree of teint yet the art of paintine in oil we should underftand in afing they that they produce two more for the mixing of two different colour together on the cloth will make another of middle teint berween they to it be with the light and middle teint and with the middle and shade teint the firft antwer to the firft teint in white fatin and the laft will confequently be fort of gradate or half shade if the light and middle teint mix to beautiful clean colour of middle hue between both there will be no occation for colour to go between they as in blue fotin but if in mixing they produce teint incline to dirty warm hue then there muft be another find of tympathize nature which should be lay between they in order to preferve the beauty of the light as the firft reint in the white latin for if it be not of the red in the middle teint would certainly dirty and fpoil the white it be highly neceffary to understand thefe principle of the firft lay of colour in order to have perfect knowledge of the general rule of colour on which the principle of painting depend scarlet and crimson light yellow red make of light oker light red and white be the proper ground for fearlet the shadow be indian red and in the darkeft part mix with very little black the second painting should be little lighter than we intend the finithing colour mean in proportion to the glzze which will make it darker the high light be vermillion and white for fain and velvet and vermillion for cloth the middle teint art of painting in oil vermillion with very little lake or indian red the ihade teint be make with indian red and lake with the addition of little black in the darkeft fhadow the difference between fearlet and crimfon be that the high light of crimfon be whiter and the middle teint be make darker they refiect be make with light red and vermillion the high light should be lay and manage in the fame manner as thofe of the blue for fear of dirty they and fometime they require to be touch over the second time before we glaze they the more the co lour of the second painting be drive the eafier and better they may be manage to character but the high light should have good body of colour and be leave with delicate light touch after it be well dry we should finith with glaze the whole with fine lake and improve the reffect and fhadow remember that the fearlet require but very thin glaze and it be better to glaze the crinfon twice over than lay too much at once painting pine colour there be two different method of painting pink colour one be by glaze the other be do with body of colour at one painting the fame grounds do for both which should be whitifh colour incline to yellow for the light and indian red lake and white for the thadow the second painting for the glaze method be do with the fame colour and little vermillion and whice for the high light when it be dry glaze it with fine lake and then break and foften the colour into harmony directly the the art of painting in oil other method be to make the high light with carmine and white the middle teint with lake white and little carmine and the fhadow with lake and indian red with little vermillion for the reffection but remember the thadow will require to be break with some tender obicure teint tellow the ground for yellow should be ayellowifh white for the light and mixture of the oker for the shadow there be the fame number of teint in the pellow as there be in the white fatin and the method of ufe they be the very fame the light be make with king yellow ground with clean good drying oil the firft teint be lightoker change with little of the pearl teint make with the dark shade and white which should be lay and manage as the firft teint in white fatin the middle teint be mixture of the light and brown oker foften with the pearl teint the shade teint be make with brown pink and brown oker thefe belong to the firftlay the reffect be light oker and fometime in the warmeff part mix with little light red the shadow be rrengthen with brown pink and burnt umber thefe colour well manage will produce yellow very like vandyke but if we leave out the king yellow which be in the high light only then it will be one of sir peter lely favourite yellow creepy the art of painting in oil proper ground for green be light yellow green which be make of light oker little white and pruffian blue for the light and the oker brown pink and pruf lian for the hadows the fineft green we have for drapery be make of king yellow pruffian blue and brown pink the high light be king yellow and very little pruffian the middle tent should have more pruffian and the fhadow teint be make with fome of the middle teint brown pink and more pruffian but the darkeft fhadow be brown pink and little pruffian the light and middle teint should be manage in the fame manner as thofe of the bly the fhadow teint should be keep entirely from the light becaute the brown pink that be in it will in mixing dirty they as the black do thofe of the bly remember to allow for they drying little darker and that the king yellow muft be ground with good drying oil for the longer it be drying the more it will change and grow darker and the fooner it be ufe the better it will fland it be proper to have two fort of king yellow mean one to be very light which will do beft for the high light of velvet should it be want changeable changeaele colour be make with four principal teint viz the high light middle teint fhade teint and reflect teint the the art of painting in oil greateff art lie in find the exact colour of the middle teint becaufe it have more of the general hue of the filk than any of the other the shade teint be of the fame hue with the middle teint though it be dark enough for the fhadow the high light though often very different from the middle teint should be of clean friendly working colour that will in mixing with it produce reint of clean fympathizing hue the method of painting filk be to make out the fold with the fnade teint and then fill they up in the light with the middle teint this be what call the firtt lay which should be do to we fatisfaction before we add any other colour and the fiffer the middle teint be ufe the better the high light may be lay upon it the reflect teint fail generally upon the gradate half shade and should be lay with tender touch paringly for fear of spoiling the firft lay this method of painting antwer for all the coloured filk as well as changeable with this difference only that the plain colour require not of much art in matching the teint as the changeable do the laft part of the work be the finithing and ffrengthening the fhadow with a obfcure teint little incline to mellowith hue fuch as will not catch the eye and interrupt the beaury of the light blace the beft ground for black be light red for the light and indian red and little black for the fhadow the finithing coloursare for the light black white and little lake the middle teint have let white and more art of paintinc in oil more lake and black the shade teint be make of a equal quantity of lake and brown pink with very little black the method of painting black be very different from that of other colour for the principal thing in they be to leave they light clear and brilliant of in black it be to keep the fhadow clear and tranfparent therefore we should begin with the fhade teint and glaze over all the fhadow with it next lay in the darkeft fhadow with black and little of the shade teint very correctly after that fill up the whole breadth of light with the middle reint only all which should be do exactly to the character of the fatin velvet cloth cc cc and then finith with the high light here we may obferve the ground beingr will bear out and fupport the red which be ufe in the finithing colour the lake in the light take off the cold hue and give it more beautiful colour if the fhade teint be of any other colour than tranfparent warm hue the hadows would confequently be black and heavy becaufe no other colour can preferve the warm brilliancy which be want in the fhadow of the black like lake and brown pink black be of cold heavy nature and always too ftrong for any other colour therefore we should make a allowance in ufe it there will be few reflect in fatin which should be add as thofe of other colour but they should be make of firong colour fuch as burnt umber or brown oker mix with little shade teint though the grounds which have mention for the drapery be abfolutely neceffary for the principal and peareft figure in picture fuch as fingle portrait or for art of painting in oil like yet do not intend they of for figure which be place more into the picture .. such as be behind the principal or front figure they grounds should always be fainter in proportion to they local finithing colour line the colour ufe in line be the fame as those in white fatin except the firft teint which be make of white and ultramarine ath inflead of the black and mix to very light bluith teint in the dead colour we should take particular care that the grounds be lay very white and broad in the light the fhadow be make with black white and little indian red like the middle teint of white fatin thefe should be leave very light and clean in order to fupport the finithing colour the second painting begin with glaze all the light with ffiff pencil and fine white only drive bare without ating any oil the fhadow may be fcumble with poppy oil and fome of the colour they be make of this be the firft lay on which we be to follow with the finithing colour directly the middle teint of white fatin be the beft colour for the general hue of the fhadow with this and white in different degree we should make out all the part to character with free light fouch without foften then with large longpoint pencil and fine white lay the high light very nicely with one ftroke after this come the fine light bluith teint which should be mix eight and lay in the tender gradation very paringly and lightly without fill they up remember the art of painting in oil the firft lay should be leave clear and distinct the more it appear the better it be the overmix and join all the colour together which spoil the beauty of the character therefore it be better to let it dry before we add the reffect and finithing teint the method of let the beautiful clear colour dry before we add the warm reflect and harmonizing teint prevent they from mixing and dirty each other the principal blend colour ufe in the reffect be the yellow teint green teint and the rofe teint which laft be make of lake indian red and white find glaze the pearl and lead colour with white though it feem to anfwer we purpofe when it be do will certainly fink and be loft in the grounds on which it be lay the refore we should make the dead colour as white as we intend the finithing colour by reafon they will fink little in proportion to the colour of the cloth which the glaze with pure white only will recover of painting landscape the principal colour ufe in landicape be fine flake white white lead or common white fine light oker brownoker brown pink burnt art of painting in oil burnt umber ivory black pruffian blue ultramarine terreverte ii lake indian red vermillion or native cinnabar king yellow the principal

leathercolour canva which be prepare with brown oker white and light red this colour give warmth to the fhadow colour and be very agreeable and proper forglazing but canvafe and ftrerch frame be to be purchafe ready prepare in feveral different way becording to the modern practice at the colourfhop in long acre st . martin lane ec alfo every other material ufe in this delightful ftudy sketck or rub in the defign be the firft work of the picture this should be do with burnt umber drive with drying oil and little oil of turpentine in faint flight fcumble free manner as we fhade with indian ink and water leave the colour of the cloth for the light as we do that of the paper remember in do it we leave no part of the fhadow of dark as we intend the firft lay or dead colour which be to be lighter than the finithing colour and though the foliage of the tree be only rub in with faint fort of fcumble yet the trunk and body should be in they proper fhape with they breadth of light and fhadow all ind of building should be do in the fame manner leave the colour of the cloth for they light the figure on the foreground if they be determine should alfo be ketch in the fame manner and then leave to dry of the art of painting in otl deadcolour ler the firft lay or deadcolour be without any bright glaring or ftrong dark colour to that the effect be make more to receive and preferve the finifh colour than to thew they in they firft painting the ky should be do firft then all the diftance and of work downwards to the middle group and from that to the foreground and neareft part remember all the part of each group as tree building or the like be all paint with the group they belong to the greateff secret in deadcolour be to find the two colour which ferve for the ground of fhadow in general the thy except and the method of ule they with the light the firft of which be the dark shade with little lake in it the other colour be only burnt umber thefe should be little change to the natural hue of the object and then lay and drive with drying oil in the fame manner as we shade with indian ink which be fcumble kind of glaze and as fuch they should be leave for otherwife they will be dark and heavy and therefore would be entirely fpoil for the finithing glaze both thefe colour mix and fympathize agreeably with all the light but should be lay before they when the landicape be defign begin with the sky which should be lay with good body of colour and leave with faint refemblance of the principal cloud and this we should do more in the manner of claro obfcuro than with finithing colour the whiter it be leave the better it will bear out and fupport they the diftance should art of painting in otl should be make out faint and obicurely with the dark shade and fome of they light in different degree and lay of as beft to find and thew they principal part as we come more into the middle group we fall by degree into the burnt umber in the shade all the grounds of the tree should be lay or rub in enough only to leave a idea of they shape and hadows faintly the ground of they fhadow muft be clean and lighter than they finithing colour fuch as will fupport the character and feem eaty to finith orn in painting the light it be better to incline more to the middle teint than to the very high light and obferve to leave they with fufficient body of clean colour which will preferve the finithing colour better all which may be do with few teint after this go over the whole with fweetner very lightly which will foften and mix the colour agreeably for finifh second painting becin with the lky and lay in all the azure and colour of the horizon then foften they after that lay in the general teint of the cloud and finith on it with the high light and the other teint that be wanting with light tender touch then foften the whole with fweether very lightly remember the finithing of the fky should be do all at once painting becaufe the tender character of the cloud will not do to well art of painting in oie when the whole be wet obferve that the stiffer the azure and colour of the horizon be lay the better the cloud may be paint upon they the greateft diffance be chieffy make with the colour of the fky and as they grow nearer and darker we should glaze and fcumble the part very thin with fuch glaze thadowcolour as come neareft to the general hue of the group the object be in this glaze should be underfiood of darkith hue and that the firft painting or dead colour should be feen through it diftinctly on this lay or ground we should add the finithing colour now fuppoting this glaze ground be properly adapt to the object and place think then it will be eaty to find the other colour which be want for the light and finithing of the fame but in lay they we muft take care that we do not fpoil the glaze therefore we should he very exact in make thofe colour on the pallet and then be fure to lay they with light free touch before proceed any farther it will be proper to fay fomething of the moft uteful glaze colour lake terrevert pruffian blue and brown pink be the four principal the more we manage they like indian ink and the more diffinctly we leave they the better they tranfparent beauty will fland and appear provide we do it with good drying oil after thefe four glaze colour burnt umber be very good glaze warm brown and of great ufe in the break grounds and neareft part but the moft agreeable colour for the darkeff fhadow be the dark fhade improve with lake it be fine warm fhade when it be drive with drying oil no colour in the world be to fweet and fympathizing art of paintinc in otl mix harmonioutly with all the light as well as the hadows and be charming colour in the trunk and bodie of tree and in all kind of building we should make out all the ground of the object with tuch glaze fhadowcolour as feen neareft to the totural hue of the object in that fituation but as the principal glaze colour themfelves be often too ftrong and glaring they should therefore be little change and foften with fuch colour as be of near refemblance to themfelves and the object thus if it be in the dif tance the terreverte and azure which be the pricipal glaze colour may be improve and make lighter with tome of the lky teint and as the diftance come nearer with the purple as we get more into the middle group the terreverte and prullian blue may be change with some of the green teint fuch as be make without white for white be the destruction of all glaze colour as we approach the firft group there be let occafion for change they but the foreground and its object require all the ftrength and force of glaze which the colour be capable of produce after this glazeground we should follow with rrengthening the fame in the fhadow and darkeft place in fuch manner as will feem eafy to finith which be the firft lay of the second painting the colour that come next for finithing be in the degree of middle teint thefe should be carefully lay over the greateft breadth of light in fuch manner as not to poil and cover too much of the glaze do it with good body of colour as ftiff as the pencil can agreeably manage to character remember the colour of the middle teint should be of clean beautiful hue accordg art of painting in oil to thefe method think it will be eaty to finith all the second painting as we work down from the iky through the middle group as we come to the firft group where all the object should be perfectly finith we should finith they under or moft diftant part before we paint any of the other which appear nearer obferve this method down to the laft and neareft object of the picture and where it to happen that painting one free over another do not pleafe forbear the fecond until the firft be dry thin near tree of different colour will do better if we let the under part dry before we add the finithing colour the third and last painting ir oil be neceffary lay the leave quantity that can be which should be do with fiumptool or pencil proportion to the place that be to be oil to that we may oil no more than be want then wipe the whole place that be oil with piece of filk handkerchief by this method we leave no more oil than be proper for we purpofe when we be go to finith any object we should remember to ufe great variety of teint very near of the same colour but moft of all when we be finifhng free he give richnet to the colour and pro duce harmony find by experience the green will fade the art of paintinc in oil and grow darker therefore it be highly neceffary to improve and force they by exaggerating the light and make a allowance in ule they to much the lighter for the same reafon we should take great care that we do not overcharge and fpoil the beauty of the glaze for if we do it will be dull and heavy and therefore will confequently grow darker the merhod of painting near tree be to make the firft lay very near to nature though not quite to dark but more in the degree of middle teint and follow it with ttrengthen the fhadow then the middle teint and laft of all lay the high light and finithing colour but all this can not be do as it should be at once painting therefore the beft way be to do no more than the firft lay with the faint lhadow and leave it to dry then begin with improve the middle teint and tha dow and let they dry the third and laft work be add all the light and finifh colour in the beft manner we be able this method of leave the firft and second part to dry feparately not only make the whole much eafier and more agreeable but leave the colour in the greateft perfection becaufe moft of the work may be do with fcumble and glaze and some part without oil the light alfo may be lay with better body of colour which will not be mix and fpoil with the wet ground what have faid of tree anfwer the fame to all kind of shrub and buthe the figure in the landicape be the laft work of the picture thofe in the foreground should be do firft and thofe in the diftance should be do next for after the figure in the firft and farcheff group be paint think art of painting in oil it will be much eafier to find the proportion of thofe in the middle part of the picture and we should obferve that the thadow of the figure should be of the same hue or colour with thofe of the group or place they be in finis
