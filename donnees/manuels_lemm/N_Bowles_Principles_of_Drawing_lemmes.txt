acquire the art without the assistance of master every branch of draw be contain in this book such as the different part of the bird human body cattle academ shipplng dress figure landscape elegantly engrave on sixty folio page of copper plate all from the original drawing of the most approve master to which be prefixe a introduction to draw contain rule and direction for the choice of instrument and material and how to apply and manage they with easy and proper lesson for the young student translate from the french of monsieur gerard de lairesse with abstract from du fresnoy the seventh edition correct and greatly improve with addition london print for and sell by the proprietor carington bowle at bis map and print warehouse no in stpaul church yard draw be the art of represent by line and shade the figure of any object we see or of any form we conceive a idea of in the mind it be most ingenious useful and elegant art and the study of it ought to be encourage in every youth that discover a inclination or genius towards the practice thereof whatever station of life he may be place in its utility be so very extsive there be few art and few profession in which it be not serviceable all design and model be execute by it manthematician engineer architect mariner gardiner embroiderer weaver and multitude of other profession have frequent occasion to practise it in most station it be useful from the general who command a army to the mechanic who support himself by handicraft person who have knowledge in draw and capacity of perform it usually see and remember the form shape and other circumstance of object more minutely and perfect than one unacquainted with the art and possess a accomplissiment exceedingly desirable both for amusement and use he be qualified to take on the spot the sketch of fine building of beautiful prospect of any curious production of art or of uncommon and strike appearance in nature and to bring home for future inspection and service the foris of object which yreld entertainment in journy and distant place whether you draw after nature or the performance of other the hand can only express by line and shade those form and idea which have impress the mind hence the utility appear of accustoming the mind to curious and attentive observation of object especially of those intend for imitation its imprefsion will hereby be strengthen its conception will be more exact and just and the hand will delineate with greater ease and correctness those form which be clearly and strongly retain in the memory inform you judgment of the property and excellency of à draw well execute in this knowledge the mind will make quick improvement by frequent attentive inspection of the performance of those who have excel in view they contemplate the freedom and boldness of the outline the correctness or justness of the proportion of the several part the character which be peculiar and distinguishing in every figure and expressive of the circumstance it be suppose to be in the elegance or that which give à kind of delicacy or certain agreeableness which please every one the perspective or representation of the part accord to they situation with respect to the point of sight if the judgment be well inform in these particular the young practitioner will make much greater improvement than can possibly be attain if he proceed in practice without due regard to increase know¬ ledge and judgment more to the genius than the hand we owe from this the beauty of you art must flow the labour of the hand must second and support that of the brain to become a able artist the art must be make habitual a easy and just expreffion be only to be gain by constant practice in all aris the rule be learn in little time but the practice require long and severe diiigence the hand should be improve in practice and the mind in judgment every day this ingenious art not only afford very pleasing entertainment to man of leisure and fortune in variety of instance but enable they to judge the propriety of design for such work as they intend to have execute to lay down and exhibit they construction and vary and improve the plan most to they own like of all other this art have the greatest number of admirer and no wonder since in kind of universal language understand by all man it represent to we vicw the form of innumerable object we have no other way of beholding and help we to the knowledge of many of the work in nature or art which any other method of describe would be insufficient to give a idea ofit transmit to we view thing long since past and preserve the form of other that will soon perisni it reprefent the deed of people and action for many age dead and hand down to we the feature and resemblance of we ancestor and of other valuable and renowned persous of former generation the esteem of this excellent art be not confine to adult child admire it and often by the power of natural genius draw variety of object ili such manner as to excite commendation for the instruction of vouth in this useful art the follow rule be lay down and course of proper lesson exhibit for they practice to be observe let you first practice be employ in imitate the most plain and simple object in accustoming you hand to draw strait line perpendicular and horizontal one circular and irregularly curve line this method will be useful in bringing the hand to facility of operation moreover these line be the rudiment of all object that can be express they bound and circumscribe every figure all its part or member be compose of they little time may be advantageously employ in draw after plain inanimate figure which require stroke of various curving after this draw the particular seature of the face begin with the eye the nofe the mouth the ear draw they in they different position persevere in copy several time after the same example before vou make the transition to new one you can nôt expect to draw a entire head or face till you be capable of performing the part separatelv nor of copy with pleasure and improvement those object which require more art and time till you have acquire customary exercise of patience and freedom and exactness in copy those that be easier sketch vour outline at first very faint that the amendment of it may be perform without its appear to be retouched endeavour at à graceful freedom boldness and just pro portion of all its part in these the exceliency of good outline consist it should be draw with flow and glide stroke not swell suddenly but with gradual risings such as might just be feel in statue be careful that it lose nothing of its freedom and boldness when you correct it by reduce some purt and swell other the outiine on that side nearest the light must be fainter than the other the surest and most improve miethod of practice be to fketch outline for consi¬ derable time without attempt to shade any of they and to make number of sketch from the same pattern imitate as nearly as you ean every stroke and carefully to compare each of vour copy with the original that vou may observe wherein it be faiilty and avoid those ercor in vour next sketch good outline be of the greatest importance and extent in the art of draw draw a ability to make it can only be acquire by appli¬ cation and practice proceed slowlv in vour first attempt make it vour care to secure every stroke and rather to produce one good sketch than in heedless manner to hurry over number of bad one view you original with close attention ponder upon the length the breadth and the form of each part they proportion to one another and to the whole the distance from one part to fhe other which of they lie parallel and which underneath the other in consider what part be opposite to each other you may conceive or occasionally draw perpendicular line from the top to the bottom and à strait line from side to sitle and notice what part be mark by these line and in what manner other deviate from they this observation may be make by lay vour ruler acrof the work and observe the part intersected thereby sketch out the general appearance of the whole in very faint stroke without regard the minute particular and littie turn these may be add afterwards review you sketch after it have be lay aside for some time compare it again with the original fault may then appear which be indiscover before this method of practice tend to make you more perfect in any particular sketch and by improve you knowledge of outline and proportion to enable you for nearer imitation after other pattern proportion or the just magnitude of the several member make one essential article in every good draught scheme of the proportion of graceful human figure be give in the fifth lesson take from the measure of antique statue estcem for the highest degree of proportion knowledge of these will be of great service to the young student yet it must not be suppose that this scheme be the standard of measurement for all figure for different attitude make sensible difference in the limb of the same bodv the muscle shift they appearance swellthis the arm the foot the knee be enlarge by bend¬ ing they and the limb be also fore shorten moreover different human body of agreeable appearance have nat the same meafure and exact propoition in they feature and limb therefore the eye must judge of gracefulness and proportion fitnef to peculiar character should always be join to the idea of proportion brawny muscular limb be expressive of strength and more stender form of agility for motion the leg of chairme and the shoulder of waterman be enlarge by tleir different occupation aukward as such fioure appear yet thoughtiess country clown be fitly express by large liead shoyt neck high shoulder flat stomach thick knee and thigh and large foot proportion in these and other instance be regulate by fitnef to peculiar character and no exact dimension can be give of they the proper material for draw he material for draw be black lead pencil charcoal crayonof black white or red chalk or other dry colour madle up into crayon portcrayon indian ink hair pencil crowquill pen à rulerand pair of compass black lead pencil be most convenient at the beginning of practice slope you pencil to fine point accustom yourself to hold it further from the point than the nib of pen in writing this be necessary to a easy command of hand and to the make you stroke with freedom and holduenr charcoal of fine smooth grain slit into slender piece fon the portcrayon be very proper for sketch as any stroke make with it be easisy brushied out with feather or clean soft rag if you thiuk they wrong have secure you outline with charcoal wipe it slightly over with feather to make the line fajnt then go over they with black or red lead endeavour to make they more correct these new stroke when wrong may be discharge with india rubber or the crumb of stale white bread in sketch after plaster or academy figure charcoal be much use because it be easily discharge chalk the best sort of it be free from grittinef and sand be pretty foft and have kind of fatness in it black chalk be often use on blue or grey paper the colour of which serve for good part of the shad and the lighis be put in with white chalk red chalk be use on white paper the shade make in hatch with it receive sostness by rub they in gently in the broad strong part with stump make of wasfi leather and then hatch upon they again chalk be proper for draw large figure but little experience will teach you to be careful not to make false stroke with it for they be very difficult to be discharge from the paper crayon be any colour mix with tobaccopipe clayy which while soft and in the consistency of paste be roll up in piece about the thicknef of quill and two or three inch in length and then be dry be properly call dry colour they work easiest and express themselves strongest on paper of rough grain and be use on coloured paper if dark or brownissi or near the colour of whitebrown paper it yield good relief to the tender part of the work in ufe these colour they be rub and wring one into another in such manner that no stroke appear but the colour be mix as if they be lay in with brushi many picture after the life be paint in crayon draw with these dry colour be quick and expeditious and when the crayon be handle with judgment they give delicate softness but the touch of rude finger may spoil the sine work or damp place mildew it indian ink do not spread and run like common ink and the work perform with itappear much softer it be buy in small cake and by mixing it with water may be make to any degree of strength and use either with hair pencil or in pen like common ink when the young student have make some progress in draw with he black lead pencil and begin to use this ink let he secure he outline as correct as he can with the black lead then he may trace it over with pen or hair pencil and indian ink and afterwards with india rubber er the crumb of stale white bread rub out any remain mark of the black lead pencil shad with this ink be sometimes do by hasch with the pen or make stroke cross one anorher but this be as well or better perform with the hair pencil more expeditious and customary manner be wash or work the shade with the ink and hair peneil in the sanie way as water colour be use the shade make by hatch resemble the siroke of engrave print in wasl the shade they appear like those in mezzotinto print in which there be not any line the ruler and compass be useful in make geometrical figure and in architecture except in these instance the ruler be never to be use and the compass but seldom occasionally they may be apply in nicely examine the agreement of the copy with the original but it be best to judge in most cale by the eye only the conduct of the teint of light and shadow it be the proper distribution of light and shade which give the appearance of substanice round or flat sliape distance and relievo or projection to whatever body you represent draw circle and accord to the manner in which you shade it it will either receive flat globular or concave appearance fill it up with a even colour or with number of line of thie same strength and it will resemble body with round circumference and flat side by colour it strongest in the middle the edge be make to retire by the gradate shiad and it receive convex appearance like globe by graduaily weaken the stiad from the edge towards the centre the middle part will be make to retire and concave appearance like bason be give to it those part of a object which have the greatest vivacity of colour catch the sight first and appear nearest to it by gradually weaken thé colour the other part be make to recede from the eye and appear farther off pure and unmixed white either bring a object nearer or make it to retire further if the white be gradual ly weakened and support by fhade it then advance but unless it be thus force forward it sly off to the remotest view in round the part of any object thelight and thade must be gradually soften into oné another and lose themselves by slow and almost imperceptible degree the outline must be faiait in those part which receive the light and strong and bold where the shade fall begin vour shad at the top proceed downward and go through the whole of it with faint shade before you give the finishiag to any particular part abalance should be preserve between the light and shade they serve for a opposition to onc another broad light must therefore be accompany with broad shade fainter light with fainter shade light object must have sufficient strength of shadow to sustain they and dark body must be relieved by maf of light behind without this opposition object will adhere to the ground or stick to one another but by distribute light and shadow to advantage they be loosen and set free and receive strong relievo those object or part of object which come forwardest to view must have strong and smart opposition and the highest finish those that be design to be throw further off must be make still weaker and less distinct in nature object appear distinct or confused accord to they nearness or dotance the feature of face or fold of garment be not distinguishable the length of street and the innumerable leave of distant plantation look like one confused maf more accurate or slighter finissiing give to olject relative dominion over each other as to they distance the heighten of one chase another further from the sight which be not so minutely and strongly pencile give to every object such light as be most proper to its suppose situation in the open air when the sun shine full upon object the light must be strong and bold and the sha¬ dow dark if the sun be obscure by cloud the light be more equal and universal but not so strong and warm and the shiad must be fainter and more sweet artificial light tinge the object with its own colour and occasion large shadow with bold extremity elementary light be pure and more generally diffuse and the shadow it produce be softer the project part of object that be nearest to the light catch it first be brightest and produce shiad upon the lower part consider trom what poinf and in what diin all art and science the learner begin with the most simple principle the knowledge of the alphabet be a intro duction to the grammar aud a ability to imitate the form of different line it be no matter of what shape so that they be cxactly imitate be the foundation of draw aster every kind of object in the first lesson the scholar be present with many line of different kind for he imitation viz perpendicular line mark that be line fall directly on another so as to rection the light sall upon the object and place all you light and shade accord to that direction if it fall perpendicular upon man the top of the head be then lightest the shoulder in the next degree so and the lower part gradually darker the cavity and part that bend inwards not receivitg any direct ray be darkest of all and the colour be lose in they the full force of the principal light be to be only in one part and ought not to be cross or interrupt with littie shadow sudden brightness be see and many reflection and small tint be produce when the force of light strike upon siik sattin vessel of silver copper or upon other glittering object the very extremit of the shadow side of object be seldom the darkest of all because it almost always receive à reflection of light from adjacent body reslex be scarce sensible except in the shadow part all reflect light be suppose to carry withit part of the colour of the body which reflect it so that those place which receive this light have they own colour mix or ting with the other much skill and accuracy be often require in management of the reflex as the same place many time receive they from different object differently coloured every circumstance of the colour light and position of each figure and what effect each have upon the other be to be consider and nature pursue in all the variety of mixture nature give vast variety of appearance in light and shadecurious observer of they be rewarded with high delight and the artist with much improvement the sky always gradate one way or another the rise and setting sun exhibit it with astonishing beasty and perfection the variety of form and colour reflect in water from the sky and cloud from tree house and other object be exceed beautiful to behold accustom yourself to consider the different effect of light fall upon object its various and delightful softning and modulation in the shade or part which be more or less deprive of the ray you judgment will this way be best inform by you sense how to represent these pleasing appearance the proper ianagenient of which make onc of thé great division or branch of painting first lesson make equal angles on each side horizontal line which pass srom onc point to another without any deviation oblique line converge or approximate one way and diverging or continually increase they distance the other way parallel line which be every where equidistant from each other at two semicircle be draw from point assume in the lower line and the upper line be tangent to both of they prove the truth of its be draw parallel example be also give of various sort of curve and twining line the second lesson consist partly of geometrical figure some of they with plain line other with they surface form by light and shade number be cijcle the circle appear with flat side be fill with a equal shade convex appearance give to the circle by light and shade concave appearance give to it other convex and concave surface square of four equal side a equilateral the third leslon will be more pleasing to the learner than the former one and practise after the instance the follow leave exhibit many example of the feature of the human face as the eye nose mouth ear the pupil should practise after the different feature in they various position till he be able to draw they well unless he can perfoim the part separately it will be fruitless to attempt the whole together triangle spiral or curve line issue from centre and continually go off fromit at every turn cone these with other figure shew in this lesson be useful in different part of practice by consult small treatise of practical geometry by le clerc the student in fhiort time will gain knowledge of the construction of geometrical figure very advantageous in draw multitude of object here give will qualify he to copy more difficult representation several easy example be also give of entire face and head in variot aftitude when the student have make progress in sketch after those in outline there be other which be finisnied for he to shade after by consider the plate annex he will improve he idea of face and the method of draw it in all the change and variation which be occasion therein by different turning of the head the division and proportion of the head and face in draw head and face four equal part the length of the nose be usually allot from the top to the bottoi froi the crown of the head to the top of the forehead from thence to the top of the nofe to the bottom of the nofe from thence to the bottom of the chin the breadth of the face be divide into five equal part one of which part be the length of the eye the distance between the eye be the measure of one part and from the corner of the eye to the side of the face be one part the width of the mouth be little more than one of these part the width of the nose across the nostril little less thie eve be divide into three part one of which be the measure of the pupil or sight with the iris round it the ear be usually the length of the nose these be approve proportion of good face view in front but in different beautiful subject the same feature often vary both in length and shape the head in general have nearly the shape of a egg or oval as in fig of the annex plate in the middle of the oval draw from the top to the bottom perpendicuthe feature of front face when draw upon the cross line accord to these direction will appear in they proper place whatever way the oval or egg be turn as be shew in fig and the learner may apprehend more perfectly the ule of these two line they variation in the different turning of the head and how the feature on they appear when the face be incline to either side turning upwards or dotn ward let he either conceive of or procure piece of smooti wooe turn in the form of a draw line lengthway quite round the egg as in sig andrpendicular from top to bottom as in fig divide this line into two equal part by another which reach from side to side as in fig the feature be draw on these cross line produce front right face as in fig by turn the egg small mat¬ ter to the leave or to the right the crof line appear more curve as in fig and the feature must be draw on they as shiewn in fig and the nose always project beyond the perpendicular line in proportion as the face be more or less turn aside and more of the ear and nearest side of the face become visible the first line which be draw round the eg no longer its boundary but it gain à new circumierent line by be turn into new position by inciin the egg downwards and little to the leave the cross will appear as in fig raise upwards and recline to the right the line appear as in fig and the feature in these instance be shew in sig and vast variety of face differently inclined may be shiewn by this oval or egg lar line as in fig through the centre of this line draw another directly across as in fig on these two line the feature of the face be to be draw in they due proportion divide the perpendicular line into four equal part the first must be allot to the hair of the head the second be from the top of the forehead to the top of the nose the third reach to the bottom of the nose the fourth division includy the lip and chin this perpendicular line divide the face breadthway into two equal part it lie exactly in the middle betwixt the eye run down the midst of the nose and the gutter underneath the middle of the mouth must always be place on it and the bottom of it terminate on the point of the chin divide the cross line which be the breadth of the face into five equal part and place the eye upon it so as to leave exactly the lergth of one eye between they this be to be understand of front face as in fig for if it turn to either side the distance appear lessen on that side which be farthest from you the cross line be the boundary for the top of the ear the bottom of they be parallel with the bottom of the nose the nostril should not swell beyond the inner corner of the eye profile or side face be to be draw by means of perpendicular as in fig on which the forehead nofe mouth and chin be to be place as in fig in these figure the line from top to bottom be strictly perpendicular it would be so in a oval draw on paper or any flat surface but the curvity of a egg turn it out of that form though for dis¬ tinction sake it be describe by that name in the forego accouint yhen vou mark the feature in they proper place touch they very lightlvat sirst and afterwards proceed on they with greater exactness then draw the hair beard andshadow when the pupil can draw face and head tolerably well he may proceed upon the hand and seet the hand be very important article and to perform they with ease and freedom be not à little difficult much labour should be bestow in practise aster the example give of they in they various action and foreshortnings the hand from the tip of the foresinger to the wrist be the length of face that be threc quarter of head and this length be equally divide into two part one of which be for the pali of the hand the thumb be the length of the nose the breadth of the palm be the same as its length equal to the length of the fore finger the nail of the finger be about half the joint it stand upon the soot vicw sideways be in length the sixth part of tlie figure and may be divide into four equal part one of which be for the heel two other for the sole and the other for the toe the great toe be commonly the length of the thumb these proportion usually obtain and it will be useful for the pupil to fix a idea of they in he mind though there be few opportunity of apply they directly because of the foreshortnings in which these part appear in almost every graceful action he ancient commonly allow eigat head to they figure the modern ordinarily divide the figure into ten face the face begin at the root of the lowest hair on the forehead and end at tne bettom of the chin a human sigure divide accord to this method into ten equal part of the length of face each division will reach as followy the first from the crown ofthe head to the nostril the second tothe hole in the neck between the collarbone the third to the pit of the stomach the fourth to the navel the sisth to the lower part of the belly the sixth and seventh to the upper part of the knce the thigh be the length of two face the kuce contain half face from the lower part of the knee to the ankle two face from tlic ankie to the sole of the foot haif face man with he arm extend from the extremity of the longest singer of he right hand to the longest of he left measure as broad as he belong viz from the tip of tie long singer to the joint of the wrist one face thence to the elbow one sace and one third begin with make the oval for the head and divide it accord to the instruction already give agreeable to tiat uiversal rule in all just design of compare and pro portion every part to the first the rest of you figure must now be proportion to the head theresore draw perpendicular srom the top of the oval and mark on it eight division or length of the head sor the heighth of the figure and adjustment of its part this line be also of use in place the figure upright and whether it be measurede by eight head or ten sace the sormer leston direct what part of the body be to be place on the several division skeich the head sirst then the shoulder then draw the runk of the body begin with the armpit ioave the aviie tiil afterwarie and sy doin to the hip on boch side bout it in all face there be some principal touch which ive spirit and be the characteristic thereof these should be well consider and caresully express if the face be fat the cheek will seem to swell if lean the jaw bone will stick out and cheek fall in the corner of the mouth and middle of the eyebrow will be elevate in agreeable sensation the eyebrow will rise up at tlie end and fall in the mid¬ dle and the corner of the mouth will sink in pain or uneasiness the mouth by fhoot forward and rise in the middle express aversion every passion of the soul be visible in the feature of the face the line and light which be ex¬ press of they proclaim particular attention thence to the juncture of the shoulder one face and one third thence to the hole of the neck one face and one third in all five face which with the five along the other arm to the tip of the middle finger give ten in measure figure by eight part each part the length of the head the division allot to they be vix from the crown of the head to the point of the chin one thence to the bottom of the breast one thence to the navel one thence to the lower part of the belly one thence to the middle of the tligh one thence to the lower part of the knee one thence to the small of the leg one thence to the bottom of the foot one the figure with he arm stretch out measure breadthway by eight part or head be divide as follow viz from the end of the long finger to the wrist one thence to the bend of the arm one thence to the bottom of the shoulder one thence over to the other shoulder two thence to the end of the other long finger three the proportion of man differ in some respects from those of woman particularly the head of woman be lessthan that of man and she neck longer the breast and belly be lower the space from the bottom of the breast to the navel be half the length of the nose less than in man aad the thigh third part of the nose shorter as to the breadth wogfian have she breast and shoulder narrower and she haunch larger she thigh at the place of articulation be larger the top of they arm and leg be larger than manbut down ¬ ward more slender and they hand and foot be less new bear infant be not at most above sour liead long and seldom so much at sour orfive year old it be about five head long and the length of the body increase with its age till it arrive of tie state of manhood and attain its ful proportion the thicknef of the limb must be adjust agreeable to the qualitv and character of the figure in general it may be notice that the breadth of the thigh at tliè thickest be double that of the thickest part of the leg and treble that of the smallest but there be à difference in tlie contour of paris when put in different posture thus when the arm be bent it be larger than when straight the same be true of the foot and kuee and other limb and joint ba careful to observe the breadth of the waist then draw that leg which the body rest upon and asterwards the other which stand loose next draw the arm and last of all the handit be somctimes recommend to begin the sketch on the right side of the figure that in the proeess of the work the performer s hand may nehiter hide or shade any part of it as it may happen in some draught when begin on the left side to ensorce direction already give in the general rule carefully view the original you draw after the distance of one feature limb joint mulcle fromt another they length breadth and turning they proportion to cach other and to the whole figure which of thei be directy unaer the other which of they be parallel and how they stand situate with regard to any part of the figure preserve just symmetry and harmonious correspondence in all the part of the figure by form they in due propor¬ tion to one another not one arm bigger or longer than the other or of size ill adapt to any of the other part not plump and strong limb with shrivel face or decay body or broad herculean shoulder with the waste limb of fribble take notice of the bowings and bending of the body and contrast the opposite part answerable thereto if the belly bend in the body must stick out if the knee bend in draw naked body whatever muscle appear must be express agreeable to the rule of anatomy they must not be subdivide into small section but keep as entire as possible only the principal muscle and those which be of signi¬ fication to express that action which be represent should be the motion or action of the figure must make to appear always be consider in draw the muscle for they rise and sink and be either less or more apparent accord to the different motion of th body the muscle of the leg which support the body or of a arm that lift weight be fuller or more swell than in the leg or arm wllich be not a cloath vour figure or casting the drapery over they with elegance and propriety it shiould be consider that the beauty of drapery consist not in the multitude of fold but in they natural order and plain simplicity the drapery must encompass the part loosely when it sit too strait or close it give stiffnef to the figure and seem obstructive to its motion draw the plait large and foliow the form of the limb underneath that they may be distinguished srom other by due management of the light and shade the extremity of the joint as the fhoulder elbow knee should be so mark as to be apparent as far as art and probability will permit notwithstanding they be cover this be so material consideration that many artist first sketch the naked figure aud afterwards put the drapery on it the great fold must be draw first and asterwards break and divide int lesser one and great care be take that they do nut cross one another improperly though in general rhe fold should be large and as few as possible vet they must be greater or less accord to the quality of the stuff of which the draperv be suppose to consist some as coarse woollen make they fold abrupt and harshi and other as silk and sine linen more soft and easy the surface of some have à lustre other be dull some aré pliable and transpa¬ rent other strong and solid the quality of the person be likewise to be consider in the drapery if they be magistrate or dignisy personage they robe or dvapery should be large and ampie if lady and nymph thin sost and pliable if counsy clown ordinary people or slave they out the ham must fall in and so of every other joint in the body sketch vour outline at sirst very faint mark the general appearance and proportion of the most conspicuous and remarkable particular with slight touch and afterwards introduce the minute part by trace it over again correct the first sketch by little and litile until the whole contour be finish with admirable exactness steady even light be alway to be choose that no glare may come on the original or on you own work so employ those of the breast become more or less visibie lift up or hold down the arm in draw young person the muscle must not appear so manifestly as in those who be elder and full grow the same be to be observe in fat and flesliy peôple and in such as be very delicate and beautiful in woman and child scarce any muscle at all be to be express and but faintly when swell by forcible action in person of a hardy and robust make they be most apparent ought to be stout and coarse suit the garment and fold to the posture of the body and the sway or action of the limb crook or strait or bend one way or another becording to they various position in such manner as will best express they attitude and motion different posture and motion vary the sold and bring they into new form and whatever posture the body be suppose to be in should be express by a artful complication of they when they be well imagine they give much spirit to every action great likeness and motion of the drapery be ouly proper for figure in great agitation or expose to the wind the loose apparel in this case must all sly one way and that part of the garment which adhere closest to the body should be draw before the loose part which fly from it in order to secure the true position of the figure the closer the garment sit to the body the narrower and sinaller must be the fold the drapery which cover those part that be expose to great light mnust not be so deeply shade as to seem to pierce they nor should the limb in that situation of light be cross by sold that be too strong lest the great darkness of the snade give they the appearance of be break whenever the drapery be adorn with rich ornament they should be intro¬ duce with judgment and propriety suitable to the character of the sigure and in general be use sparingly it be altogethe improper and debase to use they in the imaginary representation of angel the dignity and grandeur of whose dra¬ pery ought rather to consist in noble flow of the fold than in rich stuff and the glitter of ornament always choose north light if possible because it be stcady and most equally diffuse darken with the slutter all the window of the room but one and darken the lower part of thât window the light contract in this manner and only admit at a altitude above the position of the figure will make the snadow distinct and snew every part of it to advantage if vou be constrain to window which have south aspect transparent sasni of oil s paper will mo¬ derate the light and take off the glare sit at distance from the model in proportion to its size so far that vou may sce the whole of it at onice which may be effect at à distance about twice or three time its magnitude seat yourself in such manner as to bring vour eye upon à level with the sigare place vour picture in good light by which be mean not only a even steady light as direct in the former article but also the proper light for the picture that it may fall thereon cither on the right or leave side agreeable to the light and shadow in the painting seat yourself at proper dotance fromn it to see the whole picture at once observe nicely what object be place in the middle of the picture mark slightly the middle of vour paper and give it the same situation observe the principal olyject on the leave and on the right side how they be place and range sketch they rough form very slightly in the same disposition and proportion till all the principal part be mark on you paper in they proper place the expression or suppose character and circumstance of every object in the picture must be well study and imprint on you mind its attitude posture and gesture preserve in you copy and those part be particularly notice by which the action and sentiment be represent in strong and lively manner as the whole composition thould be slightly sketch before you begin to sinish any part for the snad vou should oo on with the whole together with faint shade before you finish any part mauy direction be give in the precede essay for thie light and shade common method of adjust the distance the situation and proportion of every object agrecable to the picture be to divide it into little square and then to divide the paper foi have fix vour station and deteriin what extent of view to delineate draw the horizontal line faintly aud mark it into three division then divide in vour mind the landscape in three division likewise sketch the middle divi¬ sion first then that on the left hand afterwards tiat on the right observe what object fall under one another and mark they on you paper accordingly what objecte range on level with each other between the two side and place they parallel in you draugnt remnark what ohject be the observation heretofore lay down be applicable ti this branch of draw to urge the most material of they copy after good original mark out all the par before you begin to shadow make the contour in great piece without take notice of the little muscle and other break observe every stroke as to its perpendicular pa¬ rallel and distance and particularly so to compare and oppose the part that meet upon and traverse the perpendicular as to form kind of square in the mind which be the great and almost the only rule for produce just and exact copycarefully regard not only the model vou be copying after but also the part vou have already draw therei be no possibility of perserve strict justness in vour performance but by compare and proportioning every part to the first the copy into the same number of square and to draw ini they what be correspondent to each square this be suremethod to enlarge or reduce draught with exactness but ifj the student accustom hiinself to practise by the help of these square he will certainly stint and confine he judgmenti let he rather help it by imaginary line than cramp it by real one let he conceive in he mind perpendicular and a horizontal line intersecting each other in the middle of thej picture and observe what object be cross by they and then suppose two such line cross he paper in order to give those object similar situation in like manner the si tuation and proportion of all the chief part throughout the picture may be consider by imagine other line traver they and divide as it be the several part of the paintingi into small square the primary qualification in the art offdraw be readiness of compare and measure by the eye all the part of composition and a ability to expref they with boldness and justnessthis essential accomplissiment be to be acquire by habit and application the proportion form and magnitude of olyject they di munition in size and lustre be govern by the rule of perspective knowledge in the practical part of that sciencen will greatly advance tlie pupil s judgment and facilitate he practice and this knowledge may be attain with surprizing ease by consult that plain and familiar treatise thei jcsuitperspective translate by ephraim chamber see through the interval of other particular object and give they the same apparent situation endieavour to sketch all the object in they proporyional magnitude and distance they gradually diminisn as they be farther remove from thei eye and it be this dimunition with gradual softening and indistinctness which give distant object they remote appeark ance there be certain infallible rule in perspective for the management of this important article make all you light and shade fall one way
