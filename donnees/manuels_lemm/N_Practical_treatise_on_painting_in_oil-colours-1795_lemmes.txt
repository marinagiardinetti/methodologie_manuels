call the first lay or ground the second the lay on the virgin tint the firft lay of colour confift of two part the one be the work of the shadow only and the other that of the light the work of the fhadow be to make out all the draw very correctly with the thadetint in the fame manner as if it be to be do with this colour only and remember to drive or lay the colour sparingly the light should be all lay in with the lightred tint in different de gree as we fee they in nature thefe two practical rule for two colour united produce clean tender middle tint for mixing with the thadeint they turn to pearly hue and by rrengthening they with the lightr we may work to very good retemplance in uniting the light and shade we should ufe long foftener about the fize of large fvan quill which will help to bring the work into character and leave the colour more delicate then go over the darkeft fhadow with the red or warm shade which will finith the firli lay the warm shadeb lay on the shadeint improve it to warmer hue but if lay inftead of the fhadetint it will dirty and fpoil the colour it mix with and if the red hade be lay firft inftead of the thadetint the shadow would then appear seethe article sweetener in the mlateria pictoria in oil colour red and bloody therefore notwith slanding thefe two colour be the beft that can be for the fhadow yet they be too irong to be lay alone which be proof of the great ufe and merit of the fhadetint here we may obferve that the shade and lightred tint be of friendly and delicate in they nature that they will not dirty though we be continually change they how proper then and agreeable to we purpofe be they for make the moft principal part of the likenets when in alter and change they always produce clean colour of the in¬ yit pearly hue the second part of the first paintinc in order to finith the firft painting im = prove tracticaerule for prove the red and yellow to the com= plexion and after they the bly obferving that the bly on the red make the purple and on the yellow produce the green the same method be to be underfood of the shadow but be fure to leave they clean and not too dark therefore allowance should be make in they grounds with the lightr becaute glaze they will make they darker when the cloth be of dark or bad colour there muft be frong body of colour lay all over the thadow fuch as will not fink into the ground but appear warm and litle lighter than the life to that if may be of the same forwardnel to finith as if it have be light ground therefore the bufinets of deadcolour be that we leave it always in the fame order for finithing though the colour of the cloth be quite the reverfe i in.oil colour be prove by experience that the grounds of shadow in what we call the deadcolour should be fuch as will tupport the character of the finish colour which ground muft be clean and little lighter than the finish colour litile lighter becaute the sinish of shadow be glaze and no other method but glaze can leave fuch brilliancy and beauty as they ought to have for glatthe fhadow in the first painting be not to proper as lay body of fhadow colour that be very near to the life though little lighter thefe may be glaze and touch upon when dry with great deal of cafe but if we begin the firtt painting with glaze we shall find it will rare and be of no ufe and the folid colour which be lay on it will look heavy and dull therefore all thadow and colour that be to be glaze should be do practical rulesfor do with colour of clean folid body becaufe the glaze be more lafting and have the beft effect on fuch colour remember to leave no roughnet mean tuch as will appear rough and interrupt or hurt the character of the finithing co. lour which by examine the work whilfi it be wet with foft tool or when it be dry with knife may be avoid as it will eafily take off the knot and roughelt part the lightr and white improve to all other colour for the firft lay or ground which should be always do with full pencil of fliff colour make brighter than the life becaufe it will fink little in drying the greater the body and quantity of colour and the stiffer it be lay the less it will fink every colour in drying will fink and partake in pro= pottior paintinginoil colour oj portion to its body of the colour it be lay on therefore all the light of the ffeth if not lay on light ground mult confequently change little from the life if there be no allowance make the fhadetint for the fhadow should fall into the rofe tint as the complesion grow de licare all which should be lightly united with fofc longpoint tool to the light make out the whole like mezzotinto believe the great malter veryfeldom tweeten or foften the colour but in uniting the firft lay they be very careful in preferve the brightness of they colour and therefore do not work they below the complexion for to force or keep up brilliancy in the grounds can only be do with the white red and xellow which method will make up for the deficiency of the white grounds therefore practical rule for therefore the firft painting should be leave bright and bold and the less the colour be break the better we should for bear ufe any colour that will prejudice they and be content to add what be tvant the next painting where if we fail clean rag will reffore the firft ground second colour st second painting the second painting begin with laying on the leave quantity that can be of oppy oil then wipe it almoft all off with dry piece of filk handkerchief the second painting be alfo divide into two part one be call the firft lay of the second painting which be fcumbling the light and glaze the fhadow the other finithing the complexion with the virgin tint and improve the likenels as far as can be without daub scumel be go over the light where they be to be change with the lightr tint or some other of they own colour fuch as will always clear and imdrive the complexion with fhort fliff ii pencil praciical rule for pencil but fuch part only as require it otherwife the beauty of the firft painting will be spoiled and we make double work the lightred rint improve be the very beft colour that can be for fcumble improve the complexion in general where the shadow and draw be to be correct we should do it with the shadetint by drive the colour very fiff and bare that we may the eafier retouch and change it with the finithing tint some part of the fhadow should be glaze with some of the tranfparent tha dowcolour fuch as will improve and come very near to the life but be fure not to lay on too much of it for fear of loting the hue of the firft painting the ground of which should always appear through the glaze be very careful in uniting the light and shade that they do colour mix dead and mealy for the more the light mix with the fhade the more mealy thofe shade will appear thus far the complexion be prepare and improve in order to receive the virgin ant and finithing touch the second part of the second painting be to go over the complexion with the virgin tint thefe be the colour which improve the colour to the greateft perfection both in the light and hadows this should be do in the same manner as we lay they in the second part of the firtt painting that be with the red yellow and bly blend they with delicate light touch of the tender middle tint without foften we should leave the practical rule for the tint and they grounds clean and dif= tinct and be content to leave off whilft the work be fafe and unfullied leave what be farther require for the next fitting in attempt the finithing touch before the other be dry we lofe the spirit and draw and dirty wherever we touch the painting inoil colour jor the third paintinc or pinish it be to be suppote the complesion now want very little more than few light touch therefore there will be no occation for oil begin with correct all the glaze firft where the glaze ferve as ground or under part we should determine what should be do next that we may be able to make the alteration on the part with one ftroke of the pencil by this method we preferve both the glaze and the tint but if it happen that we can not lay fuch variety of tint and finithing colour as we intend it be much better to leave off ii practical rule for off while the work be fafe and in good order becaute thofe few touch which would endanger the beauty of the colouring may eafily be do if we have patience to ftay till the colour be dry and then without oil add thofe finithing with free light flroke or the pencil belteve that rembrandt touch upon he beft picture great many time let they dry between it be this method moft certainly which give they that furpriting force and fpirst which be to inimitable find it much eafier to foften the overfrong tint when they be dry than when they be wet becaufe we may add the very colour that be want without endangering the dry work if any of the colour of the palette want to be little change to the life painting inohl colour roy life when we be painting it be much better to do it with the knife on the palette than with the pencil becaufe the knife will mix and leave it in good order for the pencil hi practical rule for of backgrounds van dyck make out the keeping in he backgrounds more from the different oppofition and harmony of the colour than from he knowledge of the claro obfcuro there be not in he picture that intelligence of light and shade which to hrik and beautiful in rembrandt van dyck general method be to be very hill and mellow and to break the colour of the ground with thofe of the drapery this will certainly produce harmony the principle of which method belong only to the art of colour but it be the knowledge of light and shade which give that furpriting force and ftrength which at firft fight we find in rembrandt work there be picture of lady painting in oil colour tog lady where he have make the ground juft light enough to thew she complexion and hair which be dark brown in the greatelt perfection the ground be wall which near to the face be lighter than the shadow of the fleth and the light diminithe of artfully in the gradation that though the part round the head be much darker yet it appear to be of the same colour with that near the fieth this method of relieve the head from the ground be better than van dyck s method where he have make the ground almoft of the fame colour with the hair and though he way of break the colour of the ground with thofe of the drapery be admirable yet there appear t near famenel as in tome of he picture where he have carry this principle to near that it be almoft imperceptible in rembrandt picture at farmouth the light practical rule for light and shade be as vifible as thofe in he print and be remarkably broad clear and hill the fhadow be very warm and thin and look as if they be paint all at once with plenty of colour which appear tranfparent which trauparency be do by glaze the dead colour the principal colour that be necet fary for painting of backgrounds in pertraiture as wall building or the like be white black indian red light and brown ochre pruffianblue and burnt umbre from which the eight principal tint be make as follow pearl be make of black white and little indian red lead of black and white mist to dark leadcolour fellow inoil colour fellow of brown ochre and white olive of

indian red darksbade of black and indian red only here the lead int ferve for the bly the feth unt mix agreeably with the lead and the murrey be very good blend colour and of great tife where the olive be too frong .. the umbre white and darkfhade will produce fine variety of ftone colour the dark thade and umbre ufe plentifully with atry oil practical rule for oil make charming warm thadowcolour all the colour should be lay with drying oil only becaute they mix and fet the better with the foftener where the mark of the trowel be of frong in the priming of the cloth that one body of colour will not be fufficient to conceal it we should lay colour to prevent it which should be dry before we begin with thofe part that we expect to finith at one painting the method of painting backgrounds be divide into two part the firft part be the work of the firft lay the second be to follow on that with the finithing tint of painting in oh colour the first lar we should always begin from the shadow fide of the head and paint the light firft from they go into the gra dation and thadow which should be do with large fiffith tool very paringly with the darkfhade and white little change with the colour that will give it more of the require hue but very near in regard to tone and ftrength leave they like mezzotinto the dark and warm fhadow should be lay before the colour that join they this we should do with the darkfhade and umbre drive with drying oil before the colour that join they becaufe if thofe colour be lay on firft they would interrupt and fpoil the tranipatency practical rule for rency which be they greateft beauty the more the firft lay be drive the eafier and better we may change it with the finithing tint therefore we may lay they with the greater body the second part be to follow directly the firft lay be wet with thofe tint that we think be moft proper to harmonife and finith with begin with the light firft and remember as we heighten and finith they we do it with warmer colour and let thofe be accompany with fine tender cold tint the lighteft part of the ground be always neareft to the fhadow fide of the head this be the part which govern all the reft and should be paint with variety of light warm clear colour which vanith and lofe they firength imperceptibly painting in ohl colour iir perceptibly in the gradation thefe should be lay with kind of cloudy touch rather than spot and we muft take care that we do not cover too much of the firtt lay but confider it as the principal colour from the light we go to the gradation and fhadow for when the light be well adapt to produce and fupport the head it be ealy to fall from they into whatever kind of fhadow we shall find moft proper for we work then foften and blend the whole with long large tool which with the firength and body of the drying oil will mell and weet all together in fuch flatter manner as will feem furprifingly finith remember the tint will fink and lofe little of they firength and beauty in drying all the grounds as wall ec should practical rule for should be finish at one painting but if they want to be change we may glaze they with little of the darkfhade and drying oil drive very bare on which with few light touch of the colour that be want we may improve they hue the dark fhadow may alfo be rrengthen and improve by glaze which should be do after the figure be near finith for fear of make they rrong remerandt grounds be rather brighter in the light and have more variety of tint than any other painter and to be fure he have obferve and juftly too that thofe tint diminish in proportion with the light therefore he shadow have but faint appearance of tint he underffood the gradation in perfection by mixing and break the firft lay of colour

nselfit will often happen for want of the life or fome defign that we can not make the fold in the firtt painting we should then leave the maff of light and fhadow in regard to the keeping of the

nature and different degree of colour or tint ufe in painting drapery firft determine how many divifion be abfolutely necelfary to make the firft lay of colour and after that the refiect and finish tint rigut method of painting drape= fie or fatin in general be to make out the whole or the firft lay with three cos jour only viz the light middle tint and thade tint for the light that the colour of all the high lightthe middle tent should be very near to the general hue of painting in oil colour the fatin exc and of a exact middle degree between the high light and the thadetint the thaderint should be dark enough for the general hue of all the thadow for which reafon it be call the thadetint we should obferve that the light should rather incline to warmith hue and the middle tint should be make of friendly working colour fuch as will always mix of clean tender coldifh hue the shadetint should be make of the same colour as the middle tint only with let light therefore this tint will alfo mix of tender clean colour it be with thefe three colour we should make out the whole like mezzotinto and we should underttand that all the beauty and character of the fold the shape attifude and principal light and thade be practical rule for all to be confider and make with thefe three colour only which should be do to we fatisfaction before we add any of the reffect or finish tint the reffect of drapery and fatin be generally production of they own and be always lighter than the fhadow on which they be find and be pro duce by light will confequently have light warm colour mix with the local colour that receive they here it will be neceffary to obferve the general I = thod and secret in manage the colour of the firlt lay and thofe of the reffect and finithing tint in the firft lay the high light should be lay with plenty of fliff colour and then fhape and foften into character with the middle tint very correctly where paintin in oil colour the gradation of the light be flow as in the large part it will be proper to lay the middle tint firft at they extremity with tool that will drive the colour and leave it paringly becaufe the light will mix and he the better upon it ext make out all the part of the fhadow with the fhadetint drive bare after this come the middle tint which fill up and ferve as the fecond light and gradation and should be manage together very nicely to character without touch any of the high light which finith the firft la reffect and finithing tint be in general the antipathy of the firft lay they will without great care porfon and dirty the colour on which they be lay and therefore should be lay with deli cate light touch without foften if it practical rule for be overdo we muft remember to res cover it with the colour of the part on which it be lay this may be do directly or when it be dry we should alfo obferve whether the reflect proceed the same colour or any other that cie method of uting they be the fame before proceed to the particular coour it will be proper to make fome obfervation on they grounds i often happen that the colour of the cloth be very improper for the ground of the drapery and when it be we should change it with thofe colour which tre think be moft proper to improve and tupport the finithing colour this Ithod of deadcolour muft confequently preferve they in they greateft luftre in deadcolour we should lay the light painting in ohl colour be and fhade in manner to as only to thew faint idea of they with regard to the shape and rounding of the figure if we have design to work from then it will be proper to make all the large and principal part in they place which should alvrays be do with colour that be clean and lighter than the intend drapery though in general of the fame hue and let the fhadow be no darker than middle tint thefe should be mix and break in tender manner and then foften with large tool to that nothing rough or uneven be leave to interrupt or hurt the charalter of the finithing colour white satin all white should be paint on white grounds lay with good body of colour practical rule for colour by reafon this colour fink more into the ground than any other there be four degree of colour in the firft lay to white fatin the firft be the fine white for the light the second the firtt tint which be make of fine white and very little ivory black mix to a exact middle degree between the white and middle tint this colour follow the white and it be with this we should fhape the light into character before we lay on any other and take care that this firtt tint appear diffindly between the white and the middle tint otherwife the beauty and character of the latin will be spoiled the middle tint should be make of white black and little indian red thefe three colour be very friendly and mix in oil colour beautiful clear colour of pearly hue which have the true brightness and warmth of the general hue of the fatin remember to allow for the red hue chang ing little to lead if there be occafion to make any part in the middle tint lighter we should do it with the firtt unt only this colour should alfo be lay paringly before the white in all the little light that happen in the middle tint and tha dow on which we should lay the white with one light touch and be fure not to cover all the part that be make with the firlt tint if we do it will fpoil the character and look like spot for want of the foften edge or border which mult be between the white and the middle fint the thadetat should be make of the same colour as the middle int but with less white to that it be dark enough for the thadow in general with practical rule for with which we should make out all the part of the hadows nicely to character this be the work of the firft lay nent come the reffect and finithing tint brown ochre mix with the colour of the light be the moft ufeful colour in general for all reffect in drapery that be produce from they own colour all accidental reffex be make with the colour of the part from which they be pro duce and the local colour that receive they there be but two reflect tint frant for drapery in general to any one particular colour one should be lighter than the middle tint the other darker thefe colour may be little change on the palette with the firft and middletint as occafion require or lightly break painting in ohl colour on the part that receive they but this laft method be not to fafe as the other the rint fufficient for blend the dark shadow to the mellow tender hue be make with the fhadetint and little brown ochre which should be lay on very paringly with foft light touch for fear of make they dull and heavy if it should be overdo we may recover it with the colour it be lay upon we often fee little bhie ufe in the firft unt of white fatin van haecken who be the beft draperypainter we ever have in england do of and fometime inftead of the blue he ufe bhieblack till he find it to be pernicious colour and be therefore oblige to ufe blue becaufe he middle tint which be make only of black and whice be of very cold that no other colour but blye would make practical rule for colder tint yet he manage thefe cold colour in all the light and middle tint to agreeably and of light and eafy be he touch that we can not help admire and may learn fomething from he though he be not to lucky in he fhadow which be generally of heavy dirty hue this be ow to the colour he ufe and the method of ule they which will always have fuch a effect when warm or dirty colour be mix with clean light one for be mix together they will form dirty colour that muft confequently appear to in the work bur if he lead or thadefint have be mise with indian red instead of the cchre and then follow with few light blend touch of the ochretint it would have leave they clean and mellow it be the want of the red hue which make the white fatin appear of often like pewter blue painting inoil colour satin bl have fatn be make of pruffianblue and fine white the beft ground for blue be white for the light and black and white for the shadow the firft lay of colour for blue be di= into three degree or tint we should firft make the middle tint of beaunful azure then mis the colour for the light about middle degree between that and where make the fhadefint dark enough for the fhadow in general all the broad light should be lay with plenty of colour and shape to character with the middle tint before we lay on any practical rule for any other colour remember the let the colour be mix the better they will appear and fland for the light of blue should be manage with as much care as thote of white fatin next be to follow with the reft of the middle tint and then make out all the fhadow the more we drive the fhadetint the better it will receive the reffect and finithing fint the fhadow should be ftrengthened and blend with ivoryblack and tome of they own colour which will mix with they into tender mellow hue the reflect be make as thofe of white fatin that with ochre and fome of the light which should be perfectly do as we intend it at one painting the fhadow when dry may be little improve if there be occafion to alfer they with paintinginoil colour the colour they be make with the pruffianblue proper to be ufe be that which look of the moft beautiful ature before it be ground and the fooner it be ufe after it be ground the better it will work and appear velvet may be paint at once the method be to make out the firft lay with the middle tint and shade tint on which we should lay the high light with light touch and finith the fhadow as we do thofe of the fatin but the nearelt imitation of velvet we can make be do by glaze which be prepare on ground or deadcolour of fuch colour as will when dry bear out and fupport the glaring colour in ii higheft perfection the nature of the glaze colour be to be of fine tranfparent quality and ufe fimply with oil only to that whatever ground i practical rule for it be lay on the whole may appear diough the beft ground for blue be make with white and white be for the high light which with the middle tint and fhadetint make out the firtt lay like merzotinto remember to make the middle tint lighter in proportion to the glaring becaufe that will make it the darker it be often neceffary to cover all but the high light with thin glaze not with plenty of in the colour but lay with let quantity than if ii be to be do once only if any of it touch the light we should wipe it off with clean rag the very high light should be improve and make of fine white and leave to dry the coiour prmanblue ground very fine with nui oil and should be lard with large nhith tool that will drive colour as occation require it of in ohl colour the latt glaze we should frengthen and finith the fhadow the greateft fault in the colour of drapery be the painting the shadow with hrong glaring colour which defiroy the beauty of the light this be not only the reverfe of art but of nature whofe beauty always diminithe in proportion with the light for this reafon we should take care to blend and foften the fhadow with fuch friendly colour as will agree with they local character and obicurity here we may obferve that glaze the middle tint which be make of black and white will not produce colour to blue as if it have be prepare with pruffianblue and white yet this colour will preserve the beauty of the light in the higheft perfection by reafon of its tender obicure hue when the blueness of the other practical rule for would only diminith they this method of glaze the blue be the general rule for all glaze when we be glaze blue the light may be glaze with ultramarine though all the other part be do with prulfian blue this method fave great quantity of that valuable colour and anfiver we purpofe as well as if it have all be do with ultramarine thowgh this general method of painting latin be to make the firtt lay of colour with three degree of tint yet we should underfland in ule they that they produce two more for the mixing of two diffcrent colour together on the cloch will make another of middle tint between they to it be with the light and middle tint and with the middle and shade= painting in ohl colour the firft anfwer to the firft sint in white fatin and the laft will consequently be fort of gradate or halfshade if the light and middle tint mix to beautiful clean colour of middle hue between both there will be no occafion for colour to go between they as in the blue fatin but if in mixing they produce tint incline to dirty warm hue then there muft be another find of fympathizing nature which should he lay between they in order to preferve the beauty of the light as the firft tint in the white fatin for if it be not of the red in the middle tint would certainly dirty and fpoil the whire ir be highly necelfary to underlland thefe principle of the firft lay of colour in practical rule for in order to have perfect knowledge of the general rule of colour on which the principle of colour depend scarlet and crimsonn ad licti yellowred make of light cchre lightr and white be the proper ground for fearlet the shadow be indian red and in the dark part mix with very little black the second painting should be little fighter than we intend the finithing colour in proportion to the glaze which will make it darker the high light be vermition and white for fatin velvet and cloth the miditle be vermition and white with tef in oil colour litle lake or indian red the shadetint be make with indian red and lake with the addition of little black in the darkeft fhadow the difference between fearlet and crimfon be that the high light of crimfon be whiter and the middle tint be make darker they reflect be make with lightr and vermilion the high light should be lay and manage in the fame manner as thofe of the blue for fear of dirty they and fometime they require to be touch over the fecond time before we glaze they the more the colour of the second painting be drive the eafier and better they may be manage to character but the high light should have good body of colour and be leave with delicate light touch after it be well dry we should linith with glaze the whole with fine lake and im = prove the reflect and thadow rememshe practical rule for ber that the fearlet require but very thin glaring and it be better to glaze the crimfon twice over than lay too much at one painting pinecolour there be two different method of painting pink colour one be by glazing the other be do with body of co= lour at one painting the same grounds do for both which should be whitifh colour incline to yellow for the light and indian red lake and white for the thadow the second painting for the glaring method be do with the fame colour and little vermilion for the reffect and panting in ohl colour tas and vermition and white for the high light when it be dry we should glaze it with fine lake and then break and foften the fhadow into character and harmony liredly the other method to make the high light with carmine and white the middle tint with lake white and little carmine and the shadow with lake and indianre with little vermilion for the reffect but remember the fhadow will require to be break with fome tender oblcure kirnt tellow the ground for yellow should be yellowith white for the light and mixture of the ochre for the fhadow there practical rule for there be the fame number of tint in the yellow as there be in the white fatin the method of ufe they be the very fame the light be make with king yellow ground with clean good drying oil the firft tint be light ochre change with little of the pearl tint make with the dark fhade and white which should be lay and manage as the firft fint in white fatin the middle tint mixture of the light and brown ochre foften with the pearl tint the shadetint be make with brown pink and brown ochre thefe belong to the firft lay the reffect be light ochre and fometime in the warmelt part mix with little lightr the fhadow be ftrengthened with brown pink and burnt umbre these colour well manage will pro paintinginoil colour yellow very like van dyck but if we leave out the king yellow which be in the high light only then it will be one of lely favourite yellow green the proper ground for green be lightyellow green which be make of light ochre little white and pruffianblue for the light and the ochre brown pink and pruffianblue for the shadow the fineff green we have for drapery make of king yellew pruffianblue and brown pink the high light be king yellow and very little pruffianblue the middle tint have more pruffianblue and the fhadetint be make with some of the middle tint brown pink and nore practical rule for more pruffianblue but the darkeft fhadow be brown pink and little pruffianblue the light and middle tint should be manage in the fame manner as thofe of the bly the fhade tint should be keep entirely from the light becaufe the brown pink that be in will in mixing dirty they as the black do thofe of the bly remember to allow for they drying little darker and that the king s yellow should be ground with good drying oil for the longer it be drying the more it will change and grow darker and the fooner it be ufe the better it will fland it be proper to have two fort of king yellowone to be very light which will do beft for the high light of relvet changeable paintingnoil colour colour be make with four principal tint viz the high light middle tint shade tint and reflecting tint the greatelf art lie in find the exact colour of the middle tint becaute it have more of the general hue of the filk than any of the other the shadetint be of the fame hue with the middle tint though it be dark enough for the fhadow the high light though often very different from the middle tint should be of clean friendlyworking colour that will in mixing with it produce tint of clean fympathizing hue the method of painting filk be to make out the fold with the fhade tint and practical rule for and then fill they up in the light with the middle tint this be the firft lay which should be do to we fatisfaction before we add any other colour and the hiffer the middle tint be ute the better the high light may be lay upon the reffecdingunt falls generally upon the gradate halffhade and should be lay with tender touch paringly for fear of fpoiling the firft lay this method of painting antwer to all coloured filk as well as changeable with this difference only that the plain colour require not of much art in matching the tint as the changeable do the laft part of the work be the finithing and rrengthening the fhadow with a obfcure int little incline to mellowith hue tuch as will not carch the eye and interrupt the beauty of the light black paintinginoil colour t beft ground for black be lightred for the light and indian red and little black for the shadow the finithing colour be for the light black white and little lake the middle tint have let white and more lake and black the fhadetint be make of a equal quantity of lake and brown pink with very little black the method of painting black be very different from that of other colour for as the principal thing in they be to leave they light clean and brilliant of in black it be to keep the fhadow clear and tranfparent therefore we should begin with the shadetint and glaze over all the shadow practical rule for dow with it next lay in the darkeft lhadow with black and little of the thadetinr very corredly after that fill up the whole breadth of light with the middle tint only all which should be do exactly to the character of the fatin exc and then finish with the high light here we may obferve the ground be red will bear out and fupport the red which be ufe in the

they belong io the greateff fecret in deadcolour to find the two colour which ferve for the ground of the shadow in general the thy except and the method of ufe they ohl colour with the light the firft of which be the darkfhade with litile lake in it the other colour be only burnt umbre thefe should be little change to the natural hue of the object and then lay and drive with drying oil in the

both thefe colour mix and fympathize agreeably with all the light but should be lay before they when the landlcape be defign begin with the sky which should be lay with god body of colour and leave with refemblance of the principal cloud this we should do more in the manner of ni ractical rule for claro obicuro than with finithing cojour the whiter it be leave the better it will hear out and fupport they the diftance should be make out faint and obfcurely with the darkfhade and fome of they light in different degree and lay of as beft to find and shew they principal part as we come more into the middle group we fall by degree into the burnt umbre in the hade all the grounds of the tree should be lay or rub in enough only to leave a idea of they thape and fhadow faintly the ground of they fhadow muft be clean and lighter than they finithing colour fuch as will tupport they character and feem eaty to finiffi on in painting the light it be better to incline more to the middle tint than to the very high light and obferve to leave they painting in oil colour with fufficient body of clean colour which will receive and preferve the finifh colour the better all which may be do with few tint after this go over the whole with the fweetener very lightly which will foften and mix the colour agreeably for finifh praciical rule for second painting begin with the sky and lay in all the azure and colour of the horizon then foften they after that lay in the general unt of the cloud and finith on it with the high light and the other tint that be want with light tender touch then foften the whole with the weetener very lighily remember the finish of the tky should be do all at one painting becaufe the tender character of the cloud will not do of well as when the whole be wet obferve that the riffer the arure and colour of the horizon be lay the better the cloud may be paint upon they the greatelt diftance be chieffy make with paintinginoil colour t the colour of the lky and as they grow nearer and darker we should glaze and fcumble the part very thin with fuch glaze fhadowcolour as come neareft to the general hue of the group the object be in this glaze should be of darkifh hue and the firtt painting or deadcolour should be feen through it dirinetly on this lay or ground we should add the finithing colour now tuppof this glaze ground be properly adapt to the object and place it will be eafy to find the other colour which be want for the light and finithing of the fame but in lay they we mult take great care that we do not fpoil the glaze therefore we should be very exact in prepare thofe colour on the palette and then be fure to lay they with ight free touch before m practical rule for before proceed any farther it will be proper to fay fomething of the moft ufeful glaze colour lake terraverte pruffianblue and brown pink be the four principal the more we manage they like indian ink and the more diffint we leave they the better they tranfparent beauty will fland and appear provide we do it with good drying oil after thefe four glaze colour burnt umbre be very good glaring warm brown and of great ufe in the break grounds and neareft part but the moft agreeable colour for the darkeft thadow be the darkfhade improve with lake it be fine warm hade when it be drive with drying oil no colour in the world be to fweet and fympathiting it mix harmonioutly with all the light as well as the thadow and be charming colour paintinginoil colour in the trunk and body of tree and in all kind of building we should make out all the ground of the object with fuch glaze fhadowcolour as feem neareft to the natural hue of the object in that fituation but as the principal glaze colour themfelves be often too firong and glaring they should therefore be little change and foften with fuch colour as be of near retemblance to themfelves and the object thus if it be in the diftance the terraverte and azure which be they principal glaze colour may be improve and make lighter with fome of the fky tint and as the diftance come nearer with the purple fis we get more into the middle group the terraverte and pruffianblue may be change with some of the green tint fuch as be make without white m practical rule for white for white be the deftruction of all glaze colour as we approach the firft group there be let occafion for change they but the foreground and its objelt require all the arength and force of glaze which the colour be capable of produce after this glaze ground we should follow with firengthening the fame in the thadow and darkeft place in fuch manner as will feem eaty to finith which be the firft lay of the second painting the colour that come next for finishing be in the degree of middle tint thefe should be carefully lay over the greateff breadth of light in fuch manner as not to fpoil and cover too much of the glaze do it with good body of the colour as fliff as the pencil can agreeably manage painting inole colour t to character remember the colour of the middle tint should be of clean beautiful hue accord to thefe method think it will be eaty to finith all the second painting as we work down from the fky through the middle group as we come to the firft group where all the object should appear perfectly finith we should finith they under or moft diftant part before we paint any of the other which appear nearer oblefye this Ithod down to the laft and neareft object of the picture and where it of happen that painting one tree over another do not pleafe forbear the second until the firft be dry thin near tree of different colour will do better if we let the under part dry before we add the finithing colour the practical rule for the third and last painting if oil be neceffary lay the leave quantity that can be which should be do with rumptool or pencil proportion to the place that be to be oil to that we may oil no more than be want then wipe the whole place that be oil with piece of filk handkerchief by this Ithod we leave no more oil than be proper for we purpofe when we be go to finith any object s we should remember to ule great variety of tint very near of the same colour but moft of all when we be finithing tree this give richness to the colour and produce harmony the green paintinginoil colour will fade and grow darker therefore it be highly neceffary to improve and force they by exaggerating the light and make a allowance in ule they to much the lighter for the fame reafon we should take great care that we do not overcharge and fpoil the beauty of the glaze for if we do it will be dull and heavy and will confequently grow darker the method for painting near tree be to make the firft lay very near to nature though not quite of dark but more in the degree of middle tint and follow it with frengthening the fhadow and improve the middle tint and laft of all lay the high light and finithing colour but all this can not be do as it should be at one painting therefore the beft way be to do no more than the firtt lay with practical rule for with the faint fhadow and leave it to dry then begin with improve the middle tint and fhadow and let they dry the third and laft work be add all the light and finithing colour in the beft manner we be able this method of leave the firtt and second part to dry feparately not only make the whole much ealier and more agreeable but leave the colour in the greateft perfection becaufe moft of the work may be do with fcumbling and glaze and fome part without oil the light alfo may be lay with better body of colour which will not be mix and fpoil with the wet ground what have faid of tree anfwer the tame to all kind of thrub and buthe the painting in ohl colour figure in landlcape be the laft work of the picture thofe in the foreground should be do firft and thofe in the diftance next for after the figure in the firft and fartheft group be paint it will be much eafier to find the proportion of thofe in the middle part of the picture and we should obferve that the fhadow of the figure should be of the same hue or colour with thofe of the group or place they be in epitome orit .. a very valuable work now

painting it afford to the painter the material of light which he diftribute in fuch manner as to bring he object together to give they relict and that magic which be the glory of he art forthefe reafon my attention will be confine to this colour the firft white which be difcover and on white pigment indeed the principal one yet know be extract from lead the danger of the process and the dreadful diftemper with which thofe employ in it be often feize have not yet lead to the difcovery of another white less anx we about the danger of the artiff than the perfection of the art they have vanrie the preparation to render the colour let liable to change fience the different kind of white viz white of crem in auffria white lead in shell and white ceruffe bur every perfon converfant in colour know that the foundation of all thefe be the cal of lead more or let pure or more or less load with gas that they all participate of this metallic fubftance will indeed be evident from the follow experiment which demon ftrate and determine the alterability of colour by phlogiflic vapour pour onn . whiite pigment pour into large glat bottle of liver of fulphur on bafis quantity of qlkali fix or volatile it make no difference add fome drop of diftil vinegar and cover the mouth of the bottle with piece of pafteboard cut to its lize on which difpot different fample of crem of white lead and of ceruffe in oil and in water place another ring of pafieboard over the firft and tie above all piece of bladder round the neck of the hottle with firong packthread it be evident that in this operation take ad= vantage of the means which chemiftry offer to produce great quantiry of phlo= giftic vapour to accomplith inflantane oully the effect of many year and in few word to apply to the colour the very fame vapour to thich picture be neceffarily expofe only more accumulate and concentrate fay the same va= in pour on whitepigment for it be fully eftabliffied that the smoke of candle animal exhalation of all kind alkalefcent odour the electric effluvia and even light furnifh continually quantity more orless of matter not only analogous but identically the fame with the vapour of vitriolic acid mix with fulphur ir it happen that the fample of colour be fenlibly alter by the phlogiftic vanpour then we may conclude with certainty that the material of which the colour be compote bear great affinity to that vapour and fince it be not poffible to preferve they entirely from it in anyfituation that they will be more or let affect with it accord to the time and valiety of circumstance after come minutesconfinuance in this vapour on whiite pigment vapour examine the fample of colour fubmit to ius infinence and find they wholly alter the ceruffe and the white lead both in water and oil be change into black and the white of crem into brownith black and hence thofe colour be bad and ought to be abandon they may indeed be defend in fome meature by varnith but this only retard for time the contact of the phlogiffic vapour for as the varnish lofe ii humidity it open a infinite number of paffage to this fubtile find after have afcertain the inrlab lity of the white in common ufe make leveral attempt to dilcover fuch as would prove more lat and though many of thefe attempt be without effect thail give fuccinet account of the whole which may fave great deal of trouble to thofe on white picment who with to travel over the fame field there be three condition effential to good colour in painting first that it dilute eafily and take body both with oil and with mucilage or at leave with the one or the other of thefe fubltance circumftance which depend on certain degree of affinity where this affinity be too flrong diffelution enfue the colour be extinguished in the new compolition and the mat become more or let tranfparent or elfe the fudden reaction abforb the fluid and leave only dry fubltance which can never again be foften but if the be too weak the particle of colour fcarcely fuspended in the ffuid and etei on whiite pigment they appear on the canval like fand which nothing can fix or unite the second condition be that the material of which colour be compote do not bear too near a affinity with the phlogiffic vapour the experiment to which fubmit white from lead be the infallible means of afcertaining the quality of colour in this respect without wait for the low impreffion of time third condition equally effential be that the colour body be not volgtile that it be not connect with fubftance of weak texture fufceptible of pontaneous degeneracy this confi deration exclude the greater part of fubstance which have receive they tint front vegetable wtitte pigmen .. organization at leave it make impoffible to incorporate they finer part with combination more folid after thefe reflection my refearch be direct firll to the five pure earth next to the metallic earth either pure of precipitate by pruffian alkalit wen= have difcover fixth earth which call eburne and which after other exberiment think of apply to the purpofe of painting but foon perceived that it would have the fame fault with other kind of earth and befide that it could not be obtain but at very confiderable expence the five pure eaith poffel fixity in very great degree and at the same time no the article prussianelue in the materin pictoria a on white pigment be little affect by the phlogiftic vapour but they refufe to unite with oil or mu cilage and the white be totally extinguith when they be ground with thofe liquid make feveral attempt on earth of alum not only becaufe beaume recommend the ufe of it in painting and becaufe it enter into the compofition of pruffianblue but alfo becaufe it be chief ingredient in ochre and other earth of that nature which indicate that it would unite in certain degree with dilut liquor notwithllanding in whatever manner treat it it would not yield white but one will be less furprifed at this want of fuccess when it be confider that in the ochre and pruffianblue the earth from alum be only the vehicle of the colour body whereas here it be the colour itfelf to be convinced of the truth of this obferon white picment it be only neceffary to mix equal part of this earth or even of clay not coloured with ceruffe or any other white the mixture will be fufceptible of be ground in oil or in gum without be extinguithed it will eafily unite with any coloured fubltance and be pro ductive of no bad confequence to the pure earth nature and art prefent to we confiderable number of carthy compofition fufficiently white for the purpofe of painting fuch as the jaspek white the feldspat white the schirl white exc but all thefe fubltance in all the trial make have the fault which have al ready mention and oiginating from the fame caufe they want fix colouring body which would not change on white pigmennt when pulverize nor be extinguished when dilnt the ultramarine blue which be ex= trat from the blue jafper and know by the name of lapis lazuli feem at firft view to warrant the poftibility of appropriating to painting all the opague halfvitrify compofition of the nature of jatper prepossess with this idea conceive the hope of produce true white lapis but foon perceive that the experiment confirm the principle which have lay down from my obtervation on pure earth fince it be not the fubitance peculiar to the jafper which conftitute the uhramarine blue but the metallic subftance which accidentally colour this particular kind of jafper in whiiie pigment the fame manner art in this imita= tion of nature should have for its object to give permanent bafe to colour al ready form to fix it without alter and to augment perhaps its plendour and its intenfity without attempt to produce colour in except from earthy and metallic falt all thofe of which the acid be not completely faturate which would eafily attract the moifture of the air or which would be eafily diffolve you have but very small number to make experis ment on the natural and artificial selenite give with oil pafte without colour and talt fomewhat like honey it be white be better preferve with gum but even in this cafe it refemble femitranfparent dap on white pigment the natural or regenerate spat pe= rant the moft likely fall to produce white as it be of all other the moft difficult to diffolve it appear after to be very fine white but be fcarcely touch with oil when it become grey and femitranfparent the mucilage alter if alfo although less dif cernibly and it do not even refume its white colour after it become dry on the canvais the fame be the cafe with the calcireous borax form by the folution of borax in lime water its white be completely extinguithed with oil let of with gum but it harden of inflantaneoully with the latter that it can not be dilut again ifland cryfial or refract spar wiiite pigment tartar obtain by cal quicklime into boiling folution of cream of tartar be affect with oil in the fame manner as felenite but with mucilaginous water it give pretty good white only poffeff of fome reflection and appear like plafter it apply very well to the canval and relift the phlogiftic vapour accord to webe in he work intitle fabriken und kunste publifh in the white call in germany eremeser wiess be nothing but the vitriol of lead prepare by diffolve lead in nitrous acid and precipirate it in vitriolic acid and form it afterwards into folid tablet by means of guin water it be certain that this refemble in no manner the white call in france the white of crem at leave never find that on whiite pigment that it could be diffeive in vinegar but try the white prepare in .. weben manner and the refult be the fame as above that it turn it black the vitricl of lead and bismuth atter more fpeedily than the calce of thofe I tal and thus with the exception of calcarsous tartar which may be of fome ute in watercolour the beft earthy falt on which have make experiment may all or the moft of they give bafe to some colour but can not conftitute by themfelves colour ufeful in painting ad or the firteen know metallic fubfance there be nine which yreld white calce viz filver mercury lead tin atimony bifmuth zinc artenic manganefc of on white pigment thefe nine fubllance we may pat over filver and mercury becaute though they yield very fine white precipitate by means of pure dry vegetable alkali yet it be foon alter when expofe to the air that from filver into black and that from mercury into yellow ir be well know that lead give very good white and one which unite eafily with oil or fize but that it be extremely liable to change have be my principal object to prove and the experiment have make place it beyond contradiction shall only add that if there be reparation able to correct this fault it should be the precipitation of the earth of this metal from a acctous folution by the pruffian alkali but the white which refult from this preparation become fenfibly on wihite pigment libly brownish when it be expofe fer minute only to the phlogiffic vapour ir would be therefore unreafonable to perfevere in the ufe of this fubllance or to with to render it fix fince the change which it undergoe do not alter ii nature and the indeftructible order of ii affinity the calx of fin be ealily apply to any purpofe and experience no change from the concentrate phlogiffic vapour thefe confideration induce I to endeavour to obtain this calx perfectly white and here follow the refull of my experimalacca tin calcine give pretty white calx but whatever attention pay to take off the red furface which the violence of the fire occafion take always shade of grey when it white picment dilut tin calcine by nitre in fu tion give tarnifh and

falt which make the particle remain on the filter to be incapable of be pulverize gummy femitranfparent and of yellowith hy it be neceitary to diluie it in boiling water and afterwards to calcine the fediment flighily when it have have sufficient time to fettle have on wtiite pigment have employ the beft malacca tin and rectify nitrous acid and have try the calcination after the manner of meyer it form very white parkling calx which remain in the lilter in the con= fiftency of jelly . —meanwhile obferve that it be always little yellow by mixture of portion of earth which take during the operation the colour of tur= peth mineral very fine white calx be make from antimony calcine with nitre in fution but the earth of this femimetal mult be place in the number of thofe which combine too ealily with the phlogiftic vapour diaphoretic anrimony ground in oil take in ten minute colour like fulphur in my phlogiftic apparatus property of bismuth to give fim white on wiiite pigment calx call magiffery or white paint ufe by the lady be well know it be eafily prepare fince it be only neceffary to diffolve the bifmuth in nitrous acid and precipitate it by means of water it dilute perfectly in oil and mucilage .but this colour ought to be reject as the moft alterable by the phlogiftic vapour it become completely black in ten minute in my apparatus and this fact be prove from what happen to perfon who ule this colour when they be expofe to the vapour of fulphur garlic or any putrid fubllance furnifh by all the proceff of calcination and precipitation pretty white calx when it be pure and feparate the fame will happen to perfon drink falt water and bathing in the fea as be well know at margate from x on wwhlle pigment from iron otherwife the preparation of vitriol of zine will become yellow when expote to the arr have precipitate it from this folution by means of limewater and by caultic and effervelcent alkali have calcine this femimetal alone and with nitre and in all thefe operation have obtain a earthy fubftance of different degree of whitenel which after it be dry and prepare mix readily with oil and mucilage without loting its colour and which experience no fentible change when ea pote to the phlogiffic vapour these valuable property the chief object of my refearch engage I to my experiment to determine at once the moff economical procet and the moft advantageous and infallible preparation .thefe attempt have convince oh whilik iigment I that the calcination of this lemimetal alone in crucible place hofizontally on the corner of reverberat ing furnace give the pureft the whitelt and the leave reducible cal and that to make a excellent colour it be fufficient to teparate with water the part unburned and grind it with little of the earth of alum or chalk to give it body linc precipitate by pruffian alkali even in diftil vinegar retain always fhade of yellow do not unite to well in oil and take femitranfparent confiffence like cheefe arsenic extinguithe much let in dilut than one would believe from its faline nature it preferve its colour beft in guim water and it be remarkable that infead of turn black in the phlogiflic vert whlle pigment giftic vapour it take very diftinct fhade of yellow this property be fufficiently fingular and conflant to furnish new method of analyf arfenic to as to know it and this alteration of colour make it of no ufe in painting although its deleterious quality might alone pre= vent the practice the femimetal know by the name of manganese give allo white calx have at firft great hope from this colour as contrary to all thofe extract from the other meial it become white by the phlogiffic vapour there remain therefore but one difficulty to overcome vit to feparate from the manganefe the portion of iron which it afually contain and which infallibly make the earth little yellow to accomplith this in the cheapeft manner fubmit the black ore on white pigment of manganele to long calcination to render its iron infoluble afterward apply vinegar to it after the example of de la peyroufe and in precipitate the folution by alkall cafily obtain pure white precipitate but foon perceive that the facility with which colour body lofe its phlogifton be no lef a inconvenience than that of attract it and productive of the fame alteration the white of manganefe become very foon yellow when expote to the air and this be not to be afcribe to the iron contain in it fince neither the gall or pruffian alkali have difcover any of it in the folution this fubliance therefore can be of no ufe in produce white colour for painting place on whiite pigment place wben the experiment be make in my apparatus piece of cloth on which be lay the white of calcarewe tartar different preparation of white from tin and zinc in oil and water and allow they to continue expote to the phlogiffic vapour during the fit of the academ if they be not alter they fuperiority over the white in ufe would be fufficiently eftablifh the fitting continue for near a hour and the bottle have be open all the colour continue to have the fame hade which they have before can therefore recommend to painter thofe three white and particularly that of the preparation of which be expofe to less variation the fhade more lively and uniform and moreover it be dijon sit on white pigment for all purpofe and perhaps procure at lef expence will affert farther that it may be procure in fufficient quantity to fupply the place of ceruife in every branch of the art even in interior houlepaintwould recommend it less with view of add new fplendor to this kind of ornament than for the fafety of thofe who be employ in and perhaps for the fafety of thofe who inhabit houfe ornament in this manner bur without be too fanguine al though the procel in the preparation be timplify in proportion to the demand as be ufually the cafe yet there be reafon would it not anfwer the purpofe of a ingenious colourman to prepare and yend this pirment on white pigment to apprehend that the low price of canruffe will always give it the preference in houfe painting with regard to thofe who apply colour to nobler purpofe they will not helitate to employ the white of am afture that four livre be pay for pound of white of crem and believe the white in question prepared in the manner which have point ed out might be fold for fix ni courtor connect with the laboratory of the academy have already declare that it be ufe in houfepain let in regard to its unalterability than its folubility and this may be the more readily believe as the fower of into many compofition of the apothecary al courtor have alfo arrive at the art of give more body to this white which the painter feem to defire and of on white pigment make it bear comparifon with white lead erther in water or oil the only fault find with it be it be drying too llowly when ufe in oil but fome experiment which have make incline I to believe that this fault may be eafily remedy or greatly correct by give it more body at any rate it may be render ficcative at pleature by add little vitriol of zine white coppera hlightly calcine painter already know the propertie of this fall but perhaps they do not know that it mix with the white of better than with any other colour for the reafon that they have chemically the same bafe it be prepare by depriving the white coppera of that fmall portion of iron which would render it yellow which be eafily do by digefting onn wiiite picment ing folution of it on the filing of tinc mikture of this falt thus prepare may be make on the palette which will caufe no alteration in the colour but be productive of great effect in very fmall quantity
