in ii cerious art of painting in oil and watercolour have ever be admire and approve as mafterpiece of other art and science wherein art of exactly imitate nature that motion only feem to be want and many fuch rare piece have be paint in both way oil and watercolour that they have at the firft blush deceive the eye of the curious who have take they for real living being and though the eye and hafnd be mainly require herein the one to direct and the other to operate yet the mind or imaginatiopn muft furnifh cut great of the curiofity have idea or the true shape of thing always in readinet this can not be dene haftily but muft be do by fteady prac tice and curious obfervation and in this under take for painting in oil be to prepare yourfelf with fuirable material in the firft place you muft take care to get good pencil of all size preportionable to you work pallet or board to lay you colcur on whilft you be ufe they a eafle to place yeu cloth fainupon frame on or againft mcllrick or stay make of weod not subject to hend pain tin about fard long at one end tye ball of cottof with leather over it of that with you left hand hold it againf the work you may fupport you right arm with it whilft you be work the next thing to be confider to the cloth and the outlihe draw thereon be the prepare you colour which in oilpainting muft be with linfeeoil unless for line and then walnutoil be great deal better for it will not turn yellow as the other in time will when mix with curious white you muft grind you colour on stone with muller ill they be as fine as butter or you may have they in bladder at the colourshop atid fome you mix a you pallet with you palletknife never put on you pallet more than you think you shall ufe for they will ikin over and poil which might be prevent by put they under water to clean you pencil dip they in oil of turpentine and fqueeze they between you finger in tin pan make for that purpofe where you generally lay they and you colour that be in bladder the colour be in number seven viz whire black red green fellow blue and brown the white white lead and flake white the black seacole black ivory elack lampblack and eorth of collen the red red lead vermilion lake indian red and ornatto the green terveret verditer and verdegrife the yellow apruce oaker pink or fiment and mallicot the bluc shmait and ultramarine the erowns umber spa ish brown burnt oker thefe be the chief to be lay in oil but lvory spruce oker and umber muft be burnt before they be ground and as fir malticor vermilion ultrantarine stial erpiment you may temper they on you pallet without grind ing bur for the mixing and temper you colour to make violet take iudico whice lead and lake mix they well and thhe more or let of each quantity will make the colour deeper or lighter to make lead colour aac of white and indico pain tin to make scarlet take lake red lead and fmall quantity of vermilion to make flame colour take red lead and mafticot heighten with white to make light green take pink and smalt as you fee occafion lighten it with white to make purple take spanmh brown indico and white to make bay colour mix spanish brown and white to make murry colour mix lake and white and of by often temper colour and practice you may find out thouland tint but in the ufe they be cautious of take too much oil for which reafon thofe who would have they piece keep freth make ufe of as little oil can and keep they colour the firmer by mix ing with they little oil of spike which foon eva porate but ferve to make they run the berter and render they the more pliable in work ano the caufe of colour lofe they beauty be when the painter work they too much in mixing they for be jumble together they change and corrupt one another and take away the vivacity therefore you muft be careful to ufe they properly and lay the colour each in its place without mingling they too much with the pencil or bruth alfo not to temper adverfe colour together as black with other particularly smokeblack but to ufe they apart as much as poffible and when you would give the more force to you work you should stay till it be dry to touch it over again with colour that will not kill the firft lay on in the mean time they ought to learn and qualify themfelves with the proportion and connection of the part of draw as well as the colour and how to fix the sketch or outline and often to view and examine exquifite original and all the infenfibility and sweetneffe of the art which you will artain by view the work of the kilful mafter rather than by practice alone after you have do some part of you piece fet it by for fome time without look on it then view it again by which mean you may chance to difcover fome fault of pain ti .. error or excellency of you work which you may either mend avoid or advance accord to you skill and difcretion it will be in vain for you concinually to pore over you work and dull you genius in fpite of nature and you prefent inclination general rule for painting in wa col we choofe thofe subject that be noble and beautiful even in the atmoff degree of perfection that have fomething of magnanimity and greatness in they be the true

put the quantity of the top of yeu humb of gumarabick and half that quanticy of sugarcandy this faft prevent the colour from feal when dry which they commonly do without it and when the vellum paper be greaty mix little of the gall of a ox carp or eel especially of this laft it will give they lutre and vivaciry not natural to they if yeu ufe sea shell you muft firff foak they for twis c pa in in or three day in water then clean they well in hor water to clear they of certain salt which poil the colour when you have do this pour cumwater into the shell together with the colour you ufe and temper they with you finger till the whole be very fine if you find you colour too hard leave it to foften in the shell before you mix it then when mixfet it to dry and to do by all except the irisgreen and sapgreen and gamboge which muft be temper with water only but ultramarine lake and spanish brown muft be more gum than other colour to underfland when you colour be fufficiently gum you need only make stroke with you temper colour upon you hand which will immediately dry if they break and fcale they be too much gummand if they rub off by paff you finger acrot they they be not gummenough take care alfo that you put not in too much for it will have a hard and effect you colour will be glutinous and stick ing good pencil be of great importance to the work to choofe which wet they little and twirl they on you finger if they keep they point they be good but if they break into many point of different length they be good for nothing when tey be too tharppoint with only four or five hair stick out beyend the reft you may blunt they carefully with pair of sciffer or light candle it will be proper to have variety of size have poke of colour and pencil shall next shew how they be to be ufe firft of all if you would paint flethor drapery or aught elfe you muft begin by skerching or draw with large bold yet clear stroke endeavour alfo to drow you colour into each other that no line of separation may be feen between they and foften you stroke with the colour on each hand of they of as to be equally blend with and confound into each other some plice be touchall over alike yet foas when it be finish you may perceive the vellum paper coc in pa in in in feveral place quite through the work which be indeed too flight way and should rather be call wath than painting the beft way be as follow lay full flat ground all over where you fleth or drapery gc be to be of the colour you defign it which be do you will find much eafier to be wring upon and may be either heighten or deepen at pleafure take special care that when you temper or mix you colour with pure water and when you perceive they have loft they gum by often put water therein you temper with gum water till you find they be in good order again for either complexion or garment that you mix they well with you finger and not let they be too aterith likewife preferve all you colour from duft in landlkip it be impoftible to expret the various example they be innumerable be as many as there be painter and fancy therefore not to be comprife within rule but for the general obferve thefe which follow always begin with the sky sunbeam or lighteff part firft next thofe beam that be yellowith next the blueness of the sky work you sky downwards towards the horizon fainter and fainter as it draw nearer and nearer the earth except in the tempeftuous sky work the top of mountain far remote to faint that they may appear loft in the air makelow place and fuch as be near the round of the colour of the earth of darkyellowith brown or green the next to they of light green and of fucceffively as they lofe in diftance make they abate in colour do not make any thing that appear at diftance perfect by expreffing any particular sign or token that it have but express it as weakly and faintly as it appear to the eye always place light againft dark and dark againt light by which mean you may extend the prospect as if very far off let all the shadowslofe they force as they remove from the eye always make the grongeff shadow neareft to hand you need of paint inc. need not be over curious in the firft work but rather ain at good free and bold lmitation of nature than a extreme neat fet or silf way be not difecurage it the roughness of you colour for you may work that down and touch it by degree with the other shadow though you do not do it at the firft after this weet and heighten you shadow by degree accord as the light fall then touch it in fome place with arong touch and bring you werk up together in thefe place io equal roundness and strength not finifh any part before the other but view and work all the part curioutly ke as if all the picture be paint at once take notice that sky water tree plant flower and ground be all to be finithd before the fizure thefe inftruction lay down may be of particular efe when you work after frint where you have nothing before you but black and white but there be this difference between painting in water and in oil that in the laft the colour be take off from the pallet juft as they appear to you to that in this cafe you have nothing to confult but tuch light and fuch chade now it be fer from be the fame in watercolour where often it happen thit the laft colcure you lay on do not preferve ii colour but partake of the colour beneath or rather the one and the other compofe new one to form the efleit you aim at for alino it be white green carmine blue orpinent befter and the like which form yeaur colour they never thelefs would not produce it if you mix they toge the for it be by proceed from one to ine other that you can fuccce and wheti you copy picture of this kind you muft take you own tate to produce the effect without have feen how it be do you muft be conjurer at leave to quet at the order and method it be do in and take this obfervytion by the way that watercolour always dry lighter than when lay on and oil darker in fome way of painting in water you have no lfe of white to otmee print white colour but make the ground of the vellum or paper oc ferve to raife they figure in which cafe the light appear bright in proportion to the depth and strength of the colour of the figure or you may before you go to werk give the vellum paper coc light wath with white lead weil prepared and purify which have pretty effect by reafon of the white run up in work which foften the shadow and make they look pleaf to lay on meztitinto print on glass undertake this curioutly lay the print hatin warm water of the fineft and thineff paper for that which be rough and thick will not do near to well if at all let they foak well and you glat the beft white flint go over it with venice turpentine pread thin with pliable knife

print if they will not bear the colour do they over with fome thin starch which will take off the greafinet of the printing and make the colour run fmooth in colour you muft be sure to leave the light which have two advantage viz if the light be leave on this occafion the whiteness of the paper ferve inflead of the fe of white paint which be very heavy colour and if not finely preparwill turn black and would rather confound thote that have be prescribe to be lay on than do they any service but the colour as will be direct where there be no white lay on will thine agreeably into the whice of the paper be more particular in this becaufe fome perfon will lay ablue flower all over with one colour thoughit be thick enough to hide both the light and the shade of the print and then it will look like peny picture where there be nothing but jumble of red bly and green but this avoid and be fure you leave you light broad and frumble the light into the shade of every colour but leave the middle of the light open on the papers for as the paper be white of itfelf it make beautiful hleightening and roundness in painting the leave of tree plant and iferb regard muft be have to the colour of the
