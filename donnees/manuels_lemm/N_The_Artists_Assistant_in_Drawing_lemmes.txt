the artist assistant in draw perspective etch engrave mezzotinto  scrape painting on glass in crayon in water  colour and on silk and satin contain the easiest and most comprehensive rule for the attainment of those truly useful and polite art methodically digest and adapt to the capacity of young beginner illustrate with suitabie example engrave on copper the third edition improve london print for robert sayer map and print  seller  in fleet  street and john smith  as the act direct january have ever be the misfortune of those who have prosessed to lay down rule for the at tainment of any art or science to leave they envelop with difficulty which if not ut terly insuperable at leal dilcourage the learner from proceed in study which he can have little hope will ever reward he pursuit from hence we may reasonably infer that the say professor be totally unacquainted if not with the theory at least with the practical part of what they undertake to teach other and that the instruction they have give be found rather upon bare supposition of they efficacy than upon the furer bafis of long and repeat experience which alone could have ensure they success and from which with all due deference to the judicious whofs sanction we shall at all time be ambitious to deserve we may venture to answer for the prac ticability of we own to obviate every objection and to remove all those difficulty which have so long block up the path of science and retarded if not wholly impede the pupil in he progress to the temple of fame be the chief view in com piling the subsequent little treatise over and above the improvement make in illustrate the several art hitherto so imper fectly and unitelligibly explain we have introduce direction for scrape in mezzo tinto which in this edition be still farther en large and which as they have never be be fore attempt in any book of this kind we flatter ourselves will be the more acceptable especially when it shall appear from the rule lay down for the performance of this art that it be of easy to be attain that tolerable profi ciency in draw will enable any one to under take it with all imaginable prospect of suc cess the reader will also find in this impression the addition of very useful problem in the article of perspective illustrate by new plate as this book be chiefly intend for the use of young practitioner we have purposely avoid all abstruse expression and obsolete term content ourselves with such familiar stile as we judge most likely to inform those mind we would with to improve yet as the idea ef a artist be not wholly to be convey without some necessary term peculiar to each branch we have take care to explain such as could not be omit without manifest injury to the work by familiar word of synoni mous tendency where  ever they occur so that we apprehend we have not leave the least stum bling  block for the reader to encounter the artist assistant chap of draw draw be the art of represent by outline and shadow the various producti on of nature and art and of enlarge and contracting object in the most exact proportion this art recall to we memory thing long since past and rescue from oblivion the deed of we illustrious ancestor at the same time that it revive they image in we mind by preserve they fea ture for many generation in word it may be say to be the silent but most expressive language of nature which speak to the eye be underitaod by all nation and convey a idea where even word themselves would prove deficient after give some general direction for the at tainment of this truly polite and rational amusement which be the basis on which all the rest of the art depend we shall confider it more particularly under the follow head and lay down the most copious and intelligible rule for each respectively viz copying of draught drapery emarge and contrast landskip imitation of life light and shadown history the implement necessary for draw be ruler compass charcoal black lead pencil penknife porte  crayon black white and red chalk crayon indian ink crow  quill pen can mel hair pencil fitch paper of several sort and porte folio general rule for draw the first thing to be observe be the choice of proper original and here we would recom mend le clerc 's principle of draw as the easiest and best calculate for the instruction of beginner this may be have price at the publisher of this work have provide this begin with the outline of the several feature as eye nose mouth ear as they occur in the book practise these often over till you be quite master of they then procce to profile or side face after that to a oval or full face always remember that each of these must be perfectly attain before you venture to proceed further when you can copy face correctly the next thing be to draw the several limb or part of the body as the hand arm foot leg then go on to the body itself which have do you will be able to undertake whole figure observe carefully the exact proportion and bearing of one part with respect to the other the learner ought to be particularly cautious that he do not attempt whole figure before he have make himself master of the several part for this be begin ning the work at the wrong end and be indeed the same thing as if man should attempt to climb to the top of house without the help of the stair as for beast bird fruit plant we deem it useless to give direction for draw they as it be wellknown thar he who have of far improve he idea as to be able to draw human figure correctly will find it no difficulty to perform every other branch of this art skerch or draw all you outline faintly with piece of soft charcoal which may be know by the pith in the middle cut to point like pencil and when you see any thing amiss whisk it out with fandker chief or feather correct you error with black  lead pencil and compare you work with the original till every part of they perfectly correspond this do finish you outline with black lead or indian ink this advice properly uttended to will save you a infinite deal of trouble in draw over and over again to you no small discouragement if you prefer indian ink rub it with water upon marble sell for that purpose at the star holborn hill and with crow  quill pen perfect you out iine then rub out the mark of the pencil with brend . â€”keep three or four different shade of ink in the hollow of you stone to distinguish you distance reserve one of the hole for water when you be thoroughly verse in the outline you next business will be to learn to shadow but of this hereafter under the article of light and shade be not too hasty at first set out which will but impede you progress and hinder you improvement whereas by bestow little more time you will attain perfection sooner than you can well imagine and expedition will come of itself as you become more experienced of copping of draught then you would copy print or draw exactly of the same size rub the back of it with the dust of red chalk or black lead lay this upon you paper and pin it down at the four cor ner then with blunt point trace the outline and breadth of the shadow which do have care fully examine it to see that nothing be omit take it off and finish it with the pencil or pen another way to make a exact copy and at the same time to preserve the original be to lay piece of transparent paper upon it and draw the outline thereon with black  lead pencil then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon place piece of thin post paper redden or blackne at the back after which proceed to trace and finish it accord to the forego rule if you would reverse you original you need only turn the transparent paper with the draw you have make upon it downwards upon the postpaper and trace it as above direct of enlarge and contracting divide you original with pair of compass into any number of square and rule they across with black  lead pencil from side to side and from top to bottom then have you paper of the size you intend divide it into the fame number of square either big ger or less as you would enlarge or contract it place jour original before you and draw square by square the several part observe to make the part you be draw fall into the same part of the square as it do in you original to prevent mis take number the square both of the original and copy as in fig and ii of the draw  plate then outline it with indian ink rub out the mark of the pencil with bread and shade it at pleasure of imitation of life let the person you draw after be of proporti onable size and well shape place he in the easiest and most natural attitude then sketch faintly with you charcoal the head or any of the limb separately which have carefully do proceed to finish with you pencil when you have sufficiently practise the several part or limb you may draw the whole figure in whatever attitude you think proper to place it be gin with the easiest and proceed by degree to the more difficult posture as time and experi ence shall enable you be sure to finish you outline so correctly mark  ing all the muscle as they occur that even before you give it any shadow it may have fome resem blance of the person the true proportion which one part of human figure bear to another may be see in fig iii which will serve as standard to examine you draw ing by except where the figure be to be fore  short ened in which cafe nature will be the best guide in draw of likeness care must be take to express the passion in the most lively manner which be to be do by observe the peculiar cast and do position of every feature with the exactest nicety and as this be of all the part of draw by far the most difficult it will require more than ordi nary attention and should be last attempt of drapery drapery be the art of cloath you figure with elegance and propriety when you naked figure be outline first draw the outline of the drapery lightly then the greater fold and afterwards the lesser observe never to let they cross each ether particular regard be to be have to the quality of the drapery as the fold of stuff or wooll cloth be more abrupt and harsh and those of silk more flow ing and easy line cambrick gauze as they substance be lighter than either require still greater delicacy in express the wave of the fold by the faintness of they shadow the drapery should not stick too close to the bo dy but must seem to flow round as it be yet in such manner as that the motion of the figure may be free and easy great lightness and motion of the drapery should only be use when the fi gure be suppose to be in much agitation or ex pose to the wind but in calm place and free from violent action they drapery should be large and flow in order to give they more graceful appearance let the loose part of the drapery blow by the wind all flow one way and draw that part which lie closest to the body before you draw those which fy off suit you garment to the body and make they bend with it the closer the garment stick to the body the narrower and smaller must be the fold and if it fit quite close there will be no fold at all but must only have faint shadow to represent the part of the body which lie under it by observe diligently in what manner the dra pery flow upon any person stand or sit before you for that purpose you will see in what manner to dispose you fold and shadow accord to the unerring rule ornature of landskip landskip represent the face of the country â€”â€” as it appear to we view with all the various object analogous thereto as town castle church house tree hill cattle river rock ruin be caretul to augment or lefssn every object be cording to its distance make the most remote ob ject fainter and less distinct as they appear to the eye and enlarge they proportionably as they ad vance nearer shew the sky cloudy or clear as occasion re quire and if you introduce the gun let it be rise or set either of which representation will give a additional grace to you picture as they repre send nature in its liveliest and most agreeable ap pearance adapt every part of you landskip to the season of the year and the time of the day you intend it to reprefent and dilpose you light and shade with consistent propriety lastly we would recommend it to practitioner in this noble art to rise early in fine morning that they may have better idea of the harmony and beauty of the work of the great creator which would wonderfully replenish they mind as to co lour and effect of light and shade the true distribution of light and shade in picture be absolutely necessary to be know as it not only determine the proper distance of onc object from another without which the whole would be a undistinguishable mass of confusion but it give likewise to each respective object in substance roundness and effect shadow be perform with the pen or pencil in either of which great judgement be require have make you outline correct the first thing be to observe from which side of the original the light come in which if natural be either from the right hand or leave for whenever the light ap pear in the middle of picture and seem to glare more than ordinary it be cause by candle lamp or some other luminous body and be call a artificial light lay on you little tint first dispose they as you see they be do in the original and then pro ceed to the deeper one till you come to the darkest part of all for you may at any time darken you shadow when you can not lighten they let all you shadow in the fame piece fall on the same side that be if the right side of man face be dark so must be the right  side of he body arm leg thigh but if the light side be darken by the opposition of some other body intercept the light it must receive contrary shadow make you shadow fainter as they grow towards the light break they gradually that they may not appear too sudden or harsh if you shade with black  lead or with crayon you may blend you shadow and often they one into another as you require with stump make of paper paper or glove  leather roll and tye hard and cut almost to the point with which you may also weaken you shade where they be too strong when one part of the body project over or before another the part project must receive stronger light those part that bend inward must be make so much the darker and shadow deepest next the light two equal light must never be make in the same picture the strongest light should fall upon the middle of the piece where the principal figure ought to stand diminish gradually towards the extremity by frequently examine into nature you will have a opportunity of improve you idea of light and shade and will be enable to form proper judgment of the effect which the different ray or degree of light will produce in picture for which reason you should never let flip a opportunity of remark the various appearance you meet with of history this branch of draw present to we view thing past prefent and future a historical picture must describe the transaction represent in manner so clear and conspicuous as to convey a idea of it to we mind as fully as could be do by verbal description and care must be take to preserve such a analogy or con nection between the figure that not one may seem to be introduce but for fome end or purpose and as in dramatic writing it be essential to make every person speak consistent with the part he represent so here it will be equally necessary to observe the same propriety of character and make every figure lock the sentiment it be intend to express chap ii of perspective perspective be the art of delineating ob ject as they appear in nature upon plain surface accord to they distance and height perpendicular to the horizon between the object and the eye this art be of great consequence to those who would excel in draw etch engrave car ving bas relief or painting for be well un derstood the artist will be enable to know when to adhere to the strict rule and when to depart from they with propriety explanation of the term use in perspective base or fundamental line be the bottom  line of the draw on which the perfon be suppose stand with he face towards the point of sight perpendicular be line draw upright with resp ect to any part of the base parallel line be line equidistant from each other as the horizon to the base horizon be the most distant part of plain where the cloud seem to touch the earth limit the sight the horizontal line give the heigh tof the eye for we can not see any thing above the ho rizon which do not exceed this height yet the summit summit of mountain may be above the horizon though it be foot be far beneath it point of sight be that part of the horizontal line where all the visual ray center in point visual ray be beam of light convey the likeness of any object to the eye or sight and the knowledge thereof to the mind or understanding point of distance be suppole point set off on the horizontal line at equal distance on each side the point of sight diagonal line be those draw from the point of distance to the extremity of the base line abridgment of the square be the line where the diagonal intersect or cross the visual ray and must always run parallel to the base it be only make where the sight be limit by perpendicular as the far the end of church hall room and sup pose person to stand thereon parallel linedrawm through the point of sight will feem to pass through the eye and will conxequently shew what height that perion ought to be the nine forego definition be illustrate in fig of the perspective plate point of direct view this be nothing more than the front view of house church or in other word geometrical elevation raise from plan or ground plot and comprehending a equal space on both side of the point of sight see fig x iv ii point of oblique view be when we see the ob ject sideways or aslant example suppose per son be to draw view of canal with fome reÂ¬ markable building he be desirous to shew more dif tinct he must place himfelf on the base or funda mental line opposite to that building that the ray of light may be more oblique by which mean the admire building will be less fore  shorten and ap pear to greater advantage the point of sight be still before he though not in the middle of the pic ture see fig xv accidental point be those where object end in the horizontal line but neither in the point of sight or distance and serve for street house chair road which take different direction as for example suppoxe street lead to the point of sight and from it two other branch the one on the right hand the other on the left and take dif ferent direction these two last street make what we call accidental point terminate in some part of the horizontal line on each side of the point of sight see fig xvi the same be to observe in grove park where the walk you be in direct immediately to the point of sight and the avenue branch out on either side terminate also in different part of the horizon ichnography be the plan or ground  plot of any ob ject that be to be raise in perspective scenography be the art of bring any thing raise in perspective from a ichnographick plan to it ' due proportion accord to the distance in which it be place that all object may be diminish accord to they distance in picture in the same degree as they be diminish by distance in anatural prospect scenographic view may be either direct as in fig xiv or oblique as in fig xv as the art of perspective be construct upon geo metrical principle it will be necessary previous to the rule themselves to learn the follow intro ductory operation from point in give line ab to raise perden dicular see fig ii draw with the ruler the give line ab then fet one foot of you compass in and extend they to rather more than half the length of the line ab sweep the arch cd and with the same extent of compass fet one point in and sweep the arch ef then without alter the compass set one foot in and describe the arch hi next rule through the point cg to interfect the arch hi in and draw the line from to which be the perpen dicular require another way see fig iii from the point take the equal distance ab and be on each side of it then stretch â€ he compass to any distance greater than ab or be and with one foot of they in sweep the arch de then with the same extent of the compass set one point in sweep the arch fg and these two arch will inter sect ach other in the point from which line draw to the point be the perpendicular require to draw one line parallel or equidistant to another give line ab see fig iv extend you compass to the distance of the pa rallel you require then with one foot in any point of the give line as in describe the arch de again without alter the compass six one foot in any other pont as in and sweep the arch gh then rule the line ik touch the outward part of the two arch and that will be the parallel to the give line to bisect or divide give line ab into two equal part se fig take with you compass any distance greater than half the give line then with one foot of they in sweep the arch cc and with the same distance set one foot in sweep the arch dd and these arch will interfect cach other in the point gh which join by perpendicular will intersect ab in the middle point upon the end of give line ab to raise per pendicular see fig vi place one foot of the compass in and extend they to any point without the give line then set one foot of they in and turn the circle and and through draw the diameter meet the circle in join and that right line be the perpendicular require to turn the circle through any three give point not in right line see fig vii fix three point at any distance you think proper as at and and join they by the right line ab and bc then by fig bisect the line ab with the line de which do bisect the line bc with the line fe and from the center where these line meet extend you compass to and describe the circle abcg to draw a oval see fig viii draw give line ab which divide into four equal part fet one foot of the compass at and from that center describe circle with the same extent of compass place one foot in the center and turn the circle then with one foot still in extend you compass and turn the arch and with the same extent place one foot in describe the arch join the intersection with perpendicular from to next place one foot of the compass in sweep the arch will and without alter they set one foot in and describe the arch another method for a oval see fig ix draw give line ad and with the compass extend place one foot in with the other turn the circle then without alter you compass on the line ad in the suppose point sweep the circle and through the point where the two circle interfect draw the perpendicular then fix you compass with one foot in and ex tend thein so as to describe the arch to the lower extremity of the circle then with the tare ex tent with one foot in sweep the arch to join the upper extremity by these example it will appear than a oval of any form or size may be construct at pleasure on ly take care always to six the compass equidis tant from the give line ad in the perpendicular hi practical example in perspective to draw square pavement in perspective see fig and xi suppose you piece of pavement to consist of of marble each foot square you first business be to draw a ichnographical plan or ground plot of it which be thus perform have make a exact square of the size you intend you plan divide the base and horizon into eight equal part and from every division in the base to its oppo site point in the horizon rule perpendicular line then divide the side into the same number rule pa rallel line across from point to point so will you pavement be divide into square foot because the eight foot in length multiply by the same in breadth give the number of square foot or piece of marble contain in the whole then rule diagonal from corner to corner and thus will you ground plot appear as in fig now to lay this in perspeclive draw another square to you intend size and divide the base line ab into eight equal part as before then six you point of sight in the middle of the horizon de and from the same point rule line to every di vision in the base ab after which rule diagonal line from to and from to answerable to those in the ground  plot and you square will be reduce to the triangle abc then from the point where the diagonal intersect the line be to the opposite intersection where the diagonal ea cross the line cb rule parallel line which be the abridgment of the square then through the point where the diagonal cross the rest of the line which go from the base to the point of sight rule parallel line and you square pavement will be lay in perspective as in fig xi to find the height and proportion of any object as they appear above the horizon on suppose plane see fig x ii first rule you horizontal line no and fix you point of sight as at then mark the place of you nearest pillar by make dot for the base or bot tom as at and another for the summit or top as at rule line from to the point of sight and another from to and these two line will give the height of any number of pillar as for example suppose you would have pillar at fix you dot for the base and rule from thence pa rallel line to meet the diagonal am at then rule the perpendicular de to the diagonal bm which perpendicular be the height of you figure be quire at or if you would place pillar at and observe the same method rule the parallel fg and ik the perpendicular gh and kl will give they height at the distance require to find the diameter or thickness of pillar at any particular distance you be also to be guide by the nearest the base for instance suppose you nearest pillar ab to be ten foot high and one foot in diameter divide it from ' op to bottom into ten equal part and fet off one of they upon the base of the pillar then rule line from the point of sight to the diameter and you will have the thickness of all you pillar on they respective parallel or basis the same rule exemplify in object below the ho rizon see fig xiii if you would know the height of number of figure below the horizon rule you horizontal line qr and fix you point of sight as at then place you nearest figure or mark the dot for the head and foot by the point and which a swer the same purpose and rule from these dot to the point of sight the line ap and bp and if you would find the height of figure to be draw at rule from thence the parallel to the diagonal bp and the perpendicular will give the height re quire the same direction will shew the height of figure at any other distance you have mind to place it as at and by rule the parallel fg ik and mn and from each of these they respective perpendicular gh kl and no which perpendicu lar will shew the height of the figure at and to draw diret view see fig xiv to illustrate this example suppose you be to draw the inside of church as represent in this figure first take you station at the point in the center of the base line bc from which you have front view of the whole body of the church with all the pillar on each side then fix you horizon at any height you think proper as at de bisect it by the perpendicular ea and where these two line interfect be the point of sight this perpendicular will pass through the center of all the arch in the dome or cupola which center may be find by any three give point as in fig vii next divide you base line into any give number of foot and the visual line rule from thefe di vision to the point of sight will reduce all you object to they just proportion by set off they height upon perpendicular raise at they respective distance the base in the example here give be divide into twelve equal part of five foot each from which supposing you front column to be foot high take seven division from the base line of you draw and fet they off upon the perpendicular gh then supposing this column to be five foot thick at the base fet off onc of those division upon the parallel ik which be the breadth require so that by proportioning this scale to any distance by the forego direction you may not only find the dimension of all you column but also of every distinct part of they as well as of all the door window and other object that occur for instance have find the height and breadth of you first or nearest column draw from the top and bottom of the say column to the point of sight the line hf and kf after which rule the line if from the base of the column to the polnt of sight and you have the height and breadth of all the rest of the column as have be already shew in fig xii by ruling line from the point to the point of sight you will see that all the sum mit and basis of you column door window must tend immediately to that point and by line draw from the point on each side to the correspondent point on the oppo site side may be see all the part of you building lie upon the same parallel to draw a oblique view see fig x v first draw you horizontal line then if you favourite object be on the right hand as at place yourself on the left hand upon the base line as at then from that station erect perpendicu lar which will pass through the horizon at the point of sight to which rule the diagonal and which will shew the roof and base of you principal building and will also as before di rect serve as standard for all the rest observe also either in direct or oblique view whether the prospect before you make curve for if it doc you must be careful to make the same curve in you draw to draw perspective view wherein be accidental point see fig xvi rule you horizontal line ab and on one part of it fix you point of sight as at from which rule the diagonal and on the one side and and on the other which will shew the roof and basis of all the house in the street direclly face you supposing yourself place at in the center of the base line then fix you accidental point and upon the horizontal line and rule from they to the angles and im where tlie street on each side take different direction towards the accidental point and and the line and gk give the roof and basis of all the building on one side as lh and mb do on the other accidental point seldom intervene where the do tance be fmall as in noblemen seat grove can nal which may be draw by the strict rule of perspective but where the prospect be extensive and varied include mountain bridge castle ri ver precipice wood city it will be quire such a infinite number of accidental point that it will be better to do they as nature shall dic tate and you ripe judgment approve to find the center for the roof of house in a ob lique view see plate iv suppose from the point of sight the visual line and be be draw bc be one per pendicular give and de the other rule the dia gonal from to and from to and the per pendicular fg raise through the point of they intersection will shew the true center of the roof as will appear by rule the line and for want of be acquainted with this necessary rule many who have be well verse in other part of perspective have spoiled the look of they pic ture by draw the roof of they house out of they true perpendicular chap iii of etch etch be method of work on copper wherein the line or stroke instead of be cut with graver be eat with aqua fortis this art be execute with greater ease and freedom than engrave represent curious subject better and more agreeable to nature as landskip ruin and small faint or remote object build ing the principal material for this art be the plate hard and soft ground the first for winter and the other for summer dabber turpentine  varnish lamp  black soft wax and aqua fortis the tool be a oil  rubber burnisher scraper hand vice etch  board etch needle a oil  stone and parallel ruler the plate may be have of any size and well po lish fit for use of mo . whittow in shoe  lane holbourn mo . torond in little st. andrew 's  street or mr. watt in great st . andrew street seven dial direction for lay the ground have provide yourself with plate of the size of the print or draw you intend to copy rub it well with a oil  rubber make of swan skin  flannel till all the mark of the charcoal use in polish it entirely disappear then wipe off the dirty oil with line rag dip you finger in some clean oil and touch it over every part of the plate after which with you burnisher polish the plate till you can see you face in it and in case any sand  hole or flaw appear the scraper will as sist you in take they out the mark leave by the scraper be to be take out with the burnisher till nothing appear have fix you hand  vice at one end of the plate with rag and whiting clear the plate carefully from grease then heat it over charcoal  fire or light paper till it will melt the ground which be to be lay on thinly and dab all over with the dabber till it be perfectly smooth and even then warm the plate again and hold it up with the ground downwards smoak it all over with large candle take care that the snuff of it do not touch the ground and wave the candle continually ever every part so that the ground may not be burnt by heating it more in one place than another if the plate be large you may bind four penny  candle together direction for trace the first thing to be do while the plate be cool after the ground be lay be to rub the back of you print or draw all over with bit of rag or cotton dipt in the scraping of red chalk and shake off the loose dust or wipe it off gently with clean rag place the red side upon the plate make it fast at each corner with little bit of soft wax lay you etch  board under you hand to prevent bruising the ground then with blunt etch  needle trace lightly the outline and breadth of the shadow till the mark of they appear upon the ground which you must take care not to pene trate by trace too hard as great nicety be require in this part of you work it will be necessary now and then to lift up one corner of you original and examine whether every part be trace before you take it off as it will be extremely diffcult to lay it down agai in its for mer position direction for etch have carefully trace you original take it off and lay silk or line handkerchief next the plate and over that you etch  board then procce to the etch for which observe the follow direction which be adapt to every par ticular branch as landskip shipping portrait history architecture distance in landskip or the faint part of any other picture be the first to be do and these be to be work closer and with sharper  point needle the darker part must be etch wider and with blunter needle but to prevent mistake the needle may be mark accord to they different degree and the use for which they be intend as for the very faintest part of all they be to be leave for the graver or dry needle of which here after in building and all architecture in general use parallel ruler till frequent practice enable you to do they well enough without the needle may when necessary be whet upon you oil  stone keep they turn in you hand so as to whet they equally all round the oil  stone will be farther ufeful in whet the scra per whlich be to be rub flat upon the stone and with steady hand keep oil conitantly upon the stone of bite or eat in thie work with aqua fortis first examine you work carefully to see that nothing be omit and if any scratch appear upon the ground or mistake be commit in the etch they be to be slop out which be do by cover they with mixture of lamp  black and varnish lay on thinly with hair pencil which when dry will resist the aqua fortis but it will be best to stop out these as they occur to you in the course of you work for by this means they will be less liable to escape you notice and when the var nish be dry you may etch over it again if require the next thing be to enclose the work with rim or border of soft green or other coloured wax about half a inch high bend the wax in the form of spout at one corner to pour off the aqua fortis and that it may not run out at any other part take care to lay you wax so close to the plate that no vacancy be leave you aqua fortis must be single and if too strong as will be see in the biting take it off and mix it with little water shake they together in bot tle and when by often use it become too weak it may be strengthen by mixing it in bottle with little double aqua fortis the bottle which con tain the aqua fortis should have large mouth and glass stopple let the aqua fortis lie on the plate short time wipe off the bubble as they arise with feather which may remain upon the plate while it be bite after which take it off and wash the plate with wa ter then let it dry and by scrape off part of the ground from the faintest part of the work try if it be bit enough and if not stop out the part you have have try with the lamp  black and varnish and when that be dry pour on the aqua fortis again when the faint part of you work be bit enough stop they out and procecd to bite the stronger part stop they out as occasion require till the whole work be sufficiently bit then warm the plate and take off the soft wax after which heat the plate till the ground melt pour on little oil and wipe the whole off with rag when the ground be take off rub the work well with the oil rubber and wipe the plate clean then proceed to finish it with the graver accord to the follow di rection chap iv of engrave the tool necessary for engrave be the oil  rubber burnisher scraper oil  stone neddle and ruler already mention to be use in etch also graver compass and sand  bag graver be of two sort square and lozenge three of each sort should be provide the first be use in cut the broader stroke the other for the fainter and more delicate no graver should exceed the length of five inch and half the handle in clude except for strait line the sand  bag or cushion be use to lay the plate on for the conveniency of turn it about the oil  stone must be of the turkey sort of whet and temper the graver as great pain be require to whet the graver nicely particularly the belly of it care must be take to lay the two angles of the graver which be to be hold next the plate flat upon the stone and rub they steadily till they be polish like mir ror and till the belly rise gradually above tbe plate so as that when you lay the graver flat upon it you may just perceive the light under the point other wise it will dig into the copper and it will be impo sible to keep point or execute the work with freedom in order to this keep you right arm close to you side and place the fore  finger of you left hand upon that part of the graver which lie upper most on the stone when this be do in order to whet the face place the flat part of the handle in the hollow of you hand with the belly of the graver upwards upon moderate slope and rub the extremity or face upon the stone till it have a ex ceed sharp point which you may try upon you thumb  nail the oil  stone while in use must never be keep without oil when the graver be too hard as be usually the case when first buy and may be know by the frequent breaking of the point the method of tem pering the steel be as follow heat poker red hot and hold the graver upon it within half a inch of the point wave it to and for till the steel change to light straw  colour then put the point into oil to cool or hold the graver close to the flame of candle till it be of the same colour and cool it in the tallow but be careful either way not to hold it too long for then it will be too soft and in this case the point which will then turn blue must be break off and whet afresh and temper again if require but be not too hasty in temper for sometimes littlc whet ting will bring it to good condition of hold the graver cut off that part of the handle which be upon the same line with the belly or sharp edge of the graver make that side flat that it may be no obstruction hold the handle in the hollow of you hand and extend you fore  finger towards the point it rest upon the back of the graver that you may guide it flat and parallel with the plate take care that you finger do not interpose be tween the plate and the graver for they will pre vent you from carry the graver level with the plate and from cut you str direction for engrave tthe table or board you work at be firm and steady upon which place you sand  bag with the plate upon it and hold the graver as above direct proceed to business in the follow man ner for strait stroke hold you plate firm upon the sand  bag with you left hand move you right hand forward lean lighter where the stroke should be fine and harder where you would have it broader for circular or crook stroke hold the graver stedfast move you hand or the plate as you see convenient learn to carry you hand with such slight that you may end you stroke as finely as you begin it and if you have occasion to make one part deeper or blacker than another do it by degree and that you may do it with greater exactness take care that you stroke be not too close nor too wide in the course of you work scrape off the barb or roughness which arise with the belly of you graver but be careful in do this not to scratch the plate and that you may see you work pro perly as you goon rub it with the oil  rubber and wipe the plate clean which will take of the glare of the copper and shew what you have do to the best advantage any mislake or scratch in the plate may be rub ed out with the burnisher and the part level with the scraper polish it again afterwards lightly with the burnisher have thus attain the use of the graver be cording to the forego rule you will be able to finish the piece you have etch by grave up the several part to the colour of the original begin ning as in the etch with the fainter part and advancing gradually with the stronger till the whole be compleate the dry needle so call because not use till the ground be take off the plate be principally employ in the extreme light part of water sky drapery architecture for you first practice copy such print as be openly shade the more finish one be too dif ficult till you have gain farther experience great choice of print of every kind fit for young beginner may be have where this book be publish to prevent any obstruction from too great degree of light we would recommend the use of sash make of transparent or fanpaper paste on frame and place sloping at convenient distance between you work and the light this will not only preserve the sight but when the sun shine can not possibly be dispense with chap of mezzotinto  scrape this art which be of late date be recom mend to the practice of the ingenious read er for the amazing ease with which it be exe cute especially by those who have any notion of draw mezzotinto print be those which have no hatch ing or stroke of the graver but whose light and shade be blend together and appear likea draw ing of indian ink the tool use in this art be the copper  plate oil  stone grounding  tool scraper burnisher and needle direction for lay the mezzotinto  ground mark off upon the bottom of the plate the distance you intend to leave for the writing coat of arm then lay you plate with piace of swanskin  flannel under it upon you table hold the grounding  tool in you hand perpendicu larly lean upon it moderately hard continually rock ing you hand in right line from end to end till you have wholly cover the plate in one direction next cross the stroke from side to side afterwards from corner to corner work the tool cach time all over the plate in every direction almost like the point of compass take all possible care not to let the tool cut in one direction twice in place this donc the plate will be full or in other word all over rough alike and would if it be print appear completely black have lay the ground take the scraping of black chalk and with piece of rag rub it over the plate or you may with two or three candle smoak it as before direct for etch now take you print or draw and have rub the back with redchalk dust mix with white lake proceed to trace it as direct page for whetling the grounding  tool if tooth of the tool should break it may be per ceive in the working by particular streak or gap which will appear in the ground in strait line in which case the tool must be whet on the back hold it sloping and in circular man ner like the bottom of the tool direction for scrape ihe picture take blunt needle and mark the outline only then with scraper scrape off the light in every part of the plate as clean and smooth as pos sible in proportion to the strength of the light in you picture take care not to hurt you outline and that you may the better see what you do with the thumb and fore  finger of the left hand hold piece of transparent paper sloping just over you right hand and you will soon be judge of the dif ferent tint ofthe work you be do scrape off more or less of the ground as the different strength of light and tint require the use of the burnisher be to soften or rub down the extreme light part after the scraper be do with such as the tip of the nose forehead line which might otherwise when prove appear rather misty than clear another method use by mezzotinto  scraper be to etch the outline of the original as also ofthe fold in drapery mark the breadth of the shadow by dot which have bit of proper colour with aqua fortis accord to the direction give page and take off the ground use in etch and have lay the mezzotinto  ground as in page proceed to scrape the picture as above four or five day before you think the plate will be ready for prove notice must be give to the roll  press printer the properest person to print mezzotinto be mo . smith king '  head  court shoeÂ¬ lane to wet some french paper as no other will do for this work and as that time be necessary for it to lie in wet when the proof be dry touch it with white chalk where it should be lighter and with black chalk where it should be darker and when the print be retouch proceed as before for the light and for the shade use small grounding  tool as much as you judge necessary to bring it to the pro per colour and when you have do as much as you think expedient prove it again and so procce to prove and touch till it be entirely to you mind when the plate tarnish in the part where you be at work little vinegar and salt keep by you in vial will take it off wipe it dry with clean rag avoid as much as possible over  scrape any part before the first prove as by this caution the work will appear the more elegant chap vi of painting upon glass painting upon grass be a art which have generally appear difficult yet there be no re presentation can be more elegant than that of picture do well in this manner for it give all the softness that can be desire in picture and be eafy to work as there be no outline to draw nor any shade to make but the colour be put on without the trouble of either the picture be those do in mezzotinto for they shade be rub down on the glass the several line which represent the shady part of any common print be by this means blend together and appear as soft and united as in any draw of indian ink provide such mezzotinto as you like cut off the margin then get piece of fine crown  glass the size of you print as flat and free from knot or scratch as possible clean the glass and lay some venice turpentine quite thin and fmooth on one side thereof with brush of hog 's hair lay the print flat in water and let it remain on the surface till it fink 't be then enough take it carefully out and dab it between some papers that no water may be see yet so as to be damp next lay the damp print with it be face upper most upon flat table then hold the glass over it without touch the turpentine till it be exactly even with the print let it fall gently on it press the glass down carefully with you finger in several part so that the turpentine may stick to the print after which take it up then hold the glass towards you press the print with you finger from the center towards the edge till there be no blister remain when this be do wet the back of you print with spunge till the paper will rub off wich you finger then rub it gently and the white paper will roll off leave the impression only upon che glass then let it dry and with camel 's hair pencil dipt in oil of turpentine wet it all over and it will be perfectly transparent and fit for painting colour proper for panting upon glass the several sort

paper on the table and take the picture in you left hand with the turpentine side next you hold it sloping the bottom rest on the white paper and all the outline and tint of the print will be see on the glass and no thing remain but to lay on the colour proper for the different part as follow the method of use ihe colour as the light and shade of you picture open lay the lighter colour first on the lighter part of you print and the darker over the shade part and have once lay on the brighter colour it be not material if the darker sort be lay little over they for the first colour will hide those lay on afterwards as for example red lay on first the red lead and shade with lake or carmine yellow the lightest yellow lay on first may be shade with dutch pink bly blue  bice or ultramarine use for the light may be shade with indigo green lay on verdigrease first and then mixture of that and dutch pink this green may be lighten by a addition of dutch pink when any of these colour be too strong they may be lighten to any degree by mixing white with they upon you pallet or you may darken they as much as you please by mixing they with deeper shade of the same colour the colour must not be lay on too thick but if troublesome thin they before you use they with little turpentine  oil take care to have pencil for each colour and never use that which you have use for green with any other colour without first wash it well with turpentine  oil as that colour be apt to appear pre dominant when the colour be dry wash all the pencil after use in turpentine oil you glass when paint must

dry which be apt to deceive young beginner another way to make the necessary preparation be to take some of the thickest and smoothest light blue or other paper and get strain frame from framemaker ' or carpenter on which strain fome coarse scotch or irish cloth draw and fastening it wich small tack round the edge till it be quite smooth after which with spunge and fair wa ter gently wet the blue paper and then with brush or rag paste the paper all over and lay it carefully on the cloth exactly even with the strain frame after which take it up and lay white paper on the table place the blue paper down ward with one hand keep the strain  frame steady and with the other rub the cloth close to though paper do this very carefully and take it up lay it on the table with the blue paper upwards and piece of paper under you hand and rub it close to the strame  frame without touch any other part then let it stand to dry after which fet it on a easal which may be have at the colour shop and

great care must be use not to lay the colour on too thick otherwise they will crack little white sugar  candy will be find very necessary when mixt with the gumwater as preventive to that incon veniency if flower happen to be of so deep colour as not to admit of any pure white in the lightest of the part sort of priming of white should be lay on after which when dry begin with the ground colour of the flower proceed gradually with the shade as in the above direction which with the selete example we have annex peculiarly choose from nature for the purpose we hope will be suffi cient
