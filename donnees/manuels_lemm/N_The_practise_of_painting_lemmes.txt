taste and genius inspire with the love of they and whose rank and fortune may afford that support and en couragement without which they would languish and droop in shade and obscurity dedication the want of this encouragement be possibly one reason why these art have never flourish among uncivilized uncul tivate nation who confine by too exact a equality to the sole view of procure the necessary of life have nei the inclination nor leisure to pursue and cultivate ornament and elegancy that distinguish the polite part of the world a easy situation and freedom from the distress of nece sity

devotion to you service with my lord tour lordsbip most oblige moft bumble and most obedient servant bardwell the practise of painting introduction tis a observation of pliny that the ancient paint with four colour only and out of they make all they teint monsieur de pile be of opinion that it be out of these they make they grounds or what we call the dead colour how it really be time have put it out of we power to determine but if we suppose those four principal colour in perfection then ithink it can be no longer doubt but that from they might be make all the various colour in nature for my part can not believe that the four capital colour of the antient would mix to that surprising perfection we see in the work of titian and ruben and if we have no certain knowlege of they method of colour who live in the last century how should we understand theirs who live near two thousand year ago and why the method and practice of colour which be so introduction well know to ruben and van dyck should not be continue down to the present master be to ine surprising must confess ihave often think and still believe that those painter who have acquire so sine manner of colour might if they pleased have communicate it to posterity in writing but never hear that any attempt be make towards it though tis probable there might be some it be astonishing nevertheless all europe should suffer alike at the same time for want of that noble franknef and generous spirit which might have be expect from those master and which would have do the world more service than they picture it be plain from the work of they pupil that they know it because in they picture we see the same sort of colour and colour and from the little variety of capital colour and sameness of method use by they it be not to be doubt but the whole be contain in few principle neither difficult nor tedious if we trace the art through its several declension we shall find rembrandt who be master of all the part of colour in the highest degree live to the year next to he be zoust who die in england about eight year after lely live to the year reily who be zouff disciple survive they and be leave the best colourist we have mo richardson who die about the year be he pupil but in my opinion in point of merit much he inferior reily think decline in the same proportion to zoust that zoust do to rembrandt as all these master from rembrandt sunk gradually below each other in the art of colour we may with certainty date the declension of that art from he can not attribute this gradual degeneracy in the knowlege of so charm ing a art to any thing but inability or want of that generofity have before mention or both though these gentleman be not able to give we so perfect a account as the great master yet they might have com municate what they learn from they and if it be against they own private interest to have publish it whilst they practise they should out of general regard to man of taste and to the art itself have leave it behind they to have give to posterity a opportunity of reap the benefit of they study flatter myself that the follow sheet compile originally for my own use contain something that may be of consequence in study this art and hope the practicable method of colour here lay down which have be the result of much study and long experience and which now use will be find both useful and agreeable in the course of study this part of my art as could have no assistance from the living find myself oblige to make my court to the dead mean they work and though have have very little op portunity to study even they yet from the few have copy have after tedious course of mistake at last by mere dint of labour and the assistance of genius such as it be find the follow method of colour very easy and expeditious painter say de pile spend many tear in the search of knowlege wbich they might bave attain in little time bad they bit at first upon the right path this truth have experience and confess that the work of van dyck and rembrandt be the surest guide to nature it be out of these most excellent master that have establish my method it be from they picture have find the first lay of colour and from they have learn the virgin teint and finish secret though have always apply they to practice from nature in the method of my work begin with short and plain account of the principal colour use in the flesn next follow with the principal teint first painting to dead colour second painting third or last painting of painting back grounds some remark on copving of drapery painting of landscape painting new short and familiar account of the art of perspective all these particular have endeavour to make familiar clear and instructive without design to flatter or offend and thro the whole course of the work have have the utmost regard to truth the motive of my publish be solely the benefit of the art such as be bear with happy genius though destitute of master or guide may from these instruction acquire competent knowlege of colour ing alinost without study here the lover of painting who study for they pleasure and amusement may be conduct easily step by step to the secret of that art which of all the design one afford per haps the greatest pleasure to the mind it may be object to I by some that my own work do not shew have either acquire or revive that art which accord to my own confession have long time lain dormant be not the proper person to answer this objection nevertheless have some copy by I that will leave to judge to compare in this point with any painting that have be do for the last sixty or seventy year and believe could con vince any artist even at twice painting head from the great master that my method will certainly answer to all they variety of colour and sure every sensible painter will grant that that method which come nearest to van dyck and rembrandt will certainly be the nearest way to nature since li have establissied myself in these principle must inform the reader that find no difference in the method of the working between copying and painting from nature have know at my first setting out as much as have since learn should have approach much nearer to those great master other who have the advantage of youth may be persuade attain the end propose it be for they that write and most sincerely wish the rule lay down may contribute to restore so divine a art monsieur de pile say titian and rembrandt prepare they first lay er grounds very near alike and with colour that kindly united and be as near to tbe life as possible on which they lay they virgin teint with light stroke of the pencil and thus they imitate the force and fresbness of nature nature they be convinced that there be certain colour wbich destroy each other if they be mix to excess and that they should be as little shake as possible by the motion of the pencil lt would be folly in any man at this present time to assume so much knowlege in the art of painting as monsieur de pile really have who be man of genius and learn that make painting he principal study and travel on purposo to complete he knowlege in that delight ful art be intimately acquainted with thie painter in he time who assist he in study the work of the great master which he care fully examine and from which he make he reflection and judicious remark this be when the work of van dyck and rembrandt be more in perfection and in a age when painting be better understand be it poffible for any thing to be more plain and intelligible than these two most excellent remark of monsieur de pile which contain the principal matter and foundation of colour this be vastly different from theirs whose colour be as they pretend to change and wear to the complexion though this may answer they purpose yet none that study the art of colour will hope believe it it be certainly true that the great master imitate nature in they first painting or dead colour ing so far as they could with out dirty the colour omit only the finish touch and colour that should come last which design to shew in the course of this work in the most intelligible manner can and exactly to the rule and method of my present practice some painter imagine the great master have colour which we have no knowlege of and it be probable they might yet confess see none in the picture of van dyck and rembrandt but what be common to painter only some of they be better than ours which would be reme die if that art be more encourage by the painter those we have be convinced would appear much finer if they be lay on proper grounds painter should have as great regard to he first lay as he have to the succeed part of he work sir godfrey kneller in lely time study he manner and prepare he grounds and first lay of colout introduction on such cloths as lely use but after he death he soon fall into slighter manner which be more agreeable to he genius and inclination and invent the cold grey coloured cloths on which he establish he slight cxpeditious manner then be the time when the painter expose they understanding in neglect the charming stile of van dyck to follow kneller but though colour be not he talent yet he be in he time the best face painter in europe nor have there be a artist since he whose head can stand any comparison with he aster he co louring hunig here for some time between the manners of mo richardson and rosalba the follower of the latter fail in oil establish she method have trace the art of painting thro its several declension will venture to give my opinion on it as it stand at this present time in regard to portraiture and hope to do it in such manner as to offend no body that may differ from I if may be allow to judge from the picture bring home by gentleman from abroad as the work of ghe most eminent living master may without partiality affirm that face painting be no where so well perform as in england notwithstand ing the prejudice of some in favour of foreigner nor be it at all sur prising it should be so since where there be the greatest encouragement to a art thither the most eminent master in that art will resort and there it will be improve to its greatest height it be well know that no nation in the world delight so much in face painting or give so generous encouragement to it as we own and it be equally know that no country afford such help in regard to beautiful nature we have also the greatest number of van dyck s picture and the rest of the best face painter rembrandt except of any people and it seem rea sonable from these observation which be found on matter of fact to infer that england be preferable to all other nation whatsoever in this respect and the best place for study the art of face painting can not but indulge fort of compassion for those artist as do for other mistaken man who conceive it absolutely necessary to traverse italy and other country waste thattime abroad which in my humble opi nion may be employ at least as well at home in study the work of van dyck and the inimitable beauty of the english lady which think as much preferable to the antique as the animated beauty of nature be to the cold imitation of she in stone am inform there be scheme on foot to establish a academy for painting and sculpture wish it may succeed as it must probably in time improve those art to the highest perfection and will of course do honour to the nation and to the nobility who will from frequent it for they amusement learn the principle of those art and so become real judge of the principal coloue use in the flesh from wbich all tbe teint be make lake white ofine white be the very best white we have this colour should be ground with the finest poppy oil than can be make at present we white be bad on account of the oil which be not really poppy white be friendly work colour and come forward with yellow and red but retire with bly and green it be the nature of all whitee to sink into whatever ground they be laidt on therefore they should be lay on white grounds ivory black be the best black we have it be colour which sympathize and mix kindly with all the other it be true shade for blue lvory black and little indian red make the best general shadow colour that can be it be ground with linseed oil and use with dry ing oil black be cold retire colour ultramarine be the finest blue in the world it be tender retire colour and never glare and be beautiful glaze colour lt be use with pop oil prussian be very fine blue and kind work colour it be ground with linseed oil though think nut oil be more proper it should never be use in the flesh but in the green teint and the eye light oxer be friendly mixing colour and of great use in the flesh lt be usually ground with linseed oil but nut oil be better all yellow be strengthen with red and weaken with bly and green lightrep be nothing but fine light oker burnt this and white in mixing produce the most perfect flefh colour that can be make it be beautiful clean kind work colour but too strong for the white and therefore will grow darker it should be ground and use with nut oil novermillion but what be make of the true native cinnabar should ever be use it will not glaze but be fine colour when it be glaze it be ground with linseed oil and should be use with drying oil carmine be the most beautiful crimson that can be it be middle colour between lake and vermillion be fine working colour and glaze delightfully it should be ground with nut oil and use with drying oil lake be tender sympathizing deep red but of no strong body therefore it should be strengthen with indian red it be the beft glaze colour that can be use it be ground with linseed oil and use with drying oil i iindian rep be à strong pleasant working colour but will not glaze well and when mix with white falls little into the lead it be ground and use as the lake ii brown pink be fine glaze colour but of no strong body dn the flesh it should never join or mix with the light because this colour and white antipathize and mix of warm dirty have for which reason they joining should be blend with cold middle teint in glaze of shadow it should be lay before the other colour that be to enrich it it be one of the finisning colour and therefore should never be use alone in the first painting it be strengthen with burnt umber teint and weaken with terraverte ground with linseed oil and use with drying oil burntumber be sine warm brown and good work strong colour lt be of great use in the hair and mix finely with the warm shade of the principal teirt that be absolutely necessary for painting fiesn all wbich be make from the principal colour light red teint be make of light red and white it be the most kind and best condition of all colour for the general ground of the flesh with this colour and the shade teint we should make out all the flesh like claro obscuro or mezzontinto we should also remember that this colour will grow darker because it be in its nature too strong for the white therefore we should improve it that be mix some vermillion and white with it in proportion to the fair ness of the complexion and though it be thus mix yet ishall call it the light red teint in all the course of the work because would not have the vermillion teint confound with it as if there be no difference vermillion teint be only vermillion and white mix to middle teint lt be the most brilliant light red that can be it agree best with the white light red and yellow teint carmineteint be carmine and white only mix to middle teint it be of all colour the most beautiful red that can be for the cheek and lip it be one of the finish colour and should never be use in the first painting but lay upon the finish colour without mixing rose teint be make of the red shade and white mix to middle degree or lighter it be one of the cleanest and most delicate teint that can be use jà the flesh for clear up the heavy dirty colour and therefore inschanging will sympathize and mix kindly yellow teint be often make of naple yellow and white but make it of light oker and white which be good work colour remember the oker be too strong for the white therefore we should make à little allowance in use it it follow the light red teint and should always be lay before the bly if we lay too much of it would may recover the ground it be lay on with the light red teint blue teint be make of ultramarine and white mix to azure it be pleasant work colour with it we should blend the gradation it follow the yellow and with they it make the green and with the red it produce the purple no colour be so proper for blend down or softening the light into keep leadteint be make of lvory black and fine white mix to middle degree it be fine retire colour and therefore be of great use in the gradation and in the eye greenteint be make of prussian light oker and white this colour will dirty the light and should be lay sparingly in the middle teint it be most use in the red shadow where they be too strong it be of dirty antipathize nature shade teint be make of lake indian red black and white rix to beautiful murrey colour of middle teint this be the best colour for the general ground of shadow for which reason call it the shade teint it mix with the light delightfully and produce pleasant clean colour little inclined to the redish pearl as all the four colour of its composition be of friendly sympathizing nature so conse quently this will be the same and therefore may be easily change by the addition of any other colour rep shade be nothing but lake and very little indian red it be charming work colour and good glazer lt strengthen the shadow on the shade teint and receive when it be wet the green and blue teint agreeably it be good ground for all dark shadow ii warmshade be make of lake and brown pink mix to middle degree it be fine colour for strengthen the shadow on the shade teint when they be wet or dry we must take care that it do not touch the light because they will mix of dirty snuff colour and therefore should be soften with tender cold teint dark shade be make of lvory black and little indian red only this colour mix very kindly with the red shade and sympa¬ thize agreeably with the middle teint in the dead colour it be charming glaze colour for the eye brow and darkest shadow it be of all the most excellent shadow colour and one of the finest working colour we have first painting the colour and teint that be necessary for the first painting of the flesh fine white light oker and it be two teint light red and it be two teint vermillion —and it be teint teint make of lake vermillion and white rise teint blue teint lead teint green teint half shade teint be make of indian red and white shade teint red shade warm shade the finish pallet for fine complexion require six more viz carmine and its teint lake brown pink lvory black and prussian blue first painting the first painting or dead colour divide into two part the first call the first lay or ground the second the lay on the virgin teint the first lay of colour consist of two part the one be the work of the shadow only and the other that of the light the work of the shadow be to make out all the draw very cor rectly with the shade teint in the same manner as if it be to be do with this colour only and remember to drive or lay the colour sparingly the light should be all lay in with the light red teint in different de gree as we see they in nature these two colour united produce clean tender middle teint for mixing with the shade teint they turn to pearly hue and by strengthen they with the light red we may work to very good resemblance in uniting the light and shade we should use long softener about the size of large swan quill which will help to bring the work into character and leave the colour ing more delicate then go over the darkest shadow with the red or warm shade which will finish the first lay the warm shade be lay on the shade teint improve it to ¬ warmer hue but if lay instead of the shade teint it will dirty and spoil the colour it mix with and if the red shade be lay first inftead of the shade teint the shadow would then appear too red and bloody therefore notwithstanding these two colour be the best that can be for the shadow yet they be too strong to be lay alone which be proof of the great use and merit of the shade teint here we may observe that the shade and light red teint be so friendly and delicate in they nature that they will not dirty though we be continually change they how proper then and agreeable to we purpose be they for make the most principal part of the likeness when in alter and change they always produce clean colour of the invite pearly hue the second part of the first painting in order to finish the first painting improve the red and yellow to the complexion and after they the bly observe that the bly on the red make the purple and on the yellow produce the green the same method be to be understand of the shadow but be sure to leave they clean and not too dark therefore allowance should be make in they grounds with the light red because glaze they will make they darker when the cloth be of dark or bad colour there must be strong body of colour lay all over the shadow such as will not sink into the ground but appear warm and little lighter than the life so that it may be of the same forwardness to finish as if it have be light ground therefore the business of dead colour be that we leave it always in the same order for finish though the colour of the cloth be quite the reverse be convinced by experience that the grounds of shadow in what we call the dead colour should be such as will support the character of the finish colour which ground must be clean and little lighter than the finish colour isay little lighter because the finish of shadow be glaze and no other method but glaze can leave such brilliancy and beauty as they ought to have for find that glaze the shadow in the first painting be not so proper as lay body of shadow colour that be very near to the life though little lighter these may be glaze and touch upon when dry with great deal of ease but if we begin the first painting with glaze we shall find it will stare and be of no use and the solid colour which be lay on it will look heavy and dull therefore all shadow and colour that be to be glaze should be do with colour of clean solid body because the glaze be more lafting and have the best effect on such colour remember to leave no roughness mean such as will appear rough and interrupt or hurt the character of the finish colour which by examine the work whilst it be wet with soft tool or when it be dry with aknife may be avoid as it will easily take off the knot and roughest part the light red and white improve be superior to all other colour for the first lay or ground which should be always do with full pencil of stiff colour make brighter than the life because it will sink little in drying the greater the body and quantity of colour and the stiffer it be lay the less it will sink every colour in drying will sink and partake in proportion to its body of the colour it be lay on therefore all the light of the flesn if not lay on light ground must conse quently change little from the life if there be no allowance make the shade teint for the shadow should fall into the rose teint as the com plexion grow delicate all which should be lightly united with soft long point dsog toel to thelight make out the whole like mezzotinto believe the great master very seldom sweeten or soften the co lour but in uniting the first lay they be very careful in preserve the brightness of they colour and therefore do not work they below the complexion for to force or keep up brilliancy in the grounds can only be do with the white red and yellow which method will make up for the deficiency of the white grounds therefore the first paieting should be leave bright and bold and the less the colour be break the better we should forbear use any colour that will prejudice they and be content to add what be want the next painting where if we fail clean rag will restore the first ground second painting the second painting begin with lay on the least quantity that can be of poppy oil then wipe it aliost all off with dry piece of silk handkerchief tlie secondpainting be also divide into two part one call the first lay of the second painting which be scumble the light and glaze the shadow the other finish the complexion with thevirgin teint and improve the likeness as far as we can without daub scumble be go over the light where they be to be change with the liglit red teint or some other of they own colour such as will always clear and improve the complexion with short stiff pencil but such part only as require it otherwise the beauty of the first painting will be spoiled and we make ourselves double work the light red teint improve be the very best colour that can be for scumble and improve the complexion in general where the shadow and and draw be to be correct we should do it with the shade teint by drive the colour very stiff and bare that we may the easier retouch and change it with the finish teint some part of the shadow should be glaze with some of the transparent shadow colour such as will improve and come very near to the life but be sure not to lay on too much of itafor fear of lose the hue of the first painting the ground of which should always appear through the glaze be very careful in uniting the light and shade that they do not mix dead and meally for the more the light mix with the shade the more meally those shade will appear thus far the complexion be prepare and improve in order to receive the virgin teint and finish touch the second part of the second painting lave to go over the complexion with the virgin teint these be the colour which improve the colour to the greatest perfection both in the light and shadow this should be do in the same manner as we lay they in the second part of the firft painting that be with the red yellow and bly blend they with delicate light touch of the tender middle teint without softening we should leave the teit and they grounds clean and distinct and be content to leave off whilst the work be safe and unsullied leave what be farther require for the next sitting for in attempt the finish touch before the other be dry we lose the spirit and draw and dirty where ever we touch the third painting or finish tis to be suppose the complexion now want very little more than few light touch therefore there will be no occasion for oil begin with correct all the glaze first where the glaze ferve as ground or under part then we should determine what should be do the part with one stroke of the pencil by this method we preserve both back grounds the glaze and the teint but if it happen that we can not lay such variety of teint and finisning colour as we intend it be much better to leave off while the work be safe and in good order because those few touch which would endanger the beauty of the colour mapeasily be do if we have patience to stay till the colour be dry and then without oil and those finishing with free light stroke of the pencil believe that rembrandt touch upon he best picture great many time let they dry between it be this method most certainly which give they that surprising force and spirit which be so inimitable find it much easier to soften the over strong teint when they be dry than when they be wet because we may add the very colour that be want without endangering the dry work if any of the colour of the pallet want to be little change to the life when we be painting it be much better to do it with the knife on the pallet than with the pencil because the knife will mix and leave it in good order for the penci of back grounds van dyck make out the keeping in he back grounds more from the different opposition and harmony of the colour than from he knowledge of the claro obscuro confess can not find in he picture that intelligence of light and shade which be so strike and beautiful in rembrandt s van dyck s general method be to be very still and mellow and to break the colour of the ground with those of the drapery this will certainly produce harmony the principle of which method belong only to the art of colour but it be the knowlege of light and shade which give that surprising force and strength which at first sight we find in rembrandt s work have see picture of lady where he have make the ground just light enough to shew she complexion and hair which be dark brown in the greatest perfection the ground be wall which near to the face be lighter than the shadow of the flesh and the light diminish so artfully in the gradation that though the part round the head be much darker yet it appear to be of the same colour with that near the flesn must own like this method of relieve the head from the ground better than van dyck s method where he have make the ground almost of the same colour with the hair and though admire he way of break the colour of the ground with those of the drapery yet be not so much plcase where there appear too near sameness as have see in some of he picture where he have carry this principle so near that it be almost imperceptible in rembranct picture at yarmouth the light and shade be as visible as those in he print and be remarkably broad clear and still the shadow be very warm and thin and look as if they be paint all at once with plenty of colour which appear transparent which transparency be do by glaze the dead colour the principal colour that be necessary for painting of back grounds in portraiture as wall building or the like be white black indian red light and brown oker prussian and burnt umber from which the eight principal teint be make as follow pearl be make of black white and little indian red lead of black and white mixt to dark lead colour yellow of brown oker and white olive of light oker prusfian and white flesh of indian red and white mixt to middle teint murrey of indian red white and little black mixt to kind of purple of middle teint stone of white umber black and indian red dark shade of black and indian red only here the lead teint serve for the bly the flefn teint mix agree ably with the lead and the murrey be very good blend colour and of great use where the olive be too strong the umber white and dark shade will produce fine variety of stone colour the dark shade and umber use plentifully with drying oil make charming warm shadow colour all the colour should be lay with drying oil only because they mix and fet the better with the softener where the mark of the trowel be so strong in the priming of the cloth that one body of colour will not be sufficient to conceal it we should lay colour to prevent it which should be dry before we begin with those part that we expect to finish at once painting tiie method of painting back grounds divide into two part the first part be the work of the first lay the second be to follow on that with the finish teint of the first lay we should always begin from the shadow side of tiie head and paint the light first from they go into the gradation and shadow which should be do with large stiffisn tool very sparingly with the dark shade and white little change with the colour that will give it more of the require hue but very near in regard to tone and strength leave they like mezzotinto the dark and warm shadow should be lay before the colour that join they this we should do with the dark shade and umber drive with drying oil say before the colour that join they because if those colour be lay on first they would interrupt and spoil the tran parency which be they greatest beauty the more the first lay be drive the easier and better we may change it with the finish teint there fore we may lay they with the greater body the second part be to follow directly whilst the first lay be wet with those teint that we think be most proper to harmonize and finish with begin with the light first and remember as we heighten and finish they we do it with warmer colour and let those be accompanicd with fine tender cold teint the lightest part of the ground be always nearest to the shadow side of the head this be the part which govefh all the rest and should be paint with avariety of light warm clear colour which vanisn and lose they strength imperceptibly in the gradation these these should be lay with kind of cloudy touch rather than spot and we must take care that we do not cover too much of the first lay but consider it as the principal colour from the light we go to the gradation and shadow for when the light be well adapt to produce and support the head it be easy think to fall from they into whatever kind of shadow we shall find most pro per for we work then soften and blend the whole with long large hog tool which with the strength and body of the drying oil will melt and sweeten all together in such flatter manner as will seem surprise ingly finisn remember the teint will sink and lose little of they strength and beauty in drying all the grounds as wall should be finissied at once painting but if they want to be change we may glaze they with little of the dark shade and drying oil drive very bare on which with few light touch of the colour that be want we may improve they hue the dark shadow may also be strengthen and im prove by glaze which should be do after the figure be near finish for fear of make they too strong see rembrandt s grounds be rather brighter in the light and have more variety of teint than any other painter and to be sure he have observe and justly too that those teint diminish in proportion with the light therefore he shadow have but faint appearance of teint he understand the gradation in perfection by mixing and break the first lay of colour so artfully that they flatter we in regard to they real strength fresnoy say let the field or ground of the picture be pleusant free tranfient light and well united with colour which be of friendly nature to each otber and ef such mixture as that there may be sometbing in it ef every colour that compose you work as it be the contents of you pallet de pile say variety of teint very near of the fame tone employ in the same figure and often upon the fame part with moderation contri bute much to harmony all the curtain should be dead coloured when we paint the ground and should be do with clean colour of near hue to the intend curtain curtain such as will support the finish colour do it with tender sort of keep and near in regard to they tone in the light but much softer in the shadow all which should be mix and break with the colour of the ground and as fresnoy say body that be back in the ground should be paint with colour ally to those of the ground itself it will often happen for want of the life or some design that we can not make the fold the first painting we should then leave the mass of light and shadow in regard to the keeping of the picture broad and well united together such as may seem easy to finish on the colour of the landskip in back grounds should be break and soften also with those of the part which join they this method bring they into keep which will make all the part of the ground as it be of one piece so that the different part do not stare nor cut at they extrea mity the sky should be break with the lead and the flefh téint the murrey teint be of great use in the grounds of distant object and the umber and dark shade in the near grounds the green should be more beautiful than we intend they because they will fade and grow darker after all be paint we should go over the whole very lightly with the softener as we do the grounds which will make it look agreeably finish on copy the author of the analyfis of beauty have give he opinion of copy in he true spirit and genius treat with ridicule one of the most useful part of painting this impute to he want of skill in this branch of the art or to most ill grounded prejudice for be it reasonable to believe that painter who understand the true merit of copying would treat that part of the art with contempt which the greatest master have always practise and esteem man of common sense know that the artist in all age have copy and study each either in whatever they find most for they purpose and for the advance ment copy ment of they art be it not for this the art itfelf would soon dwindle and decay and fwisn this have not be the case with we ruben study principally the work of titian paul veronese and tintoret that be he copy such of they picture as he think most worthy he imitation and keep they for he own use van dyck copy titian and all the venetian school or in de piless phrase saim they cream tenier be celebrate for transform he self into as many master as he copy which he do so exactly that it be hard to distinguisn the copy from the original hanneman s copy of van dyck be take for the original of that great master have see copy by stone sell at great price for undoubted original notwith stand they be divest of that free pencil and charming variety of teint which be so apparent in van dyck buckshorn be one of the last good copier we have have in england the rest that follow he and he master lely soon dwindle to half artist there be copy of buck sbear painting after van dyck which like much better than any of stone mean the picture of the earl of strafford and he secretary in the marquis of rockingham s collection which be well paint and de servedly esteem believe every one that have hear of andrea del sarto s copy of leo the tenth paint by rapbael and julio romano will be convinced of the great use and merit of a art to which be ow that great number of original now abound in every country by original mean picture impose as such by we ingenious and honest dealer to adorn the cabinet of the virtuosi and connoisseur it be surprising that since the age of these great master we have not have man able to make fine copy from any one of they picture and ibelieve if such genius should hereafter arise it be to be fear the de stroyer of the art if they be suffer to go on will scour off the remains off they beauty so that very little will be leave for he to study and by the end of this century there will be none fit for copy it copy it be in vain for man to think of make fine imitation of any of the great master without be thoroughly acquainted with the nature of colour and of colour and without be clearly con vince at sight of the picture hie be go to copy of the method and principle on which it be paint it be the want of this knowlege and conviction which lead we into so many error and mistake painter that have acquire any sort of manner will always tincture he copying with the same now day we be too apt to fall into manner before we understand the nature of colour which be the case where some predominant colour or hue appear in all the complexion alike for this reason painter whose carnation be too red will cer tainly make he copy blushi or if he colour and shadow be heavy they will of course fall into the obscuro by the same rule whatever teint infect he colour the same will unavoidably taint he copying for which there be no cure because he himself be infect monsieur de pile say it be very rare to change bad manner in colour ing for better that raphael michael angelo leonardo do vinci julio romano and other great master spend they wbole life without truly understanding good colour and though colour be the principal excel lence in copying yet it be necessary that every artist should avoid particular manner with he pencil otherwise it will certainly be see in he work from what have be say on this subject apprehend it appear that the art of copying which be practise by the great master in order to catch each other excellency and perfection and by which they noble work have be so often repeat and as it be renew be so so far froin deserve contempt that it ought to be encourage as thing highly useful and worthy of esteem or of painting drapery in order to understand the nature and different degree of colour or teint use in painting drapary first determine how many di vision be absolutely necessary to make the first lay of colour and after that the reflect and finish teint the right method of painting drapery or sattin in general be to make out the whole or what call the first lay with three colour only viz the light middle teint and shade teint for the light mean the colour of all the high light the middle teint should be very near to the general hue of the sattin and of a exact middle degree between the high light and the shade teint the shade teint would have dark enough for the general hue of all the shadow for which reason call it the shade teint we should observe that the light should rather incline to warmissi hue and the middle teint should be make of friendly working colour such as will always mik of clean tender coldish hue the shade teint should be make of the same colour as the middle teint only with less light therefore this teint will also mix of tender clean colour it be with these three colour we should make out the whole like mezzotinto and we should understand that all the beauty and character of the fold the shape attitude and principal light and shade be all to be con fider and make with these three colour only which should be do to we satisfaction before we add any of the reflect or finish teint the reffect of drapery and sattin be generally production of they own and be always lighter than the shadow on which they be find and be produce by light will consequently have light warm colour mix with the local colour that receive they here it will be necessary to drapery to observe the general method and secret in manage the colour of the first lay and those of the reflect and sinish teint in the first lay the high light should be lay with plenty of stiff colour and then shap and soften into character with the middle teint very correctly where the gradation of the light be slow as in the large part it will be proper to lay the middle teint first at they extre mity with tool that will drive the colour and leave it sparingly be cause the light will mix and lie the better upon it next be to make out all the part of the shadow with the shade teint drive bare after this come the middle teint which fill up and serve as the second light and gradation and should be manage together very nicely to character without touch any of the high light which finisn the first lay the reflect and finish teint be in general the antipathy of the first lay they will without great care poison and dirty the colour on which they be lay and therefore should be lay with delicate light touch without softening if it be over do we must remember to recover it with the colour of the part on which it be lay this may be do directly or when it be dry we should also observe whether the reflect proceed from the same colour or any other that the method of use they be the same before proceed to the particular colour it will be proper to make some observation on they grounds it often hapen that the colour of the cloth be very improper for the ground of the drapery and when it be so we should change it with those colour which we think be most proper to improve and support the finish colour this method of dead colour must consequently preserve they in they greatest lustre in dead colour we should lay the light and shade in manner so as only to shew faint idea of they with regard to the shape and rounding of the figure if we have design to work from then it will be proper to make all the large and principal part in they place which should always be do with colour that be clean and lighter than the intend drapery though in gene ral of tlie same hue and let the shadow be no darker than middle teint white sattin drapery teint these should be mixd and break in tender manner and then soften with large tool so that nothing rough or uneven be leave to isiterrupt or hurt the character of the finish colour white sattin all white should be paint on white grounds lay with good body of colour by reason this colour sink more into the ground than any other there be four degree of colour in the first lay to white sattin the first be the fine white for the light the second be the first teint which be make of fine white and very little lvory black mix to a exact middle degree between the white and middle teint this co lour follow the white and it be with this we should shape the light into character before we lay on any other and take care that this first teint appear distinctly between the white and the middle teint other wise the beauty and character of the sattin will be spoiled the middle teint should be make of white black and little indian red these three colour be very friendly and mix to beautiful clear colour of pearly hue which have the true brightness and warmth of the general hue of the sattin remember to allow for the red hue change à little to the lead if there be occasion to mnake any part in the middle teint lighter we should do it with the first teint only this colour should also be lay sparingly before the white in all the little light that happen in the middle teint and shadow on which we should lay the white with one light touch and be sure not to cover all the part that be make with the first teint lf we do it will spoil the character and look like spot for want of the softening edge or bor der which must be between the white and the middle teint the shade teint should be make of tlie same colour as the middle teint but with less white so that it be dark enough for the shadow in gene ral with which we should make out all the part of the shadow nicely to character which be the work of the first lay next come the reflect and finish teint brown oker mixet with the colour of the light be the most useful colour in general for all reflect in drapery that be produce from they own colour all accidental reflex be make with the colour of the part from which they be produce and the local colour that receive they there be but two reflect teint want for drapery in general mean to any one particular colour one should be lighter than the middle teint the other darker these colour may be little change on the pallet with the first and middle teint as occasion require or lightly break on the part that receive they but this last method be not so safe as the other the teint sufficient for blend the dark shadow to the mellow tender hue be make with the shade teint and little brown oker which should be lay on very sparingly with soft light touch for fear of make they dull and heavy if it should be over do we may recover it with the colour it be lay upon we often see little blue use in the first teint of white sattin van haecken who be the best drapery painter we ever have in england do so and sometimes instead of the blue he use blue black till he find it to be pernicious colour and be therefore oblige to use blue be cause he middle teint which be make only of black and white be so very cold that no other colour but blue would make colder teint yet he manage these cold colour in all the light and middle teint so agreeably and so light and easy be he touch that we can not help admire and may learn something from he though he be not so lucky in he shadow which be generally of heavy dirty hue this be ow to the colour he use and the method of use they which will always have such a effect when warm or dirty colour be mix with clean light one for be mix together they will form dirty colour that muit consequently appear so in the work but if he lead or shade teint have be mix with indian red instead of the oker and then follow with few light blend touch of the oker teint it would have leave they clean and mellow it be the want of the red hue which make the white sattin appear so often like pewter blue sattin blue sattin be make of prussian blue and fine white the best ground for blue be white for the light and black and white for the shadow the first lay of colour for blue be divide into three degree or teint we should first make the middle teint of beautiful azure then mix the colour for the light about middle degree between that and white make the shade teint dark enough for the shadow in gene ral all the broad light should be lay with plenty of colour and shap to character with themiddle teint before we lay on any other colour remember the lef the colour be mix the better they will appear and stand for the light of blue should be manage with as much care as those of white sattin next be to follow with the rest of the middle teint and then make out all the shadow the more we drive the shade teint the better it will receive the reflect and finish teint the shadow should be strengthen and blend with lvory black and some of they own colour which will mix with they into tender mellow hue the reflect be iade as those of white sattin that be with oker and some of the light which should be perfectly do as we intend it at once painting the shadow when dry may be little improve if there be occasion to alter they with the colour they be make with the prussian proper to be use be that which look of the most beautiful azure before it be ground and the sooner it be use after it be ground the better it will work and appear velvet may be paint at once the method be to make out the first lay with the middle teint and shade teint on which we should lay the high light with light touch and finisn the shadow as we do those of the sattin but the nearest imitation of velvet we can make be dène by glaze which be to prepare ground or dead colour with with such colour as will when dry bear out and support the glaze colour in its highest perfection the nature of the glaze colour be to be of fine transparent quality and use simply with oil only so that whatever ground it be lay on the whole may appear distinctly thro it the best ground for blue be make with white and lvory black the white be for the high light wliich with the middle teint and shade teint make out the first lay like mezzotinto remember to make the middle teint lighter in proportion to the glaze because that will make it the darker it be often necessary to cover all but the high light with thin glaze do not mean with plenty of oil in the colour but lay with less quantity than if it be to be do once only if any of it touch the light we should wipe it off with clean rag the very high light should be improve and make of fine white and leave to dry the glaze colour be prussian ground very sine with nut oil and should be lay with large stiffisn tool that will drive the colour as occasion require it be on the last glaze we should strengthen and finish the shadow the greatest fault in the colour of drapety be the painting the chadow with strong glaring colour which destroy the beauty of the light this be not only the reverse of art but of nature whose beauty always diminish in proportion with the light for this rea son we should take care to blend and soften the shadow with such friendly colour as will agree with they local character and obscurity here we may observe that glaze the middle teint which be make of black and white will not produce colour so blue as if it have be prepare with prussian and white yet this colour will preserve the beauty of the light in the highest perfection by reason of its tender obsoure hue when the blueness of the other would only diminish they this method of glaze the blue be tlie general rule for all glaze when we be glaze blue the light may be glaze with uitra marine though all the other part be do with prussian this meth save great quantity of that valuable colour and answer we purpose as well as if it have all be do with uitramarine though this general method of painting sattin be to make the first lay of cslour with three degree or teint yet we should understand in use they that they produce two more for the mixing of two dif ferent colour together on ge cloth will make another of middle teint between they so it be with the light and middle teint and with the middle and shade teint the first answer to the first teint in white sattin and the last will consequently be sort of gradate or half shade if the light and middle teint mix to beautiful clean colour of middle hue between both there will be no occasion for colour to go between they as in the blue sattin but if in mixing they produce teint incline to dirty warm huc then there must be another find of sympathizing nature which should be lay between they in order to preserve the beauty of the light as the first teint in the white sattin for if it be not so the red in the middle teint would certainly dirty and spoil the white it be highly necessary to understand these principle of the first lay of colour in order to have perfect knowlege of the general rule of co louring on which the principle of colour depend scarlet and crimson light yellow red make of light oker light red and white be the proper ground for scarlet the shadow be indian red and in the darkest part mix with very little black the second painting should be little lighter than we intend the finish ing colour mean in proportion to the glaze which will make it darker the high light be vermillion and white for sattin and velvet and vermillion for cloth the middie teint be vermillion with very little lake or indian red the shade teint be make with indian red and lake with the addition of little black in the darkest shadow the difference between scarlet and crimson be that the highlight of crimson be whiter and the middle teint be make darker they reslect be make with light light red and vermillion the high light should be lay and manage in the same manner as those of the blue for fear of dirty they and sometimes they require to be touch over the second time before we glaze they the more the colour of the second painting be drive the easier and better they may be manage to character but the high light should have good body of colour and be leave with delicate light touch after it be well dry we should finisn with glaze the whole with sine lake and improve the reflect and shadow remember that the scarlet require but very thin glaze and it be better to glaze the crimson twice over then lay too much at once painting pink colour there be two different method of painting pink colour one be by glaze the other be do with body of colour at one painting the sane grounds do for both which should be whitish colour incline to yellow for the light and indian red lake and white for the shadow the second painting for the glaze method be do with the same colour and little vermillion for the reflect and vermillion and white for the high light when it be dry we should glaze it with fine lake and then break and soften the shadow into character and har mony directly the other method be to make the high light with carmine and white the middle teint with lake white and little carmine and the shadow with lake and indian red with little vermillion for the reflect but remember the shadow will require to be break with some tender obscure teint yellow the ground for yellow should be yellowish white for the light and mixture of the oker for the shadow there be the fame number of teint in the yellow as there be in the white sattin the method of use they be the very same the light be make with king s yellow ground with clean goed drying oil the first teint be light oker change with little of the pearl teint make with the dark shade and white which should be lay and manage as the first teint in white sattin the middle teint be mixture of the light and brown oker soften with the pearl teint the shade teint be make with brown pink and brown oker these belong to the first lay the reflect be light oker and sometimes in the warmest part mix with little light red the shadow be strengthen with brown pink and burnt uinber these colour well manage will produce yellow very like van dyck but if we leave out the king yellow which be the high light only then it will be one of lely favourite yellow green the proper ground for green be light yellow green which be make of light oker little white and prussian for the light and the oker brown pink and prussian for the shadow the finest green we have for drapery be make of king yellow prussian and brown pink the high light be king yellow and very little prussian the middle teint have more prussian and the shade teint be make with some of the middle teint brown pink and more prussian but the darkest shadow be brown pink and little prussian the light and middle teint should be manage in the same manner as those of the bly the shade teint should be keep intirely from the light because the brown pink that be in it will in mixing dirty they as the black do those of the bly remember to allow for they drying à little darker and that the king s yellow should be ground with good drying oil for the longer it be dwying the more it will change and grow darker and the sooner it be use the better it will stand it be proper to have two sort of king yellow mean one to be very light which will do best for the high light of velvet changeable colour be make with four principal teint viz the high light middle teint shade teint and reflect teint the greatest art lie in find the exact colour of the middle teint because it have more of the general hue of the silk than any of the other the shade teint be of the same hue with the middle teint though it be dark enough for the shadow the high light though often very dif ferent from the middle teint should be of clean friendly working colour that will in mixing with it produce teint of clean sympa thize hue the method of painting silk be to make out the fold with the shade teint and then fill they up in the light with the middle teint this be what call the first lay which should be do to we satisfaction before we add any other colour and the stiffer the middle teint be use the better the high light may be lay upon it the reflect teint falls ge nerally upon the gradate half shade and should be lay with tender touch sparingly for fear of spoiling the first lay this method of painting answer to all the colcure silk as well as changeable with this differeuce only that the plain colour require not so much art in match the teint as the changeable do the last part of the work be the finish and strengthen the shadow with a obscure teint little incline to mellowish hue such as will not catch the eye and interrupt the beauty of the light black the best ground for black be light red for the light and indian red and little black for the shadow the finish colour be for the light black white and little lake the middle teint have less white and more lake and black the shade teint be make of a equal quantity of lake and brown pink with very little black the method of painting black be very different from that of other colour for as the principal thing in they be to leave they light clean and brilliant so in black it be to keep the shadow clear and transparent therefore we should begin with the shade teint and glaze over all the shadow with it next lay in the darkest shadow with black and little of the shade teint very correctly after that fill up the whole breadth of light with the middle teint only all which should be do exactly to the character of the sattin and then finisn with the high light here we may observe the ground be red will bear out and sup port the red which be use in the finish colour the lake in the light take off the cold hue and give it à more beautiful colour if the shade teint be of any other colour than transparent warm hue the shadow would consequently be black and heavy because no other colour can preserve the warm brilliancy which be want in the shadow of the black like lake and brown pink black be of cold heavy nature and always too strong for any other colour therefore we should make a allowance in use it there will be few reflect in sattin which should be add as those of other colour but they should be make of strong colour such as burnt umber or brown oker mixt with little of the shade teint though the grounds which have mention for the drapery be absolutely necessary for the principal and nearest figure in picture such as single portrait or the like yet do not intend they so for figure which be place more into the picture such as be behind the principal or front figure they grounds should always be fainter in proportion to they local finish colour line the colour use in line be the same as those in white sattin except the first teint which be make of white and ultramarine ash instead of the black and mixt to very light blueish teint in in the dead colour we should take particular care that the grounds be lay very white and broad in the light the shadow be make with black white and little indian red like the middle teint of white sattin these should be leave very light and clean in order to sup port the finish colour the second painting begin with glaze all the light with stiff pen cil and fine white only drive bare without use any oil the shadow may be scumble with poppy oil and some of the colour they be make of this be the first lay on which we be to follow with the finish colour directly the middle teint of white sattin be the best colour for the general hue of the shadow with this and white in different degree we should make out all the part to character with free light touch without softening then with large long point pencil and fine white lay the high light very nicely with one stroke after this come the fine light blueish teint which should be mix light and lay in the tender gradation very sparingly and lightly without sill they up remember the first lay should be leave clear and distinct the more it appear the better it be the overmix and join all the colour toge the which spoil the beauty of the character therefore it be better to let it dry before we add the reflect and finish teint the method of let the beautiful clear colour dry before we add the warm reflex and harmonizing teint prevent they from mixing and dirty each other the principal blend colour use in the reflect be the yellow teint green teint and the rose teint which last be make of lake indian red and white find glaze the pearl and lead colour with white though it seem to answer we purpose when it be do will cer tainly sink and be lose in the grounds on which it be lay therefore we should make the dead colour as white as we intend the finish colour by reason they will sink little in proportion to the colour of the cloth which the glaze with pure white only will recover landschape the principal colour use in landschape be fine white common white fine light oker brown oker brown pink burnt umber lvory black prussian blue uitramarine terra vert ii lake indian red vermillion king yellow the principal teint use in landschape be light oker and white light oker prussian and white light oker and prussian the same darker terra vert and prussian brown pink and prussian brown pink and brown oker brown pink oker and prussian indian red and white lvory black indian red and lake the colour necessary for dead colour be common white light oker brown oker burnt umber indian red lvory black and prussian the principal colour and teint for painting the sky be fine white uitramarine prussian light oker vermillion lake and indian red the teint be fine azure lighter azure light oker and white vermillion and white and teint make of white little vermillion and some of the light azure landschape should be paint on fort of tan leather colour which be make of brown oker white and light red this colour give warmth to the shadow colour and be very agreeable and proper for glaze sketch or rub in the design be the first work of the picture this should be do with burnt umber drive with drying oil and little oil of turpentine in faint slight scumble free manner as we shade with indian ink and water leave the colour of the cloth for the light as we do that of the paper remember in do it we leave no part of the shadow so dark as we intend the first lay or dead colour which be to be lighter than the finish colour and though the foliage of the tree be only rub in with faint sort of scumble yet the trunk and body should be in they proper shape with they breadth of light and shadow all kind of building should be do in the same manner leave the colour of the cloth for they light the figure on the fore ground if they be determine should also be sketch in the same method and then leave to dry of dead colour let the firft lay or dead colour be without any bright glaring or strong dark colour so that the effect be make more to receive and pre serve the finish colour than to shew they in the first painting the sky should be do first then all the distance and so work downwards to the middle group and from that to the fore ground and nearest nearest part remember all the part of each group as tree building or the like be all paint with the group they belong to the greatest secret in dead colour be to find the two colour which serve for the ground of the shadow in general the sky except and the method of ufe they with the light the first of which be the dark shade with little lake in it the other colour be only burnt um ber these should be little change to the natural hue of the object and then lay and drive with drying oil in the same manner as we shade with indian ink which be scumble kind of glaze and as such they should be leave for otherwise they will be dark and heavy and there fore would be intirely spoiled for the finish glaze both these colour mix and sympathize agreeably with all the light but should be lay before they when the landschape be design begin with the sky wnich should be lay with good body of colour and leave with faint resemblance of the principal cloud and this we fhould do more in the manner of claro obscuro than with finish colour the whiter it be leave the better it will bear out and support they the distance should be make out faint and obscurely with the dark shade and some of they light in different degree and lay so as best to find and shew they principal part as we come more into the middle group we fall by degree into the burnt umber in the shade all the grourds of the tree should be lay or rub in enough only to leave a idea of they shape and shadow faintly the ground of they shadow must be clean and lighter than they finish colour such as will support they character and seem easy to finish on in painting the light it be better to incline more to the middle teint than to the very high light and observe to leave they with sufficient body of clean colour which will receive and preserve the finish colour the better all which may be do with few teint after this go over the whole with the sweetener very lightly which will soften and mix the colour agreeably for finish second painting begin with the sky and lay in all the azure and colour of the hori zon then soften they after that lay in the general teint of the cloud and finisn on it with the high light and the other teint that be want ing with light tender touch then suften the whole with the sweetener very lightly remember the finish of the sky should be do all at once painting because the tender character of the cloud will not do so well as when the whole be wet observe that the stiffer the azure and colour of the horizon be lay the better the cloud may be paint upon they the greatest distance be chiessy make with the colour of the sky and as they grow nearer and darker we should glaze and scumble the part very thin with such glaze shadow colour as come nearest to the general hue of the group the object be in this glaze should be understand of darkish hue and that the first painting or dead colour should be see through it distinctly on this lay or ground we should add the finish colour now supposing this glaze ground be properly adapt to the object and place think then it will be easy to find the other colour which be want for the light and finissiings of the same but in lay thein we must take great care that we do not spoil the glaze therefore we should be very exact in make those colour on the pallet and then be sure to lay they with light free touch before proceed any farther it will be proper to say something of the most useful glaze colour lake terra vert prussian and brown pink be the four principal the more we manage they like indian ink and the more distinctly we leave they the better they transparent beauty will stand and appear pro vide we do it with good drying oil after these four glaze colour burnt umber be very good glaze warm brown and of great use in the break grounds and nearest part but the most agreeable colour for the the darkest shadow be the dark shade improve with lake it be fine warm shade when it be drive with drying oil no colour in the world be so sweet and sympathizing it mix harmonioussy with all the light as well as the shadow and be charming colour in the trunk and body of tree and in all kind of building we should make out all the ground of the object with such glaze shadow colour as seem nearest to the natural hue of the object in that situation but as the principal glaze colour themselves be often too strong and glaring they should therefore be little change and soften with such colour as be of near resemblance to themselves and the object thus ifit be in the distance the terra vert and azure which be they principal glaze colour may be improve and make lighter with some of the sky teint and as the distance come nearer with the purple as we get more into the middle group the terra vert and prussian may be change with some of the green teiat such as be make without white for white be the destruction of all glaze colour as we approach the first group there be less occasion for change ing they but the fore ground and its object require all the strength and force of glaze which the colour be capable of produce after this glaze ground we should follow with strengthen the same in the shadow and darkest place in such manner as will seem easy to finish which be the first lay of the second painting the colour that come next for finish be in the degree of middie teint these should be carefully lay over the greatest breadth of light in such manner as not to spoil and cover too much of the glaze do it with good body of the colour as stiff as the pencil can agreeably manage to character remember the colour of the middle teint should be of clean beautiful hue accord to these method think it will be easy to finisn all the second painting as we work down from the sky through the middle group as we come to the first group where all the object should appear perfectly finisn we should finish they under or most distant part before we paint any of the other which appear nearer observe this method dovn to the last and nearest object of the picture and where it so happen that painting one tree over another do not please forbear the second until the first be dry thin near tree of different colour will do better if we let the under part dry before we add the finish colour the third and last painting if oil be necessary lay the least quantity that can be which should be do with stump tool or pencil proportion to the place that be to be oil so that we may oil no more than be want then wipe the whole place that be oil with peice of silk handkerchief by this method we leave no more oil than be proper for we purpose when we be go to finisn any object we should remember to use great variety of teint very near of the same colour but most of all when we be finish tree this give richnef to the colour and produce harmony find by experience the green will fade and grow darker therefore it be highly necessary to improve and force they by exaggerating the light and make a allowance in use they so much the lighter for the same reason we should take great care that we ldo not overcharge and spoil the beauty of the glaze for if we do it will be dull and heavy and therefore will consequently grow darker the method for painting near tree be to make the first lay very near to nature though not quite so dark but more in the degree of middle teint and follow it with strengthen the shadow then the middle teint and last of all lay the high light and finish colour but all this can not be do as it should be at once painting therefore the best way be to do no more than the first lay with the faint shadow and leave it to dry then begin with improve the middle teint and shadow and let they dry the third and last workis add all the light and finish colour in the best manner we be able this method of leave the first and second part to dry separately not only make the whole much easier and more agreeable but leave the colour in the greatest perfection because most of the work may be do with scumble and glaze and some part without oil the light also may be lay with better body of colour which will not be mix and spoiy with the wvet ground what have say of tree answer the same to all kind of shrub and bush the figure in landschape be the last work of the picture those in the fore ground should be do first and those in the distance next for after the figure in the first and farthest group be paint think it will be much easier to find the proportion of those in the middle part of the picture and we should observe that the shadow of the figure should be of the same hue or colour with those of the group or place they be in introduction we be much oblige to the learn in the mathematick who in the beginning of this century make such great im provement in the principle of perspective and who have do they utmost to render they useful but for want of understanding the art of painting and the practice of design ing they be intelligible only to those reader who have sufficient fund of geometry to comprehend all they scheme and example they find that all plane be alike in geometry and follow they geo metrical genius which lead they into such construction as they think would explain they property in general and as they say give new turn to perspective indeed they scheme be so intricate that none but those who be well acquainted with the mathematick can under stand they dr taylor neglect the horizontal plane and in he book make no difference between that plane and any other whatsoever here it be that be quite of the reverse opinion to that learn gentle man and believe that the term of horizontal line should confine we notion to the horizontal plane and think that that plane which represent the earth on which we live enjoy some particular privileges which make the figure in it more easy and more convenient to be describe notwithstanding all plane be alike in geometry for which reason perspective reason have follow nature and have united the old and new prin ciple and believe that object be best understand fivin they natural appearance have give the horizontal plane to all my woik with the vanish line in its proper position here find it absolutely necessary to confider the subject in manner as yet unattempted and which should require no mathematical knowlege to understand it teis oblige I to find one general method for the whole work and find ing the principle few and simple upon which the art depend and that there be no more than three plane and six different line require to be understand in order to represent any ohject whatsoever compose such variety of object as conceive would draw on the knowiege of perspective and which think can not fail of render the useful principle of this art general and intelligible most gentleman that have study the mathematick whom have talk with on perspective be for have mathematical demonstration of all the lineal part of picture and will not allow that any thing can be right but what be do accord to the strictest rule and dr taylor say painter ought to govern himself intirely by the rule of perspective and not to take any liberty whatsoever confess be of they opinion and believe they be most certainly right provide the picture be only the projection of any of the five solid be we to follow the rule in project the base and capital of column we should find those useless operation too tedious and difficult for human patiencé and how we be to represent all sort of object accord to the rule of perspective be to I as surprising as impossible painter be not to be confine strictly to the rule of perspective but to make they subservient to he purpose nothing should tie up he hand he should not have he genius imprison but be at liberty to express he idea like gyofto with one stroke of he pencil and as fresnoy say let the compass be ratber in he eye than bis hand thete let he measure distinctly every object by comparison which be the principal talent of painter if he be well acquainted with the prin ciple of he art he will not stop at the dry rule of geometry wlailst he fancy be sketch all the principal part of the icture ile will preceed with the whole and then after the design be fix correct such part as be requisite with the rule of perspective design not to trouble the reader with multitude of example but to explain the general rule of perspective in such manner as may be intelligible to he all my scheme be limit to six plate only which be the suliject of the six different sort of line that represent all object whatsoever and which be adapt to such object as be easy to be anderstand and though design to take the reader out of the common road will not lead hiin any round about tedious bye way as be often the case shall conduct he directly into some beautiful garden where he may entertain himself with pleasing variety of object as building aventy walk and visto terminate with agreeable view of distant prospect and that he may enjoy they to he wish have intermix no figure that might interrupt or divide he attention plate figure order to explain the general rule of perspective let we suppose twe see the real object as part of garden with some distant prospect and between they and the spectator s eye let we imagine transparent plane as glass to be place perpendicularly on the ground at the nearest part of the object on or thro which plane we see they representation and it be with the assistance of this imaginary plane that we be to understand the principle and be suppose to produee the perspective projection or representation the seat or line on which this plane stand be call the base line as zy the line hi at the horizon be call the horizontal line the height or distance this line be from the base line be always equal to the height of the eye of the spectator and be always draw parallel to the base line the the distance which we be from the imaginary plane when at the station where we propose to take the perspective view be the distance of the picture the point of sight be the principal point in picture it be that point where line from the spectator s eye cut the imaginary plane at right angles and which always distinguisn with the letter the line so be equal to the distance of the picture and cut the horizontal line at right angles as the principal ray do the imaginary plane therefore be the eye point because it represent the eye transfer from its first position or point of view to the imaginary plane the next thing we be to consider be the ground plane the ground plane be that part which be below the base line zy lt be the plane whereon the plan of the geometrical or original object be draw though we be oblige to have the ground plane below the base line yet the part which be in it will be produce by the rule above it and as it be beyond it at distance in perspective proportion as those in the ground plane be distant from the base line we should remember that in order to represent any object in per spective it be necessary that we understand they geometrical plan eleva tion profile and section before we attempt the perspective projection in the beginning of the work we should first draw the base line then asfume point for the point of sight and draw the horizontal line through it make so equal to the distance of the picture and design the geo metrical plan of the object in the ground plane here the geometrical or original object be the point the repre sentation of which be require to be find in the imaginary plane or picture first draw line from the give point to cut the base line in any direction at pleafure as ab parallel to that draw line from the eye point to cut the horizontal line which give the vanish point for the representation of the line ab here the line os be parallel to the line ab therefore will be the vanish point draw the line bs and ao the intersection of which be the representation seek the linc ba be also the representation of its original ba we may find the representation of the seat or place where the pine tree grow without use the original in the ground plane thus bring down the distance to the horizontal line as sd and bring up ba to the base line as bc which make bc and sd parallel then line draw from cto will cut the line bs in therefore if we suppose the imaginary plane to be the picture and have assume the line bs in which we suppose the pine tree make bc on the bottom of the picture equal to the distance we suppose or know the tree be beyond the imaginary plane which distance be commonly call the require distance then the line cd will intersect bs which give the representation seek be the vanisning point of the original line ab because the line ab vanissy in that poift the representation depend on the parallelism of the line os and ab for be they parallel in any other direction they would then project the point in the very same place nowv after this explanation of the first figure we should remember that the imaginary plane be to be understand and call the picture fi let be five original point give in the ground planc to find they representation zy be the base lipe dv the horizontal line the point of sight and the distance of the picture instead of draw the line from the point in any direction we may draw two parallel line thro four of the point to the base line as cg and df which will shorten the work then draw they parallel ov from the eye point to cut the horizontal line which will give the vanishiing point drawgv and ƒv and intersect they with the ray co and do which give the representation the point and be in line that be parallel to the base line the representation of which must be parallel to the base line also which be intersected by the ray eo give the point then will the point be the representation of the original point the projection seek we may find they representation without use the ground plane thus bring down the distance of the vanish point to the hori zontal line as and bring up the line côg and daf to the basc line then draw line from they to the point which will intersect the line gv and ƒv in the same point as may be see by the line vh all circle and curve line figure be represent by find several point in they and then join they neatly by hand therefore we should assume in the original line only so many point as be absolutely necessary and in such manner as may be easy for the work of the pro jection fig be the method of divide the visual line es into any number of part as the tree let zy be the base line the point of sight so the distance of the picture and sd that distance bring to the horizontal line and let the line es be require to be divide into give number of part equal to fe first bring up the give space fe to the base line as ie and draw the line which intersect es in the point or the seat of the first tree instead of continue the division on the base line we may draw aline from the first division to the point of sight and by make the line parallel to e we have new scale of the space at its place in the picture therefore all the rest be find by this repetition plate ii fig line that interfect or cut the picture at right angles be call direct line which line will vanish in the point of sight therefore we see row of tree or the like which be in parallel line contract themselves and seem to grow more and more narrow the far the they be extend froin the eye the representation of direct line be call visual line or ray here the line ab and ƒg be direct line whose representation be the visual bs and which vanish in the point of sight as do also both the green wall the walk and the side of the building that be parallel to they the side of the building at have its part as the base and frize parallel to the base line but those in the side where the window be and which be perpendicular to the first vanish in the point of sight the same hold with respect to the pavilion fig zy be the base line the point of sight de the horizon tal line and so the distance of the picture be directline the representation of which vanisn in the point of sight in order to understand the nature of the generating line and angles and the distance of the picture be place above the horizontal line suppose they be turn or lift upon they axis the vanish line de till the eye point be directly opposite to the point of sight then they would be in visual plane which pass from the spectator s eye parallel to the ground plane the intersection of which plane with the imaginary plane or picture be the vanish line of that plane or hori zontal line line which be dravn from the exe point to the horizontal line produce the vanish point be call generating line they be also the parallel of original line in the first figure plate os be the parallel of the line ab in the second ov be the parallel of the line cg and df in the third the principal ray be the parallel of the line fe and in the fourth figure plate il it be the same to the line ab and fg the generating line oe be parallel to the diagonal el give the vanish point of that line and do the vanish point of the other diagonal dk the line op be also the parallel of the original line le therefore pis the vanish point of that line the line that generate the vanish point of two original line make the same angle at the spectator s eye or eye point as the original line do with each other here the generating angle soe be equal to that of dle and produce that of sle and the angle dos be equal to that of dke and pro duce that of dk the angle pos be also equal to that of elf and pro¬ duce the angle pis lf we consider the plane of the picture as ceiling these object which be lay on the ground will then appear perpendicular to the plane of the ceiling this fort of perspective be easy because the representation of object which be parallel to the plane of the ceiling be similar to they original and therefore will retain they geometrical form plate iii will representation of object parallel to the picture be parallel to its original therefore those line that be parallel to the picture have no vanissiing point because the original line which should produce the parallel be also parallel to the picture line that be parallel to the picture be call transverse line fig zy be the base line hl the horizontal line the point of sight and sd the distance of the picture in the horizontal line which be point just behind the tree in this picture all the object but the approach walk and the green wall be parallel to the picture here have give the plan of the four tree and the graf plot and bz the distance the wall be from the picture which distance be find by the intersection of line from to the point and the visual zs as in the base line of the wall make n equal to nm and draw the vifual ns intersect that with the line d which will give the corner of the grass plot c be the distance the tree be from the picture the intersection of the line sd and the visual will give the representation of the seat of the tree whose plan be through which point draw line parallel to the rcaae in which the line will be the seat of four tree and the end of the green wall the rest of this figure need no explication fi my be the base line be the point of sight sd the hori zontal line and distance of the picture plane that be perpendicular to the horizontal plane be call vertical plane therefore the imaginary plane or picture be vertical plane whose intersection with the ground plane be the base line the object whose side be mnrd be in the plane of the picture and those of and be in plane parallel to the picture the line og be the vanish ing line of vertical plane which cut the picture in that direction the distance of any vanish line which pass through the point of sight be equal to the distance of the picture therefore gs and os be equal to sd in order to project the object draw the visual fs for thg upper side then draw the two diagonal no and fg and the sidehl which will complete the whole square in the plane of the picture be the geome trical of the end of the beam in in this seventh figure it be obvious after the vanish line they center and distance be fix that the rule for draw the appcar ance of object upon the vertical or perpendicular planc be the sanie as those for represent they on the horizontal plane which rule will answer the same to inclined plane the line which pass through ol be the vanishiing line of a ineline plane which incline to the picture in the direction of the line do and ol be the distance of that vanisning line it be the length of do which last be the parallel of the inclined plane more will be say on this subject when we come to the inclined plane plate iv fig be the base line hi the horizontal line the point of sight and so the principal ray or distance of the picture the two direct line can and kl be part of the original whose visual line as and lave terminate this agreeable walk my design in this picture be chiefly to shew the representation of line which be perpendicular to the ground plane whose original seat be the pro jection of which be the intersection of the visual as and the ray co as à the object which have make choice of for the perpendicular line be the fust of the gothic column the axis of which be next to be demonstrate let ab in the plane of the picture be the give height of the per pendicular line then will the visual bs determine the top and line draw from the seat perpendicular to the base line give the axis of the column the representation seek tle reprefentation be in avisual plane which pass from the line ab through the column the face of the green wall and vanish in the visual point this visual plane be also vertical plane because it be in à perpendicular direction there be also perpendicular plane which pass through the axe of the yew or cone tree in which be find they height they seat may be find as fig in the first plate the situation of the building be parallel to the picture which may be observe by they parallel part corresponding with the base line fig zy be the base line the point of sight de the hori zontal line so the distance of the picture go be the vanish line of the vertical plane and sd be its distance place perpendicular to it all thefe object be in perpendicular position to the horizontal plane therefore all they side be in perpendicular or vertical plane the figure be the representation of cube which have its nearest side in the plane of the picture the perspective of the upper face in the horizontal plane be shew by the visual and the diagonal from and in the vanish line of that plane the projection of the side in the vertical plane be also shew by the visual and diagonal g and of here have make the double pro ection to this cube only to fhew how exactly alike the principle be to both the plane which will appear more if we turn the paper so that the vanish line go be in the horizontal position then the horizontal scheme will be change to the vertical and consequently appear so the pillar have that and its opposite side parallel to the plane of the picture but the other side be in vertical plane which vanisn in the visual point the plan be shew by the diagonal to it be obvious from this figure that all object which be parallel to the picture can not alter nor change they shape for if we suppose line continue from all the part to the vanish point and that they be cut by plane in vertical and paralh direction to the picture yet then every section vould retain the original form of the side the pillar place obliquely with the base line have its nearest angle in the plane of the picture the vanish point be produce by the generating line which make the rig angle at the eye point as doe the representation of which be dhe and dle the side be in vertical plane that pass through the line lh and vanish in the point the other side be in the plane hl and therefore vanish in the point in order to project the bottoin bring down the distance of the vanish point to the vanish line as make hf equal to the side and draw fe which give the side h draw line from paral lel to the base line to intersect hd which give the other side but if the vanish point be not at equal distance from the point of sight which be here the vanisning point of the diagonal then it would be necessary to draw line from to and from through which would give the other side the triangular pillar have its nearest angle in the plane of the picture and its plan in the ground plane the projection of which be find by bring the side to the base line as and draw which give the side mthe visual line be the distance of bring dovn to the horizontal line draw which give the other side then raise the side and finifh the top the side be in vertical and visual plane the side vanifhy in the point the nearest part of object will in they representation be farthest from the vanish line of the horizontal plane and if that vanish line be in the middle they top and bottom would then be exactly similar as may be understand by these ohject imagine from the principle which have already lay down the reader will be inclined to believe that the representation of object may be project without the ground plane for if we understand the original why should we not use the same rule at the part of the object in the picture where the projection be require as if it be below the bottom of the picture which method would certainly shorten the work and make it more easy plate fig ie tlie base line pi the horizontal line the point of sight so the distance of the picture and ab part of a original oblique line all tlie object in this picture be represent to the eye obliquely not one visual line be to be find in the work except the principal ray the vanish point vary in they distance from the point of sight the situation of the wall be govern by the original line ab the paral lel of which be ov and po be perpendicular to it this make the generating angle pov degree which determine the end of the wall to be square in order to find the perspective of the wall we should first find the representation of the plan from which we raise the elevation the whole be govern by two vanish point with they distance bring to the vanish line make it very easy the seat of the tree be sound as that in figure plate by make they distance or space from the firsttree parallel to the base line and divide the line ap as es in that figure but reinember it shouldbe with the distance of the vanish point the obelisk at be place with the walk have they vanish point the corner of the building at be square though it appear a obtuse angle which be ow to the little distance of the picture for have the point pbeen at much greater distance the obliquity of the line pz would appear more to the satisfaction of the eye fig here az be the base line pv the horizontal line the point of sight and so the distance of the picture design to begin with the projection of the wall and after that of the floor then the object rt and so finisn with the moulding above the wall the generating angle pov be right angle therefore those of the wall will be square we should first make the corner cl then the side and next that of assume the corner xy and draw line from it to to intersect those of cv and iv which will give the side and make the side which finish the wall the line oh divide the angle pov equally and ch be its repre sentation be the vanish point of line that intersect the wall as diagonal do the side of square let be be the diagonal of the first square draw av and ap intersect they with pe and have which give the square abcd the next diagonal be be by this repitition it be eafy to see how the whole floor be project design the corner of the object rt to be exactly over the point and that its side opposite to should touch the wall let a in the plane of the picture be the give height of the corner therefore that corner be the intersection of ev and perpendicular from the side next the wall and its opposite be in vertical plane the vanish line of which be vh because it pass through the point in that direction and be the vanish point of the common intersection of the vertical and horizontal plane be the distance of the vanish point bring down to the horizontal line the place where we should make the original angle of inclination as veh which be the angle the object be suppose to make with the floor and be the vanish point of the inclination lf from the point we draw line perpendicular to he to cut the vanish line hv then will that point be the vanish point of line perpendicular to the side the perpendicular at give the length of draw all the side to they vanish point which finish the repre fentation the mosl exact and casiest method of project moulding in archi tecture be to make the geometrical profile at its place in the picture which design to stiew by the projection of these three moulding that represent fort of cornice let ikl be the geometrical profile of the moulding place at the top of the wall to the line cl draw line from the vanish point of the diagonal through cut that with line from through the intersection of which be the extremity of the projection by repeat this method at every point of the profile down to the bottom we shall have the exact representation in vertical plane which pass through the angle or mitre joint when this projection of the mitre joint be find we hane nothing more to do but to continue the line of the side in they proper direction plate vi this picture be the representation of large block of stone whose angles be square like those cube it stand on one of its edge on the horizontal plane and be support by another block the line cp be the seat of the edge it stand on and cv be the seat of the side its angle of inclination with the horizontal plane be equal to the angle veh therefore be the vanish point of its inclination fi let zy be the base line pe the horizontal line the point of sight s the distance of the picture and the vanish point of the edge the block stand on first we must find the vanish point of line that be perpendi cular to the point thus draw line from to the eye point and and make ov perpendicular to the line op which give the vanish point then will be the vanish point of the seat of the side which side be in vertical plane whose vanish line pass thro in that direction therefore be the vanish point of the ccinnion inter section of the vertical and horizontal plane draw the vanish line gh then will be its center and vo its distance make have per pendicular to the vanish line gh and equal to its distance vo then at the point make the geometrical angle of inclination as veh which give the vanish point of the inclination draw eg per pendicular to eh which make in that vanish line the vanish point of line perpendicular to next draw the vanish line ph and make sd parallel to it and equal to the distance of the picture then from the point of sight draw line to cut the vanish line ph at right angles which give the center and id the distance of that vanish line here it be obvious in this projection that the line ph gh and pg be the three vanish line of the several face of figure which con tain solid right angle it be also very plain that the line eh accord to thefe rule must be the geometrical of the original inclined plane therefore if we make eb equal to the end or thickness of the block then will be the seat of as on the horizontal plane to proceed with the projection make ab in the plane of the picture equal to ab then will the point be the nearest angle of the block next we should make ik equal to id and draw the line pk and hk that generate square angle which be equally divide by the line ke make bl equal to the length of the block and parallel to the vanish line ph draw line from to the distance of which will give the side bn draw nh and the diagonal be and thro they intersection draw line from which give the upper side next draw the line bg which give bc the nearest edge and draw the line bp cp and bh ch then the line ng and one from the angle above to will finisn the whole representation or projection of ghe block have endeavour to shew in the progress of all the scheme chat the principle on which the whole art depend be so simple that it be obvious the method be general to all plane alike first of the horizontal plane the distance of the picture inust be place from the center or point of sight perpendicular to its vanish line before we can make the generating angy which give the vanish ing point then we may bring down they distance to the horizontal line provide the dimension of the original be bring parallel to they as have shew in the course of the work secondly of the vertical plane the distance of the vanish line be place perpendicular to it and from the eye point proceed the gene rating line that give the vanish point the distance of which be use and bring to the vanish line in the same manner as those of the horizontal plane and the inclined plane have its distance place perpendicular to the vanisning line and from the eye point proceed the generating line and angles which produce the vanish point and which be also bring to the vanish line and use as those of the horizontal the method of find the center of vanish line be only to draw line from the point of sight to cut or intersect the vanish line at right angles which intersection will be the center of that vanish line the general rule for find the distance of vanish line be always to make the distance of the picture from the point of sight parallel to that vanish line and to draw line from that to the center of the vanish line which will be the distance of that vanish line as di be to the vanish line ph or ov to that of gh to find the perspective representation of circle we be oblige to make plan of the circle or part of the plan by add such line to it as may easily be project and leave clear idea of the require circle for let be the point of sight and the point of distance and klm the scheme of the plan the most exact and easiest method be to inclose the circle with square and then make the two diameter and diagonal which give the eight require point but instead of draw line thro the point of the diagonal parallel to the side of the square make they parallel to the diagonal this method give the same point with the line nearer to the circle than can be draw by any other method whatsoever the rest of the figure need no demonstration fi shew the method of make the plan of the circle in order to find the perspective representation of the torus which have do accord to my method juft shew of draw circle and which may be understand very easily at sight of this figure the perspective of the torus seem to be circle contain in four line which be nearer or farther distant from each other accord to the situation of the eye two of which be perpendicular to the hori zontal plane these give the greatest breadth of the torus the other twe be parallel to that plane and give the height and depth the one be the upper and farthest part of the circle the other the nearest and bottom part of the torus the two perpendicular line proceed from the ex tremity of the circle in the plan which be find from the projection of the two eight opposite part those that give the height and depth be govern by the perspective section of the base which be in the vertical plane fio be the diagonal scale which be of universal use for tranf ferr all sort of defign to the greatest exactness and so easy to under stand that one demonstration be sufficient for every artist who will imagine find no manner of difficulty in apply it to practice suppose ab to represent one foot in the design which we be to work from and be to be the intend length of one foot in that which we be go to make the method be first to take the dimension of the part we propose to begin with then to place the compass to the base line of the scale and find what it be in the line db then open they to that in the line dc which will be the require length thus the reprefentation be find by foot and inch because the base line do contain twelve part which consequently divide the length ab and be on the line de and dc into that number by this method we may make the scale to any proportion and as it be the business of every artist to find proper scale for he purpose there fore painter be not oblige to use always such scale as the work be wring to suppose we draw the pedestal without use the method of foot and inch divide the whole height into any convenient number of equal part and let one of those be for the scale then divide the height we intend to make the pedestal of in the same manner and apply they to the method of the scale which will answer we purpose as well it be sometimes necessary in copying to divide the original into number of square and then divide the cloth for the copy the same lf in one of the square at the corner of the cloth we make the scale accord to this method we may use they as we do the scale of foot and inch the number in the base of the scale be at we pleasure remember to make the square very large for none but novice make they otherwise fi be method which have often find to be of great use and very easy to practise when we be à little use to it suppose the line a to be the height of any design we have to work from and the line bb the intend height of that which we be go to make draw the base can then place the design perpendicular to it as a bb and draw line from through to cut the base which will give the center if the line a be divide into any number of part and we draw line from the center cthrough they to cut the linebb then will they divide the line bb in the same manner exactly therefore if the line a be the axis of à column and entablature the same may be transfer to the height we would have it by have small nail in the center and fine thread such as the wig maker weave with and only strain the same over the part in a to bb which will give the require dimension in the same manner we may have all the breadth by apply they to the line a and continue they to the line bb or if it be only few of they as the diameter they may be do separately but remem ber that after the place of the line a and bbare fix they must con tinue so till the whole be finish the antique figure in the sixth plate mark with the letter be a object have study with great application and care in order to project it exactly accord to the rule of perspective and as improve in the knowlege of the new principle flatter myself should succeed believe if iarrive at such perfection in the art should then be able in time to represent all object whatsoever as some of the learn in the mathematick will have it accord to the strictest rule who dogma tically asfert that every part of the perspective should be mathematically true when we fancy this to be really the case it be reasonable to believe that we should be anxious to learn a art which we think so absolutely nece sary now gentle reader must confess my weakness and tell you that notwithstanding all my care and puzzling after this mathematical truth find the undertake be too great for iy capacity and therefore from the experience of my folly determine to give up the attempt and flatter myself no farther with such expectation but whenever the rule which have shew should fail and grow tedious which believe will not happen in matter of consequence ldesign immediately to settle the affair at sight of the object the volute in the capital of column and the twist in stair case be object of this nature and very probably be take from this a tique it have also great resemblance to mr hogarth s precise serpentine line and therefore without doubt have some grace though the twist be little quicker it be a object of well varied contents whose pro portion gradually lessen to its extremity and its dimension be governod by fitness variety uniformity simplicity intricacy and quantity what pity it be this venerable object of antiquity should not be represent by the strictest rule of perspective confef this would afford matter of triumph to any learn critic that be happy enough to succeed in the attempt in pursuance of we present inquiry suppose accord to certain chimerical new system the object under we consideration be imagine to have all its inward contents nicely scoope out and the eye at once to view the whole from within and mark the opposite corresponding part and take care to acquire perfect idea of the distance and bearing of they several material point and line in the surface or for the more easy description of the projection suppose we be to gauge the contents with wire in order to assist and guide we to readier conception of all che intervene part leave it to the critic to judge of what use these expedient be towards raise in the imagination true and perfect idea of the antique in question the pamphlet intitule critical examination of the painting on the ceiling of the banqueting house at white hall shew that that celebrate ceiling have nine separate point of sight and that no painting can appear perfectly true unless see from the point intend by the painter and though picture may be perfectly true from one certain point of view it can not from any other therefore the author have take great care of shew the necessity of regard picture as intend by the painter the picture he fay be alaaays confider as transparent surfaae be medium through which the visual ray be sippose to pass if the spec tator cbange he situation those ray in nature will intersect that sur face in different point and therefore in the picture be determine to such certain point tbe station of the spectator become necessarily fix and unalterable and the picture must appear false see otberwife suppose we see through window or transparent plane real cube place directly opposite though somewhat below the eye in this situation we shall see only two face one in front and the other at top and if we move to the right or leave we must see one of the other face this ishis proposition which be certainly teue in order to understand the principle of perspective we be oblige to consider the picture as transparent plane thro which the visual ray paf to the spectator s eye but when the design be really picture whose representation be fix upon some opaque body as board wall or paint cloth that can not be transparent but flat smooth surface and the object represent be cube that shew only two face one in front and the other at top though we move to the right or leave from the point of sight we shall never see more by change the place nei the be it reasonable to believe we should for if we find the same appear ance though move from the point intend by the painter the case be not akter which shew there be no necessity of have the eye of the spectator exactly in that identical point if the spectator s eye must coincide with the point of sight the distance should be consider accordingly and it will then be very difficult mat ter to come at the proper point of view to see the picture and the more so as its horizon when hang up be seldom so low as the eye own the sight of the pamphlet excite my curiosity to examine the ceiling and find the centre of the whole to be the only point of sight requisite in all that noble design for from the middle of the room see the intention of that great painter and be convinced of it from the order of the whole and by the natural position of the figure which appear all finely foreshorten and look like such living object view from the middle of the room below which be in my opinion the principal point of view that ruben intend for the whole ceiling am also of opinion that all ceiling except those of gallery or long room should have but one point of sight and that there be some subject which believe require no point of sight as living object represent in the cloud which have no architecture nor any terrestrial appearance which be the case with most of the work in this ceiling and if there be no point of sight require in the work of the picture then think there be none in regard to its be truly see because the eye can not coincide with the point that never be make or intend it be not material to take notice of the most dry and lifeless part of the performance lexpect mo highmore would have give we some ingenious remark on the foreshortenings of the figure and of the excellence of the colour which presume would have be more agreeable to he reader than tell they that ruben be little deficient in a art which be never understand as he might have say till this century but it be reasonable to believe if he leisure have permit he to examine the whole he would have find much to commend and very little to censure as it may be expect that should say something of the perspective of shadow shall only observe that the geometrical or perspective know lege of shadow be of very little consequence to painter it be easily understand when we have learn that of the object but in my opinion painter may spare themselves the trouble of learn the lineal perspec tive of shadow because they business be to shun every thing of that nature in picture all the limit and shape of shadow should vanisn cvery part that be hard and edgy cut and offend the eye have now give my reader the best insight in my power to the practice of painting and perspective hope they will excuse the size of this treatise which it have be my study from its first projection to con fine to as narrow limit as possible be from experience convinced that a art if properly can not be too concisely describe therefore am forry could not from the nature of the subject reduce it to fhorter or lesser work
