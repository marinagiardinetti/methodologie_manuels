the draw school for little master andmiss contain the most easy and concise rule for learn to draw without the assistance of teacher emibellistied with great variety of figure curiously defign to which be add the whole art of kite make the author 's new discovery in the preparation of water colour by master michael angelo london print for carnan at number st paul church yard to he royal highness prince edward this draw school with all due submission and respect humbly inscribe to he as patron of the art bx he royal highness 's most obedient and devote servant michael angelo the preface to the second edition after have peruse almost every book hitherto publish for the instruc tion of young people in the art of draw have find they calculate only for those who be advanced above the period of childhood many of they contain nothing but design without the least direction how to proceed and even in those that have term of art and geometrical propor tion as tend rather to deter youth from the study of this science than encourage they in the purfuit of it there be it be true book of drawing sell at every print shop for six pence each but if the purchsser expect to find in any one of they all the different part of the hu man body he will be much mistaken the first he lay he hand on may confist of land preface to the scape the second of bird and in the third he may find leg or a arm and perhaps body complete should he express he desire to have one contain every limb separate he will be tell that such a one can not be have under five or six sbilling ihave here attempt with no small share of care and application to form such piece as apprehend will be of singular service to those who wishi to become proficient in draw ing at very trifling expence and will venture to asfert that whoever shall make themselves perfect master of what it contain will find no great difficulty in imitate what ever they may afterwards meet with in much more expensive work have not only give the different part of the human body but have likewise introduce twelve bird in dif ferent attitude and give some direction for the preparation of water colour the first principle of draw can not be teach too early and be fully convinced that young child might be bring to tolerable knowledge of it long before that age in which they be generally first put to it child be naturally fond of picture and second edition it be no uncommon thing to sée they before they be teach how to hold pen draw house and steeple dog and horse be this disposition which seem natural to the generality of child properly en courage and make rather matter of amuse ment than tafk we should probably see many prodigy at seven or eight year of age and time might make they artist equal to those of italy the human figure and particularly the face be the most difficult study but when the young pupil have make himself perfect master of this he will find no great difficulty in any thing else for this reason have give copy of various face from the moff easy gradually encrease to those which be difficult would advise such parent as may chuse to put this little work into the hand of they child not to impose these lesson on they as task but merely as a amuse ment not to treat they with severity if they do not properly attend to they but to encourage they by trifling reward such as be great in the eye of child when they make preface make any remarkable improvement though ' they may not understand draw themselves yet surely there can be but few if any who can not tell when the design here give be properly imitate have add the whole art of kite mak ing be induce to give it place here by the manner in which it be write though it be a amusement of child only yet even they amusement should be think of and though every little artist may think himself perfectly acquainted with this matter yet it be possible on read this treatise he may change he opinion and find himself totally unacquainted with the essential of kite making of this second edition nothing more seem necessary to be say than that we have re vise the whole and give some new draw ing instead of those in the former edition draw school lesson my young pupil must not expect to be come perfect artist in day week or month no science be to be acquire but by time and industry and it would be kind of cowardice in any one to be do hearten at the first or second trial merely because they do not succeed in they expec tation have see many little folk when pretty draw have be shew they ex press the most eager desire to be able to pro duce the like which undoubtedly they might in time have do would they have have pa tience but not be able to arrive at the desire ability on the first trial they have give the whole over as impracticable it be not such pupil want as they will only tend to bring my work into disgrace and deter other from consult it to you who be my patient little pupil the draw school now address myself and shall proceed to set you forward in you work and will not leave you till have teach you the true rule of proportion for on this depend the whole beauty of you drawing you first attempt should be to draw hu man figure for when you can do that per fectly well you will be able to copy almost any thing but in this you must begin by degree you must provide vourself with sine pen paper that be ftout and smooth and good black lead pencil it will be time enough to think of hair pencil india ink and colour when you have make tolerable progress in this art instead of loose paper many make ufe of common copy book such as be generally use for writing in at school and this be preferable to loose paper because the young artist will there by have a opportunity of preserve all he operation from the beginning and may whenever he please compare former attempt with the present and there by see how much he im prove he first attempt should be of the easiest kind such as the follow for little master and miss this be mouth and part of nose attempt this first with you pencil but do not despair if what you do should be hut little like it even after several trial for time and industry will certainly conquer all thing be sure strictly to follow this rule never to begin another figure till you can draw the former perfectly well when vou find you can imitate this pretty well with you pencil you may then draw it with you pen compare you own draw ing with the copy and not leave it till you come very near to it this will be sufficient for the first lesson lesson ii if my young pupil have go throt they first lesson in week think they have make sufficient haste in they progref for slow beginning generally make quick end ing but to proceed as you have now the draw school learn to draw the mouth and the lower part of the nose it be necessary you should add chin to they otherwise the nose and mouth would be of little use as every young artist well know however here be chin add to the former nose and mouth little practice will bring you to form this chin very properly as there be no compli cate stroke the ein and thus you will have learn the lower part of face after this you may proceed to the eye to draw the eye properly require somo time and attention and the young artist must not expect to do it perfectly tull after many trial he must first make the ball of the eye then the curve strong line over it and for little master and miss and the semicircle under it after that the other line and shading above and below it in larger figure the eye will require to be make moch fuller and ornament with many other shading but the artist who be once become expert at draw this will soon find it easy to draw any other that shall fall in he way the ear be no less difficult to draw than the eye and require equal care and attentior draw the outer part first and do this seyeral time before you attempt to meddlétiwith the inside when you find you can imitafé the outside tolerably well and that after re peat trial you may then proceed to fi nish it but do not be in haste to get out of this lesson into new one ' it would be ad viseable before you proceed any farther to go over again what you have already do lesson iii ave now learn to make the nose mouth eye and ear the next thing to be attempt be to form face be cording to the rule of proportion without sufficient knowledge of which it will be in vain for the young artist to proceed any fur the with hope of applause first draw the oval which must be well proportion like the above when you have make one to you mind draw line quite across across exactly in the center and another at a equal distance between the former and the chin after this draw line from the top of the oval to the bottom on the center line draw the eye and little above they place the eyebrow very little above the lower line be the place for the lower ex tremity of the nose or nostril below that line be place the mouth and at the bottom of the oval be make stroke for the chin thus will the eye nose mouth be place accord to thé rule of proportion when you have thus finish the face you may then draw the ornament round the head and the two line at bottom which form the neck and part of the shoulder when you be fully convinced that you can do this properly you may then take one step further and attempt the follow this be nothing more than the former more perfectly finish in which the eye nose and mouth be distinctly represent it will be prudent at first to attempt this only with the black lead pencil as the pupil may then rub out with bit of bread such stroke as appear to he erroneous after he think he can draw it tolerably well he may try he skill with he pen but let he remember to draw the line which be to direct he where to place the eye nose with he pencil only that he may rub they out when the ink of he draw be dry and there by give he head the more graceful appearance when he can do this head to perfection he may congratulate himself on have arrive to some tolerable degree of knowledge in the art lesson iv the young pupil have hitherto be em ploy in learn to draw the front or full face he must now proceed to draw the face look sideways which be call pro file he may first attempt the follow very casy one he must begin this at the nose and pro ceed downwards if he have take pain in learn the precede lesson he will find no difficulty in this but may soon proceed to the follow this be something more expreffive than the last and consequently require little more attention here the young student mustob¬ serve that the lower extremity of the nofe be make much different from the last and that the lip appear thicker and accompany with more stroke all this he must carefully observe and endeavour to imitate they as near as possible as it be undoubtedly necessary for the learner to learn face in all direction here be one look the opposite way and not have be use to it he will at first find it à little difficult if he use himself at first to draw face in one direction only he will find it à difficult matter to break himself of it and will there by remain only half a be tist but time and practice will make they equally familiar we have already mention in what man ner the learner be to koow in what part of the head he be to place the eye it may not now be improper to acquaint he how the eye be to be direct upwards or downwards here the learner will ' observe that the eye be place higher in the head than be¬ fore direct and that instead of streight curve line be use which incline upwards my pupil will see by the figure what effect this you perceive be the reverse of tha former the eye be bring rather lower than usual and the curve line incline down ward which make the figure as though look ing at something beneath it patience and good deal of practice will in time make these thing familiar lesson this lesson will not be very difficult provide the young artist have properly attend to the precede since they be ra the copy to improve he by practice than as contain any thing materially new though they may be necessary in order to pre pare he for the difficult tafk which he will meet with in the next lesson this be pretty little bald pate fellow who have perhaps tear all the hair off he head by run it into busn after some bird 's nest however be that as it will first draw the outline observe not to give he less hair than he have and to imitate the few stroke resemble it as nearly as possiuie be careful likewise to observe the form and situation of the ear then proceed to the eye nose and mouth and carefully finiss the whole it be difficult to say whether this little fal low ' head want comb or whether he be naturally what we call shock head it be no matter which but this be certain that the young artist will find this head of hair little more difficuit to imitate than the last he must observe nicely the stroke in every part and be carefal that he do not over look the ear which seem almost bury in the hair this little gentleman be look down at something and it be possible that it may be athis book you have already be direct how to give the proper turn to the eye in order to direct the look of the figure down ward you must likewise observe that this be rather front face than profile though the head be so much inclined one way as to leave only one ear expose to view you observe that this head be in different situation from either of the other three for here be onlyone eyé see and that almost obscure by lock of hair he be little sulky look fellow but never mind that do he all the justice you can in draw he very likeness do not overlook the small part of the ear which be leave open to view and be particularly attentive to the nose mouth and chin lesson vi hope my young pupil have be very at tentive to the precede lesson other wise they will cut but poor figure in this which be by far the most difficult they have yet have and which to execute properly will require all they experience care and at tention this as well as the two follow be a antique in which the different paffion of the mind be express it will be adviseable for the young pupil to draw this with he pencil several time before he attempt it with he pen as he will find occasion to remove many of he stroke or at least to amend they let he first begin with the forehead nose mouth chin and eye and by no means attempt to draw any other part of the head till he can imitate these to nicety by mak ing he feature the same as those of the co py when he can do this perfectly well he may proceed to draw the ear thé hair the neck and shoulder and complete all by ad ding to it any stroke that may appear to be want the young pupil will easily perceive that this be more difficult copy than the former as every feature be much more bold and ex preffive he must spare neither time nor attention to draw every stroke exact and not pretend to proceed till he can nearly equal the copy let he first draw the eye nose and mouth and then the side of the face after this he may proceed to the ear then the hair and finisn with the neck as kind of reward to mylittle artè for the pain he have take in the twe preced ing drawing have heig give ifim ver pretty head of nun whichtiie will not find so difficult as the former perhaps be lead he begin first with the face then draw the veil and finisn with the neck it will be well worth the pupil ' while to continue som time in this lesson for when he can drau these three head to perfection he may then poast of have acquire no small skill in the useful and divert science of draw and every thing that follow will become pleasure rather than toil lesson vii ave giy the necessary instruc tion and example for draw head and face we shall now proceed to the arme and hand which the vo pupil will not find very difficult as the position of the hand and arm be frequently very different and more difficult in some position than in other shall here give few copy of some particular one which be perhaps all that need to be do on this head here the hand be rest on the edge df something by which mean you see only the thumb the fore finger and the second bent the rest be conceal from the view be careful to imitate the arm as well as thei hand as nearly as possible the fore finger be here represent al point to or count out money on ta¬ bie the fore finger and the thumb only be see because the other finger be sup pose to be bend into the palm of the hand begin this and the former figure at the topsa of the arm and proceed downwards to the extremity of the finger here the back of the hand be turn to ward you the second finger be suppose to be hold something between that and the thumb consequently accord to nature the third finger must be à little bent and the first and little finger be extend the hand be here extend and the third finger be bend downwards for some particular purpose be careful to observe that this si tuation of the hand make material altera tion in the line of the arm here the hand be represent as holding or ball in this position you shew only the thumb the finger support the other side of the globe this hand be grasp staff and it be probable that the young pupil will find it more difficult to imitate than either of the other in this lesson however there be no thing in it to despair of since little care and attention will soon accomplish it lesson viii from the hand and arm we shall now proceed to the body and in the next lesson shall conclude the part of the human figure with the leg and foot out either head or arm but this will be no great loss as by this time you can make she very pretty head and give she hand and arm in what position you like you must begin this at the neck and shoulder then proceed downwards and at last finish it by draw around it the loose slow gar ment as this be the only body shall troa¬ ble my young pupil with hope they will not be in too much haste to pass it over hut give it all the attention it require and not quit it till they can draw it to the utmost ex actness the different position in which the human body may be place be so various that they can by no means find place in so concise and circumfcribe work as this nor indeed be it neceslary since the little artist if he make himself perfectly master of the contents of this small volume will be able to take off almost any figure that shall fall in he way at the first or second trial lesson ix we come now to the last part of the human figure the thigh knee lég and foot in the execution of which the student will sind no great difficulty this be thigh knee and part of leg which fs so plain and easy as to require no particular direction when he find he can do this perfectly well he may proceed to the foot this foot be cut off at that part of the leg where it fhould join to the precede so that if the young student join they together he will then have the limb complete as the leg and foot like the arm and the body may be place in different position the young artist must observe that he view this foot sideways and let he be very carefol in imitate the line which form the upper 's art of the foot the heel and particularly the toe this be right foot place in different form to the precede the toe be rather contract than extend to give the various position of the foot would be endless and in some degree i be possible even the large st work have not at tempte it and can not however shall not quit this lesson with out give one more curious example this be the leg and foot of a angel be on wing with the back part of the leg and foot turn to the view the spectator there be many other poss tion of this limb as have just observe but these be sufficient for the prefent purpose lesson have now teach the young pupil how to draw the different part of the human body it be necessary he should know how to put they properly together which can be learn only from practice the fol low figure may perhaps take he up lit¬ tle time and that something more than he first expect to imitate exactly but let he not be dishearten nor give over till he conquer in the appendix the youag pupil will see the use of the line which run from the head to the foot of this figure as well as of the number and the line which inclose they on he first attempt would advise he to pay no regard to they but to let they alone till he think he be able to proceed further when he can draw this figure perfectly well and have attend properly to what have be advanced in the course of these ten les fon may venture to apprehend he will not think much of the trifling expence of thia little volume which have teach he so much without the assistance of master whose premium be generally very extravagant but let I not forget my fair pupil who be per haps under more obligation to I than the young ' gentleman who have other stu die of more laborious nature to pursue have not so much time as young lady to amuse themselves in this delightful field of pleasure when speak of young lady as wish they to employ small portion of that time which they throw away at the toilette and the glaf to the more rational amusement of drawing may perhaps fall under the censure of some little female who before she can well speak plain be teach to rail against every thing but the invention of some new cosmetic or the discovery of some delicate paint which can not be disco ver from nature itself alasl it be to the false mode of education and not to the fair sex sex themselves that they be so much ex pose to the just censure of the sensible and judicious part of mankind appendix as apprehend may with some degree of reason suppose that my young pupil have by this time acquire know ledge of the art of draw superior to some who have study it in school for much child but give they hort abstract of ghe ingenious mo russel 's element as far as gentleman write for the instruction of pupil of more advanced age as be evident from he recommendation of the study of ana tomy in order to enable the artist to imitate every muscle of the human body with more accuracy my design be to entice child to the practice of draw at a age before any such thing be generally think of and to make this not so much matter of com palsion as of amusement after thus fairly acknowledge my intention be confident that the ingenious author of the element will not accuse I of any unfair or illiberal freedom take with he valuable produc tion some artist reject the use of drawing or print for the student 's imitation `` it be say they servile method of proceeding because it cramp the idea and hence genin suffer too great confinement notwithstanding this the usual practice be to copy after print and drawing at first and imagine experience have determine the ad¬ vantage accrue from this method to set the drawing of the most eminent artist before young beginner at he first commencement must be highly beneficial as it undoubtedly will prevent that rude ness and inaccuracy against which the most exact can not be too much guard how much more then ought the young student to observe this caution some geniuse require restriction and when this happen to be the case the place of accurate work before they must hold they in kind of subjection from which alone correctness be tobe expect ed exact copy be absolutely necessary at first this will imperceptibly produce ha bit of correctness till by degree the stu dent will make himself master of those grand essential to perfection truth boldness and freedom truth will be acquire by this accustom correctness boldness and freedom will fol¬ low after as the certain consequence and on these the excellence of the performance muft depend copy the draw of good master have also another considerable advantage which be teach good method of execution whereby many laborious and fruitless effort will be prevent the young student should always have it in remembrance that he chief aim ought to be the making of cor rect draw and of attain truth of outline since this be more effentially neceffa ry than smartness of touch or pleasing execution when the young pupil have make himself master of good degree of exactness by copying after print or drawing let he be provide provide with some good head cast after the antique and this should be one in which the feature be strongly mark and boldly determine such as the hercule jupiter or niobe as he will find the strength of either of these more easy of imitation than the refinement and delicacy of the antinous or venus of medicis though the latter after time will be he favourite and most valua ble study the nose be the center most artist begin they particular shape with that fea ture and from thence proceed to the eye and mouth but let the student sketch the outline very lightly that any mistake may the more easily be alter he greatest at tention must be pay to the produce he draw correct and the line of the fea ture parallel to one another and each at proper distance if the student fail here all he labour in the finish will be to no purpose when he have make himself master of the knowledge of the face he may proceed to the whole figure study with much assi duity the cast after the antique those al most perfect standard of grace majesty and beauty rule in tlie opinion of some people be the fetter of genius but great man very sa judicioussy observe lately that et they be fetter only to man of no genius ' which be undoubtedly true for when they be pro¬ perly use by man of ability they affist genius and not impede it on this account shall proceed to give the meafure of fine ly proportion human figure with which it be necessary the student should make he self acquainted previous to he study after the life the best way to measure the human figure be by face ten of which from the lowest hair on the forehead to the bottom of the chin be the best proportion height the face be divide into three equal part ist the forehead zd the nose and the mouth and chin from the chin to the collar bone be twice the length of the nose from the collar bone to the lowest part of the breast the length of the whole face from the bottom of the breast to the navel one face and half nose from the navel to the secret one face from the secret to the knee pan two face from the knee pan to the ancle two face from the an¬ cle to the sole of the foot nose and half when the arm be extend hori¬ zontally they length from the extremity of the longest finger on one hand to the other should measure the same as the height of the figure from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot from the shoulder to the elbow the length of two face from the root of the little finger to the elbow two face from the box of the shoulder blade to the pit of the collar one face the foot be the lixth part of man 's height and the hand should measure as much in length as the face the thumb be third part of face in length the shoulder that the face be most turn over be raise higher than the other the shoulder bear heavy burthen will be raise considerably higher than the other the hip on which the body chiefly rest will likewise be raise higher than the other very easy method of draw any pic ture be to cover it with square in the follow ing manner when you have thus squar you copy do the same by the paper on which you intend to imitate the figure but for this purpose use only the black lead pencil observe to make the square in both exactly the same in number and dimension with you pen then draw the same line in each square on you paper as vou find in you copy when finish rub out the black lead line with piece of bread and you draw will ap pear in the greatest perfection if you be de firous of make you draw less than the original you have nothing more to do than to make you squarès on you paper às small as you would have they but to observe to make they the same in number as you will here see shall here only add the figure of twelve bird in different attitude which though ' not difficult if the pupil have properly attend to he former lesson may afford some mat ter of improvement as well as amusement if the young pupil be defirous of imitate nature throughout she various production he may consult dr brooke natural history in which he will find very curious collec tion of beast bird fisn insect exe ecute in masterly manner of the preparation of colour before any young artist attempt to colour either he drawing or star it will be absolutely necessary he should have some idea of the nature and property of colour that he may know how to prepare they after deprive myself of whole month 's holiday which other boy would have spend in idleness or play be enable to give the youthful and industruous artist some valuable direction to this month 's labour have add my own observation as they occur to I in the progress of my colour some hundred of star and pic ture in those leisure hour which school always afford the youth who be ambitious to excel the first thing to be consider be gum water to make which take a ounce of of the preparation the whitest gum arabic and half a ounce of clear white sugar candy dissolve these in quart of water and add to it if you think proper little coloquintida the use of this last ingredient be only to keep the fly from spoiling vour work if it should be expose abroad in the air for where this be use fly will not come near it when you gum water be thus prepare pass it through fine sieve or à piece of muslin and keep it in bottle so stop that no à dirt may get in pour but little of it ont at time when you want to use it for should it get dirty or foul it would spoil the brightness of you colour alum water be useful article for with this you may wasn the drawing or star you intend to paint which will so six the pa¬ per that the colour will not sink in when you lay they on but will rather tend to brighten they it be make in the follow manner boil four ounce of alum in quart of rain or river water till the alum be dissolve and let it stand twenty four hour after which strain it off for use it proper here to remind you that if you paper paper be very thin and loose let it be wash with the above water four or five time ob serve to let it dry every time and that it be perfectly so before you attempt to lay any of you colour upon it let we now proceed to enquire into the to ture of the various colour use in painting of star and drawing as to white have already observe that it be by no means to be leave in star intend for kite as every por tion should be sill up with some other co lour than that of which the general body be compose and in drawing where it be sometimes necessary the colour of the paper will always answer the end especially if it be well glaze without any other assistance of yellow the first of this kind be straw colour and be make of flour of brimstone which of itfelf be sine enough to mix with gum water yellow cker will make another good pale yellow but in illuminating of print it be colour of rather too much bo dy to be use for that purpose anlef it be well ground with gum water for deep yellow dutch pink be generally use as be english pink for lighter shade with re spect to colour of star gamboge be al way to be prefer as it be most beautiful colour and of strong body of red the best colour of this class for painting of star be vermilion but this be too heavy to be use on drawing or print crimson be represent by carmine but great cau tion should be use in buy it which should never be do by candle light as it will then be impossible to discover what be truly of the right colour there be great deal of it of so different shade from the real crimson as to be worth nothing transparent pur lour as shall appear necessary for painting different print or drawing may be make in the follow manner take pint of stale beer in which boil one pint of rasp brazil wood and half a ounce of cam peachy or logwood till the liquor be height ened to the colour you desire which you must try by dip piece of paper into it ff you then find it too red add quarter of a ounce of logwood to the brazil wood and you will find it musch nearer to the pur ple than the former in like manner ' you may humour any degree of purple as you put more or less logwood to the former com pofition after which six the colour with little alum this will produce such clear purple as no mixture of solid red and bly possibly can though purple be be queatly make by uniting those two colour of bly the first and best bright blue we have be uitramarine which give spirit to all painting in which it be use but the price of it be so high that it be never use for star and seldom even in many of the best print prussian blue be the next in beauty to uitra marine but it will not long retain its colour when mix with gum water and therefore improper for we purpose the next colour to the former for brightness be that which we call blue bise which though it be colour of body will flow pretty well in the pencil if it be well wash which must be do in the follow manner put three or four ounce of it into quart of rain water then stir it and pour off the water imme diately let it settle to the bottom of every cup or glass you pour it into after which pour off the water and in day 's time you will have the colour dry and as fine as you can wish indigo make fine blae when it be ground and wash with gum wa ter by means of stone and mullet if you use it for star you can not have it too strong but mean not of strong as to prevent it run freely from the pencil and lie smooth on the paper without appear in lump if you use it for the colour of print you may lighten or darken it to you mind by ufe greater or less quantity of gum water therewith but before you touch you draw or print with it try it be strength upon white dutch tile for it run freely in the pencil and may be too strong for you design which you should always be aware of when flow colour be to be lay ower the dark shade of print as it will mach aggravate its blackness and even make it appear quite black of black have already observe that black be by no means to be admit among the colour for the use of star fhall therefore only speak of it for the purpose of print in even oussy admit it be so heavy colour as to hide the beautiful stroke of the engraver unless do with great care be here speak of what they call lvory black which must be pure and well ground many prefer strong tincture of good indian ink while other make use of lvory black prepare in the follow manner let you burnt lvory be well ground in gum water and then beat the white of a egg very well till you sind kind of oily liquor settle to the bot tom mix the liquor with as much of the extraordinary gloss if the object be shin ing such as the wing of some beetle mix some of it with little white upon dutch glaze tile till you find it light enough to relieve the shade then make another lighter shade which be use on the brighter part of the subject will produce the effect you desire of green green be by all allow to depend apon the yellow and the blue and by the help of the one or the other colour may be form ed any green we please the gamboge be one of we first vellow which with the pre paration of verdigrease may be make to produce five or six sort of green accord as the gamboge abound or be less in quan tity if the gamboge abound it will form tolerable oak green and be ftill mon mix with the verdigrease green it will form grass green as for the verdigmase itself it produce fine blueisn green flow easily in the pencil and may even serve as a ink to write with as the method of pre par this colour be not much know to the generality of young artist fhall here in¬ form they in what manner it be to be do take three ounce of common verdi grease break it à little and boil it gently in pint of white wine vinegar observe to stir it continually when you perceive it to boil add iittie tartar break and keep you mixture stir till you find the clear liquor of such colour as you would wishi that be of fine transparent green with blue cast the state of the colour may be know by dip in stick and touch piece of paper with it when you have colour to you mind pour it through line cloth into a open vessel and set it to cool when it be quite cold keepit in close vessel for use pour ing out à little at atime as you want it for when it be expole to the air it will soon dry but be reducible again by common water when you prepare this liquid colour do not use the distilled verdigrease for it will not answer the end you propose take care you make it strong enough for it be not to be strengthen afterwards without the trou ble of boiling afresh though it may at any time be make as faint as you please by add ing common water thereto sap green be colour like that of a oak leaf if it be use thin with common water for this as well as the former want no gum however if it be use strong it pro¬ duce very dark green you may try you colour first on white dutchtile and by thin it with water reduce it as you please but you may brighten it very much by add to it little of the liquid verdi grease sap green be make in the follow man¬ ner take the flower of the blue flag lris or flower de luce and press they while thert be any juice to be get from they boil this juice in glaze pipkin till it grow thick add little alum to it when it will make very useful and last green remember in the boiling of any juice in order to make colour to uie a earthen glaze pipkin for if you boil they in vessel of metal you will sometimes be much disappointed in you expectation there be another method of prodace which be gain by take the uice of buckhorn berry and though that juice simply will yield only dark pur ple of very base hue yet by add tar tar to it it will turn to good sap green and may be bring to good consistence by boiling these be the principal discovery have make in the preparation of colour and which as before observe have deprive I of the sportive enjoyment of many holiday however it may be necessary here to observe that would not advise those young artist who make use of colour on ly for star or now and then to ornament print or draw to be at the trouble and expence of prepare they own colour since it will be much cheaper for they to buv they in shell at the colour shop which be fit for immediate use with the assistance of they own gum water only defign these instruction only for those who dip deeply into the science and who can not be content with superficial knowledge of any to every one these caution seem to be necessary take care to have as many pencil brushie as colour if you intend to be nice and always observe to wash the colour well out of they by dip they in water and squeeze they well with you finger till no colour be see to proceed from they before you lay they buy after use otherwise they will get hard and be no longer serviceable do not presume to offer this to young artist as complete treatise comprehend ing every thing that can be say on the sab ject bat thus much will venture to say if they follow the direction here give they may possibly find it more useful to they be ing both concise and cheap and collect from natural experiment than many ochen book of ten time the price conclusion efore take leave of my little pupil ishall lay before they few passage of history from which they may form design for capital piece of drawing if my little disciple should be at loss how to plan picture from these authenticate scrape it will be no wonder but after they have go through this work with assiduity and patience and imitate such historical draw ing as may have fall into they hand they will then find this to be no difficult rather pleasing task and have with the more pleasure embraced this opportunity as no¬ thing of the kind have ever yet appear in the most extensive work of this nature in the mean time they may read they perhaps to advantage merely as matter of enter tainment and improvement the athenian be at war with the peloponnefian the oracle have promise the victory to the athenian if they king should peloponnesian the fall by the hand of enemy be inform what the oracle have declare give general charge to they sol¬ dier not to kill codrus who be then king of the atbenian codrus however one even ing advanced beyond the trench in the ha bit of wood gatherer and begin to cut several bough some peloponnefiaa hap pening to be engage in the same office meet he come immediately to blow he wounded several of they with he bill but be overpower he fall under they stroke the prophecy be thus fulfil the atbeaian inspire with additional strength and courage march to battle without he fitation and send herald to demand the bo dy of they king the peloponnefian un derstand what have happen fleed and the victorious atbenian decreed heroic ho nour to the memory of codrus who have vo luntarily facrifice he life for the good of he country in order to design this picture as well as the follow in proper manner would advise the artist not to confine himself too much in the size of he paper and never make it less than quarter of sheet to draw historical piece in miniature be the work only of a experience artist this design should consist of codrus engage the wood cutter and sink under they blow the most difficult matter here will be to re present the natural attitude of the body in such circumstance for this purpose let two of he intimate make sham fight but take care they do not fight in earnest and from they copy the desire position when the principal figure be finish he may then draw the representation of wood and embellisn it with beast bird aristide and themistocle differ wide ly in they political principle be violent enemy enemy upon the invanon of the perfian take hold of each other and go out of the city they put down they hand with they finger twist together into one place and at once cry out et here we lay down ee we enmity till we finisn the war against ee the perfian have thus speak they take up they hand again and untwisted they finger as if something have be there deposit then sill up the pit they be turn to the city and continue in har mony during the whole war this unani mity of the general chiefly contribute to the overthrow of the enemy great care must here be take in repre sent the stoop posture of the two ge neral to preserve the due proportion of nature in such posture require great care skill and judgment polemon the atbenian be very de bauch young man one day agreeable to resolution he have before take have intoxicate hiinself with much liquor he crowned he head with flower and then stagger into the school of the philosopher yenocratus who be then argue in defence of temperance the more the unthinking youth endeavour to interrapt he discourse the more strenuoussy the philosopher pursue it till at last polemon be oblige to hear it become so sensible of he error that from that moment he begin to reform and make firm resolution to live better for the future he succeed so well in he endeavour that in little time he become the first disciple of xenocratus whom he afterwards succeed the principal figure here be that of drunken man crowned with flower the face should be in full front that you may give he such silly countenance as be pecu liar to people much intoxicate with liquor he disorder dress and totter position should be expressive of he situation the other part of the design contain nothing difficult philip king of macedon fall to the ground by accident and see the extent of he body mark in the dust cry out ee good god what little space do ee man fill in this universe be nothing very difficult in this de¬ sign take care however that you place the king in proper attitude and fill he face with surprise mind that the sun be place in such part of the piece as may cast the shadow properly which last can not be do to nicety without much care and attention ptolemeus the théban be so accus tom to send no one away empty hand that come to afk he charity that when poor soldier in distress come to implore he assistance the general have nothing else to give pull off he shoe and present they to the distress man say ee my ee friend take these and make the moft you can can of they for would rather go bare ee foot than you should starve little need be say on this design in the countenance of the soldier while he be re ceive the shoe from the general must be paint sorrow and distress while the look of the general must be expressive of benevo lence and humanity after the bloody battle of pedewardin which the german gain over the turk among the prisoner be janissary who much lament the loss of he turban the german german soldier who have pick it up hap pene to be near he and hear he ex press he hopeless wishie to have it restore very generously return it to he at the same time thus address he in the turkisn languagez ee you be soldier and so be ee we ought to treat each other as bro et thers the janissary full of joy at this unexpected mark of generosity and be unwilling to shew less mark of grandeur of soul receive the turban with one hand and with the other present he musket to the german saying es lf we be brother « have no need of this instrument of death ee which but little while fince be employ¬ cé ed against my enemy and might have be fatal to you the young artist will here be at no loss to find matter to cover he paper man in arm turk and german may fill every part of it but the center in which must be represent the turk receive he turban from the german with one hand and surren dering he arm with the other take care to infuse into they countenance the different passion arise froi they different situation brutus and cassius after have make some conquest meet at sardis where they agree to march against anthony and young caesar here one evening brutus as he be sit pensive and revolve the tran action of he life the memory of caesar occur to he now perhaps not as trai tor tyrant or usurper but as one he love and murder a apparition appear to he as he imagine which tell he he be he evil genius and would meet he at pbilippi to which brutus calmly answer ° will meet thee there here be copious field in which the young artist may exert every power of he genius brutus and the apparition afford two capital figure brutus must be draw recline on couch half raise lean on one hand with the other lift up in surprise the most difficult part of the work will be to sill he face with that horror which the artist himself would be suppose naturally to repre send in the same sitaation if he have see the tragedy of hamlet in which the ghost ad dress the young prince let he take that for he pattern on this occasion or rather let he imitate some good draw of this kind pyrrbus king of epirus after be defeat by the roman retire to tarentum and be slain at argo city of greece by large stone throw on he head from son he be on the point of kill in the attack this will form very pretty pictare and fill up every part of the paper the repre sentation of castle may be make to cover one half of it under the castle must be draw the figure of pyrrbus clad in be mour and sink under the blow of fall ing stone on he head near he the fi gure of warlike youth with whom he be suppose to have be fight and who stand astonished at the sudden fate of pyr rhus over the countenance of the king must be throw the appearance of insensibili¬ ty arise from the blow he be suppose to have receive but a air of majesty and dig nity should he preserve on the top of the castle directly over the head of pyrrhus you must place the figure of woman in a a attitude that will shew it be from she hand the stone fall and in whose counte nance you may perceive the different paffion of joy and terror the rest of the ground may be occupy by the effort of contend soldier but take care you do not incumber the living by place too many dead man at they foot let not the more aged and experience reader imagine that be not aware of the objection that will be make to my conclu si et that it be infinitely above the capa city of child and therein differ from the former part of my plan to such shall be sport in my answer the genius and capacity of child be seldom put to the stretch and if they in due time per form the usual task impose on they at school nothing more be require of they but if you hit upon the mode of make they consider as a amusement what you be gard as a essential ' point wonder may be often produce here genius will have its full scope unfettered of the tedious rule lay down by some self interested teacher and among thousand of my infant reader should be instrumental in produce only ten artist ishall be satisfied that my labour have not be in vain it be by no means to be expect that the most expert among they should give all that expression have here re commend to the different face in the pre ced hint fof design but let even the dullest of my little pupil remember this fure certain and infallible rule that there be no thing in human life however impracticable it may at first view appear that may not be fore to give way to uxwearied diligence ap plication and resolution
