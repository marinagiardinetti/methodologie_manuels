head hand foot academy antique groupe of figure beast bird insect flower fruit shell ornament build  ing landscape collect from the work of the greatest master to which be prefixe a essay on draw with introducrory rule for the use of learner in which the first principle of that useful and noble art be explain in such manner that it may be attain in short time without master london print and publish accord to act of parliament and sell by sayer at the golden  buck in fleet  street mdcclxii the art of draw draw be the art of represent by line and shade the figure of any thing see in nature or whatever form we conceive in idea it be the noblest operation of human ingenuity and may certainly be reckone among the qualifica  tion which be the characteristic of gentieman the study of it ought to be encourage in every youth whatever station of life he may be place in for besides it  great use to all person concerned in the way of art it must be extremely agreeable to gentleman to sketch fine building beautiful prospect piece of art or uncommon appearance in nature besides draw enable we to see thing in plainer and clearer manner and remember they form shape and other circumstance much better than can possibly be do without knowledge in this art in all age it have be carefully cultivate by the most polite nation and the great man who have excel in it have be honour by the protection of those king and prin  ce who have taste for the liberal art it set before we the most magnificent building the most delightful garden the beauty of art or the production of nature in so strong and just light that one might imagine one  self on the spot and this in language understand by all mankind the implement for draw be smooth  grain charcoal black  lead pencil red black and white chalk porte  crayon hair pencil crow  quill pen indian ink ruler and pair of compass  charcoal be proper to fketch with as any stroke make with it may be brush out with feather if wrong and the black lead pencil give the correct qutline red chalk be proper to draw large or academy figure with and black chalk the same especially on colour s paper where the light put in with white chalk have beautiful effect .  lt be best to begin draw from some of the least complex example as they be place in this collection every thing should be draw at first with stroke just visible and afterwards correct by alter what be amiss make as like the original as possible in this manner à learner should draw the several feature in different position well before he attempt a entire head or face for he can not do the whole together until he be master of the part this do draw face and head from some in qutline only sketch the qutline and sinish from the same shade before proceed in this particular will here give the most approve pro portion of face and head and the better to understand ity shall describe one view in front in which position it  qut  line make nearly the shape of a egg divide by line as in the example the upper division for the hair then to the topx and next to the bottom of the nose the lower one to the chin this last part be subdivide equally into three the uppermost be the distance between the nose and mouth the breadth be di  vide into five equal part of which one be the eye anothen the distance between the eye from the qutside of the eye to the side of the face be another part the mouth be little more than one the nose little less the eye in front be divide into  three one of which be the pupil or sight the ear be the length of the nose one of the greatest beauty in draw face and which be absolutely necessary to it be to place the feature truly in they place that be the middle of the forehead the nose and the mouth exactly under one another in line and the eye on line properly cross that on which the forehead nose and mouth be place lf you would see how these line curve in the several attitude the head may be put into there be very ingenious method of do it by get  icce of box or other smooth  grain wood turn in the shape of a egg make streight line on this piece of wood from the middle of the top to the middle of the bottom then make crof stroke on it at the the proper distance as before direct in speak of the pro portion of the head fof the eye nose and by set this piece of wood in variety of different attitude you will soe how the line curve on those occasion and accord to those curve you must place and turn the several feature by this means think you will easily understand this rule for place the feature properly which be one of the most difficult point and at the same time so absolutely necessary that it be imposii  ble to do any head well without it and next proceed to hand foot and for due proportion of which see the example after you draw these part well and with ease try a entire figure of which shall here give you the most approve mea  sure and proportion  the antient commonly allow eight head to they figure but we ordinarily divide the figure into  ten face that be to say from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot viz from the crown to the forehead one third of face the face begin at the root of the lowest hair upon the forehcad and end at the bottom of the chin d the face be divide into three proportionable part the first contain the forehead the second the nose and the third the mouth and the chin thence to the pit betwixt the collar  bone two length of nose to the bottom of the breast one face to the navel ane face to the genitory one face to the upper part of the knee two face the knee contain half face to the ankle two face to the sole of the foot half face man arm stretch out be from the longest singer of he right hand to that of he left as broad as he be long from one side of the breast to the other two face the bone of the arm call humerus be two face from shoulder to elbow thence to the roôt of the little  finger the bone call cubitus with part of the hand contain two face from the box of the shoulder  blade to the pit betwixt the col  lar bone one face the sole of the foot be the sixth part of the figure the hand be the length of face the thumb nose those measure be general but liable to exception varying varying from the quality of person and movement of the mus  cle be careful to make just symmetry and harmonious cor  respondence in the whole figure not one leg or arm bigger or longer than the other not the shrivel face of old age with the plump lip of youth the body of bacchus with the limb of a apollo or the shoulder of a hercule with the aist of fribble it be proper here to take notice of how great advantage to person who would draw human fi  gure well it be to understand something of the anatomy of it mean so much of it as relate to the bone and the muscle and as appear externally more than this would be to he mere matter of curiosity but thus much be worth the pain of every one to become master of who be ambi  tious of know the foundation of the art for it will be mean of give grace strength and beauty to he figure and he will be able to express the proper part of the limb which principally operate in every action not blindly and by chance but with truth and certainty which be esteem by every one who be best able to judge one of the greatest beau  tie in figure there be proper work for this purpose en nidle compendious treatise of anatomy adapt to the art of painting and design in which so much only as be necessary to the painter with concise explanation of it be collect to  gether from the more minute part which be necessary to the surgeon or anatomist sell by sayer at the golden  buck in fleet  street in drapery cloath you figure properly and elegantly and neither with some modern by massy fold lose sight of you original intention nor by servilely copy the ancient imi  tate wet line and it will be great help to proportion if whatever be intend for cloath be sketch naked of which preserve as much as possible yet carefully avoid the above extreme next in course though first in art be the expression of the se  yeral passion of the soul which be the most difficult and beau  tiful part of this art le brun who have treat this sub  ject with great success say that passion be motion of the  soul which make it follow what it think good and fly from that which it think hurtful and what

extant ofthis  kind be le brun expression of the passion of the soul where the principal passion be beautifully express by that great master in head almost as large as the life with a ab  stract of he discourse on each of they these head besides  they usefulnef in this particular be likewise some of the best  example to draw after either in red or black chalk that be  to be meet with sell by sayer at the golden buck in fleet  street the qut line conquer we advice touch eight andi shadow might almost be spared so shall only say in the example before you cover not the light too much at first for that will throw gloom over you draw and can not easily be efface on the contrary if you light be too open you may advance on they with shade at pleasure in composition  so dispose you object that both light and shade may fall in mass and be careful that you principal be place to advan  tage when you copy nature the noblest school for art ob  serve the operation of light which consider and observe  from its fountain will alone instruct be unerring in it  pro  gref and render the being most conspicuous nearest  to we  view thus far relate to the human figure and it  immediate apa pendage which be the most difficult and important subject of this art there be however other part which merit the re  gard of the learner the draw flower fruit bird beast and the like might be the subject of some of you firsti attempt not only as it be more pleasing employment  but as  it be a easier task than the draw of face hand foot and other  other part of the human body which require not only more care but greater exactness and more judgment there be but sew particular rule for you instruction on this head you have variety of example in this collection which copy with great care and exactness and be sure to make correct qut  line before you begin to shade draw of landscape build  ing for gentleman be the most entertaining and useful in the whole art to be able on the spot as be before observe to take the sketch of fine building or beautiful prospect of any curious production of art or uncommon appearance in nature or whatever else may present itself to view on we jour  nie or travels in we own or foreign country may  be thus bring home and preserve for we future use either in busi  ness or conversation and be the best method of bring to mind again those beauty that have once char we tree or house though of the same size will appear otherwise accord  ing to they nearness or distance those at distance appear less than those on the fore ground and those that be farther off yet less this proportion you must be careful to represent accordingly because it be that which principally give the ap  pearance of distance and be one of the grcatest beauty in view or landscape as may be see by the example annex and be best inculcate by the appearance of object accord to they situation in nature the forego rule be necessary to be know and will rea  dily advance student therefore he who intend the imitative art for he profession should well attend to they  but the gentleman who mean no further from he pursuit than a be  complishment may be less solicitous in the discipline of rule since though he become no great proficient taste only will enable he to judge properly of the work of such eminent mas  ter who have or may hereafter improve the graphic art
