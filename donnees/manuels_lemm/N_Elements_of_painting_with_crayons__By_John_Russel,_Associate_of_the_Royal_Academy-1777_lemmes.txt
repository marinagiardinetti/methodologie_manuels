this pleat htudy and of explain its principle for the benefit of fuch as in this age of diffipation may prefer the filent amufement of beautiful art to the delufive enchantment in the gay circle of unreftrained pleafure have induce I to this undertake and should it instruet or even encourage fingle student shall not think my labour ill beftow but happy shall be if my observation should in the leave degree awaken the attention of the curious to thofe new fource of beauty and elegance which may yet he conceal for if they be find to be juft thofe who be mafter of the subject may be tempte to improve and extend they be this as it may my aim by this publication be to be ufeful to thofe who want experience and therefore have not doubt but shall fland excute from any im putation of vanity with thofe who do not require fuch affiftance to the former with fuccess and would foften the cenfure of the latter by remind they in the word of my motto that there be labour in the most trift thing element afe epe a no iv concern tafte il of draw section of the application of the crayon with some dispofition iv of drapery of the material section vi of roll the crayon and dispoting they for painting with cray on can in here be no disputing about taffe becaufe its principle be not abfolute and therefore they can not be define the opinion of man concern beauty and elegance in any of the fine art be as various as they face they difpofition or the different climate in which they live nature it be true be in every particular confiftent with herfelf we be frame with mind capable of have the higheft relifh for the elegant art and confequently nature have frame we with a uniformity of tafte to furnish proper object for that high relifh without which the the art could never have arrive at any degree of perfection and this be fufficient to convince we that they be not yet bring to perfection fome object indeed of the fine art make fuch lively impreftion of beauty grandeur and harmony of proportion as to command kind of ge neral taffe but inftance of this fort be very uncommon taste depend more on experience than on nature this be point which merit peculiar attention becaufe it open to we fure method of improve we tafte in the elegant art and be powerful incitement toward the cultivation and improvement of they fiudy which can not fail to embellifh manners and fweeten society all therefore that can be faid cencerning tafte be that there be certain principle that conftitute the fenfitive part of we nature and which be common to all preferve kind of uniformity with respect to the emotion and feeling of different individual the same object make upon every one the same impreffion or atleaft the fame in kind if not in degree this be the only way of accounting for uniformity of tafte in the polite art and this in other word may juftly be term the common fenfe of mankind which be the only true flandard of tafle all other be equivocal or uncertain and confequently will never be fufficiently ggeneral to become flandard of tafte but the principle that conflitute the fenfitive part of we nature painting with cray on nature will undoubtedly lead we to method of afcertaining the common fenfe of mankind or flandard of tafte with great exactnet and accuracy these will determine almoft generally what be either elegant or beautiful and hence when we idea be regulate and direct by thefe principle we may be faid to have form good tafte and be enable to difcern what be natural and proper and what be not of true it be that inattention the force of example preudice or paffion may introduce bad tafte and banith good one in painting heavy compofition incorrect draw and bad colour may prevail notwithftanding the influence of thofe principle that conftitute the fenfitive part of we nature inftance of to defective tafte will however be very rare and when they happen they will feldom prejudice any but the poffeffor becaufe they can carry but little authority with they to impofe on other after all the remedy againft form bad tafte be to hudy the work of man of good tafte this will enlarge the mind and by obfervation eftablish student in ood tafte of he own ii wing may be juftly term the foundation of painting this should be the firft object of the student attention the more perfectly this be attain the greater be the certainty of acquire excellence genius be the gift of nature but genius without cultivation can never arrive at the fummit of perfection the material neceffary for draw be portcrayon leather stump fome ftain paper charcoal black white and red chalk with drawboard of about two foot quare some artift reject the ufe of drawing or print for the it be fay they fervile method of student imitation oc proceeding becaufe it cramp the idea and hence genotwithflanding of nius fuffer too great confinement this the ufual practice be to copy after print and drawing at firft and imagine experience have determine the advantage accrue from this method to fet the drawing in particular of the moft eminent artifl before young beginner at he firft commencement muft be highly benefiof with cr aton as it moft undoubtedly will prevent rudeness and inaccuracy againft which the moft exact can not be too much guard how much more then ought the young student to obferve this caution some geniufe require reftriction and when this happen to be the cafe the place of accurate work before they muft hold they in kind of subjection from which alone correctness be to be expect exact copy be abfolutely to be require at firft this will imperceptibly produce habit of correctnefe till by degree the student will make himself mafter of thofe grand effential to perfection truth boldness and freedom truth will be acquire by this accuftom correctnets boldness and freedom will follow after as the certain confequence and on thefe the excellence of the performance muft dependdcopy the drawing of good mafter have alfo another confiderable advantage viz teach good method of execution by which many laborious and fruitlet effort will be prevent crayon painter should pay particular attention to th draw on ftain paper with black or red and white chalk as this kind of draw have bold effect be ally to the manner of ufe the crayon and impart knowledge of what be ufually term the middle teint indeed in almoft every respect this method be attend with confiderable advantage but the young student should always have it in remembrance that he chief aim ought t be the making of correct draw and of attain truth of outline fince this be more effentially necefiary than smartness of touch or pleaf execution when he have make fome confiderable progress with the chalk he may then attempt the round or plaifter figure but here as in every other cafe care should be obferve in make choice of good subject for nothing be of prejudicial or dangerous as to copy from imperfect fubject on which account he should be direct in he choice by the opinion of the moft experience artift who all recommend the study of the antique and other approve plaifter figure previous to the draw after living model which will furnith the student with great knowledge and correctnefs as have be before obferve and without which there be great danger of acquire extravagant and pernicious habit which be eafily attain without great care but they be not to eafily difmiffed when acquire to draw from living figure without have firft faudy the antique be no less abfurd than to attempt to underfland the claffick without previous knowledge of the rule of grammar the human figure and especially the face be the moft difficult fludy but thorough knowledge of this particular will give facility of execution in every thing elfe when the student have make himfelf mafter of good degree of exactness by copy after print or drawing let painting with crayon he be provide with fome good head caft after the antique one in which the feature be ftrongly mark and boldly determine fuch as the hercule tupiter or wiobe as he will find the frength of either of thefe more eafy of imitation than the refinement and delicacy of the apotlo antinous or venus of medicis though the latter after time will be he favourite and moft valuable study after the choice of subject the next confideration will be to place it in proper light and shadowif the window be too near the ground the effet can not be pleaf becaufe the shadow will be diftract into too many part in this cafe the lower part of the window should be darkened with fomething that will quite obstruet the light about the height of fix foot which will throw the hade into very agreeable maff on the subject for imitation which be thus place have the drawboard partly refting in the lap and partly on the table the moft convenient Ithod let the student carefully obferve the particular turn and action of the head how much the forehead be inclined over the right or leave shoulder and how much over the back or breaft then with the charcoal let he lightly draw the general hape of the head after which the centerline of the face from the middle of the forchead to the middle of the chin and then the crof line which determine the fituation of the eye nofe mouth and root of the hair all this be the foundation on which the student may give the the particular fhape to each feature and he muft remember that good proportion face be divide into three equal part the firfl contain the forchead the second the nofe and the third the mouth and chin from the root of the hair to the crown of the head be juft the height of the forchead the nofe be the centre moft artift begin they parricular shape with that feature and from thence proceed to the eye and mouth but let the student ketch the outline very light that any miftake may the more eafily be alter he greateft attention muft be pay to the producing he draw correct and the line of the feature parallel to one another and each at proper diftance if the student fail here all he labour in the finifh will be to no purpofe but when the line be properly draw the broad shadow may be lay in with foft chalk difregarding the leffer part till afterwards fweeten with the leather stump then the demy shade and the heighten with white be add with which the whole be to be compleate preserve a intermediate space of the ftain paper which as middle teint muft be leave between the white and black otherwife the ufe of draw on teint paper be effectually deftroy and the production will have heavy unpleaf effeet and be entirely deftitute of that greatness and breadth which diftinguithe the production of mafter from the effort of inferior ability whien painting with craton the student have make himfelf mafter of the knowledge of the face he may proceed to the whole figure ffudie with much affiduity the caft after the antique thofe almoft perfect flandard of grace majetty and beguty rulk it be faid be the fetter of genius but great man very judicioufly obferve lately that oo they be fetter only to man of no genius which be undoubtedly true for when they be properly ufe by man of ability they rather affift genius than impede it on this account have give the meafure of fine proportion human figure with which it be neceffary the student should make himfelf acquainted previous to he fludy after the life and for this reafon place this particular before what propofe to fay on that important part of study the beft way to meafure the human figure be by face ten of which from the loweft flair on the forehead to the bottom of the chin be the beft proportion height the face be divide into three equal part iff the forehead the nofe and the mouth and chin from the chin to the collarbone be twice the length of the nofe from the collarbone to the loweft part of the breaft the length of the whole face from the bottom of the breaft to the navel one face and half nofcfrom the navel to the secret one face from the secret to the kneepan t the kneepan to the ancle two face two face from the ancle to the sole of the foot nofe and a half when the arm be extend horizontally they length from the extremity of the

from the root of the little finger to the elbow two face from the box of the shoulderblade to the pit of the collar one face the foot be the fixth part of man s height and the hand should meafure as much in length as the face the thumb be the third part of face in length the shoulder that the face be moft turn over be raif higher than the other the shoulder bear heavy burthen will be raif confiderably higher than the other the ilip on which the body chiefly reft will be raif higher than the other the knowledge of anatomy to far as relate to the structure of the bone and difposition of the mufcle with they origin and infertion will enable the scudent to draw the human figure in great perfection this may be acquire by rudy some good treatife on the subject and by drawing the bone and mufcle in different view the attending fome diffection if he have a opportunity will improve the student much fooner than any other method poffibly can le brun lecture on the paftion of the soul read before the with cr yon the academy in france will impart great knowledge in the exprestion of the mufcle of the face which should be strictly attend to and alfo the knowledge of light and shadow as this in particular will inftruct he how to preferve harmony in he picture and proper exprestion of the different projection thefe thing be acquire genius will improve by study and perfection and fame reward the labour of clofe application when the student draw from living model great care be require to place the figure in proper action after which particular attention should be pay to its general careful to preferve what be term the center tway be of gravity which be that line always perpendicular from the pit between the collarbone to the foot on which the figure reftstthe firft sketch muft be touch very lightly in square manner defcribe the large form by which the action of the figure be expreff the second time of draw over the outline notice should be take of thofe leffer part which in the former flight sketch be neglect in each sketch the student muft begin at the head which muft be carefully place in its proper inclination or elfe however in other respects juftly draw the figure will have a ungraceful appearance it muft be remark that moll graceful figure fland on one foot only the other as a auxiliary wie when the outline be correct and in good proportion the principal difficulty be overcome the next slep be to proceed to the shadow which muft be make broad and firm and not diftract into too many part which would perplex the student as all the inferior diftinction in the feveral degree of hadow ought to be second confideration and be therefore to be avoid when the whole care should be to preferve the maff of light and fhade broad and mafterly care should be obferve where the principal mat of light fall as in every wellfet figure there will be principal mass of light to preferve it broad not too much divide confider the whole together before the part in particular ir hadow be produce by any mufcle cc near the grand body of light it will at the firft view be apt to miflead the student and incline he to think it much darker than it really be but if compare with the principal hadow the true degree may be afcertain sometimes on the rife of mufcle or the projection of bone the light may catch near the mass of thadow which if not draw tender will have a unpleaf harth effect which can only be regulare by compare it with the frongeft light this method of compare one degree of light and fhadow with another will be the only certain rule of preferve the tone and confiftency of the whole together as the compare of length painting with cr ton and breadth with each other be the only rule to produce the juft form of figure while the figure be refting the student will have a opportunity of place he draw at diftance by which mean the eye will more eafily difcover how much he have err from this rule which he may foften with line rag or rub out with bread at pleafuredas it can not be fuppof the figure can for any length of time have the fame mufcle of he body in continual action the opportunity should be embraced while they be moft properly exert to draw each limb and defcribe each particular mufcle the great variety of which will give liberty to the student to exercife he genius in produce he draw in a elegant tafle ec tion iii of the application of the crayon with some previous disposition yhether the painter work with oilcolour watercolour or crayon the grand object of he purfuit be ftill the fame juft imitation of nature but each species have its peculiar rule and methodpainting with crayon require in many respects treatment different from painting in oilcolour becaufe all colour ufe dry be in they nature of much warmer complection than when wet with oil or any other bind fluid let this be prove by matter of fact mr cote paint portrait of sir william chamber which be in lord besborough s collection a ingenious foreigner have difcover Ithod of fix crayon picture to that they would not rub or receive a injury if any accident happen to the glat the society for the encouragement of art have before offer premium

this portrait of sir william chamber paintinc with cr ayon the crayon he indeed to perfectly fix as to refift any rub or bruth without the leave injury which before would have entirely deface or spoiled it but the picture which before have particularly warm brilliant and agreeable effect in comparifon become cold and purple and though in one fenfe the attempt fucceed to the defign intention of fix the colour yet the binding quality of whatever fluid be make ufe of in the process change the complexion of the colour render the cold teint too predominant for this reafon in order to produce rich picture much greater portion of what painter term cool teint muft be apply in crayon painting than would be judicious to ufe in oil with we any danger of miftake it be to be fuppof the not be acquainted with this observation be one great caufe why to many oilpainter have no better fuccess when they attempt crayon painting on the contrary crayon painter be to much ufe to thofe teint which be of cold nature when ufe wet be apt to introduce they too much when they paint with oil which be feldom pro ductive of good effect another observation would make which require particular notice from the student who have be converfant with oil painting prior to he attempt with crayon oil painter begin they picture much lighter and fainter than they intend to finith they which prefent the future colour clear and brilliant the light underneath greatly affit the tranfparent glaze and fcumble colour which if they be lay over any part already too dark would but increafe its heavy effect on the contrary crayon be make of dry colour be difficult to procure fufficiently dark the grayon painter therefore will find a abfolute neceffity to begin he picture as dark and rich as poftible except in the ftrongeft light for if once the grey and light teint become predominant it will be next to impoftible for he in the deep fhadow especially to reffore depth and brilliancy have no opportunity of glaz ing or fcumble to give the effect as the grey teint be mixture with whiting underneath will continually work up and render the attempt abortive shall now endeavour to give the student fome direction towards the attainment of excellence in this art the student muft provide himfelf with fome ftrong blue paper the thicker the better if the grain be not too courfe and knotty though it be almoft impoffible to get any intirely free from knot the knot should be level with penknife or razor otherwife they will prove exceedingly troublefome after this be do the paper muft be paft very finooth on line cloth previoutly ftrain on deal that fide of the paper should be paft which have the rroke from the wire moft evident that the painting may be on the fmootheft fide otherwife the line which thefe wire have leave in the paper will prove troublefome and look unpicafant franle painting with craton the fize accord to the artiff pleafure on this the picture be to be execute but it be moft eligible not to palte the paper on till the whole subject be firft deadcoloured the method of do this be very eafy by lay the paper with the deadcolour on its face upon finooth board or table when by means of brush the backfide of the paper muft be cover with pafte the frame with the itrain cloth muft then be lay on the paft fide of the paper after which turn the paint fide uppermoft and lay piece of clean paper upon it to prevent finear this be do it may be ftroke gently over with the hand by which mean all the air between the cloth and the paper will be force out when the pafte be perfectly dry the student may proceed with the painting the advantage arife from paft the paper in the frame accord to this method some crayon picture be paint on vellum but the animal falt in the ikin very often caufe they to mildew it muft be confelf the vellum give the picture foft effect but it be ufe can not be recommend in we unfavourable climate other make ufe of finalt grounds le tour lately painter of note in paris often ufe they with great fuccel the method to prepare they be to bruth over the paper with guin water which directly draw with finalt moderately fine the luperfluous part of which should be fweep off with painter bruth when the gum water be perfectly dry on this the picture be to be paint but we have paper now in england to be procure of of excellent lexture as to render this preparation perhaps unnecellary it may be do the young pracitioner pleature to inform he that mobishop stationer in newportpreet long acre have make it he bufinct to provide himfelf with paper make on pur poic for crayonpainting drow where the student may be fupply with the belt fort of paper for he purpoic after the picture be begin be very great as the crayon will adhere much better than any other way which will enable the student to finith the picture with firmer body of colour and greater luftre the late mocote dif cover this method by accident and efteem it valuable acquifition and remember on particular occafion he remove fine crayon picture of rozalba and place it on another ftrain cloth without the leave injury by foak the canva with wet spange till the pafte between the cloth and paper be fufficiently wet to admit of teparation when painter want to make very correct copy of picture they generally make ufe of tiffany or black gauze frain tight on frame which they lay flat on the fubject to be imitate and with piece of fketch chalk trace all the outline on the tiffany they then lay the canva to be paint on flat upon the floor place the tiffany with the chalk line upon it and with a hlandkerchief bruth the whole over this prefent the exact outline of the picture on the canva the crayonpainter may alfo make ufe of this method when the fubject of he imitation be in oil but in copy crayon picture he muft have recourfe to the follow method on account of the glaf the head of califid in the collection of drchauncg the paintinc with craton picture be place upon the efel let the outline be draw on the glat with small camelhair pencil dip in lake ground thin with oil which muft be do with great exactness after this be accomplish take sheet of paper of the lame fize and place it on the glass roke over all the line with the hand by which mean the colour will adhere to the paper which muft be pierce with pinhole pretty clofe to each other the paper intend to be ufe for the painting muft next be lay upon table and the pierce paper place upon it then with fome fine pound charcoal tie up in piece of lawn rub over the perforate firoke which will give a exact outline great care muft he take not to bruth this off till the whole be draw over with fketch chalk which be compofition make of whiting and tobaccopipe clay roll like crayon and point at each end when the student paint immediately from the life it will be moft prudent to make correct draw of the outline on another paper the fize of the picture he be go to paint which he may trace by the preceed Ithod becaufe erroneous ftroke of the ketch chalk which be not to be avoid without great expertnet will prevent the crayon from adhere to the paper ow to certain greaty quality in the composition the student will find the fitting pofture with the box of crayon in he lap the moft convenient method for he to paint the part of the picture he be immediately painting should be rather below he face for if it be place too high the arm will be fatigue let the window of the room where he paint be darken at leave to the height of fix foot from the ground as before direct and the subject to be paint should be fituate in fuch man ner that the light may fall with every advantage on the face avoid too much hadow which feldom have good effect in portrait painting especially if the face he paint have any degree of delicacy before he begin to paint let he be attentive to he subject and appropriate the be tion or attitude proper to the age of the subject if child let it be childith if young lady express more vivacity than in the majeftic beauty of middle aged woman who alfo should not be expreff with the fame gravity as perfon far advanced in year let the embellifhment of the picture and introduction of bird animal ec be regulate by the rule of propriety and confiftency the feature of the face be carefully draw with chalk let the student take crayon of pure carmine and carefully draw the noftril and edge of the nofe next the fhadow then with the fainteft carmine teintlay in the rongeft light upon the nofe and forchead which muft be execute broad he be then to proceed gradually with painting with cr ayon the fecond teint and the fucceeding one till he berife at the fhadow which muft be cover brilliant en rich with much lake carmine little break with brilliantgreen this method will at firft offenfively hrike the eye from its crude appearance but in finithing it will be good foundation to produce pleaf effect colour be much more eafily fully when too bright than when the firft colour be dull to raife the picture into brilliant flate the feveral pearly teint difcernable in fine complection muft be imitate with blue verditer and white which anfwer to the ultramarine teint ufe in oil but if the part of the face where thefe teint appear be in fhadow the grayon compofe of black and white muft be fubfticute in they place thovch all the face when firft coloured should be lay in as brilliant as poffible yet each part should be keep in its proper tone by which mean the rotundity of the face will be preferve ler the student be careful when he begin the eye to draw they with grayon inclined to the carmine teint of whatever colour the iris be of he muft lay they in brilliant and at firft not load with colour but execute lightly no notice be to be take of the pupil yet the student muft let the light of the eye incline very much to the blue calt cautioufly avoid ftare white appearancc which when once introduce be feldom overcome preferve broad fhadow throw on its upper part by the eyclath black and heavy teint be alfo to be avoid in the eycbrow it be therefore beft to execute they like broad glow hadow at firft on which in the finiththe hair of the brow be to be paint by which Iinc thod of proceed the former teint will thew themfelves through and produce the moft pleaf effect the student should begin the lip with pure carmine and lake and in the fhadow ufe fome carmine and black the ftrong vermillion teint should be lay on afterwards he muft beware of execute they with fliff harth line gently intermix each with the neighbour colour make the fhadow beneath broad and enrich with brilliant crayon he mult form the corner of the mouth with carmine brown oker and green varioufly intermix if the hair be dark he should preferve much of the lake and deep carmine teint therein this may be eafily overpower by the warmer hair teint which as obferve in painting the eyebrow will produce richer effect when the picture be finith on the contrary if this method be unknown or neglect poverty of colour will be ditcernable pter craton paintinc after the student have cover over or as artift term it have deadcoloured the head he be to fweeten the whole together by rub it over with he finger begin at the strongeft light upon the forehead paff he finger very lightly and uniting it with the next teint which he muft continue till the whole be fweeten together often wipe he finger on towel to prevent the colour be fully he muft be cautious not to fmooth or fweeten he picture too often becaufe it will give rife to thin and fcanty effect and have more the appearance of drawing than folid painting as nothing but body of rich colour can conflitute rich effect to avoid this as the student find it neceffary to fweeten with the finger he muft continually replenith the picture with more crayon when the hlead be bring to fome degree of forwardness let the background be lay in which muft be treat in different manner cover it as thin as poftible and rub it into the paper with leatherstump near the face the paper should be almoft free from colour for this will do great fervice to the hlead and by its thinness give both foft and folid appearance in the background alfo crayon which have whiting in they compofition should be ufe but feldom or never without caution but chiefly fuch as be the moft brilliant and the leave adultcrate the ground be paint thin next the hlair will give the student a opportunity of painting the edge of the flair over in light and free manner when he give the finithing touch the student have proceed thus far the face hlair and background be entirely cover he muft carefully view the whole at fome diftance remark in what respect it be out of keep that be what part be too light and what too dark be particularly attentive to the white or chalky appearance which muft be fubdue with lake and carmine the above method be properly put into execution will produce the appearance of painting principally compofe of three colour viz carmine black and white which be the beft preparation painter can make for the produce fine crayon picture the next hep be to compleat the background and the hair as the duft in painting thefe will fallon the face and would much injure it if that be compleate firft from thence proceed to the forehead finithing downward till the whole picture be compleate back grounds may be of various colour but it require great tafte and judgment to fuit they properly to different complexion in general flrong coloured head should have weak and tender teint ground and on the contrary delicate complexion should be oppot with rrong and powerful teint by which proper contraft beweci painting ii cr aton the figure and the background the picture will receive great force and strike the spectator much more than it could poffibly do be this circumftance of contraft not attend to tounc painter often treat the backgrounds of picture as matter of very little or no confequence when it be moft certain great part of the beauty and brilliancy of the picture especially the face depend upon the teint be well fuit the dark keep in they proper place and the whole be perfectly in fubordination to the face thus fimple background require attention but the difficulty be hill greater when variety of object be introduce tuch as hill tree building ecc in thefe cafe one rule muft be strictly attend to that each grand object be difpofe of as to contraft each other this be not mean merely respect they form but they colour they light shade cc for inftance we will fuppofe the figure receiving the ftrongeft light behind the figure and very near at hand be the ftem of fome large tree thefe muft have shade throw over they either from drive cloud or fome other interpof circumstance behind thefe ftem of tree and at diftance be feen tree on rife ground thefe should receive the light as contraft to the former etc if a architedural background be choofe the fame rule muft be apply fuppofe building at moderate diftance be place behind the figure receive the light column or fome other object in hadow should intervene to preferve proper decorum in the piece or what will have the fame effect fhadow muft be throw over the lower part of the building which will give equal fatisfaction or repofe to the eyc it muft be remember the light muft be always place againft the dark and the weak againft the ftrong in order to produce force and effect and vice versa in painting over the forehead the laft time begin the higheftlight with the molt faint vermillion teint in the fame place where the faint carmine be firft lay keep it broad in the fame manner in the next fhade fucceeding the lighteff the student muft work in some light blue teint compote of verditer and white intermix with they tome of the deeper vermillion teint sweeten they together with great caution infenfibly melt they into one another increaf the proportion of each colour as he judgment shall direct some brilliant fellow may alfo be ufe but paringly and towards the root of the hlair rrong verditer teint intermix with green will be of lingular fervice cool crayon compote of black and white should fucceed thefe and melt into the hair this direction be for the finell complection but the student mull vary he colour accord to he fubjecl deneath with cr ton beneath the eye the pleaf pearly teint be to be perterve compofe of verditer and white and under the nofe and on the temple the fame may be ufe beheath the lip teint of this kind alfo be proper mixing they with the light green and some vermillion the introduction of green and bly into the face in painting have often give furprize to thofe who be unacquaint with the art but there be reafon fufficient for they introduction though it may appear ftrange at firft in order to break and correct the other colour the carmine predominate in the dead colour be as have be obferve the beft preparation for the fucceeding teint the crudeness of this preparation muft be correct by varioutly intermix green bly and vellow which of thefe be to be ufe be to be determine by the degree of carmine in the dead colour and the complexion intend the blue and vellow be of nature diametrically oppofite and ferve to correct the red and oppoie one another the green be compound of both thefe colour be of peculiar ufe in many cafe where the tranfition be not to be to violent the student attentively confider nature will difcover pleaf variety of colour on the furface and difthrough clear and tranfparent skin this variety will be sill encreat by the effect of light and hade he will perceive one part incline to the vermilion red aother to the carmine or lake one to the blue this to the green and that to the vellow ecc in order to produce thefe different effect he will apply thofe colour to which the teint be moft inclined yet in crayon painting it be often beft to compound the mix colour upon the picture fuch as blue and fellow inftead of green blue and carmine inflead of purple red and vellow instead of orange in other circumftance the compound already mixt should be ufe but in this cafe there can be no abfolute rule give it muft be leave to the experience and difcretion of the painter though the student may be greatly affift in the commencement of he study by a able mafter to direct and point out the beft method to treat circummftance of this nature as they occur in practice which may at firft appear obicure and myfterious but will foon to good capacity become demonftrably clear upon certain and fure principle the circumftance that require different treatment be of various and to many as to render it impostible for I here to defcend to every particular i finithing the check let the pure lake clear they from any duit contract from the other crayon then with the lake may be intermix the bright vermillion and laft of all if the futycel should require it few touch of painting with cr aton the orange coloured crayon but with extreme caution after this fweeten that part with the finger as little as poftible for fear of produce heavy difagreeable effect on the cheek as the beauty of crayon picture confift in one colour thew itfelf through or rather between another this the student can not too often remark it being the only method of imitate beautiful complection the eye be the moft difficult feature to execute in crayon as every part muft be expreff with the utmoft nicety to appear finith at the same that the painter muft preferve its breadth and folidity while he be particulariz the part to accomplith this it will be good general rule for the student to ufe he crayon in fweeten as much and he finger as little as poffible when he ant point to touch fmall part with he may break off of little of he crayon againft the box which will produce corner fit to work with in the minuteft part if the eyc lathe be dark he muft ufe fome of the carmine and brown oker and the crayon of carmine and black and with thefe he may alfo touch the iris of the kye if brown or hazel make broad fhadow cauf by the ryclath red teint of vermillion carmine and lake will execute the corner of the eye properly but it the eyc lid be too red they will have difagrecable fore appearance the pupil of the eye muft be make of pure lampblack between this and the lower part of the iris the light will catch very firong but it muft not be make too fudden but be gently diffute round the pupil till it be loft in shade when the eyeball be fufficiently prepare the fhine speck muft be make with purc white crayon which should be firft broken to point and then lay on firm but as it be poffible they may be defective in neatnel they should be correct with pin take off the redundant part by which mean they may be form as neat as can be require the difficulty with respect to the nofe be to preferve the line properly determine and at the fame time to artfully blend into the cheek as to express it projection and yet no real line to be perceptible upon clofe examination in fome circumftance it should be quite blend with the check which appear behind it and determine entirely with flight touch of red chalk the fhadow cauf by the nofe be generally the darkeft in the whole face partake of no reflection from it furrounding part carmine and brown oker carmine and black and fuch brilliant crayon will compofe it beft student have before prepare the lip with the frongeft lake and carmine cc muft with thefe colour make they compleatly correct and when finifh introduce the ftrong vermillion but with great caution as they ifc painting with craton extremely predominant this if properly touch will give the lip a appearance equal if not superior to thofe execute in oil notwithflanding the feem fupethe latter have by means of glaze of which the former be entirely deftitute when the student paint the neck he should avoid expreft the mufcle too ftrong in the ftem nor should the bone appear too evident on the cheft as both have a unpleaf effect denote violent agitation of the body circumftance feldom neceffary to express in portrait painting the moft neceffary part to be expreft and which should ever be obferve even in the moft delicate fubject be jult above the place where the collar bone hrong mark unite and if the head be much throw over the shoulder tome notice should be take of the large mufcle that rife from behind the ear and be infert into the pit between the collar bone all inferior mufcle should be in general quite avoid the student will find this caution neceffary as moft fubject especially thin perfon have the muicle of the neck much more evident than would be ju dicious to imitate as few neck be too long it may be nccellary to give fome addition to the ftem fault on the the method with which painter in oil expret tranfparency in the lip be by painting they firll with light vermillion teint and when dry touch they over with pure lakc other fide be quite unpardonable nothing be more ungraceful than fhort neck in colour the neck let the student preferve the ftem of pearly hue and the light not of ftrong as on the cheft if any part of the breaft appear it tranfparency muft alfo be expreff by pearly teint but the upper part of the cheft should be coloured with beautiful vermillion delicately blend with the other iv aint the drapery be commonly think to be very inferior branch of the art this be moft certainly miftake very great painter be afk what part of the picture he think moft difficult to execute antwer the drapery whether we allow this to be abfolutely true or not we may venture to affirm that it be very difficult part to execute with tafte merely to give the effeet of silk sattin or cloth coc be not the point this the fervile copyift by the mere dint of labour may effect and may even deceive paintinc with cr ayon the vulgar eye to that the imitation may be take for reality but to make the fold give grace and dignity to the figure to cloath it uninfiuenced by prejudice fathion or caprice of as to bear the teft of age require the fulleft exertion of true genius and the frudy of man life but it be not my defign to fay much on this copious subject therefore shall difmiss it with few observation concern the colour and execution dark blue purple black pink and all kind of red drapery alfo should be firft ting with carmine which will render the colour much more brilliant than any other method over this should be lay on the paper the middle teint medium between the light and dark teint of which the drapery be to be paint except the dark maff of chadow which should be lay on at firft as deep as poffible thefe sweeten with the finger be deftitute of the smaller fold will exhibit mafterly breadth which the lefter fold when add ought by no means to deftroy with the light and dark teint the smaller part be next to be make with freedom execute as much with the crayon and as little with the finger as poftible in each fold touch the laft flroke with the crayon which ftroke the finger muft never touch in the cafe of reflection the fimple touch of the crayon will be too harfh therefore finger will be neceffary afterwards as reflect light be always more tender than thofe which be direct with respect to reficelion in general they muft always partake of the fame colour as the object reflect but in the cafe of fingle figure it may be ufeful to make fome particular obfervation in blue drapery let the reffection be of greenith call in green drapery make they of yellow teint in yellow of a orange in orange reffeet reddith caft in all red fomething of they own nature but inclined to the yellow black should have reddith reflection the reflection of reddith teint will alfo prefent purple to the beft advantage or whatever colour the drapery be its reflection on the face muft partake thereof otherwife the picture will have but gaudy effect line lace fur should be touch spiritedly with the crayon finger very little except the latter and the laft touch even of this like all other part should be execute by the grayon without fweeten with the finger have content myfelf with treat on the firft principle of the art of painting only which hope will prove not altogether ufeless becaufe many judicious writer on the subject have not be to explicit concern the element painting with crayon of the art whofe work notwithftanding merit the higheft attention and to whom muft recommend the student for farther knowledge and instruction the method have recommend have be practife by the moft celebrated crayon painter whofe work have be hold in public eftimation but the knowledge of and ability to exxecute each feparate part with brilliancy and truth will be find very infufficient to conftitute compleat painter without he judgment enable he to unite they with each other by correctness of draw propriety of light and thadow and harmony of colour in order to accomplish this the student should carefully avoid finish one part in particular till he have properly confider the connection it be to have with the reft the neglect of this be the principal reafon why the performance of indifferent painter be of deftitute of what be term breadth of conspicuoutly beautiful in the work of great mafter it muft be grant that this obfervation relate more particularly to large compofition where diverfity of figure require fuch judicious difpofition that each may affitt in the combination of kind of univerfal harmony yet even in portrait painting the student should be particularly attentive to observe this idea of breadth if he be defirous of acquire that importance and dignity which constitute excellence in painting se ct ton on of the material perfection of the crayon confift in great meafure in they foftness for it be impoflible to execute brilliant picture with they if they be otherwife on which account great care should be obferve in the prepar they to prevent they be hardin all compofition flakewhite and whitelead should be wholly reject becaufe the flighteft touch with either of thefe will unavoidably turn black the ufual objection to crayon painting be that they be subject to change but whenever this happen it be intirely ow to a injudicious ufe of the abovemention white which will fland only in oil to obviate the bad effect arife from the ufe of fuch grayon let the student make ufe of common whiting prepare in the follow manhner take large veffel of water put the whiting into it and mix they well together let this fland about half minute then pour off the top into another veffel and throw the with crayon gritty fediment away let what be prepare reft about minute and then pour it off as before which will purify the whiting and render it free from all dirt and grittinet when this be do let the whiting fettle and then pour the water from it afterwhich lay it on the chalk to dry and keep it for ufe either for white crayon or the purpofe of prepare teint with other colour for with this all other teint may be fafely prepare if the student chufe to make crayon of the whiting immediately after it be wath it be not neceffary to dry it on the chalk for it may be mix inftantly with any other colour which will fave confiderable trouble all colour of heavy or gritty nature especially blue verditer muft be purify by wathing after this method the student muft be provide with large fexible palletknife large stone and muller to levigate the colour two or three large piece of chalk to abforb the moifture from the colour after they be levigate piece of flat glass to prevent the moifture from be abforb too much till the colour be roll into form and veffel for water spirit ec as neceffity and convenience thi direct ed mine and ir be rather difficult to procure either good carmine or good lake good carmine be inclined to the vermillion teint and should be a impalpable powder and good lake to the carmine teint the carmine crayon be prepare in the follow manner as they texture be inclinable to hardness inflead of grinding and roll they take fufficient quantity of carmine lay it upon the grindftone mix it with levigate knife with spirit of wine till it become fmooth and even yet the let friction produce by the knife the better the chalkftone be ready lay the colour upon it to abforb the spirit but be careful that it be lay on in proper hape for painting if it be levigate too thin the grayon will be too flat and if too thick it will occafion wafte of colour by they adhere to the palletknife but practice will render the proper degree of confiftency familiar when thus make if the carmine crayon should prove too hard they muft be reduce to a impalpable powder in mortar and again mix in the same manner till foft chough painting with cr yon for ufe which will not be if the carmine be ground by the muller with any fluid the limple colour be prepare the next sleep be to compofe the different teint by mixture with whiting the proportion to be obferve confift of twenty gradation to one which may be clearly underffood by the follow direction take fome of the fimple colour and levigate it with spirit of wine add about one part of wath whiting to three part of carmine of which when properly incorporate make two parcel the next gradation should be compote of equal quantity of carmine and whiting of which four crayon may be make the third compofition should have one fourth carmine and three fourth whiting of this make fix crayon which will be good proportion with the reft the laft teint should be make of whiting very faintly ting with carmine of which make about eight crayon which will compleat the abovemention proportion as thefe compound teint be levigate they be to be lay immediately upon the chalk that the moifture may be abforb to the proper degree of drynel for form into crayon which may be know by its lofe the greateft part of its adhefive quality when take into the hand if the confiftency be find to be right it may be then lay upon the glass which have no pore will prevent the moifture from become too dry before it be convenient to form it into crayon otherwife the grayon would be full of crack and very brittle which will be great inconvenience when they be ufe in painting though thefe teint make with whiting may be roll yet the pure carmine will not bear it but muft be leave on the chalkftone till perfectly dry be colour very apt to be hard to prevent which the student muft obferve the follow particular take about half the quantity of lake intend for the grayon and grind it very fine with spirit of wine let it dry and then pulverize it which be eafily do if the lake be good then take the other half and grind it with spirit after which mix it with the pulverife lake and lay it out directly in crayon on the chalk the colour will not bear roll the fimple colour be thus prepare proceed with the compound grayon as direct before and in the same degree of gradation as the carmine teint if thefe should prove too hard when make let they be again pulverize and treat as the carmine ver painting ith crayon or native cinabar to prepare the beft be inclined to the carmine teint this colour mix it on the stone with foft water or spirit after which it may be roll into crayon it be fometime indeed inclined to be of very foft as to return again to powder and can not be hold in the finger which may be remedy by mixing it up with thin watergruel well frain which will give fufficient cohefion the different teint be produce by mixture of the fimple colour with whiting accord to the proportion already give be colour very apt to bind and be render foft with more difficulty than carmine and lake the fame method of preparation be to be follow with this as direct with respect to lake only it be neceffary to grind larger quantity of the pure colour as it be chiefly ufe for painting drapery the different teint may be make accord to neceffity or the fancy of the painter be colour naturally gritty and therefore it be neceffary to wath it well its particle be of coarfe as to require fome bind matter to unite they otherwife the crayon will never adhere together to accomplith this take quantity fufficient to form two or three crayon to which add piece of flack plaifter of paris about the fize of pea mix thefe well together and form the crayon upon the chalk this blue be extremely brilliant and will be of great ufe in heighten drapery ec the teint muft be form with whiting as direct in the former inftance and be highly ferviceable for painting fleth to produce thofe pearly teint to beautiful in crayon picture it be not necefiary to mix the compound with fpirit as clear water will be fufficient brilltant green be produce with great difficulty which may be procure of thofe who make it they bufiness to prepare they yet the follow composition will be take yellow oker and after grind it find ufeful thefe brilliant crayon will be necelfary for the student to compleat he fet with of which he will find great want both in the brown and deep red as well as in the green but in general he should be careful what white or light crayon he ufe that they be not compound by the maker with flakewhite trial may be make of one of they thus bruife the crayon to powder between the finger and thumb and mix it with a equal quantity of charcouldull put this into crucible which muft be place in fierce fire till the charcoal duft be confume and if the crayon be make with flakewhite the lead will return to its original metallic flate confequently thefe light crayon be not fit for ufe in this limate as the leall damp will make they turn black yet notwithllanding the dark colour will be perfectly good and may be ufe without danger with painting with cr yon spirit mix it with the powder of pruffian blue then temper it with knife and lay the crayon on the chalk without roll they befide this ufe king yellow mix with pruffian blue brown oker and pruflian blue the crayon make of thefe laft may be roll various teint may be produe by thefe colour accord to fancy or neceflity fome to partake more of the blue and other of the yellow be the moft ufeful and the moft brilliant levigate with spirit of wine and compofe the different teint as before direct yellow oker and naple yellow ground with spirit will make ufeful crayon produce with kingyellow and vermillion ground together with spirit and the teint form as in other cafe but no great quantity of they be require vl ii be fine dark brown after fix or eight of the fimple crayon be prepare feveral rich compound teint may be roman oker and pruffian blue mix in different proportion will be ufcful produce from it by mixture with carmine in various degree black carmine and this colour mix together make ufeful teint for painting hair feveral gradation may be produce from each of thefe by mixture with whiting roman and brown oker be excellent colour either fimple or compound with carmine whiting ting in feveral degree with either of thefe will prove very ferviceable in painting common seacoal ground and mix with carmine be fine brown may be treat in juft the fame manner only it be neceftary to levigate it with spirit of wine prussian elue ground with spirit and mix with pulverize lake will produce good purple carmine thus mix with pruffian blue will produce purple fomething different from the former various teint may be make from either of thefe compound by mixture with whiting painting with crayon be the only full black that can be ufe with fafety as all other be fubject to mildew but as good lampblack be very fcarce the student will perhaps find it moft expedient to make it himself the process of which be as follow provide tin cone fix it over lamp at fuch height that the flame may juft reach the cone for the foot to gathe within it when fufficient quantity be collect take it out and burn all the greafe from it in crucible it muft then be ground with fpirit and lay on the chalk to abforb the moifture various grey teint may be form from this by mixture with whiting as mention in for mer inftance black chalk ground be very good blue black cinabar mix with carminethis be compofition of great ufe and teint make from this with whiting will be find very ferviceable carmine and black be another good compound of which five or fix gradation should be make fome partake more of the black and other have the carmine moft predominant befide feveral teint by mixture with whitng cinabar and black be alfo very ufeful compound from which feveral different teint should be make paussian elue and black be another good compound and will be find of fingular fervice in painting drapery ir be impoftible to lay down rule for the form every teint neceffary in compofe fet of crayon there be many accidental compofition entirely dependant on fancy and opinion the student should make it rule to fave the leaving of he colour for of thefe he may form various teint which will occafionally be ufeful the cologn or cullenearth yellow oker brown oker roman oker naple vellow umber black chalk and seacoal duft be all subject to throw
