chapterhouse in st. paul s churchyard mdcclmvi the introduction none of the art which have be invent for the use or amusement of mankind can boast so great number of admirer as that of draw and very justly for it give such a agreeable representation of thing that we be apt to fancy we see object which have no real existence and that the imagery before we which be no more than paint cloth actu ally breathe the whole creation wich all its work and wonder come within the power of its imitation it let before we thing long since bury in oblivion exhibit to perfect view the most note action of people who have be long in they grave and shew we we ancestor in per fect resemblance of they feature throseveral successive generation there be scare any art or profession which receive not some assistante from draw ing without she help no design or model can be well execute to she the mathematician architect and navigator be continually indebt no station of life be exempt from the practice of it from ihe general at the hend of a army to the mechanic who subsist by he handicraft this excellent art seem inculcate by nature herself for we see it not only practise by grow proficient but even child frequently draw various figure and that of curiously as even to astonish we wich they produc tion that therefore youth may be instruct how to attain to good degree of perfection in the art we shall prescribe the best rule we be able at least such as we apprehend be ablolutely necessary for they information after which we shall give they fome very ufeful and pertinent instruction for they better understanding of this art ruur for the direction of the young practitioner in the art of draw daraw may be define representation by line and shade of any object in nature or art the imitation of another draught or the express the likeness of something conceive in we own mind in imita tion of nature or copying from any draught the form and shape of the figure be the first thing that make a impression on the mind which be after ward reduce into form by manual operation which draw the lige hence appear the necessity of frequently employ the mind in curioudy observe whatever object be propose to it by which mean it will be more capabie of conceive truly and exactly of object and the hand will more easily and justly delineate that which be so strongly fix in the memory it be highly necessary for he who would draw well to understand what be truly good and beautiful in draught in order to which the most expedi tious method will be to compare print and draught together many painter have grievously miscarried by satisfy themlelves only wich imitat ing bad piece without give any scope to they own genius or improve they knowledge in judge of the brauty and defect of picture the idea in we mind may in great measure serve we for model and to im prove these we should frequently examine the performance of other and we observation on piece that be esteem correctly do qhould be nice and critical we should attentively consider every print and draught we see and every beauty we find in it endeavour to fix on we memory particularly the freedom and boldness of the outline and the proportion of the several part above all thing it be necessary thart the judgment be rightly inform for then the young practitioner will make the greater and quicker progress in he improvement than if he go on in practice without encrease he knowledge for he success will be more owto he genius than he hand the labour of the hand must indeed aid and assist that of the brain for whoever would be a able artist must by continual practice make the art habitual the rule of all art be soon learn bur to attain perfection in any of they long practice and strict attention be ablolutely requisite it be true maxim that laziness be never the parent of any thing excellent draw be not attainable but by length of time nor perfection in it be quirable unless the hand be frequently employ in the pradtice and the mind in judge every day should produce something and the hand give frequent proof of the speculation of the head as some part of every day should be spend in the practice of this art we would recommend the morning as fittest for that purpofe which therefore should be employ in perfect yourfelves both in judgment and practice he who propose to gain a entrance into minerva s cabinet must make he approach gradually thus in the art of draw thoughthe represen tation of the human figure or many figure in piece be the principal object which every practitioner have chiefly in view yet he must not make this he first essay but proceed to that by proper and regular step let the first part of he study be to draw streight and curve line square round regular irregular and inanimate figure also part of human fi gure as the eye the ear the hand foot this will be good foun dation whereon to erect he future structure for by this means he will acquire readiness of hand freedom and exactness in draw line and accus tom himself to the exercise of he patience qualifiication absolutely nece sary for one who would be esteem a exact copier of nature especially in piece thait require length of time and more than ordinary skill in the per formance he who begin well have more than half performhe work the outline be the circumferent stroke of figure the perfection of good outline consist in the freedom and boldness of the stroke and the due proportion of all its part to attain which the scholar be admonish to reject all mean and trifling practice such as trace che original throoil paper or make use of the paper for the same purpose or take advantage of a artificial light the use of such deception will certainly prevent all progress and improvement in draw neither should the rule and compass be use except in architecture or to raise perpendi cular in order to form square or some oher figure to draw in or when a artist have finish he draught he take this method to compare it with the original to see whether there be a agreement between they however the bare eye if use to it will be suficient for such discernment for some time at first be satisfied wich practise upon good outline without aim at finish piece nor be it necessary that you should as yet hatch or shade you own draught you outline at first must be sketchwich flight and faint touch that you may have a opportunity to amend it where proper which so will have the ley appearance of be retouch in every stroke endeavour a exact imitation and whenever you mend the outline either by take away little of its part or by swell the other be sure to lose nothing of the freedom and boldness of it mind frequently to compare you copy wich the original take particular notice of what be amiss and let not the least fault escape uncorrected that so in the draught which you may afterwards make of the same original those error may be avoid for you must not pass from one original to anothertill you be in good degree master of the first the bess and surest method of prac rice be to make great number of sketch of the fame figure in each of which endeavour to excel what you do in the former in you first operation proceed slowly for hasty production be seldom beautiful or correct and design be often thus spoiled in the first attempt it be no easy matter to amend bad habit expedition in performance be acquire by constancy in practice as the young beginner will have be quent occasion for the exercise of he patience he must be careful to subdue he passion in he first attempt he must procce deliberately and slowly and use he urmoft endeavour to perform well secure every stroke and try all he skill to make one good draught rather than to hurry over in negli go manner great number of bad one when you fit down to work and all the time you be at it take strict and close view of you original and in you mind divide it into several part take due notice of the length breadth and similitude of each part ob serve the proportion of each to the ocher and to the whole the distance between the part and the part that lie parallel or be exactly opposite to each other when you have finish you copy and lay aside both the example and draught let you mind be employ for some time on other affair then return to it again and view you work afresh and very probably you vill discover fault which do not appear to you before t be easy to imagine that when the eye have be engage considerable time on the same ob ject the form and shape of it become familiar to he and that on revi sal he mind may entertain different notion of it than in the light it appeard before and assure yourself whatever pain you bestow in review and com par you copy wich the original draught in order to discover and amend you fault will not be useless but you will find this advantage in it that ir will be means of perfect you in that particular draught and improve you in the knowledge of line draught and proportion and by continu ing to practise this method you will in little time find yourself qualified for the exactest imitation let you outline be large and smooth and draw in flow glide manner for if they be too streight they will carry disagreable stiffness but if draw accord to this direction they will have the resemblance of life and motion and appear wich a easy grace in all you draught let there be perfect relation between the part and the whole and uniformity run throthe whole piece that be let every member be make for its own head and agree with it you must not put strong limb to body that be consumptive or to old age in its decay nor mult you be less exact in pair the eye hand leg and foot for the least disproportion will be blemish or when any of the limb be not proportionate to the rest in the instruction which we shall presently give the learner will find direction to avoid any such mistake and solecism when yon draw the muscle take care to insert they accord to the rule of anatomy they must not be croud into small section but keep as entire as possible and only the principal musce express in member which be to express any particular force they must be shew large as in the leg when it support the body or in the arm when it lift weight and be more swell than in any other member thus when the limb and member be draw wich few and large muscle they shew themselves wich majesty and beauty so in drapery the beauty of which consist not in multiplicity of fold but in they plain simplicity and natural order the drapery must seem to cover the part loosely for if it be too close and streight the piece will appear too stiff the plast must be large fold naturally over the part which be to be see underneath which be do by place properly the light and shade in cover both the extremity of the joint such as che shoulder elbow knee care must be take to mark they in such manner as to distinguilh they shape and in fact drapery be no trist or insignificant part of this art for if well do it add new grace to the picture give a enliven air to its other beauty and never fail of pleasing the eye of the spectator the material proper for draw the material necessary for this purpose be either pencil of black lead or black lead lead in porcrayon charcoal chalk black red and white pastil or crayon pen hairpencil and indian ink nothing be more proper for beginner to practise with than black lead in draw plain line especially as this make smoother stroke than can be do by charcoal or crayon cut you lead with penknifetill you have bring it to fine point that it may give neat small stroke or you may fix piece of the same lead in porcrayon but whatever it be you sketch with use yourself to hold it longway in you hand and let you finger be much farther from the point than the nip of pen be when you write and let you stroke be form with light gentle touch thus will you gradually acquire ready command of hand and you will with ease make yout outline free and bold in practise after limb and figuresi will be proper at first to draw the rough sketch wich charcoal which be mere easily discharge from paper than black lead slit pour charcoal in small slender piece one of which fix in porcrayon the better to hold it then sharpen it to point and lightly but correctly sketch out pour original when vou have so do if there be any thing you mislike in che performance you may easily wipe it out by brush ie with feather or ciean rag when vou have secure vour out line wich charcoal proce thus take feather and wipe they slightly over wich it that they may appear faint then go over the line wich black or redlead and correct they wherever you can if after all this vou still see any error to amend take bit of crumb of stale white loaf with which vou may discharge any part of it you please by rub it therewith yeu may use redlead or red or black chalk in the fame manner as blacklead if in heightnings or when you would give strong light or draw on colour s paper use white chalk and tobaccopipe clay pistil and crayon be term which perhaps the learner may not readily understand they be colour mix up with tobaccopipe clay which must be work into paste and roll up into the thickneis of quill two or three inch long and then dry when fit for use the artist work they on colour paper but not in hatching as black and redlead commonly be the colour be rub and work together so thar there be no single stroke but the whole appear as if only brush have be use the crayon be very expeditious manner of draw and when skilfully handle always produce delicate softness and fine expression however it must be observe that the careless or rude touch of finger may at once blot out all the beauty of this fine work to prevent which let it be pre serve in bock or in frame under glass the crayon will be workmore easily if the grain of the paper be litte rough and be express more strongly than when the paper be quite smooth or if the paper be somewhat dark or brownich or whar they call whitebrown it will give relief to the tender part of the work by shew the light stroke of it in shad draught sometimes pen be use for hatch the cross stroke however the hair pencil and indian ink serve much better for this use which be not only proper for hatch by stroke but for shad by I thol much more expeditious that be by wach which be the fame way of work as with hair pencil and water colour in hatch the shade be produce by line not unlike ihe stroke which shade print engrave lnnt in wash no linc appear but the shade shew themselves like those in metzotinto print of the tint of light and shadow light and shade when judiciously dispose give the appearance of subslance nature and distance to such body as the pencil represent suppose for instance circie draw on piece of paper imagine you see it fill up with any even colour you can conceive of it no otherwise than as round flat equal body but if you put the strongest of the colour in the middle and weaken it gradually towards the extremity you will per ceive a agreeable deception and instead of flat even body it will have the resemblance of ball or globe wherever the colour appear the most lively there the object catch the eye first and seem nearest to it but where the colour weaken and go off it grow faint and at length seem to fly off and break away from the sight thus the painter by break and diminish he colour throw that behind which he have mind shall be less visible when you round the part of a object it require the nicest touch of the pencil to draw the extremity so as that in turn they shall lose themselves insensibly and confusedly without too sudden transition of the light into the shadow or of the shadow into the light but let the one pass into the other as it be reciprocally and imperceptibly that be by degree of light into shadow and shadow into light when you object be to be paint light you must allow due breadth of shadow to sustain they if dark sudden light must rise behind they to separate they from the ground or from other object that be place behind they or else they will appear as if they be stick upon each other in confused manner whereas by just opposition of light to shade and shade to light projection be give which make separation of the object you must keep proper ballance between light and shadow and intro ducing broad light into you draught you mult give it large shadow you must make you light serve as repose to the dark and che dark the light thus drapery which be coloured red or yellow in some place in other will take brown wich good effect the eye see a object the more strongly and plainly the nearer it be dif tance weaken the sight the farther off a object be the more impersectly it be perceive those object therefore which stand nearect to view should be better finishthan thofe which be throw behind but obserse that the must have reciprocal dominion over each other so that as one object by it heighthtenings force other to appear at distance so the same object must be throw farther from the sight than other which be illuminate more strongly it should be farther observe in regard to light and shade that it be no enough that remote object be coloured in more faint and languid manner but the more or less distant they be the part should appear more or less confused the eye can not minutely discriminate a object which be at do tance from it we can see human figure at street s length but can not discern the feature of they face or the plast in they cloath so the innumerable leave of distant grove appear to the sight but as one mass white pure and unmixed have two different property it draw a object nearer to it and it carry it off to farther distance when it be place wich black che opposition of light and dark bring che object more into view and render it more sensible but pure white as it be the lightest of colour will fly off to the remotest view unless force forward and sup ported by black on the other hand pure black be deem the heaviest most earthy and most sensible of all colour and present object nearer to the sight you must cast it into mass confuse be insensibly and give it its proper repose in the representation of body you must always give they such light as be most proper and convenient for they suppose situation suppose the object before you be in the field or open air and the sun obscure with cloud you business be to introduce a universal light though not vivid or strong you shade too must be faint but when the sun appear in all it be glory you light must then be very strong and bold and the shadow exceed dark suppole again that the object you represent be in room little though not very much illuminate and to survey it you take you station without and stand level wich the light that strike upon ir that figure must have very soft shadow which will shew it very beautifully and though the shadow be so soft yet the figure will seem as if it be emboss and have very bold appearance when small light illuminate body the shadow on the dark side appear large and they extremity very bold whereas large light render the shadow on the darker side more distinct and much softer than they li mitation useful instruction for the young practitioner whoever would make any proficiency in the art of draw must first understand geometry for it be by this and the help of line that we be struct to take the length and largeness of body and know whether they be streight or curve round oval and square or any other imaginary figure but as it be not we business here to treat of geometry or give those geometrical rule which be use in the art of draw we shall refer the learn to le clerc s practical geometry he that would be perfect master in the art of draw must learn to sketch well to which therefore he ought to give the greatest attention in copy statue some person begin wich the head which they entirely finish before they proceed any farther by which mean it frequently happen that they either make the head too little or too big and the other part so disproportionate that there be but small resemblance of the original occa sion chiefly throwant of duly observe distance when therefore you have any thing to draw let you first care be to divide it into its differ ent part then measure the distance in the original with you eye mark the distance and length of each division with faint line on you paper and make sketch of the while figure before you proceed to finish any part of it so will yon secure the proportion in the exactest manner the learner will find among these example several draught of the part of the face as the eye nose mouth view in different position all which he should practise upon before he attempt whole face for which purpose we shall lay down such leffon and instrucion concern a oval wich its several change and variation and of the cross in the fame as will enable he to flgure all bowings and returning reclination and incli nation of all sort of face the head you be to observe have the shape and form of a egg or oval this head have eye eyebrow nose and ear which must be place in they proper situation by run cross throthe oval by this means you will divide ihe perpendicular in the oval into four equal part which will make the head to measure four nose in height the face three only the diameter cross the perpendicular divide into live part each be the breadth or wideness of one eye this diameter be call the ocular line or that whereon the eye be to be place you must therefore draw streight line from the top of the right ear through boch eye to the top of the lest ear and the line draw from the top of the head down throthe nose mouth and chin be call the perpendicular cross the diame ter or ocular line at right angles these line together we call the cross of the oval upon which cross whatever situation the face be in you must place the eye nose mouth and ear in proper place when you understand this thoroughly and hive fix it in you mind vo will soon be able to draw good face out of you own fancy and inven tion and execute they in masterly manner but if you accustom yourself to draw only after print draught or picture without know the use of the crossline and the proportion of face wich its part you take wrong method don know what yon be about and will never attain to any degree of perfection have thus instruct you in the several method of draw face we come now to give you the dimenlion and proportion of the several part of the body it be customary wich the autient to allow eight head to they figure though some of they have only seven the modern usually divide figure into ten face take it at the crown of the head and end at the sole of the foor thus from the crown of the head to the forehead be the third part of the face the face take its beginning at the root of the lowest hair on the fore head and it be end be at the bottom of the chin painter divide the face into three proportional part namely the force head the nose the mouth and chin the distance from the chin to the pit betwixt the collarbone measure two length of nose from the same pit to the bottom of the breast one face from thence to the navel one face from the navel to che privity one face the distance from the genitals to the upper part of the knee two face the knee itself measure half face meafure from the lower part of the knee to the ancle and you will find it two face from the ancle to the sole of the foot be half face when man stretch out he arm as wide as he can line draw from the top of the longest finger of the right hand to the top of the longest singer on the left will meafure the length of he whole body or he will find himfelf as broad as he be long thee distance from side to side of the breast two face the bone of the arm call humerus from the shoulder to the elbow measure twp face the bone call cubitus wich part of the hand measure from the tip of the elbow to the root of the little finger contain two face from che box of the shoulderblade to che pit betwixt che collarbone be one face in take the measurement of the breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other to see if it be equal to the length of the body you be to observe that the box of the elbow wich the humerus and of the humerus wich che shoulderblade bear the proportion of half the face when the arm be stretch out the sole of the foot measure the sixth part of the figure the hand be the length of the face the thumb of the nose from the place where che pectoral muscle or that muscle which make the breast disappear to the middle of the arm measure four nose carry you measure from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand you will find it five nose tour longest toe be the length of you nose the top of the two nipple and the pit betwixt the two collarbone make a equilateral triangle no certain measure can be give for the breadth of che limb because even the measure be changeable accord to the different quality of the person and movement of the muscle these farther rule be to be observe in draw head viz you must set the eye at such distance from one another that you may place one between they the mouth when shut hasthe dimension of a eye the ear be always on level with the eye top and below with the nose whether it be short or long the nostril should be place exactly against the corner to the eye in face that be flat the cheek swell out and one that be lean the check fall in and the jawbone stand out have finish we instruction for the draw of the face let we now proceed to draw man at full length in the first piace you must make pour oval then divide as before direct you then draw perpendicular line from the top of the head to the sole of the foot which you must divide into eight length this will be good direction in place you figure upricht or in whatever action the posture require where it either fall in or swell out you must make the length of une head between the chin and the breast the third measure must reach to the navel the fourth from thence to the genitals the fifth to the middle of the thigh the sixth come to the lower part of the knee the seventh to the lower part of the leg and the last reach to the heel or sole of the foot in every measure or division you must take particular notice what touch there be of the muscle the leg must be first draw on which the body stand then the other after which draw the arm and hand you must first draw all the part very lightly only with coal because that will give you the least troubie in rub out or alter the hand you must observe be twice as long as broad and each of they part have its particular length breadth and thickness the nail of the finger make about half the joint it be upon the length of the foot measure sixth part or height of man or five eighth more in length than in breadth take notice that the length of the face and hand be exactly equal and be just the tenth part of person s height have thus instruct you to draw complete man we shall in the next place lay down some rule for the draw of child some will have the length of child to contain five measure of the head as thus from the top of the head they make three and the thigh and leg two morc the breadth between the shouldler be the length of head and half ihe breadth of the body above the navel the length of one head and the breadth of the thickest part of the thigh be one third of two length of the head the breadth of che knee measure exactly the distance between the eye and the chin ehe brawn of che arm and small of the leg be just the thickness of the neck if you take the proportion of child stand backward you will find it of the fame meadure as the former if you be desirous of draw piece well proportion you must be very careful and attentive to copy all the several part singly as the eye ear rule for fill up empty figure thus far we have treat of colour and outline we come now to instruct the learner how to fill up the empty figure and to mark the hatching to as to produce the best effect in the first place observe that you hatching must consist but of two stroke cross each other or at most three to make the strongest shade where the cavity be such as require the whole force of you lead or crayon you must rub it upon you paper as you see occasion for it would be needless trouble to employ more than three hatching one upon another when with you charcoal you have draw the outline you must be touch they wich you redlead crayon and then with feather brudh away the dirtiness of the charcoal when you have do that you must retouch wich gentle hand such place as have be foul in the rub as the hair eye nose mouth finger toe outline let I also caution you that in those outline which be open to day you make you stroke very light but stronger in those which be darken thus will the outline appear in natural manner and add wonderful beauty and grace to human figure and all other object when this be do you must begin the shade with single hatch but pretty strong yon begin it at the top proceed insensibly to the bottom as evenly in the distance as you possibly can you then go on to the rounding which you must also ex press by single stroke with such light as the object before you require be cautious not to make you shadow too hard or dark at first if you would present the perspective in the best manner begin the shadow lightly and faintly and heighten they afterwards and you will soon be pleased with the agreeable effect instrustion how to draw after picture model of the life have give you the neccessary instruction for draw print and draught we shall in the last place direct you how to draw after picture model or the life and in what manner you be to place they when you have get picture to draw after be sure to place it in good light so that the sight of you eye and the light of the day may fall together on the picture place yourself at moderate distance accord to the largeness or smallness of the picture at least no farther off than that you may with glance of you eye see the whole picture at once for the larger the picture be at the greater distance you must sit to draw it be careful likewise to place you print exactly right before you and let it not lie down flat for if it be lay flat you will quickly see the figure in it fore shorten the paper you draw upon you must lay five or six time double upon pannel board set in you lap and raise as high as yon can wich you knee or let it be rest on form or stoop desk of that you work may stand upon one end before you thus will you be enable to judge of the similitude between you draught and the original which it will be i be possible for you to do if it lie flat before you the next thing vou have to do be to guess as near as you can at the middle of the thing you have to draw whether picture or any other matter then mark it on you paper wich the point of you coal when you have do this look for the largest figure if there happen to be more than one and touch they lightly in proper place and so all that be in the picture you will then presently discover whether you gue and sketch be true or not but besides the before you draw stroke be sure you do it wich good reaon and observation and be very careful about the great and general part and middle not with the small breakingtill the next sketch and by constantly practise in this manner you will insensibly acquire facility and judgment in you work another rule you be to observe be always to begin on the right side of the figure for so you have the first stroke constantly in you eye and the rest will naturally follow and give less trouble but if you begin on the left side you hand cover the object from you sight have thus make rough sketch you should carefully review and examine it and see if it be do accord to ait and if the action of the figure or figure in it be answerable to the original now as action be the life of picture they must shew themselves in the first draught however rude it be or you can never expect it will be happily finish you must then correct you sketch and improve it in neatness and air by add and diminish as you see proper as you may easily do with you charcoal but in do this be mindful that you don spoil the first good action in it which may easily be do if you don well observe ihe movement of several part you must be careful to admit nothing into you work that be improper or foreign to the subject of it and to let nothing trifling have the chief place in it if you can always make chooce of north light for you situation be cause it be less variable than any other should yon light at south window yon will find it proper to place sash of oil s paper before ir which will break the intenseness of the sun ray and diffuse they more equally with out any sensible variation in draw after the life you be to confider the bigness or size of the object you have vo represent and remove from it to the dislance of three time its magnitude and be seat in fuch manner as that you eye may be on level wich it and at every stroke you draw be curious to observe what part of you object lie under the perpendicular or principal line the next thing you have to do be to put you figure whether it be the life or model in proper position the best light be that which be high and equally diffuse not too strong nor glaring when object be so dispose you see all they beauty and the minutest part shew themselves to advan tage but this you be to observe that in draw from the life that you light should come from such a altitude as that the shadow of body pro ject on the plane be equal and in proportion to they height so that ihe light do not strike upon or enlighten all the part some of which be shel tered by the protuberance of other the eyebrow overshade the hollow of the eye the nose hide some part of the mouth and the throat be ob cur bythe chin for this reason portrait painter blind all the window of the room they work in except one yhe lower part whereof they clode up and let yhe light in from yhe upper only which strike upon the object they be printng after while themselves be beneach the light particular direction for the young painter the instruction we have hitherto give the young beginner have be pretty much in the general we shall now introduce he into every part of he work by such particular direction as by strictly observe they will make he compleat draughtsman for draw the face when you have draw the circle of the face which you must do at first with plain circular line without make any bend or in denture in or out make stroke from that place of the forchead which be even with the chin down the place where you intend to fix the middle of the nose and the middle of the mouth this stroke you must observe must be strike that way which the face should turn either to one side or strait down which stroke will be great help to you in place the feature rightly so that they may not stand all awry but directly one under another now if the face turn downward the stroke must be strike in such manner that the eye may turn answerable with the face downwards when you have do that make another stroke for the length of the nose where the end of it should come and another stroke for the mouth that it be not make crook still observe to make all che stroke to turn one way up or down accord as the face turn that be if the face turn up or down the eye nose and mouth must turn wich it when you have make these stroke exactly proveed to place the feature accord to the precede rule in the face be usually observe this threefold propertion from the top of the forehead to the eyebrow from che eyebrow to the bottom of the nose from thence to the bottom of the chin this proportion however be not constantly the same for in some person the forehead be lower than in other the nose of some longer and of some shorter than other and therefore this rule can only be observin well proportion face the distance between the two eye be just the length of one eye if in full face but if it turn any thing aside then that distance be lessen accordingly the nostril ought not to come out farther than the corner of the eye in any face and the mouth must be always place between the eye and the chin just under che nofe as the greatest difficulty and principal part of ihe art lie in the lively draw of the facc fhall add thefe farther direction to perfect you in this particular branch of you art fin if you would draw face exactly of as to reiemble the original you draw it from you must in the first place take notice of the physiogno my or circumference of the face whether it be long or round fat or lean big or little that so you may be sure to draw the physiognomy or bigneiss of the face right if it be fat face you will perceive the cheek to make the side of the face swell out and so make the face look as it be square if it be lean face the jawbone will stick out and che cheek fall in and the face will look long and slender if it be neither too fat nor too lean the face will for the most part be round when you draw the utmost circumference of face you must take in the head and all wich it otherwise you may be deceive in draw the true big ness of the face secondly you must carefully and judiciously observe and discern all the master touch which give life to face or discover the grace or dispo sition of the mind in which lie the whole grace of the work and the credit of the workman thus smile countenance be easily discern in the mouth when the corner of it be little turn up frow coun tenance in the forehead eyebrow bend and the top of the nose be tween the eye somewhat wrinkle sober and stay countenance be best do cern in the eye when the upper eyelid come somewhat over the ball of the eye laugh countenance be easily discerned all over the face and so be a angry wrathful countenance by extraordinary frowning there be also some touch about the eye and mouth which give life and spirit to face which you will by degree find out by frequently observe and imi tate the work of the best master further rule for the young practitioner in draw you charcoal be neatly sharpen you must in the draw of face first lightly draw the outstroke or circumference of the face exactly accord to the bigness of the pattern make it to stand foreright or to turn upwards or downwards accord to you pattern then make some little touch where che feature namely the eye nose mouth chin should be place not draw they exactly at the first when you have thus lightly point out the feature then begin to draw they more exactly and so proceedtill che face be finish which be do then add the beard and other thing about it in draw side face you need not at first draw the nose mouth and chin that stand in ihe outmost line but only make it first but bare circumference turn this way or that way accor ding to the pattern and then make the mouth nose and chin in they place and just proportion you must be sure to place the muscle in the right and proper place by the muscle mean all the shadow that be cause by some dent or swelling in the face and be able to find out the reason of every muscle that so you may proceed to work with the more judgment the muscle will be mof visible in a old wither face and you must first draw the most prin cipal of they and then you may draw the more ealily the lesser within be sure to be very exact in the plar of they or you will spoil you draught be it ever so good observe to make the shadow rightly and be careful not to make they too dark where they should be faint or if you do you can never recover it to make it light again and so the whole face will be marrand appear un handsome the shadow be generally sainter and lighter in fair face than in swarthy complexion when you draught be finish you will do well to give fome hard touch with you pen where the shadow be darkest which will add great life and grace to you draw when you face be finish you come next to the ear and hair wherein you must observe this rule have draw the outline of it you must first draw the principal curl or master stroke in the hair which will guide you wich ease to do the lesser curl which depend on they always make you curl to bend and turn exactly accord to the pattern that they may lie loose and fast and not appear stiff stubborn and unpliable when you have draw you curl exactly you must in the last place strike in the loose hair which hang carelessly out of the curl the face be draw which be the principal thing in the art then proceed to the hand and arm leg and feer and so to full body of man and woman which be the most difficult thing which if you can attain to perform with well grounded celerity nothing will be difficult to you but most easy as flower bird beast ship or any other thing that be to be draw by hand of draw the hand and foot we come now to speak particularly of the ihand and foot which you oughe to spend some time about before you come to whole body because they will be too dilficult for you to enter upon till you have pretty well practise you hand in the draw of other thing more especially hand and foot which be the most difficult member of the body to draw except the face by learn of which you will attain the rest wich less diffi culty and greater perfection and undoubtedly it be thing highly comm dable to draw hand lively and exactly which hath such variety of pos ture and action and you will find it no easy matter to imitate it in every one of they wich spirit and life or without some lameness or imper fection the action and posture of the hand be so various that no certain rule can be give for draw of they only this in general when you first draw it with charcoal you be not to do it exactly that be you must not make all the joint or vein or other thing to appear more than lightly or saintly and to touch out the bigness of the hand and the manner of turn ing it with saint touch and not wich hard stroke if you have do that right then you part the finger afunder or clofe accord to you pattern wich the like saint stroke then mark that place where any of the finger stand out from the other and make faint resemblance of it have so donc if you perceive you draught to be right procecd to draw it more perfectly and make the bend of the joint the wristbone and other principal thing somewhat exactly and lastly go over it again and draw every small bend or swell of the finger and make the nail knuckle and vein so many of they as appear and every thing else that you can discern the proportion of hand you have sufficiently describe in the print whlich shew how many equality or equal measure there be in it which you should endeavour to be acquainted wich that so you may know when hand be well proportion wich just and equal distance but you be to observe this rule or exception that accord as the hand turn one way or other the proportion must be shortne accord as they appear to the eye as you may see by the foreshortning of the hand in the print so much as the hand turn away from we sight lo much it lose of its ordi nary proportion and be make so shorten unto that proportion that the eye judge of it nay sometimes whole finger sometimes two or three or more be lose to we sight by the turn of the hand another way from we and so they must be wholly leave out and not make as to the foot it be not so difficult to draw they as it be the hand and you must procce in the same method in the one as in the other when you can draw hand and foot pretty well then procce to arm and leg wherein be little dillicul ty after which you may procecd to whole body rule to be obserse in draw tbe whole body in the draw of body you must begin with the head to whith you must give just proportion and bigness because all the body must be pro portion accord to the head when you have draw the head proceed to the shoulder and go on to che trunk of the body begin at the armpit leave the arm till afterwards and so draw down to the hip on both side and be sure you observe the exact breadth of the waist when you have do thus draw first that leg on which the body stand and afterwards that which stand loose or from the body and last of all the arm and then the hand either join tothe body or separate from it agreable to you pattern observe in you draw to place the parallel joint sinew and muscle directly opposite in strait even line one against the other as the shoulder armpit waist hip knee and so every thing else that one may nor be higher or lower than the other that the body may not seem crook or deform but every parallel joint bend may directly answer the other that be opposite to it to which end you may strike strait stroke directly cross the shoulder to direct you to place they even and strait onc against the other which you may likewise do in other place as the arm waist hip thigh or any orher part that be opposite where you should place the one even with the other but you must have the fame care in all part of the body as you have in one place where any bending or member of the body have or do require direct opposition one to the other you make use of this help and direction observe that if the body turn one way or other then this stroke must be so strike that it may answer the bow of the body thus if the body sloop little downwards you must strike the stroke sloping or side way in which case you must make the shoulder and other thing which should be strait against one another to be somewhat higher than one another of that the side which the body turn upon the shoulder and other thing that otherwise should be place even against the other must be make some what lower than the other side more or less accord to the stoop of the body as you be to be careful in the place rightly all level or parallel joint bending sinew and muscle so you must be very exact in all perpendicular joint muscle that be when you have draw the outiine of you piece and be come to draw che joint and muscle that be wichin the body you must be as exact in place they that be directly one against another as you be in place those even that be opposite to one another to the end that you may place thing exactly perpendicular that be in strait line one under another you may strike strait perpendicular line from the pit of the throat down to the privity just in the middle or seam of the body where you discern the parting of the rib and from thence strait down to the foot which line will direct you to place thing perpendicularly even that the body may isand strait upright and not appear crook or awry take notice of the bowings and bending that be in the body to make that part which be opposite to that which bend to answer to it in bend ing with it thus if one side of the body be bend in the other side must sland out answerable to the bend in of the other since if the back bend out the belly must bend in if the belly come in the back must stick out if the breech stick out the thigh that answer to it in opposition must come in so also in any other part of the body as when the knee bend out the hams that answer to it must come in and the same rule must strictly be ob serve in all other joint of the body otherwise the body will be make grosly and absurdly and without any proportion be careful to make all thing of a equal proportion and bigness that one arm or leg be not bigger than the other or one breast larger than the other or any part of the body in a unjust proportion but as every thing in face must answer to the bigness of the face so one member must answer to another in bigness that so there may be perfect harmony in all the part of the body that it may not have broad shoulder and thin slender waist rawbone arm and thick gouty leg or any part dilproportionable from the other unless it be so that any part of the body doth turn awry from we eye thus if one arm should be other sideway and the other foreright then the one arm must be make of much less than the other by how much it turn away from we sight and appear less to we eye and if one leg be see full or foreright and the other leg be see sideway then it must be make so much lef than the other by how much it turn away from vour sight as just proportion must be observin the bigness of you draught of likewise in the length that one thing may not be too long for the other the body not too long for the leg nor the leg too short for the body that neither leg nor arm be disproportion in they length but that every thing have it be due proportion both for length and bigness unless when the body shorten away in any part from you sight as thus if one leg sland behind the other it must be make so much shorter than the other accord to the distance it be remove from you eye so likewise if one arm remove itself ever so little out of you sight that which come first to the eye and stand nearest to the sight must be make longer than the other and the other be make so much the shorter by how much it turn away from you sight so again if any part of the body be foreshortne that be if it appear of to you eye as to hinder the full light of the latitude of that part of the body then the body or thar part of the body muft be make to shorten accord to that proportion that the eye judge of it observe the due distance of one thing frem another that you may be exact in you draught and perfectly imitate you pattern observe how much one part of the body stick out beyond the other or fall in within the other or whether it stand even with the other to which end you may strike small stroke down from the top of the shoul der along by the outside of the body strait down to the foot and this will direct you how far one part of the body should stand out beyond the other and how far other part should come in let nothing be do without rule and judgment let nothing be do hard sharp or cutty that be let not the bend ing that be in the body or in the joint be make as if they be dent or cut in the flesh wich sharp corner stroke but finaly round and floping like bending and not like cut in the body this be common fault among learner who should therefore be the more careful to avoid it by imitate they pattern exactly in the manner of make every stroke and touch that be give for nothing should be do without judgment of perspective proportion perspective proportion differ luch from that we have be hitherto describe and may be define the judgment of the eye of the proportion of thing by its distance from it as thus if one part of the body come nearer to the eye than the other it be make so muche bigger than the other part of the body which turn away from the eye thus it one leg stand behind another the foremost leg that stand first in sight must be make somewhat bigger and longer than the other because the eye so judge of it it be the same with regard to any other part of the body the proportion must be lessen accord to the distance of the object from the eye the next thing to be observ in good draught be graceful posture and proper action that be that the true natural motion of every thing be ex press in the life and spirit of it that be the life mult be quicken by art as to express the majesty of king you must put he in such grace ful posture as may move the spectator with reverence to behold he so to make soldier you must draw he in such posture as may betoken courage boldness and intrepidity so to make clown he must be see in the most detectable and clownish posture so in every other instance the inward affection and disposition of the mind must be express in the most lively manner in the outward action and gesture of the body now to at tain competent skill herein my advice be diligently to observe the work of we great master of those especially who delight in describe fight at handi cuff to observe the eye of private assassin the courage of wrest ler the action of stageplayer the entice allurement of courtesans such as be lead to execution to mark the contracting of they brow the motion of they eye and the carriage of they whole body to the end you may express they to the life in you drawing and work another thing to be observe in good draught be looseness or air that be that the body be not make stff in any part but that every joint may have its proper and natural bend so as it may with the greatest life express you intention that the picture may not seem lame or the joint stiff as if they be not pliable or capable of bend but every joint or limb must have its proper and natural posture accord as it may best suit with and be come the posture in which the figure be set another thing to be note in draw be what the painter call foreshort ening which be to take thing as they appear to the eye and not to draw the full length and proportion of every part but to make be shorter by reason the full length and bigness be hide from we sight so if would draw ship stand foreright there can appear only she forepartn the rest be hide from we side and therefore can not be express again if would draw horse standing foreright look full in my face must necessarily fore shorten he behind because he side and flank be hide from my eye observe therefore this rule that you ought rather to imitate the visible proportion of thing than the proper and natural proportion of they for the eye and the understanding together be direct in the perspective art ought to be the guide measure and judge of draw and painting the last thing to be regard in good draw be that every thing be do by the guidance of nature that be that nothing be express but what accord and agree with nature in every point as thus when would make man turn he head over he shoulder must not make he turn more than nature will permit nor must any thing be force beyond the limit of nature or be make to come short of it but though nature must not be stretchbeyond it be centre yet it must be quicken to the highest pitch of it thus if would express king must express he in the most majestick posture can invent and if would draw clown must represent he in the most clownish action can imagine yet must neither the one nor the other be draw in such posture as will not agree wich the motion of nature that be in such posture which man can not imitate wich he natural body so in all other thing nature must be the pattern of all kind of draught rule for draw landskip landskip be the express tract of land by hill wood castle seas valley ruin rock in which there be not so much difficulty as in draw figure and therefore the follow rule will be sufficient the best way of make landskip be to represent they shoot away one part lower than another as hath be practise by cur best be tist but other have run into contrary error by make the landskip mount up higher and higher till it reach to such height that it seem as if it touch the cloud as if the drawer have stand at the bottom of steeple when he take the prospect which be altogether incongruous for we can do cern no prospect at che bottom of hill but the most proper way of mak ing landskip be to make thie nearest hill higheqt and so to make the rest that be at greater distance to shoot away under that that the landskip may appear as if take from the top of hill be careful to lessen every thing in proportion to its distance express ing it bigger or less accord to the dislance it be from the eye you must make all you light fall one way both upon the ground and tree and all thing else and all the shadow must be cast one way must give every thing its proper motion as tree when they be shake with the wind they smaller and more pliable bough must be shew in such a action as if they strike one against another by yield and de cline from that part whence the wind blow the stiffer bough have less bend and motion you must likewise observe the bend of twig when bird fit upon it so likewise if it be force or press wich any other thing cloud in the air must be shew wich motion now gather together with the wind now violently condeny into hail thunderbolt lightning rain and such like finally you can make nothing but what require motion peculiar to itfelf accord to which it ought to be represent but this rule you must always observe namely thar all you motion which be cause by the wind must be feen to move one way because the wind can blow but one way at once always express fair horizon shew the heaven cloudy or clear more or less accord to the occasion and if you express the sun let it be either rise or set and as it be behind or over fome hill or mountain the moon and star be seldom or never depict unless it be in repre sentation of twilight because all thing be suppose to be see by day if you express the sun make he light to reflect upon all ihe tree hill mountain rock or building shad the contrary side after which manner allo shadow cloud mist and the like make the shadow to fall all one way in express thing at large distance as ten twenty or thirty mile off where the object be hard to be discerned as whether it be temple castle house or the like shew no particular sign thereof or any eminent distinction but rather as weakly faintly and confusedly as the eye judg eth of it if landskip be lay in colour the farther you go the more you must lighten it with thin and airy blue to make it seem as if it be afar off be gin first with dark green so drive it by degree into blue accord ing tothe distance in river observe the general current and dashing of the wave against the boat side in the sea observe the wave and other proper agitation the rowl of the billow che tumble of vessel up and down ship float some dipt some half drow fome standing almost a end some hide almost wich the wave thro the uncertainty of ihe surge other strive to live in the motion of water fall from a high place but especially when they fall upon rock or stone you must make it leap up in the air and sprinkling all about let you work imitate the season you intend it for thus if you intend it for winter piece represent sell of timber fled upon the lce fowl ing by night hunt of bear or fox in the snow make the tree every where naked or lade with hoar frost the earth bare without greenness flower or cattle the air thick water freeze with cart pass ing over ir and boy upon it lastly let every site have its proper work adjunct or additional grace as the farmhouse windmill wood flock of sheep herd of cattle pilgrim ruin of temple castle monument wich thousand such other thing only proper to particular subject to take tbe perfect draught of any picture take sheet of fine venice paper wet it all over wich linseed oil on one side thereof which then wipe off as clean as you can let the paper dry and lay it to any painy or print picture then wich black lead pencil you may draw it over with ease put this oil paper upon sheer of clean white paper and wich little point stick or feather out of swallowwing draw over the stroke which you draw upon the oil paper so shall you have the exact form upon the white paper which may be set out wich colour wich pleasure or thus the picture be draw as before in the oil paper put it upon sheet of white paper and prick over che draw with pen then take some smallcoal powder it fine and wrap it in piece of fine linnen and bind it up therein loosely and clap it over the prick line by little and little and then draw it over again once or twice wich pen or pencil or thus rub sheet of white paper all over on one side wich black lead or else wich vermilion mix wich fresh butter lay the coloured side upon sheet of white paper then lay che picture you would copy out upon the other side of the coloured paper or with small point stick or swal low qulll go over all che stroke of you picture and it will be exact on the white paper or thus take a oil sheet as before rub one side of it with lamb black or lake lay it upon sheet of fair paper with the coloured side downward and upon it lay the picture you would copy out and trace it over with you swallow s frather or thur take fine lake mix wich linfee oil and draw with it over all the outstroke and other material part of picture then wer the con trary side of the picture and press it hard upon sheet of paper and it will leave behind it all that which you draw over to take the shape of leaf herb or plant hold whole leaf or sprig as of nettle plantane in the smoak of gum sandrack rosin link or wax candletill it be well black which place between the leave of sheet of white paper and carefully press upon the leaf wich fome smooth thing so shall you have in moment the print on the paper especially the backside thereof with the very ramification of the fibre disperse thro it this may be of good use in travelling wiien we meet wich strange plant to take the picture of a herb from a old picture take venice soap dip it in water and rub or moisten the old pic ture all over very well with it then put upon it piece of white paper wich other paper over it and rub hard thereupon or press they strongly to gether and the old picture will come off exactly upon the white paper of colour for landskip for ligte green use pink and masticot heighten with white for sad green indico and pink heighten wich masticot for some tree take lake umber and white for other charcoal and white for other black and white with some green add some lake or vermilion with other colour for wood take lake umber and white mixing sometimes little green withal for fire lay red lead and vermilion temper together where it be reddest where it be blue lay oil smalt and white lead wherc it be yel low take masticot and work it over in certain place where you would have it shine most with vermilion for a azure sky which seem afar off take oil smalt or bice and temper they with linseed oil but grind they not for smalt or bice utterly lose they colour in grind for red sky take lake and white and for sunbeam or yellow cloud at sunrising or setting take maiticot and white for night sky or cloud in storm take indico deepen with black and heighten wich white for wood colour they be compound either of umber and white charcoal and white seacoal and white umber black and white or with some green add to which you may adjoin sometimes as in the bark of tree little lake or vermilion how to cleanse any old painting take wood ash and scarce they or else fome smalt or powder blue and wich spunge and fair water gencty wash the picture you would cleanse take great care of the shadow which do dry it very well wich clean cloth then varnish it over again wich good varnish but such as may be wash off again wich water if need be or take either common varnish make wich gum sandrick dissolve in linfee oil by boiling or glair of egg and wich you pencil go over the picture once twice or more therewith as need require of fresco or painting of wall in painting upon wall to make it endure the weather you must grind you colour wich limewater milk or whey mixt in size colour in pot the paste or plaister must be make of wellwashlime mixt wich fine powder of old rubbilh stone the lime must be so ofren walh till all it be salt be castrate and all you work must be dond in clear and dry wea the to make the work endure strike into the wall stump of head nail about five or six inch asunder and by this means you may preserve the plaister from peel then wich this paste plaister the wall pretty thickness let it dry be dry plaister it over again about the thickness of half barleycorn very fine and smooth then you colour be ready prepare work this last plaistering over while it be wet so will you painting unite and join fast to the plaister and dry together as perfect compost in painting be nimble and free let you work be bold and strong but be sure to be exact for there can be no alteration of the first painting and therefore heighten you paint enough at first yon may deepen it at plea fure all earthy colour be best as the oker spanishwhite spanslhbrown terraevert and the like mineral colour be natch lastly let you pencil and brush be long and soft ocherwise you work will not be smooth let you colour be full and flow freely from the pen cil or brush and let you design be perfect at first for in this there be no after alteration to be make of wash and other material thereof by wash here we intend nothing more but either to fet out map or print picture in proper colour or else to varnish they the instrument and

put it into jar glass and hang therein sufficient quantity of pure white and clean gum arabick bruise and tie up in rag let it hang till the gum be dissolve then put you finger into the water and if you find they stick together as if they be glew you warer be too stiff or full of the gum which you must remedy by put there to more fair water and if you find it too weak you may help it by add more gum wich this water or the former size most colour be to be temper and with so much of ihe gumwater as be touch when dry the colour will not come off where note that if the colour glisten there be too much gum in it liquid gold and silver take five or six leave of gold and silver which grind with stiff gumlake water and good quantity of salt as small as yon can then put it into vial or glaze vessel add so much fair water as may dissolve the gum water then let it stand four hour that the gold may settle decant the water and put in more till the gold be clean wash to the gold put more fair water little salarmoniac and common salt digesting it close for four day then put all into piece of thin glover leather whose grain be peel off and hang it up so will the sal armoniac fret away and the gold remain behind which keep or thus grind fine leaf gold wich strong or thick gumwater very fine and as you grind add more thick gumwater be very fine wash it in great shell as you do bice then temper it wich little quantity of mercury sublimate and little dissolve gum to bind it in the shell shake it and spread the gold about the side thereof that it may be all of one colour and fineness which use with fair water as you do other colour the same ob serve in liquid silver wich this observation that if you silver by length of time or humidity of the air become rust then cover the place with juice
