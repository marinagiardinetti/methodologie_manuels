universally admit to the most honor able station as elegant and useful attainment they have consti tute principal part of accomplish education in every polite country never be they so universally esteem never be the applause of the british public so liberally bestow as of late but perhaps the most strike proof of approbation be the assiduity with which they be cultivate by almost every lady

with the expence attend this branch of polite education deprive many young person of both sex of that opportunity of im provement which they talent deserve such a opportunity be pre sent to they at very moderate purchase by this publication its copious direction be calculate to supersede the necessity of any other instructor while as a introduction to the art of design in general it furnish truly elegant and rational amusement by present a almost infinite variety of subject conduct with strict regard to delicacy and virtue the " human face divineas milton express it will be treat wich

constantly adopt flower among the ornament of dress but by displaying the superior elegance of we native production may banish those exotic device which have too much prevail nor be these the limit of

bestow in its execution to render it honorable to the art and worthy the patronage of the public the academy of art be be true that genius and inclination will surmount great dissi culty those which be insuperable to some other may surpass by severe labor yet be be grateful task to remove impediment from the pach to knowledge and the greater the genius the more will the obligation be feel and acknowledge for instruction especially if clear and easy to follow be most prize by those who be most capable of prosit by it the art of design embrace great variety of subject and need a equal variety of precept it be too diflicult for the young adventurer to attend to many at once we purpose therefore to treat they separately the art of draw as the foundation of all other art claim we first attention not only umiversally admire as elegant and ornamental but itacknowledge utility enhance itvalue this art lend assistance to many profession not confine to painter engraver embroiderer whose employment evi dently depend upon it it be daily practise by the mathematician engineer and navigator to be able to design on the spot strike prospect noble building curious production of art or a uncommon appearance of nature be not only desirable amusement but useful be complishment to preserve to remote posterity the resemblance of illustrious personages—to transmit object of attention to foreign climes—is no inconsiderable attainment we be pleased with the genius and ability of distant artist in return we own perf formance command they applause hereby ihe production of nature or art in all part of the globe become familiar to we we contemplate without danger the inhabitant of the pole the groen lander in he hut the siberian in he cave mountain of ice monster of the deep the bite of the rattlesnake the sting of the scorpion strike we with no dread nor be we expose to in conveniency though examine the manners of the chinese or the hottentot no wonder a art so univerfally uleful fhould be ad¬ mired and distinguished as one of the highest embellishment of human life draw be the art of represent the appearance of object it express by line and shade the resemblance of any thing whatever and even produce to the view of other the conception of the mind the material use in draw be black lead pencils— chalk black white and red— squar parallel ruler compaffes—pens—camel hair pencil —indian ink and indian rubber various sort of paper be use to work upon for indian ink white and fine for chalk more rough and coarsefor black and white chalk blue or brown accord to the fancy of the designer the young designer should by all means draw he study large there by avoid that confusion of line almost inseparable from smaller subject for have once attain strong and distinct idea of he object he will find much less difficulty in reduce than in enlarge it this premise it be adviseable to commence the study of this noble art by draw first in chalk be beiter calculate than indian ink not only for the size of the design but as they contribute greatly to bold and free handling which be very desir able acquisition ease and facility not only expedite business but give certain masterlike appearance which elaborate neatness can not equal to begin draw in chalk first form sketch from the original with piece of charcoal of convenient thickness and length this be the best material to sketch with as it admit of be ing frequently rub out consequently the outline of the subject may be render very correct before it be finish in chalk be custom yourself to hold you port crayon or pencil further from the point than in writing that it may not impede the free motion of you hand it be not amiss to caution the young designer against cut he chalk to too sharp point which do more harm by prevent proper boldness than it do good in respect of neatness neat¬ ness should be the result of judgment as well as of care and la bour or it will infallibly be stiff and awkward the use of the black lead pencil be to form a accurate outline of any design intend to be finish in indian ink the india rubber erase black lead line very neatly the square ruler and compass be necessary in draw perspective architecture but should never be apply to figure the designer should accustom himself to see correctly without such injurion assistance as great master express himselfthe compass should be in the eye not in the handbefore you begin you performance confider you original wich close attention divide it in you mind into several part observe the length the breadth and similitude of each part remark they proportion to each other and to the whole they respective distance and situation more especially attend to those object or part which fall immediately under other and those which be parallel to other if this rule be duly practise it will prevent any material error as the excellence of draw consist in its accu racy endeavour to make vour sketch as corrcct as possible never proceed to shadow or finish any part of draw till the line of the skeich have attain close resemblance to the original al way remember to begin at the left part of you paper that what you be about may be continually visible the right side of you draw be liable to be cover by you right hand and even by you arm if the paper be large some person be apt to lean they stomach and arm upon they draw or table which be very unhealthy custom and even injurion to the performance it be well worth while to remember this since the whole be habit and good posture may as readily be obtain as bad one the more upright you sit the better the distance of the original from you eye demand another caution if too near it not only prevent proper view of the whole subject you copy but be not free from danger of render the eye short fight supposing the young designer with à good original now be fore he and proper material in hand it remain before we procce to the next part of we subject to remind he that reso lution be the very life of he undertake difficulty will occur he must surmount they other may present themselves they like wise must be overcome have subdue the first he be more able to combat the second the same have present themselves to the greatest master the art will reward the resolute as fuch let he expect success of the human figure the human figure consider not only as the most ex pressive and beautiful but also the most interesting object claim we first attention it be customary to divide the figure into three part the head the body and the member which move upon the body drhunter indeed consider the head as member move upon the body but this division be peculiar to himfelf to convey more readily just ldea of the excellence proper to each part we shall treat of it under the article proportion character and expression corresponding to the degree of comparison in grammar in reference to which we may call wellproportion head body good one not only well pro portion but exhibit certain natural likeness or character may be denominate better and if to wellproportion character be be superadd happy and forcible expression it be the summit of excellence in the art and the artist the general proportion of the figure we propose somewhat to explain before we proceed to the separate part as thereby may be attain more distinct idea of the method use in measure those part as well as ihe figure the most regular manner of measur ing a object be to take for standard part whose proportion be usually most obvious and permanent therefore the figure be con sider as contain in height or breadth of many measure of the head as the head contain so many measure of the nose the best antique statue have seven head seven and half to seven and three quarter in height the most eminent artist conform in they work to this standard the figure engrave be mark by scale of head sufficiently explain themselves to which may here be add that the arm of man when ex tend be in length equal to he height from one side of the breast to the other be one head and half from the shoulder to the elbow one and half from the elbow to the end of the little finger one and half the hand exactly span the face the thumb contain one nose the sole of the foot be onc sixth part of the height of the figure dismiss for the present the proportion of the figure we pro cced to consider the part into which we have divide it of the head which in the language of artist often include besides the face so much of the neck as be neccessary to give proper air and expression but be here confider as comprehending only from the chin upwards nature have make the countenance not only the seat of great beauty but of universal expression nor be there any passion of the mlind or sensation of the body which do not discover itself in the movement of the feature as the head be the chief seat of character which differ in different subject and imply vari ation of proportion it be less bound by fix rule than any other though ever so wanton and playful attention should be pay to the natural disposition of the sex doll which as toy well enough become girl be improper for boy as manly ex ercise horse or arm which be the delight of boy be not pleasing in the softer sex the character of the head of adult person open very extensive field for investigation wherein we should consider not only the now very visible distinction of sex but also the ef fect of natural inclination of acquire habit and of various rank in life the difference between the native of one country and another and the influence of those numerous disorder to which the human frame be subject all which arc clearly discernible to those whose attention have be employ upon the subject the follow remark be take from the ingenious author quote above whose expedient to mark the character in he per formance be singularly happy we have daily many instance which confirm the common receive opinion that the face be the index of the mind and this maxim be so root in we we can scarce help if we attention be little raise form fome particular conception of the lper son mind whose face we be observe even before we receive information by any other means how often be it say on the slightest view that such one look like goodnature man that he hath a honest open countenance or look like cun ning rogue man of sense or fool and how be we eye rivet to the aspect of king and heroes murderer and saint and as we contemplate they deed seldom fail mak ing application to they look it be reasonable to believe that aspect to be true and legible representation of the mind which give every spectator the same idea at first sight and be after ward confirm in fact for inftance all concur in the same opinion at first sight of downright idiot there be but little more to be see by child s face than that they be lively or heavy and scarcely that unless they be in motion very handsome face of almost any age will hide foolish or wick mind till they betray themselves by they action or they word yet the frequent awkward movement of the muscle of the pool s face though ever so handsome be apt in time to leave such trace up and down it as will distin guish defect of mind upon examination bur the bad man he be a hypocrite may so manage he muscle by teach they to contradict he heart that little of he mind can be ga thered from he countenance so that the character of a hypo crite be entirely out of the power of the pencil withom some ad join circumstance to discover he as smile and stab at the fame time or the like it be by the natural and unaffected movement of the muscle cause by the passion of the mind that every man s character would in some measure be write in he face by that time he arrive at forty year of age be it not for certain accident which often though not always prevent it for the illnature man by frequently frow and pout out the muscle of he mouth doth in time bring those part to constant state of the appearance of illnature which might have be prevent by the constant affectation of smile and so of the other passion though there be some which do not affect muscle at all simply of themselves as love and hope but leave shou be think to lay too great stress on outward show it be be knowled there be so many different cause which produce the same kind of movement and appearance of the feature and so many thwarting by accidental shape in the make of face that the old adage fronti nulla fide will ever stand itground upon the whole and for very wise reason nature hath think fit it should but on the other hand in many particular case we receive great information from the expre sion of the countenance after which remark this attentive observer proceed to recom mend the expression in le brun s passion of the mind com plete edition of which excellent performance will be give in this work it be certain that we expect from king and nobleman verv dif ferent demeanour and address from that of rustic and clown and to see in they a air of dignity and grandeur which we sup pose distinguishes they from the crowd it be true hero or king in not always tall or comely nor can the mind be universally trace in the lineament of the commntenance yet as design can not represent the mind but through the medium of the body commendable liberty to exhibit such feature as most immediately characterize to the spectator the subject intend suppose king be represent at the head of he troops we naturally look for more martial air and greater gallanter in the king than in the soldier who though valiant must yet shew valour less elevate in character than that of they leader or if the sub ject be magistrate condemn thief the character of both must be so discriminate as to prevent inquiry which be thie judge and which che culpri if che detign be a exchange amidst all the confusion occasion by the crowding multitude the artist must carefully attend to che character proper to the native of each country who may be transact business group of counte¬ nance resemble american indian would ill fuit ihe turkish walk nor would the saturnine feature of a hollander agree with the dress and exped levity of frenchman sailor must be distinguished from the merchant converse with he as the merchant himself must be from other around he little reflection upon these hint be sufficient to demonstrate the import ance of this principle and the necessity of treat it with care and attention as the intent of this work be to assist the young designer in the study of nature whose appearance be the object of we pre send attention it would be beside we purpose to enter into mys tery of physiognomy science " puzzle in maze and per plex wich errorthough many great name have think it the foundation of this part of the art and a eminent virtuoso of germany have lately support it in all it s extreme yet perhaps it may not be totally useless to remark that the animal part of

animal void of reason whose form approach in appearance very near to that of man and the feature of some man resemble part of certain animal yet there be strong and permanent mark of distinction the eye of man be place on line with the auditory nerve those of brute animal be on the contrary much lower and nearer to the nose accord to they natural disposition ii man be able to clevate the ball of the eye which animal can not do without lift up the nose they eyeball may turn of far downwards as to fliew portion of white above ihe iris but be utterly incapable of turn upwards iii the eyebrow of animal never meet and always decline at they extremity while those of the human countenance ap proach each other in the middle of the forehead and elevate they termination on the side of the nose to return from this digression dur subject lead we to consider that we have represent character as variation of proportion which by add to one part seem to diminish the rest those part of the face which chiefly contribute to expression be those wherein character be most clearly discerned in expression they appear more powerful and active as the occasion be recent and obvious but the cause of character be remote and latent ittoken though abide be not equally strong as the part of the face will be examine under the article expression few word upon each of they shall suffice here forehead upon which the hair grow very low especially if accompany with wrinkle be usually sign of gloomy dispo sition very thick eyebrow seem to indicate jealousy and dislike the eye very much contribute to character when large and fierce they express courage and fury when soft and moderate goodnature but if too small they mark disingenuity and cun ning the nose be the seat of anger and large nostril may be think to signify it the nose when turn up betoken sensu ality and when ruddy be well know as ihe sign of drunkard the mouth discover whether person be churlish or benevolent if the former the under

especial notice of those part which distinguish one man from another and which most contribute to that infinite and amazing variety observable in the species every feature however minute afford something particu lar for observation which be regard with proper attention will contribute greatly to render the idea of the student just and permanent it be impossible to say determinately such and such feature compose the character of person therefore he be morose glutton because the inclination of the human mind be not to one passion exclusively though one may predominate but com pound of many desire and contain variety of disposition often opposite and contradictory of the sign of those disposition oppose and contradict each other there be no man whose feature exhibit anger or hatred affection or tranquillity alone because he be not constantly angry though often not always tran quil and easy however calm he may be in general but he sen sation be various he aspect present the mark of that variety hence arise that almost infinite diversity of character which we remark in the human countenance hence the likeness or unlike ness in person of the same family whose turn of mind be similar or different the family resemblance be varied into the fea ture corresponding therewith natural inclination though active and powerful be not infre quently so control and check by acquire

can not erase the line of coun tenance yet should incline a artist to soften they nor represent to posterity as irascible or as glutton he whose deportment be sedate and temperate acquire habit though it can not erase the line of countenance frequently add other to they severe and long continue study be apt to occasion solemnity of aspect chiefly see in the brow which should be carefully distin

instance universally admit nor be lie reckone the most sharp fight person who do not discover taylor at first sight exception must be allow but the principle be just this idea might be pursue in very extend variety of remark but as attention to nature will confirm the student in it s propriety we shall not enlarge upon it here habit arif from cause not pro fessional have many way of shew itself and contribute not little to character person who have constantly affect superior judgment no matter in what art acquire certain positive and dogmatical air both in he countenance and manner habit make some hold down they head other hold they up some stare from habit other squint nature be the only guide upon this sub ject the variety be too copious to be regulate by precept hitherto we have only consider rule of general application it may assist to enlarge the ldea of the student if we notice some subject more particularly vain be the attempt be it ever of lawful to reprefent driry who dwelleth in light inaccessible invisible to man perhaps to to angel the church of rome in permit such picture doc equal dishonour to the subject and injury to art which if properly employ may expect to be rewarded with applause but upon design infinitely beyond itpower it s utmost ex ertion be frivolous and vain but in the person of jesus christ the restraint be take off and the human nature of christ be equally with other subject for the pencil not that there be the least reason to suppose he por trait be ever take or that stluke be the author of those at tribute to he which be universally paint in so wretch style as to make we hope be they he he succeed better in he evangelical calling than in that of painter the plate exhibit head of christ from various master and history indeed the same master when treat different fact could not but insert head of different air as the subject treat might require yet in he character which the greatest painter have choose to represent christ there appear resem blance of feature because the part which compose he moral character be permanent he pictursique charaster so to term it of necessity contain such trait as correspond wich it meck ness

majesty the apostle should be draw in style suitable to they apo tolic office and not to they previous prosession peter as a apostle should have more dignity united to he warmth than be due to he as fisherman as the station of peter and john be very conspicuous in the history of the gospel they be naturally introduce into most composition represent event of that history and artist have generally agree in the character proper to each but to retain as some have do the youthful appearance of jonn when the story related happen in he old age be absurd no excuse can justify of flagrant violation of propriety moment s reflection be sufficient to demonstrate the nece sity of give to judas iscariot very distinct feature from any of the other apostle for although it be evident the disci ple rather suspect themselves than he so fairly do he preserve appearance yet unless the artist be permit to employ some sign of he baseness he can not possibly distinguish the traitor and thief these subject be clear and obvious but there be other more obscure and difficult we have authority to suppose stpaul be in person diminutive and inelegant and troubled with disorder most probably nervous or paralytic under these embarrassment what trait shall express the dignity of sentiment the persuasive energy the eloquent patho of this in spired apostle the plate shew the idea of raphael and other great master

ertion of design and as art enjoy the greatest liberty when engage upon they because creature of fancy so it be ex pect that fertile imagination and skilful hand should embody as it be the idea of the poet and present to the eye the similitude of deity or heroes of nymph or syl van with freedom and vigour but if imagination should run riot and attempt to express the subject treat without strict attention to character what a heterogeneous mixture would it produce " confusion worse confound " would be its proper motto jupiter or apollo cupid or hercule must be know not so much by the thunderbolt or lyre the quiver or the club as by feature so expressively coincident with the subject as to preclude doubt achille and nestor ajax and ulyss must differ as well from each other as from

shakespeare have leave we would be to transcribe many page and would extend this article beyond its proper limit it be no new idea that the genius necessary to poetry and painting be greatly simi lar of this the subject before we be very confiderable evidence for unless both the poet and painter carefully maintain in they work regular and obvious discrimination of character the beauty and excellence of they performance vanish from these remark it appear that one mean whereby to attain competent discernment of picturesque character be familiar acquaintance with the work of we best author whoever with attention to this hint read those spectator which contain account of sir roger de coverley will quick iy perceive the diversity of feature necessary to distinguish he from will honeycomb or sir andrew freeport the different nation which inhabit the globe have each something in they appearance peculiar to themselves arise either from climate or custom from religious rite or civil manners independent of that cast of feature which each indi vidual possess and of whatever rank he may sustain in life it be true that among european and nation who have conside rable intercourse with each other this variety be not so strike as in people who never mingle with they neighbour because the former become in time not little assimilate to those with whom they have most communication and native of either country who unite and mix with the other diffuse they distin guish peculiarity wherever they form connection so like wise person of rank and fortune seldom present the mark of they nation equally strong with the lower class of people be cause by acquaintance with foreigner at home or residence among they abroad they acquire much of they manners and deportment while the inferior part of mankind not have the same opportunity but continually converse among such as resemble themselves preserve the original and popular character of they country national distinction of feature and manners be so ob vious that little need be say upon they it be useless labour to prove that a englishman do not resemble chinese or frenchman hottentot but it would require very copious dissertation to examine into all the variety that might be name nor be it easy to procure authentic portrait of remote nation sufficiently correct from which to form judgment what we have be able to obtain appear in the plate what further may occur will be notice under the miscellaneous observation it may be proper to remark in general that geographer and other who have study the human species inform we of at least eight variety find upon the globe diflerent from each other in many respects the laplander whose diminutive fi gure instead of measure seven and half or eight timee the length of he head admit but from five to six and of conse quence have to we a uncouth and squab appearance who perhaps be as little pleased with what he consider as the too tall and awkward proportion of the southern european the negro have feature peculiar to himself so have the the chinese the hottentot so have the indian of north america and those of the south to which variety may be add that singular people the jew many other national peculiarity might be notice but it become we to consider that this article be as we have ob serve very extensive field for investigation which al though it abound with flower both fragrant and beautiful yet like all other path to knowledge be not without many thorn and briar it require no little dexterity to avoid the latter in whoever wilh to possess the former this dexterity may be attain in time when ripe judgment and intelligent mind may safely emulate subject which at present it be prudent to forbear we hint that the numerous disorder to which the human frame be subject be considerable source of those peculiarity of feature which contribute to character sickly person be readily distinguished from one in health and distemper acute or chronical produce correspondent effect in the coun tenance whether distemper accompany we openly or conceal they selve closely they effect be great but the most powerful agent in change the feature be time to whose irresistible sway all person and thing submit what remain to be say on the different appearance of age be less pleasing than what have go before shall be describe with brevity in the age from twenty to thirty barring acci dent there appear but little change either in the colour or line of face for though the bloom tint may go off little yet the feature attain fix firmness which aid by a air of acquire sensibility make ample amend for that loss and keep beauty till thirty pretty much upon par after this time as the alteration grow more and more visible we per ceive the sweet simplicity of many round part of the face begin to break into dent shape with more sudden turn about the muscle occasion by they many repeat move ment as also by divide the broad part and there by take off the large sweep of the serpentine line what further havock time continue to make after the age of fifty be too remarkable to need describe the stroke and cut he then lay on be plain enough however in spite of all he malice those lineament that have once be elegant retain they flow turn even in venerable age leave to the last comely piece or ruinthis passage be borrow from a artist whom we have quote already such be the close of the most admirable beauty and most elegant feature `` this be old age and thus do man outlive they youth they strength they beauty which will change to witherweak and grey `` alas how little from the grave we claim " we have not notice the feature peculiar to each sex sepa rately because they be too plain to be mistaken and be in both sex subject to the same rule of particular character the abbe winkelman have remark and justly that the second childishness of mankind shew itfelf in the assimilation of the sex in advanced year in infancy they be greatly alike very distinct at maturity and in old age they return to likeness the most beautiful woman retain not the softness of she countenance but as wrinkle increase approach in appearance to man of the same time of life as man who though ever so robust and athletic lose the distinguish ing character of he sex and under the pressure of load of year desert by strength and vigour dwindle into close resemblance to a old woman as we mean not to enlarge this article we shall conclude it by remark that dress though no essential part of the person be yet a essential part of character the feature of the face can not be ehange but they appendage may be and accordingly have be almost ad infinitum the absence or superfluity of the hair of the beard and of the head the different form into which it be curl twist or plait and the innumerable ornament to which mankind have recourse for a addition of suppose elegance contribute very much to diversity of character the ruff and cap of we forefather would so effectually metamorphof modern fine gentleman that he most intimate acquaintance would not know he nor be less remarkable the effect produced by the redundant fullbottom wig of we great law officer to which if the pendent beard be add when moserjeant become judge he might justly defy the acutest brother of the coif to discover he in effect the fea ture of any man who have not very singular cast of counte nance may be so disguise by various form of dress as scarcely to appear the same the use of this principle upon the stage be notorious and perhaps in real life its influence be much more frequent and deceptive than be generally imagine we shall here close this subject refer to the remark upon the plate which accompany it to the miscellaneous obser vation and to similar title when we consider the figure discourse upon expression deliver to the royal academy of painting at paris by mon le brun president gentleman at we last meeting you be pleased to approve of my defign to discourse upon expression in the first place it be necessary to understand in what it consist expression be in my opinion natural easy and strike resemblance of the subject intend to be represent it be a indispenfable requisite in all part of painting no picture can be perfect without it by expression be mark the just charac ter of every object it distinguishes the nature of different body impart to figure life and motion and give apparent reality to what be only delusory it be principle equally nece sary in colour as in design and should be regard as well in representation of landscape as in composition of figure expression be principle which discover the sensation of the mind and the effect of its various passion nothing can be add to what have be already write by many learn man who have treat upon the passion whose opinion upon this subject should not repeat be it not the better to explain what concern we art and that it seem necessary to touch upon it for the information of young student first then passion be a emotion of the mind reside in the sensitive part which exert itself to attain what the mind consider as good and to avoid what it regard as injurious and usually whatever raise passion in the mind produce a action of the body therefore as it be certain the greater part of mental passion produce bodily motion it be necessary we should know what be those motion of the body which express the passion and these we term action action be nothing but the motion or apparent variation of certain part this variation in the appearance or situation of that part be produce by change make in the muscle the muscle receive motion from the nerve which surround they the nerve act by the spirit contain in the cavity of the brain the brain receive they from the blood which procceed continually from the heart where it be so heat and rarify as to raise certain subtle vapour which rise to the brain fill it the brain thus fill distribute these spirit to the other part of the body by means of the nerve which as so many small tube convey they to the muscle in quantity greater or less as may be requisite for the action to which they be call that muscle therefore which be most exert receive the great est portion of spirit and in consequence become more in flated than the other which be deprive of they and which by that privation be render apparently weaker and less con spicuous though the foul be united to all part of the body yet there be various opinion respect the place where it more particu larly exercise its function some maintain that it be fmall gland in the midst of the brain because this part be single whereas all other part be in pair and as we have two eye two car and all the exterior organ of sense in pair there must be some place where the two image admit by the two eye or the two impression receive from single object by the two organ of any other sense may unite before they arrive at the mind itself in order that they may not present two object instead of one other say the feat of the mind or foul be in the heart because here the passion be feel my opinion be that the mind receive the impression of the passion in the brain and feel they effect in the heart the exterior movement which have remark confirm I greatly in this opinion the ancient philosopher have suppose the mind to possess in its sensorium two distinct appetite place the simple passion in that which be the seat of desire and in that which be the feat of anger the more ferocious passion and those which be com pose of they the first they say contain love hatred desire joy sorrow in the other reside terror courage hope despair anger fear other add admiration which they confider as the first then love hatred desire joy and sorrow from these be derive those passion which be compound such as fear courage hope it will not therefore be improper to say something upon the nature of these passion for we better understanding they before we speak of they exterior movement we shall begin with admiration admiration be surprise which make the mind attentively consider strike and extraordinary object this suprise be so forcible that sometimes it impel the spirit towards the part which receive the impression of the object and occupy the mind in consider this impression so strongly that there remain scarce any spirit pass in the muscle but the body become motionless as statue excess of admiration produce astonishmnent and astonish ment may take place before we know whether the object be desireable or not insomuch that it should seem that admira tion be united to esteem or to contempt accord to the great ness or diminutiveness of a object from esteem arise vene ration from contempt disdain but when any thing be represent as good for we it raise in we love for it when it be consider as evil or hurtful it ex cite in we hatred love be a emotion of the mind cause by sensation which incite it to desire a union to those object which it suppose desirable hatred be a emotion cause by those sensation which incite the mind to desire separation from object it suppose hurtful desire be a agitation raise in the mind by its inclination for those thing which it imagine to be proper thus not only do we desire the possession of absent but the continuance of present good joy be a agreable emotion of the mind the effect of its en joyment of good suppose to be in its possession sorro be disagreeable languor the effect of uneasiness which the mind feel either from present evil or from the want it suffer of some good compound passion fear be a apprehension of future evil which anticipate calamity that threaten we hope be promise appearance or strong expectation of obtain what be desire hope when extreme become cer tainty as on the contrary extreme fear become despair despair be persuasion of the impossibility of obtain what we desire and deprive we even of what we possess anger be turbulent agitation excite by vexation and cou rage by which the mind retire within itfelf to withdraw from injury receive and at the same time rise against the cause of the injury with purpose of revenge there be many other passion which shall not now enume rate but content myself with exhibit they in the design but let we previously notice those movement of the blood and spirit which produce simple passion it have be remark of admiration that it do not cause any change in the heart or in the blood as the other passion do the reason be that neither good nor evil be its object but merely the knowledge of the thing admire it have no concern with the heart or blood upon which depend the function of the body love when simple that be to say unaccompanied by joy desire or sorrow have a equal pulsation more sensible and stronger than usual pleasant warmth invigorate the breast and digestion be promote by it in the stomach insomuch that this passion contribute to health of hatred it be remark that on the contrary the pulse be unequal and weak often quicker than ordinary the breast be afflict by heat intermingle with sharp and severe inflam mation and the stomach suspend its office in joy the pulse be equal and quicker than usual but not so strong or sensible as in love not only be a agreeable warmth feel in the breast but diffuse over all the exterior part of the body in sorrow the pulse be seeble and flow the heart feel as if confine by band and freeze by icicle which communicate they frigidity to the rest of the body desire have this singularity that it agitate the heart more violently than any other passion and furnish to the brain greater quantity of spirit which pass thence through the muscle quicken every sense and render every part of the body alert have mention these internal movement the better to ex plain they connection with the external shall now proceed to observe what part of the body serve to indicate the passion of the mind to the spectator the mind as we have assert be united to all part of the body and may use they to express she sensation fear may be signify by man run in fright anger by man beat another with he fist but if it be true that the mind more immediately exercise its function in one particular part which be in the brain we may say in like manner that the face be that part where she feeling be most conspicuously exhibit and as we have say that the gland in the midst of the brain be the place where the mind be ceive the image of the passion so that part of the face where the passion shew themselves most distinctly be the eye brow though many have suppose it to be the eye it be true the eyeball by its fire and motion shew clearly the agitation of the mind but it do not express the nature of that agitation the mouth and the nose have great share in expression but in general these part only follow the motion of the heart as we shall remark in the sequel of this discourse and as it have be say that in the sensitive part of the mind reside two appetite from whence procce all the passion so in the eyebrow there be two motion which express all they sen sation these two motion coincide perfectly to those two appetite for the elevation of the brow towards the brain be the sign of the passion which be savage and cruel but be yet more remarkable in these motion that in proportion as the passion vary they nature the movement of the brow vary its form for to express simple passion the movement be fimple if it be compound passion the movement be compound if the passion be gentle the movement be gentle if violent so be the movement but it must be remember that there be two kind of ele vation of the eyebrow one when it rise the middle and this express agreeable sensation when the brow thus rise the corner of the mouth be elevate whercas in expression of sorrow the mouth be elevate in the middle but when the eyebrow sink in the middle denote bodily pain then the mouth sink at its corner in laughter all the part follow each other for the brow descend towards the centre of the forehead and make the nose the mouth and the eye follow the same motion in weep the movement be compound and contrary for the eyebrow lower themselves on the side of the nose and eye and on that side the mouth rise there be yet this observation to make that when the heart be deject so be all part of the face but on the contrary when the heart feel some passion which inflame and harden it all the part of the face follow similar movement parti cularly the mouth which prove as have already say that this part exhibit more especially the sensation of the heat for we must observe that when the heart suffer the corner of the mouth sink when it be satisfied they rise when the heart have aversion to any object the mouth express that avertion by rise in the middle and pout these gentleman be the remark we shall make upon the simple outline which have sketch the better to explain my discourse esteem there be no other way to represent esteem than by the attention and motion of the part of the face which seem to be fix to the object which cause this attention for in this passion the eyebrow appear advan ced over the eye one part approach ing the side of the nose the other somewhat elevate the eye very open and the eyeball raise the vein and muscle of the forehead and those which be around the eye seem little inflate the nostril gently draw downwards the cheek rather hol low the mouth little open its cor ner draw back and bend down ward admiration we have notice admiration as the first and most temperate of all the passion and which least agitate the heart the face receive very little alteration in general what there be be only in the elevation of the eyebrow but both its side be equal the eye little more open than ordinary the lid motionless and fix upon the object of admiration the mouth half open but without any change and all the other part of the face be usual this passion produce only suspension of motion to give time to the mind for deliberation upon what be to be do and consider attentively the object present for be it be rare ple extraordinary this first and sim and movement admiration beget esteem additional observation proportion of the part of the face it be necessary to observe before we proceed to consider the part of the face that although correct rule and dimension be useful in they place yet they be not to be implicitly follow upon all occasion it be not easy without they to fix in the mind of the student a abide idea of regular proportion but that such rule be necessarily very confine appear from the front face in plateand the profile in plate viiifor it be evident that small variation in the situation of the face would deprive the rule of its application it be certain that nature do not in any of she work confine herself to mathematical precision but produce a almost infinite variety of counte nance by enlarge or diminish the feature which compose they so should the designer be careful to avoid constant repetition of the same pro portion leave he performance fatigue the spectator by they too great simi larity for since in observation of natural object the eye be delighted by continual variety be it liable to be satiat when inspect the imitation of those object if instead of that variety to which it have be accustom there be present to it continual repetition without diversity the part of the face be too obvious to need division the forehead be usually about one third of the length of the face but be more or less accord to the situation of the hair which in some person be high in other low the eye contain three division the ball the iris and the pupil the ball may be consider as about one fifth part of the width of the face they be one third of the length of the ball it be differently coloured in dif ferent person but not accord to any certain rule in general people whose hair and complexion be high coloured have the iris blue or grey and on the contrary those whose hair and complexion be dark have the iris of deep brown for the pupil no determinate proportion can be give for by most admirable contrivance this part possess the faculty of contracting or dilate itself accord to its situation in strong light which might otherwise be offensive its orifice close so as to admit no more of the ray of light than be convenient in the shade or wherever light be deficien it expand and there by enjoy much greater portion of light than otherwise it could receive in cat and other animal that prey in the dark the pupil of the eye be so variable as to admit more than a hundred time the quantity of light at one time than at another the human eye admit more than ten time the quantity of light at one time than at ano the and perhaps the difference may be yet greater in very dark place it be not impossible but that the iris may then be draw back and the pupil ex pand to the whole surface of the cornea the passion of the mind have considerable influence upon the pupil of the eye it be invigorate and in flame by some by other it become debilitate and languid in what be usually term large eye it be rather the iris than the ball which be larger than usual in some person the ball be more prominent in other it be more retire the length of the nose be one third part of the face or one fourth part of the head see in front its width at the nostril be equal to the length of the eye and it have the same dimension in profile the height of the nostril be about one third the width of the nose the mouth admit of great variety of form its usual extent be about the length of a eye and quarter but for the proportion of the lip scarce any rule can be give they may be thicker or thinner one thick and the other thin in profile the mouth be nearly half the length of the front the upper lip should generally be more prominent than the under but when the under lip exceed the upper it be reckone deformity by artist the ear be usually somewhat more than one fourth part of the length of the head in profile about half they height the various position of the head very much change they appearance in conformity to the forego rule plate exhibit six study of eye at large plate ii six nose at large plate iii six mouth at large plate iv five ear at large these subject be give of proper size to be draw after and as it be of the utmost consequence to be able to copy they well before the student proceed to the other design let he repeat they frequently endea vour at very correct imitation have attain to competent skill in design the part the next step be to proceed to unite they in order to attain certain manner of do this plate present method of place the part in front face accord to the follow principle draw a oval broader above nar rower below divide it equally by the perpendicular line then by the transverse line divide into five part in and place the eye from downwards the half give the length of the nose and ear from to the chin divide into three part upon place the mouth the neck ap ear neatly level with the mouth the head be four nose in length to the pit of the neck be another nose these rule be not to be too servilely adhere to but be insert merely as kind of guide to the beginner till he eye be sufficiently instruc ted to permit he to quit they plate vi shew in two example the situation of the part in the oval which form the head when see either in profile or three quarter plate vii be study of head at large look downwards plate viii contain twelve head in varlous position which should be copy much larger than the platebe front face upon the same principle as plate to designform a equilateral triangle upon one of its side mark the feature of the face by divide it into three equal part the intersection correspond to the place of the top and bottom or the nose and the angles to the top of the forehead and the chin little prominence form the forehead chen insert the nose and divide the lower part for the mouth and chin by the proportion of plate the remain ing point of the triangle shew the situation of the earbe a appli cation of the same rule to face in profile look upward if the student have ever attentively inspect globe the principle of the follow head will be readily understand by he or it he will give he self the trouble to draw a horizontal line or two upon any eggshape object he will perceive upon furning it the reason of the variation in the line it be certain the real distance of the feature must continue the same in all position of the head but they apparent situation to the eye of spectator may vary accord to they position or to the place of he eye when view they number be example of head look upward where we observe thas those line which inand be horizontal be now become the superior part of circle and those division of the fate which be equal be become unequal the upper appear to diminish as they recede while the lower preserve they ori ginal dimensionas che head recline more and morc backward the upper part become less visible till at length the chin nearly conceal the whole face those line which in nos and be horizontal and in nos the superior part of circle in no which be head look downwards become the inferior part of circle and the lower part of the face be now apparently lessen while the higher part project and retain they proper size character of the part of the face plate ix exhibit six different mouth of various character plate x i contain the part of the face of apollo measure from the antique they be give not only as the most perfect model of proportion in the face of man but also that they may be compare with the same part in the face of the venus plate x ii xiii which may justly be deem the most regular female beauty the sculptor s design in the apollo be to give the most accurate form united wich the greatest dignity the measure should be collate with the head of antinous plate x iv xv who be ing no deity the artist be intent upon masculine delicacy only in which he have succeed to admiration the measure of the face of apollo and venus compare eye in front __

of which merit he attention plate xiv contain two head of the die gladiator nos head of a egyptian termhead of the grecian shepherdesshead of the venus of medicishead of antinousnose and mouth of antinous compare with those of fragment suppose to be execute by the same artist and the eye of the same fragment whose proportion compare with those of the venus and apollo deserve attention plate xv present two view of the head of the farnese hercule two of antinous two of the fragment by the same hand and two of the pythian apollo in these head we may remark the follow variation antinous apollo fragment hercule proportion of the eye vide pl the center of the face the neck same in profile and appear from hence that the face of hercule be by no means larger than those of the other subject but he neck be of great dimension to give he a appearance of strength the student will observe for himself the difference in the other measure the remain plate scarcely admit of remark they contain more
