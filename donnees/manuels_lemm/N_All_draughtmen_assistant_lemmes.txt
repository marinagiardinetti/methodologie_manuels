draughtsmen s assistant or draw make easy wherein the principle of that art be render familiar in ten instructive lesson comprise under the follow head feature and limb landscape profile and oval perspective whole figure enlarge and contracting drapery imitation of life light and shade history explain by great variety of example from the most approve design on copper plate neatly engrave with suitable introduction on the utiility of this noblé art observation on design as well in regard to theory as practice bx the author of the artist s assistant london print for sayer and bennett map and print seller no fleet street the draughtsman assistant or draw make easy introduction draw be the representation of any object either real or imaginary be the imitation of nature or art in which by qut line and shadow well execute in they symmetry and proportion the copy appear as if it be the real object this useful and entertaining art improve the mind refresh and support the memory it enable the artist to form the clearest conception without which the most labour description would be find deficient and it rescue from oblivion the action and person of we fore father and preserve they feature and deed to future generation and retain every uncommon appearance of nature nature seem to inculcate fondness for draw even in youth by the delight they take in picture print which be kind of universal language that speak to the eye and convey idea understand by every nation and people on the globe the artist may at pleasure take sketch of any appearance in the work of nature or art either in he own or any foreign country and bring they homc for he future use or inspection . with this accomplishment the nobility and gentry can judge of design before execute and spare themselves the mortificatton of delay and the additional expence of future alteration in word it may be say to be the silent but the most expressive language of nature there be no art or profession to which draw be not useful but more particularly the painter carver statuary engraver chaser mathematician architect navi gator gardener weaver embroiderer whitesmith and indeed every workman whose advantage in trade may depend on variety and beauty as by the assistance of it he can lay down he design and improve they to the fancy and satisfaction of he employer it be pity so useful branch of education should ever be neglect as several by excel in this art have attain perfection in they respective profession and employ ment and have distinguished themselves by work of ingenuity which have meet with the protection and encouragement of the judicious part of mankind we need not point out the injury do to youth by the neglect of this necessary study and how greatly many in year of maturity lament the deficiency of it as à loss to they selve and family no wonder it should be deem one of the chief accomplish ment in human life and think worthy even of royal patronage as well as the honourable regard pay to it by the different society in all of which spirite emulation be excited among the proficient by premium give to such as produce the most correct and perfect design or imitation it have ever be the misfortune of those who have profess to lay down rule for the attainment of any art or science to leave they envelop with difficulty which if not utterly insuperable at least discourage the learner from proceed in study which he can have little hope will ever reward he purfuit from hence we may reasonably infer that the sald professor be totally unac quaint if not with the theory at least with the practical part of what they un dertook to teach other and that the instruction they have give be found rather upon bare suppesition of they efficacy than upon the surer basis of long and repeat experience which alone could have ensure they success and from which with all due deference to the judicious whose sanction we shall at all time be ambitious to deserve we may venture to answer for the practicability of we own to obviate every objection and to remove all those difficulty which have so long block up the path of science and retarded if not wholly impede the pupil in he progress to the temple of fame be the chief view in compile the subsequent little treatise over and above the improvement make in illustrate the several art hitherto so imperfectly and unintelligibly explain we have introduce direction for scrape in metzotinto which in this edition be still farther enlarge and which as they have never be before attempt in any book of this kind we flatter ourselves will be the more acceptable especially when it shall appear from the rule lay down for the performance of this art that it be so easy to be attain that tolerable profici ency in draw will enable any one to undertake it with all imaginable prospect of succe ss the reader will also find in this impression the addition of very useful problem in the article of perspective illustrate by new plate as this book be chiefly intend for the use of young practitioner we have pur posely avoid all abstruse expression and obsolete term content ourselves with fuch familiar stile as we judge most likely to inform those mind we would wish to improve yet as the idea of a artist be not wholly to be convey without some necessary term peculiar to each branch we have take care to explain such as could not be omit without manifest injury to the work by familiar word of synonimous tendency wherever they occur so that we apprehend we have not leave the least stumble block for the reader to encounter general instruction every young beginner should endeavour to improve he memory with the beauty of the most excellent painting and print take notice of the harmony of they different part as well as of the reason for the disposition of the light and shade which will by degree improve the idea to degree of excellency and make the practice easy and familiar as the hand will be more ready to execute those object the mind have so clearly conceive the use of this accomplishment be visible in many who though not able to execute yet by accustoming themselves to this study become excellent judge and be with great propriety term connoisseur in the polite art of painting engrave it will also be of essential ser vice to the pupil to attend to the reason assign for the merit or defect of the per formance as such a enquiry will greatly forward he in he study pupil should take particular notice of the original intend to be draw from observe whether the figure or object be upright or incline to the right or leave take care also that everv part in the copy have the same direction which may easily be discover by frequentlv revise the sketch and compare it attentively with the original pay due observance to this by young beginner will mend they judg ment and in time enable they to proceed with grow pleasure material for draw camel s hair pencil charcoal cut in long slip fitch black lead pencil crow quill pen crayon of black white and red chalk ruler and pair of compass porte crayon a indian rubber indian ink instruction with example very learner be particularly desire to perfect himself in the practice of the first lesson in its several branch before he attempt the second and so of the second before he proceed with the third not endeavour to become master of the whole at once which will only perplex he idea and weary he in the pursuit of what he will never by this means be likely to attain whereas by proceed gra dually the rule will be find much more easy and practicable and consequently the study infinitely more pleasing and encourage draw the introductory line with the feature and limb separately endeavour to imitate perpendicular or upright stroke and then horizontal or parallel line but without use the ruler and if care be take few example of this sort will give you perfection when yon have attain this proceed to the curve and twining line observe carefully they different inclination and when you can with ease perform these proceed to draw the qut line of human face as the eye nose mouth and ear and from they proceed to the part of the body as the arm hand leg see plate the above must be but faintly fketch so as to be easily take down with rubber in order to make the necessary alteration before finish profile and oval when you be become master of the former you may then attempt the profile or side face be careful to observe the proportion of the several part to each other after this the full or oval face observe still the bearing of every feature with respect to the rest and keep the proportion as exact as possible after pro ceed with great care in the above you may begin the qut line of the body as in plate ii whole figure with the proportion and dimensim of the human body if on thorough examination you find you can easily imitate the different fea ture and part of the body you may begin the whole figure by sketch the whole very lightly with you pencil or charcoal examine the proportion of the different part take it down with rubber and alter where it shall appear necessary when you have bring it as near as possible toyour original proceed to finisn with the crow quill pen and indian ink beginning with the head then proceed to the shoulder body arm hand hip leg and foot take care to correct any error in the pencil sketch the remains of which will be easily eraze with rubber refrain from the use of compass till after very minute inspection with the eye and then if the fault can not be discover proper application of they will greatly assist the pupil to remedy the defect have by close attention and practice improve he ldea so far as to be able to compleat figure in qut line we shiall proceed to instruct he in the drapery or cloath but before we quit this subject it will be necessary in this place to give he the best method of ascertaining the proportion and dimension of the several part of the human body by raise perpendicular on the place you intend for the middle of the figure and divideit into head and from such form scale to regulate the proper distance but as it have be common to divide the figure into ten part we have though we do not so well approve of this method give a example of both of these method together with rule for the illustration of each respectively the proportion of figure divide into eight head see plate iii the length of the head be from the crown of the head to the bottom of the chin line rule through the second division will directly cross the pap of the breast the third division will fall near the navel the fourth acrof the privity which be exactly the middle of the figure the fifth cross the middle of the thigh the sixth be just below the bend of the knee the seventh falls little below the calf of the leg the eighth extend to the bottom of the heel observe that when the arm be extend at full length in direct line the full extent from the middle finger of each hand be exactly the length of the figure from the middle of the collar bone to the end of the middle finger measure four head viz the first to the bend of the shoulder the second to the elbow the third to the wrist and the fourth to the finger end from shoulder to shoulder in man of common size measure exactly two head but there be no precise standard for the breadth of the limb which vary accord to the bulk of the person and the movement of the muscle the proportion of figure divide into ten part see plate iii the first of these division extend from the crown of the head to the under lip the second little below the collar bone and line draw through this part of the figure will paf over the middle of the shoulder the third division will make line just below the pap of the breast the fourth will reach just below the navel the fifth which be the middle of the figure directly across the privity the sixth will pass over the middle of the thigh the seventh cross the bend of the knee the eighth directly through the calve of the leg the ninth reach half way from the calf to the bottom of the heel which determine the tenth and last division of the figure the young beginner will find the forego rule of infinite advantage to which we would advise he to give due application till they become strongly impressed on he mind but care must be take that too strict a observance of the precede dimension may not destroy that variety of composition so absolutely necessary nor will the préservation of the same proportion be always allow in the subject which mo . hogarth in he chapter of proportion very judicioussy remark in he ob servation upon the celebrate statue of the apollo belvidere where he say can not throw stronger light on what have be say hitherto of proportion than by animad verting on remarkable beauty in the apollo belvidere which hath give it the prefer ence even to the antinous mean super addition of gieatness to at least as much beauty and grace as be find in the latter in the same apartment at rome be to be see these two master piece of art where in view the antinous the spectator be sill with admiration when the apollo strike he with surprise and as traveller express themselves with a appearance of something more than human which they be always at à loss to de scribe but the effect of this be they say the more extraordinary as the dispropor¬ tion upon examination be evident to every common eye anatomy the foundation of design anatomy be perfect knowledge of all the part of the human body but no more be necessary to painter than that which relate to the bone and the principle muscle that cover they there be a absolute necessity to be thoroughly acquainted with the form and joint of the bone bécause the dimension be often alter by morion and like wise to understand the office and situation of the muscle since the most strike truth in design depend upon they as it be indispensably necessary that the pupil should have some knowledge in anatomy it be the fundamental part of design and enable artist to discover the beauty of the antique it be therefore earnestly recommend the student to pay some attention to it as all that be necessary for draughtsmen be very eafily retain drapery when you have draw the qut line of the figure you want to cloath faintly with charcoal sketch the qut line of you drapery lightly with the several fold remember that they must not cross each other due regard must likewise be have to the quality of the drapery as stuff and wooll cloth be more harsh than silky which be always flow and easy remember that the drapery must not stick too close to the bodv but let it seem to flow easy about it and yet appear so that the motion of the figure be free and natural be careful that the drapery suppose to be blow by breeze of wind all slow one way and draw the part next the body before those which sty off the garment must always bend with the figure and if you make the drapery almost close to the boly the smaller must be the fold and if quite close there must be no fold but only faint shadow to represent the bend of that part of the body which it cover it be necessary the student should take every opportunity of improvement in this useful branch by remark the fold in the drapery of gentleman and lady accord to they several position by this uner ring rule of nature the learner will greatly heighten he own idea and give superior excellence to he work thus far may serve to give the young draughtsman general idea of drapery but that he may not be at à loss in perfect himself in this necessary branch of the art we have here subjoin the follow more particular instruction viz be careful to avoid overcharge you figure with superfluity of drapery let as much of the form of the body as possible be shew underneath it when the drapery be large throw they into as few fold as you can and let these be large and graceful on the contrarv let those which be close to the body and short be loosen by sinall fold judicioussy place which will be the means of avoid that stiffnef which for want of this caution appear when the drapery be make to sit too strait and make the figure seem as if wrap round with bandage instead of be grace fully cloath when much drapery be require let the greater part if possible be throw into shadow observe that the fold which fall in the light must have such foft and tender shadow as may make they sit hollow from the body and not seem to girt too closely to it let the fold be properly contrast and avoid strait line as much as possible judicious repetition of fold in circular form greatly contribute to characterise fore shorten limb in fix attitude let the drapery appear likewise motionless unless expose to the air but the drapery of figure move with great agility should seem to play as if agitate by the wind but in proportion only to the velocity of the figure in motion we can not conclude this subject without give this very useful caution viz let the pupil be careful how he study statue and remember that the best of they be only memorial of those great artist whose life be spend in endeavour to express they own idea of perfection which varied accord to the different taste of each and the nature of the material upon which they wring and let it be likewise remember that there be stiffness which should be studiously avoid in copy even though correct one make after the finest statue which will never convey any idea but that of statue whereas there be such freedom observable in the imitation of nature as evidently distinguishes they from those take either from marble or plaister of light and shade the proper distribution of light and shade in picture be absolutely necessary to be know as it not only determine the proper distance of one object from ano the without which the whole would be a undistinguished mass of confusion but it give likewise to each respective object its substance roundness and effect therefore have out line the fold and the other part of drapery vou may next attempt the shadow of you figure observe the follow method shadow the draw with the pencil or pen in which great care be require first observe from which side the light come in which if natural ought to be from the right or leave for when the light come in the middle it be call a artificial light as proceed from some artificial luminary as candle lamp lay you shade rather faint at first so that you may heighten they at pleasure where necessary for you may at any time darken you shadow when you can not lighten they remember that you shade must be all on the same side of the figure that be to say if the right side of the face be in shade so must the same side of the body arm leg you shade must all be faint as they approach the light the strength gradually decrease towards the extremity to prevent harshi appearance as that be never fail sign of bad workman when one part of the body project over or before another the part project must receive stronger light those part that bend inward must be make so much the darker and shadow deepest next the light two equal light must never be make in the same picture the strongest light should fall upon the middle of the piece where the principal figure ought to stand diminish gradually towards the extremity stump inade of paper or glove leather roll hard and cut almost to point like pencil be useful if you shade with the pencil red chalk or crayon to blend the shade and soften they into each other as also where they appear too strong to weaken they with the afcresaid roll by examine nature you will im prove you ldea in light and shade as well as in outline and be enable to form right judgment of the truth of you draw the indian ink may be prepare for few different shade by rub it more or ley in water on marble stone cut in hollow for that purpose reserve one of the hollow for the water of draw landscape this will give the student a inexhaustible fund of amusement from the variety of subject which nature constantly supply for he observance and imitation and in order to improve in this study the best method be to adhere to the rule before lay down with regard to the human body by begin with the most simple ob ject as the outline of cottage tree for which reason we shall give few example in each with they proper shade but would advise the pupil not to be too hasty in the shadow before he be perfect in the outline and as it be impos¬ sible he should excel in landscape without some knowledge of perspective we shall give some direction suitably illustrate with problem as necessary assistant to the practitioner which will prevent he be impose on by faulty and incorrect original where the lgnorance of perspective make the whole landscape appear unnatural and distort of perspective the first thing necessary to learn before we proceed to the problem be a ex planation of the several technical term use in the practice of this art and these be as follow the base or fundamental line be the bottom of the draw or that part of the ground on which the person be suppose to stand look towards the point of sight perpendicular be a upright line with respect to any part of the base parallel line be equidistant from each other as the horizon to the base the horizon be the most distant part where the cloud seem to touch the earth and limit the sight the point of sight be that part of the horizon where all the visual ray center visual ray be beam of light convey the likeness of any thing to the sight and the knowledge thereof to the mind point of distance be set off on the horizontal line at equal distance on each side of the point of sight diagonal line be those draw from the point of distance to the end of the base line the abridgment of the square be theline where the diagonal crof tnevisual ray and must always be parallel to the base this be only of uie when the sight be limit by perpendicular as the end of church or room the forego term be illustrate in plate iv fig the point of direct view be when the obiect be see in front as house or geometrical elevation raise from ground plot comprehending a equal space on both side the point of sight the point of oblique view be when the object be see sideways for instance view of canal with some remarkable building when the person draw the say view be place on the base line opposite to the building so that the ray of light may be more oblique and the building less fore shorten and appear to greater advant age accidental point be those where object end in the horizontal line not in the point of sight or distance serve for street house chair take diffc rent direction schnography be plan or ground plot to be raise in perspective scenography be bring any thing raise in perspective from a lchnographie plaa to its proper proportion that all object may be diminish in picture the same as in nature as the art of perspective be construct on geometrical principle it may be ne cessary previous to the rule themselves to demonstrate the follow introductory operation from point in give line to raise perpendicular see fig ii plate iv draw the give line then set one foot of the compass in and extend ing they to rather more than half the length of the line stiike the arch and with the same extent of the compass set one point in and describe the arch and then without alter the compass set one foot in and sweep the arch next rule through the point to intersect the arch at draw the line from to which be the perpendicular require to raise perpendicular upon it be the center of the give line see fig iii plate iv divide the base line bcinto two equal part then extend the compass to any distance greater than or and with one foot in sweep the arch then with the same extent of compass set one foot in and sweep the arch ƒg and from the intersection of the two arch at draw line to the center of the base line at and you have the perpendicular require to draw line parallel to or equidistant from another give line extend the compass to the distance of the parallel require then with one foot in any point of the line give as in sweep the circle again without alter the compass set one foot in another point as in and describe the circle then rule the line touch the outward part of the two circle and you will then have the parallel to the line give to bisect or divide give line into two equal part see fig plate iv have take with you compass any distance greater than half the give line proceed with one foot of they in to describe the arch and without alter the distance seit one foot in sweep the arch and these arch will intersect each other in the point which join by perpendicular will cross in the middle point have three give point not in right line how to turn circle through they see fig vi plate iv three point be fix as at and proceed to join they by the right line and then by fig bisect the line with the line which be doné divide the line with the line and from the middle where these line center extend you compass to and sweep the arch sure way of draw a oval see fig vii plate iv divide the give line into four equal part one foot of the compass be set in describe circle without alter the extent of the compass from sweep the circle then extend the compaff one foot in and sweep the arch with the same extent set one foot in and turn the arch the intersection must be united by perpendicular from to then proceed with one foot of the compass in to describe the arch and with the same extent of compass set one foot in and turn the arch anotker certain method see fig viii plate iv rule give line then place one foot of the compass in and describe the circle then with the same extent of compass on the line in the suppose point describe the cirele and through the point where the two circle intersect rule the perpendicular then have one foot of the compass set in extend the other so as to sweep the arch to the lower ex tremity of the circle then without alter the compass set one foot in ty and turn the arch to join the upper extremity by the precede example it be evident that a oval of any form or size may be construct at pleasure only observe always to set the compass at a equal do tance from the give line on the perpendicular practical example in perspective to draw square pavement in perspective see fig ix plate iv supposing you have piece of pavement consist of piece of marble each foot square you first business be to draw a lchnographical plan which be thus perform a exact square be make to the size of you intend plan proceed to divide both horizon and base into eight equal part and from each division in the base to its opposite point in the horizon rule perpendicular line and divide the side into the same number ruling acrof from point to point parallel line so that of course vour pavement will be divide into square foot as the eight foot in length be multiply by the eight in breadth produce the number of piece contain in the whole then rule from corner to corner diagonal liny and you will have you ground plot as in the same figure now to throw this into perspective draw another square as before direct and divide the base line only into eight equal part fix you point of sight at in the center of the horizon then to every division in the base rule line from the same point and proceed to rule diagonal from to and from to to answer thofe in the ground plot and you will then have you square reduce to the triangle and from the point where the line be intersected by the diagonal to the opposite intersection where the line be inter sect by the diagonal then rule parallel line which be the abridgment of the square from the rest of the line which go from the base to the point of sight through the point which be intersected by the diagonal rule parallel line and you will then have you square pavement lay in true perspective as in fig plate iv to find the height and proportion of object appear above the horizon on suppose plane see fig xi plate iv have you horizontal line rule proceed with six you point of sight as at and mark the place of you nearest pillar by dot at the summit or top as at and another at the base as at then rule à line from to and another from to and these two line give the height of any number of pil lar for instance would you have you pillar at fix you dot for the base then meet the diagonal at by rule parallel line and to the diagonal cn rule the perpendicular which perpendicular shew the height of the pillar require at or would you have pillar place at observe the sorego di rection rule the parallel hi and kl and the perpendicnlars im and lo will shew the require height and distance in find the diameter at any particular distance you be to be guide by that nearest the base as for example suppose you nearest pillar dr to be ten foot in height and one in diameter intersect from bottom to top in two equal part and upon the base of the pillar set off one of they from the point of sight to the diameter then rule line to the point of sight from and you will have on the respective basis the thickness of each pillar the precede rule exemplify in object beneath the horizon see fig xie plate iv have rule the horizontal line fix the point of sight as at then accord to you judgment make dot for the foot of you figure as at and another for the head as at then rule à line from cto and from to and these two diagonal will shew the true height of any number of figure that can be want make dot for the place of the foot of any figure where you would have they stand as at and now to know the height of each respec tively draw parallel line from the dot and to the diagonal cd then raise perpendicular from the point where the parallel intersect this diagonal at lo mo ns to and pu and the perpendicular shew the height of the figure at as do mrof that at ns of that at tof that at l pu of that at note you will be oblige always to fix the height of one figure as at in order to find the size of the rest and the point ef sight may be place at any do tance you please from the first suppose figure on the horizontal line rule you base line of any length you please as at then raise perpendi cular as in fig ii from to and from bto next take with you com pasy the length from to and set one foot in turn the arch ef then with the same extent of compass set one oot in and describe the arch lastly rule line from to touch the outward part of the two arch where they intersect the perpendicular and you have the square require from give line to form parallelogram see fig xiv plate iv rule give line of the length require as at then raise perpendicular at and another at as in fig ii and on they set off the proper height as and bd join cd with line and you parallelogram be complete fig x v plate iv in this figure we have attempt to shew how to draw with certainty that curve line wnich mo . hogarth in he ingenious analysis have stile the line of beauty there have however be a objection raise by some that he have omit the rule whereby this truly useful line may be find for which reason and in order to en force the study of it we have give thisfigure not as a insult upon that celebrate author whose meaning be very clear but as . line well deserve of attention be of itself single and easily draw and as we be desirous of follow the method of that great artist in the explanation of we idea by the most familiar object we here inform the student that it may be plainly see in that well know amusement of the school boy six point star in which the contrast half of any two opposite point give the line which be with great propriety stile the line of beauty to execute direct view see fig plate if you would draw direct view of house and wall or in other word geometrical elevation to be raise from plan or ground plot by scale madæ accord to the dimension of the building first rule the base line above the plan at any height vou please then erect perpendicular at and for the extremity of the house also fiom the window mark in the plan ef gh ér no which will give the breadth of all the window rule these perpendicular faintly with black lead have do this suppose the bottom of the parlour or ground floor window to be foot above the base line take off with you compass foot from the scale and transfer that measure from to at each end of the house then supposing the parlour window to be foot high set off that measure from the scale and transfer it to the extremity from tor then if the distance from the top of the parlour window to the bottom of those on the first floor be foot take it as before from the scale and set it off at each end from tos then suppose the chamber window to be foot high transfer that distance from the scale from to at each end next supposing from the top of the first floor or chamber window to the bottom of the cornice to be feetx take foot from the scale as before and set off that distance at each end from to then if the cornice be foot high meafure it off from the scale and transfer it to each end from to lastly suppose the roof to be foot from the top of the cornice set off foot at each end from to then rule faintly with you pencil the parallel q rr ss tt and you have the height and breadth of all the window which have outfine rub out the parallel and perpendicular with bread and set off foot the suppose height of the wall rule the line from to at each end and the work be ready for shad to draw a oblique view see fig ii plate first rule the horizontal line de and if the most remarkable object be on the left hand as at have take you station on the base line as at from that place raise perpendicular which at the point of sight will intersect the horizon and to find the roof and base of the principal buildiag rule the dia gonal lk and mk observe whether the prospect before you make curve which if it should be careful to make the same in you copy whether it be direct or oblique to draw view wherein be accidental point see fig iii plate .. suppose large building in which be see two front take different directionss ¬ as in this view six you station at about the center of the base line after which rule the horizontal line then fix upon that you boint of sight and and rule first the diagonal eh and and you may draw diagonal from the point of sight to and that they may take they proper directious towards they respective point of sight accidental point seldom intervene where there be but small distance as in canalss grove noblemen seat which be to he draw by the strictest rule of per spective but when the prospect be extensive it must include every thing analagous thereto but as this require such a infinite number of accidental point you have better not attempt they till you idea be farther improve and you judgment more strengthen of enlarge and contracting fig and plate with you compass divide you original into any number of square and with you pencil rule from side to side and from top to bottom then divide you paper into the same number of square bigger or lef than the original you intend to enlarge or contract and you may to prevent mistake number the square both in the original and copy as they be do in the plate this do place vour original before vou and draw square by square that be to say make the same part as be contain in one square of you original fall into the same square of you intend copy and by do this with care you will make the one exactly corre spond with the other in due symmetry and proportion then outline you subject with indian ink and rub out the mark of the pencil with bread and so proceed to shad of copying of draught when you would copy print or draw exactly of the same size rub the back of it with the dust of red chalk or black lead lay this upon vour paper and pin it down at the four corner then with blunt point trace the qutline and breadth of the shadow which do have carefully examine it to see that nothing be omit take it off and finish it with the pencil or pen another way to make a exact copy and at the same time to preserve the ori ginal be to lay piece of transparent paper upon it and draw the outline thereon with black lead pencil then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon place piece of thin post paper redden or blacken at the back after which proceed to trace and finish it accord to the forego rule if vou would reverse you original you need only turn the transparent paper with the draw you have make upon it downwards upon the post paper and trace it as above direct of the imitation of life chuse the person you be to draw from to be of a handsome shape and good proportion as this will confirm you idea and illustrate the rule before mention place the person in the most natural and easy position always avoid in vour early practice the copying of ungraceful or distort attitude which serve only to geve the young practitioner wrong bias and render he incapable of form just and proper conception of the natural beauty and grace of the human form begin as before direct with slight sketch with vour charcoal of the main lead stroke or outline which have do correctly proceed to finish with you pencil take particular notice of the muscle as they oecur as this will give resem blance of the person in the outline if correctly observe before vou shadow it in draw likeness great care be necessary to expref the paffion in the liveliest manner and this be do by minding the disposition of every feature with pecu liar nicety this be by far the most difficult part the pupil have to learn we would advise he not to be too hasty to attain it before he have make thorough proficiency in the easier and more practicable branch of draw nor would wey on the other hand discourage the effort of genius which in the pursuit of any art or science be most certainly truly laudable and have be frequently attend with the deserve success all that we mean to inculate by this caution be not to aspire all at once or by too hasty stride to perfection but rather to ascend pro gressively the necessary step which lead towards it of history the student have in this branch the whole art of draw as it be blend together and when he have so far gain he point as to draw compleatly the human body this will be the most delightful employment that can be imagine for the choice of subject he need never be at à loss as he own or he neighbour s family will furnisn he with abundance book will likewise greatly afsist he particularly the sacred history which be replete with a inexhaustible fund of event above all other worthy to be record and therefore most deserve he ferious attention to this we may add the history of we own country wherein the illustrious action of ancient heroes as well as those of we contemporary and particularly we gallant officer military and naval in the last war afford ample matter for the exercise of the ingenious artist as to beast bird flower fruit plant we think it wholly unnecessary togive any direction concern they as the subject we have already discuss be by far the most usefül and he who can draw human figure correctly be sufficiently qualified for every other branch of this noble art but as the experienced draughtsman nay sometimes chuse to vary the object of he study which when perfect in anatomical subject he may do with safety we have give few example of beast bird shipping for he farther entertainment and amusement observation on design as well in regard to theory as practice the theory of design be only to be acquire by study the best author who have lay down the scientifical rule for the attainment of this art by sound knowledge in the theory of design those who be unable to draw the most simple object may be enable to give they opinion upon the performance of the best master in this case theory be detach from practice be equally consider and distinguished by the epithet of taste there be another method of acquire taste which be by frequently examine good picture in the prefence of those who be esteem
