that of the draught rub one fide of it with some bowder of blacklead till it be well and equally black to that finger touch it will hardly c ting with the black then take the print and lay the paper underneath it with the black fide downwards upon another piece of white paper of the fame fize pin the three together in two or three place afterwards take pin of needle fomewhat blunt at the point and trace it over the outline of you picture which with little preffing will direct the black paper to impref the white of as to receive every ilroke you draw this do you may carefully correct what error you fee with you blacklead pencil cleaning the newmake draught flightly with the crumb of ftale bread as for the draught take on tiffany or lawn they be only to be lay on paper that fuch as be draw with charcoal upon white and ia draw with chalk upon black or blue paper and then give each of they knock or two with hammer the charcoal or the chalk will fall through they upon the papers directly in the line they be draw and give you the true reprefentation of the object draw from the life in white line upon the black paper and in black line upon the white then ftrengthen thefe fhadow

to be make foon after the line becaufe thofe tender draught will quickly vanith if care be not take to rrengthen they immediately you be to begin this operation at the bottom of the draw another way be by take thin piece of paper and hold it againft glassewindow particularly fash one becaufe the interruption of lead in the smaller glaze window will himm der part of the prospect then draw what you fee from the glaf and afterwards the blacklead paper be to be ufe as direct before there be another way ftill which may be more eafy to the hand or arm of perfon not becuftome to draw upon paper or lawn place upright which be by the ufe of camera obfcure though to help the hand one may hold baguette or fuch flick in the left hand as the oilpainter ufe to reft the right hand upon or have fome other reft make for the right hand as may be eafily fcrew up and down at pleafure but there be this difference fill between draw piece of perspective or view on tranfparent paper or lawn place upright againft any object and drawing by the camera obfcur that fuch piece will take in more of the view or object and from greater diftance than the camera obicura will however the portable camera obicura will at firft be very eafy to the arm of beginner by reafon the object appear on a horizontal plane such as table and the hand have proper reff will more eafily follow the line reprefent on the plane with great exactness the camera obicura be machine or apparatus wherein the image of external object be represent diffinetly and in they genuine colour either in a invert or erect fituation this manchine may be make as follow darken chamber one of whofe window look into place fet with variety of object leave only one little aperture open in the window in this aperture fit lens either plane convex one or one convex on both fide to as to be the portion of large phere at due diftance to be determine by experience pread paper or white cloth on the unless the wall itfelf be whiten of as to serve the purpofe and on this the image of the defire object will be delineate invertedly in this cafe it be not more difficult to draw or rather copy the object though they be reverf than to draw or copy feveral thing which we fee upright on the frame of tranfparent paper lawn or tiffany for to trace line will be as eafily do one way as the other and though the object fall on the paper or cloth will while you be draw they be reverf it be but turn the paper or cloth upfide down when they be do and the draw will be right to the eye but to obviate this difficulty let the paper or what be to receive the object be place againft the back of chair and let perfon look on the feveral object reprefent thereon over the back of the chair and this will fet they right to the eye you would rather have the image appear erect it may be do either by means of concave lens or by receive the image on plain speculum incline to the horizon under a angle of or by means of two lenfe include in drawrube inflead of one it be to be obferve that if the aperture do not exceed the bigness of pea the object will be reprefent thereon even though there be no lens at all to render the image clear and diftinet it be neceffary that the object be illuminate by the fun and they will he hill brighter if the spectator firff ray quarter of a hour in the dark care muft be likewife take that no light efcape through any chink and that the wall be not too much illuminate farther the greater diftance there be between the aperture and the wall the larger and more diflinct will the image be but the ray become thus too much dilared the brightof the image be weaken till at length it become infenfible but the portable camera obicura be more proper for beginner as be more eaty for they arm befide the object appear on a horizontal plane may of courfe be draw with grefter exaclness the confiruction of portable camera obfcura may be as follow provide wooden cheft in the middle of which raife little turret either round or square open toward the object behind this aperture incline little plain mirfor to a angle of will reffect the ray upon lens convex on both fide include in tube at the end of the focus of the lens place table cover with white paper to receive the image and laffly make a oblong aperture to look through by means of this machine the image will be exhibit perfectly like they object each clothed in they different colour whereby any perfon unacquainted with defign of draw will be able to delineate any thing to the greateft degree of accuracy and juftness and thofe even well verf in painting will find many hint by it to perfect they in this art thus far we have thewn how any perfon may copy draught print or piece of painting or even make a exact reprefentation from the life but we shall yet add two other method both eaty and entertaining not hitherto mention for taking of draught or drawing which be as follow prick with pin the outline of the print or draw you defign to copy and then lave the same on sheet of paper take powderpuff or tuft of cotton dipping it now and then in charcoalduft and beat it over the prick line through the picture by which mean you shall have full direction mark on you cloth or paper fufficient to finith juft draw the other way be by make luch a impref from the print as shall give juft copy of if and it be of great ufe when we want to carry every rroke of the engraver along with we which method if you be very careful will indeed but very little fully the print for this end take fome white or green foap which mix with such quantity of water as will bring it to the confifience of jelly with this mixture rub the print and with wet sponge gently wet the paper defign for receive the impreffion then lay it on the print cover all with two or three other piece of dry paper and rub it very hard all over with any thing that be fmooth and poliffy and thus the wert paper will have upon it the reverfe of the print you rub it upon with every diftinct line in the original if you have be careful to rub it equally chap kiv secrey of copying drawing continue alfe for take off medal various way with jiveral other curious precepy for the

of the finger then lay the coloured side of this butter paper upon piece of clean paper and lay the print you defign to copy upon the burtered paper afterwards with fine pin of needle little at the point trace the outline of the draw carefully by which mean you will have good copy of it upon you white paper which may be touch afterwards with crayon or the like colour ii to take the impression of

sponge dipt in water wet the back fide of the print and turn the print fide down upon piece of white paper to as to lie mooth then lay over that piece of dry paper and pref it hard in every part and the lower white paper will receive the impreffion but if you have linepref it be better to put you pa per between two of the leave and crew the pref as tight as you can by which mean you will have fine impreffion ts take draught writings with red looseink take some vermilion finely ground and mix it with fair water in gallipot with some cotton in it of as that it may run very free in the pen with this mixture draw over all the ftroke of you print imitate both the finer and rronger line then with sponge dipt in gunmwater wet piece of clean white paper and while it be wet turn the pring upon it and preffing it well take off the print and you will find all the stroke remain on the clean paper and as foon as it be dry the vermilion will be fix to it this fort of ink have ben ufe frequently in writing any thing defign to be engrave for by turn the writing fide of the paper down upon cover with beewax and white ground rub it very equally the impreffion will be upon the wax iv take draught with blue loosk iwk you may likewife make fuch fort of ink with blue bice and common water as will run very finely in pen and ferve for the same ufe as the for mer ink to take off draw in stand rev colour by trace take vermilion finely ground and mixing it with little freth butter rub clean sheet of pa per on one fide with this mixture to that it may bear flight touch of the finger without leave the paper then lave the coloured fide of this paper upon clean sheet lay you print upon the other fide of the coloured paper and then trace every line you think proper as already direct in trace draught with fix ink but befure to pin the three papers together at the corner to prevent they flipping which would inevitably fpoil you work this impreffion make by trace will hold without rub or preffing the papers the quill of fwallow after they be thoroughly dry be very good for trace by mixing carmine with fome freth butter and colour paper with it in the same manner you will obtain more beautiful colour and by colouring paper in like manner with blue bice and butter you may have the draw blue vi to take the natural or lively shape of any fiza er tree firft take the leaf you would copy and gently rub the vein on the back fide of it with piece of or fome fuch like matter of as to bruife they little afterwards wet the fame fide gently with linfeeoil and then press it hard upon piece of white paper and you shall have the perfect figure of the leaf with every vein in it juftly expreff this impreffion be afterwards coloured will feem truly natural and may be ufeful to fuch as would remember plant vii anotber wayef painting the lerve of plant to that the impreffion shall appear as black as if it have be dene in printingpress be as follow when the leaf be dry take fuch ball as the prefimen ufe for black the type and rub it equally over with printer ink ftrike it gently four or hve time on the back of the leaf till all the vein be black with the ink then lay the leaf on flat board or the like with the back fide upwards clap piece of whice paper well moiften on the leaf and preffing it pretty hard but not to as to bruife the fibre you shall have fine impreffion but this may ftill be do to greater advantage by means of piece of wood in the form of cylinder about foot long and a inch and half diameter the middle part about fix or eight inch long be cover with wooll cloth roll three or four time round it with this cylinder roll the paper over the leaf four or five time back = ward and forward and you will have curious impreffion but where printer ink be not conveniently come at the follow method may be make ufe of rub the back of the leaf as before direct with burnt linfeeoil then flrew some powder of black lead or for want of that some charcoal or or the powder of burnt cork upon fmooth board of as equally to cover it ftroke the powder gently over and oil the back fide of the leaf clap it upon the board then lay the white paper upon the back of the leaf press or roll it as before if none of thefe ingredient be conveniently have take vermilion and mixing it with freth butter to the confiftence of printer ink cover you printinghall with it daub it over the back of the leaf and take you impreffion as before where vermilion be ufe bice may alfo be make ufe of either with butter or oil by grind blue bice with fome burnt linfeeoil and ufe it as before thus you may have fine red or blue ink proper for impreffion of this fort but the blue be preferable in colour leave becaufe it be a agreeable colour for the green fort it may be observe that the reafon why the back of the leaf be the proper fide to make the impreffion from be becaufe the rib or veffel rife on that fide above the flethy part of it and therefore be coloured with any of thofe ink they be the fitteft to give a impreffion whereas in the forefide of the leaf the ffethy part rife and thef e fine fibre be funk between they viil to take of the leayr of plant in plaiffer of paris so as that they may afterwards be caft in meial thofe perfon who caft in metal have frequent occafion to ufe leave of feveral fort in order to embellish they work thefe be generally make from model do by the hand which take up great deal of time and even at laff be imperfect but the follow way which be communicate by gentleman from frely be greatly preferable and much eafier soon after you have crop the leaf you defire to take a impreffion from lay it between the leave of book till once it shall lie flat then upon smooth board with ffrong gumwater make of gumarabic fix the forefide or front of the leaf to the board when this be do raife round it little wall of coarfe pafte half a inch high or if you can conveniently furround you piece of wood with pafteboard or cardpaper to clofe as that it shall hold liquid for some time then oil the back of you leaf as direct below in the method for caft of medal and pouron wate and plaifter of paris as there direct which when it be dry will give you a exact impreffion of every vein of the leaf and from which you may eafily make mould to caft in as you fancy ix a expeditious wiethe of take the impression ef any butterely in all its colour have take butterffy kill it without spoiling the wing which contrive to pread as regularly as poffible in fly pofitien then withatmall brush or pencil take piece of white paper wath part of it with gumwater little thicker than ordinary to that it may eafily dryafterwards lay you butterffy on the paper cut off the body clofe to the wing and throw it away lay the paper on fmooth board with the fly upwards and lay another paper over that put the whole preparation into fcrewpress and ferew it down very hard or otherwife press it let it remain under that pref= fure for the space of a hour afterwards take off the wing of the butterfly and you will find perfeel impreffion of they with all they various colour mark diftinctly remain upon the paper this be do draw between the wing of you impreffion the body the butterffy and colour you draught of the body after the life to take off the impression of medal this may be of ufe to fuch as would preferve to themfelves good specimen of fine draught of canrious medal especially as it be eafily execute and with but triffing expence one way be as follow take ifinglat and break = ing it in piece diffolve as much of it as be neceffary over the fire in quantity of water fufficient only to cover it take care to keep it ftir till the whole be diffoived this do with hairbrush hroke fome of the glue over the medal whofe impreffion you would take after place they as hofizontally as you can and when you have cover they perfectly all over let they he till the glue be harden and afterwards with the point of pin or needle raife the edge of the glue from each medal and the whole impreffion of the medal in glue will fly off as hard as horn with all the fine sharpness of the medal as it be strike this glue may be make of whatever colour you pleafe by mixing the colour in the water the glue be boil in the impreffion muft be dry immediately but very regularly and not in hot fun nor in any damp place if you ufe ifinglat without any colour mix with the water you may as foon as you take the impreffion from the medal breathe gently on the concave fide of they and then lay they upon the thickeff fort of leaf gold which will stick to they and by fhine through the ifinglat will appear like gold medal but if we would imitate copper medal we should mix carmine with the water that we diffelve we ifinglaf in water may do very well for diffolve the finglat in for this purpofe yer brandy or ip rit of wine will give the glue much greater rrength to as not to be subject to foften in damp dir xi to take the impression of large edal firft rub the medal gently over with tuft of fine cotton moiften or greaf with fwect oil then have fome melt brimftone enough to cover the medal half a inch thick put hoop of cardpaper round the edge of it and pour the melr brimffone on it but not too hot as foon as it be fix and harden take off the hoop of paper and the impreffion on the brimftone will come clean from the medal which shall ferve for sharp and correct mould wherein you may caft another with plaifter of paris but brimftone should not be ufe on filver medal becaufe it will effectually change they colour therefore to take silver medal off bind they round after oil they with hoop of some fliff paper as before and mixing little plaifter of paris with water fill the hoop with it then immediately fill the cafe in prinkling manner with the same plaifter till it harden and when it turnsdry take it off from the medal but from thofe mould caft in brimftone that be concave you muft again caft fuch medal in plaifter of paris and they will be convex oil the mould and uting the plaifter of paris as before by this method you may take off any medal or fine bas relief with great exactness even foas to form medal from they in any fort of metal x ii another way of taking of mrdal be as fellow procure some thin piece of lead and place the medal horizontally on the top of firm post any fleady place lay piece of harder metal fiat ever the lead and place piece of round turn stickover that fuch as be ufe in the ffaff of houfebruth faw off about five or fix inch in length and hold that tight with the left hand on the lead and flat piece of metal ftrike the top of the rick fmart blow with large hammer and it will give the lead perfect impreffion of the image of the medal but this muft be do by one fingl blow to render the impreftion perfect xiii various way of take off medal take the fhaving of paper and boiling they cill they be render pound they well in mortar to as to reduce they into pafte then boil they again in pringwater with little gumarabic ler this mixture sland fome time to fettle then pour off the water ftrain it through fieve or linecfoth and the remain part of this mixture will be a excellent ingredient either to pref into any mould or upon any medal for when the pafte be dry it will come off very fharp some medal that be underwrought can not be take off this way therefore in fuch cafe you should take common glue and melt it fix hoop of pafteboard coc round the edge of the medal and pour on the glue hot the medal have be firft ail with tuft of greaf cotton when the glue be dry and hard take off the hoop and the glue will fly off from the edge and it will as be subject to bend and give way which the thing formerly mention be not come very eafily off but the glue ought to be make flrong should be pour on one third part of a inch thick when a impreffion have be take by this means you muft then hoop you mould of glue with either caldpaper or pafteboard as before direct take care to oil it to that no bubble or blifter may be feen then you may caft you plaifter of paris in it and you will obtain by thefe mean good copy of the medal when this be dry the glae will fy off or may be break off and there will remain good pattern to caft from alfo putty may be make of linfeeoil and fineground ftarch which be well work togethe into pafte will take good impreffion from any medal by means of thefe mould you may cafl good medal of beewax but they will come off much charper if the mould be in brimftone than if it be in plaiffer of paris but then you wax should be as well blanch or whiten as if it be ated for waxcandle however it will be neceffary to greafe the mould before the wax be pour in and though white wax be here recommend yet it will not be beft that the copy of the medal be white becaufe the dark colour thew the medal much better if you would have you copy of red colour mix vermilion with the wax while it be melring and if you would have it blue put in flone blue well beaten or ground into the melt wax as foon as thefe wax medal be cold enough to take off you should lay some leafgold upon they preffing it down gently with piece of cotton without rub it backward and forward and that will gold you medal when you caft medal in plaifter of paris to make they look like feel or metal rub they over with tuft of cotton lightly great with oil then rewing over they tome powder of black lead rub they well with such brush as be ufe for the tooth till the whole be equally cover and this will give they fine glof you may make thefe medal in plaifter of paris look like box by boiling they in linfeeoil and this will harden they to fuch degree as to bear the brush to clean they when they turn foul or dirty if you would have thefe medal lookf of yellow colour boil little pearlath in pint of water till it make ftrong lixivium then put in half quarter of pint of french berry boil this till the liquor be of ffrong yellow and ufe it with you plaifter of paris inftead of common water if you would have the medal look green the fine tranfparent gum of verdigrife mix with the plaiffer of paris will give they that colour and for filver colour leaffilver or tinfoil may be ufe in the same manner as the leafgold for the gold colour for the copper colour german leafcopper may be ufe xiv to take off impression in plaiffer of paris

water the method of wath it be thus put the powder into glass of water he it about and prefently pour off the water while it be white into some other clean glat or veffel then let it fettle pour off the water from it and you shall have a excellent white to which when it be fettle you be to put as much gumwater as be neceffary to give it glaze it be obfervable that white lead will turn black if mix with water that come from iron or clay that be in the space of month or two you may perceive thote place where it lie thickeff ting with black and if it be mix with any other colour it will foon

will make a extraordinary mixture in other colour and will correl they from change or alter they quality as to white for illuminating of print the clear white of the paper be to be leave uncoloured and if it happen that the paper be apt to fink or to pread any watercolour that be lay upon it more than be neceffary then the way to correct it be as follow fix the paper in such ftation as that it may only receive the colour you lay on to glaze juft as far as you defign it then take fome ftarch boil and prepare in water of middle frength and with large paintingbrush stroke it over the black of the print and after it have be well dry in the air or fun put the print in book with the weight upon it to take out the crumpling which it may receive by wet of it and thus will any print he render fit to receive watercolour which will be prevent from run furthe than one would have they fine white for watercolour be make by diffolve filing of fine filver or filverfeaf in aqusfortis then evaporate the aquafortis till it look like cryftal in the bortom of the glat decant the other part of the aquafortis and wath the fil five or fix time in common water till it be freed from the aquafortis which may be know by taft it then dry it for ufe it muft be ufe with gumwater and little water of fugarcandy a incomparable fine white leadcolour be make by grind choice white lead well upon porphyry with vinegar to that it turn blackish then take pot full of water and wath the white lead in it very well let it fettle and pouring off the water grind it again with vinegar repeat this once or twice more and you will have a excellent white both for watercolour and and painting in oil to make good white for the ground for water or oit celour proper in miniature take pound of glover clipping put they some time to steep in water then boiling they in kettle with twelve quart of water till it fink to two ftrain it through line cloth into new earthen pan this be call gloveglue or fize and to know whether it be firong enough it be only neceffary to try when it be cold and have get it be confiftence whether it be ftiff and firm under the hand the glue be make take white chalk and reduce it to powder and melt the glue while it be hot put fuch quarktity of white in it as to make it to thick as pap then leave it to fteep for quarter of a hour ffir it about with briftlebrush then take some of this whire put more glue to it in order to make it brighter for the firft or sevond lav this muft be apply by heating with she end of the brush mind thar you ler every lay dry well before you put chsnother ifie be wood work on you muft put on dozen but if it be thick paper fix or feven be fufficient this do take water and dip foft bruth in it and draining it with you finger rub the work with it in order to render it the fmoother when yourbruth be full of white you muft wash it again and alfochange the water when it be too white xou may likewife fomerime make ufe of wee linen rag inflead of bruth you work be very even let it dry and when it be of rub it with fhavegraf bit of new linecloth to make it foft and free iii of vellow there be some object which have the appearance of gold fhine through the colour of green red or blue fuch as some fort of fly and beetle and the cantharide this golden tranfparency be very well imitate by lay some goldleaf on the shade part of the draw give in little to the light fide of the print the way of lay on the goldleaf be by wash the part where the gold be to be with ffrong gumwater and when it be fomewhat dry by lay on the gold as fmooth and even as poffible preffing it down clofe with cotton but in do this care muft be take that in lay on the gum water you do not exceed the limit you would have the gold appear to shine in this cafe the gold be to shine only through the tranfparent colour which be to be lay on it muft be obferve that the goldleaf will not receive the watercolour regularly and for that reafon it muft be firoke over with little thin liquor of oxgall in painting brufh of camel by which mean it will receive any celour that you have mind to paint upon it and will hold it the green may be firft the verdigrife green or fap green which colour should be defcribe in they place the red may be lake or carmine the purple lake and fine indigo or carmine and indigo and for the bly indigo on the dark fide and on the light little stroke of ultramarine blue juft to thine into the light which will have a admirable effect there may be find upon rofetree in jun and july kind of beetle of gold and green colour which may ferve for direction in this kind of painting but if gold itfelf be ufe it will be beft to polish it which may be do in the follow manner there may be feen in fome manuscript fine golden letter which rife above the furface of the vellum or paper the composition that raif they thus be faid to be make up of vermilion and the white of a egg whick or beaten up to the confiftence of a oil and work together like kind of pafte and with ftamp fix to the vellum or paper with gumarahic on this figure of letter wath some ftronggumwater with pencil of camel hair obferve that the gum do not reach more than the outline then lay on the goidleaf clofe with some cotton and be dry rub it with fome dry cotton and then polifh it with dog tooth this will make itappear as if it werereally caft in gold there be befide this another way of work in gold and that be perform by shell gold but then it muft be pure gold and not that bring from germany which turn green in few day time before you ufe this gold cover the fhady part with vermition and after you gold have be well reclify with spirit of wine lay it on with gumwhich will readily mix with it and when it be dry polish it with dog tooth in lay on gold it will be beft to leave the light without becaufe it will make much brighter appearance than if the object be cover all over with it but if by accident or otherwife the whole piece happen to be cover with gold there be no better way to fet it off than by trace over the shady part with gallilone or what be much preferable the yellow make of french berry the compofition of which be treat of below but it be the deepeft that be to be ufe in this way little minium heighten it very much how the minium be to be rectify may be learn among the red obferve to polish the gold before you ufe the minium on it after this colour of the gold the yellow shall be treat of as they fail gradually in they flrength the firft yellow be kind of strawcolour and be make of ffour of brimftone which of itfelf be fine enough to mix with guinwater common way of il luminate print be by give the tincture of gamboge for yellow and this may be of two or three fort either fainter or rronger the laft to be shade to the firft and to be shade with the preparation of french berrie mo . boyle fay that if the root of barberry be cut and put into lixivium make hrong with water and pearlafh there will be fine yellow produce from it this have be often try fucceed very well he likewife propofe another way for make tranfparent yellow which be by boiling the root of mulberryfree wath well from the earth in rrong lixivium of pearlafh and water this would afford yellowish juice from which may be extract tincture much deeper than the former fellow oker will likewife make another good pale yellotw but it be colour rather of too much body for illuminating of print yer be well ground with gumwater it be of ufe after it have be well wash the plant celandine will afford another good yellow by infufe it in water and preffing it gently and then boiling the liquor with little alum this yellow will incline fomewhat to green but yellow which fome prefer to the reft and may be ufe in feveral capacity of light be one make of french berry and prepare as follow boil two ounce of french berry in quart of lixivium make of pearlath and water till the liquor give fine tinge of yellow to bit of paper dip in it and then pour it off from the berry fet the liquor cool and bottle it up for ifc then again put pint of the same lixivium to the berry and boil they till the liquor be as deepicolour as gallfione and this will be fit for the shade of any fort of yellow you can ufc this may be boil till it produce brown colour and will with little oxgall ferve to shade any leafgold that be lay on paper and be much preferable to gallftone in imitate any goldcolour and it anfwer well upon tincture of gamboge or any of the former yellow next to this may be reckone the tincture of faffron in common water only which afford bright reddish yellow fuch as would be require for a orangecolour in cover the ihadow part of print and when faffron be infufe in rectify spirit of wine there be nothing higherthen it will fly unless it he load with gumarabic as for deep yellow with body dutch pink come the neareft of any to the foremention rtrong yellow make of french berry in point of colour but the english pink which be still make of french berry be of lighter yellow alfo good yellow colour for illuminating print may be extract from the rool of ginger and with tranfparent verdigrife it make fine green it be to be obferve that the english and dutch yellow pink be make with french berry ground to fine powder and boil chap iv of orancecolour norangecolour for wath print be make by lay on teint of gamboge and over that some minium or red lead wath and render fine and fit for ufe it not be fine enough to paint with as it be buy at the shop and befide it will change or turn black in few week if it be not refine but be well prepare it will be very lafting and beautiful but this you muft take notice of that a ounce will not produce above twenty grain of good colour to fland the reft of painter this colour may be mix with gamboge upon white dutch tile to render it of the teint you would have it either fofter or ftronger or elfe the gamboge may be glaze over and rrengthen with the tincture of faffron which will make it glare into ftrong orange d of minium the brightef red leaw the manner of prepare it he minium or red lead be as heavy and ftrong colour as moft we have and prepare be the moft beautiful one when it be well wash and cleanfe of its more weighty part which caufe it to turn black mo . borle direct the prepare or cleanfing it in the follow manner put four ounce of it in quart of rainwater then ffirring it pour off the water immediately and let it fettle to the bottom of every cup or glat you pour it into then pour off that water in day time you will have the colour dry and as fine as can be defire afterwards put little gumarabic into each glat or cup and as much water as will moiften each of they any of thefe may be afterwards ufe with gumwater but if the gum you put in it at firft make it rrong enough to glaze it then you need only add to it common water and accord as you colour be less or more gumin ufe lef or more gumwater for it be of ufelf dead colour when you ufe this colour touch it gently on the yellow above mention that be make of the yellow herry into the light fide and if it want shade you may put littlle vermilion upon it but vermilion be too heavy to paint with when you would illuminate you print becaute it hide the shade of the engraving though tometimes they have better he hide than appear some generally shade this minium with carmine which give it fine effect and render it equal to the brighteft red fower that be to be feen leave still the light ancolour only dathing little way into the

cochineal two ounce and terra marit half a ounce add pint of fair water let this boil sill it be half evaporate as before then fet it by to fettle and ftrain it but when you take it off the fire remember to put in half a ounce of calcine alum reduce to a impalpable powder and diffolve be by fir it about with stick add quarter of drachm of arfenic in order to give it body reduce two cuttlefith bone to very fine powder and put in the powder let it dry up at leifure then grind it with good quantity of fair water in which leave it to keep and afterwards ftrain it through cloth and make it up into few tablet or cake fet it to dry on card or pafteboard if you would have this lake redder add lemonjuice and if you would make it deeper add oil of tartar anotherlake may be make as follow boil shaving or fhearing of fearlet in ley of the afh of burnt tartar this ley have the property of feparate the dye from the carlet shred when it have boil enough take it off and put in cochineal powder maftic and rochalum boil the whole again and while it be quite hot strain it will or three time through fine bag the first be the bag muft be squeeze with two slick from the top to the bottom then the gross matter remain be take out of the bag wash it well after this pass the liquor you expreff with the rick through the bag again and you will find stick to the fide of the bag which you may either pread upon pafteboard or divide into sinall parcel upon paper and fet it afide to dry to make lakecolumbine fleep half pound of the fineft brazil wood of fernambuca raf in three pint of the fineft

grain of bruif cochineal into gallipot with as many drop of tartarley as will juft wet it and make it give forth it be colour then immediately add to this mixture half fpoonful of water or more if the colour be htill too deep you will have delicate purple liquor or findure then take bit of alum crape very finely with knife small quantity of it into the fincture and this will take away the purple colour and make if delicate tincture strain it through fine cloth into clean gallipot and ufe it as foon as you can becaufe this be colour that will alway look exquifitely fine if it be foon make ufe of but will decay if it rand long indian red next to thefe be the indian red which though it be colour of body yet it be afeful for back ground for ffower at diftance when ufe with gumwater be alfo a earth bring from the wight which have be find to mix extremely well with gumwater though be of vifcous to ture it require let gum than moft other colour and as it be naturally fit for ufe without grind and be vifcous of it will no doubt mix with oil as well as with water there be one thing very extraordinary in this earth which be that if you rub deal board with it it will make the board exactly of the colour of mahoganywood and stain it of deep and with to much flrength that it be hard to get it out with wath ap vii of purpie fine tranfparent purple may be make either a redder or nearer the blue as you would have it by boiling four ounce of raf brazilwood in pint of ftale beer with haif a ounce of logwood or campeachywood till the liquor be heighten to the colour you defire which may be know by dip piece of paper in it if you find it toor add a ounce of logwood to the brazilwood which will make it much nearer to the purple than the former and by this method you may humour it to any degree of purple by put in either more or lef logwood to the former compofition and fix the colour with alum this will produce fuch clear purple as no mixture of folid red and bly will do and the receipt have be for long time keep secret it be say that the beft purple colour that can be make may be compote between the carmine and indigo to rrengthen which on the red fide you may add lake between the lighter and darker part and to d when it be ufe in the fame way on the forego purple or the liquid crimfon produce very fine effect the colour may be varied and make either redder by put more carmine or bluer by ufe more indigo which be mix on white dutch rile will shew itfelf fine purple colour may be make of the grof part or fediment of lakecolumbine both for oit and watercolour as follow take the fediment of lakecolumbine which fall to the bottom of the vial in which be the bone of the cuttlefith let it dry and grind it there will be no lake to fine as this and if you mix it with lake it will give it better body befide more ftrength and vigour ch viii of blve the ultramarine blue be not only the firft but the heft fort of bright blue we have as it give spirit to all painting where bly be ufe this colour be make from the lapis lazuli diveft of its gold and ground into a impalpable powder which be do as follow take half pound of lapis lazuli and put it upon redhot coal let it flay there till it be redhot then quench it in very arong vinegar and grind it upon porphyry or any fuch hard ftone with rectify brandy to a impalpable powder make paftil with which the lapis be to be incorporate for the making of this paftil take beewax turpentine rofin and linfeeoil of each quarter of pound and melt the whole together over flow fire when it begin to boil pour it into glaze pot this the pafte of ultramarine take of this paffe quantity equal to that of the lapis knead they together upon the marble and be well incorporate let they remain for one night after which to bring out the ultramarine that be in the pafte pour clean water upon it and knead it with you hand as pafte be knead and the ultramarine will come out for the receive of which place porringer or other proper vellel under you hand and let it fettle in this water till you fee the ultramarine at the bortom of it if you colour feem to be clammy or pnafty you may correct it thus add thereto tartar difsolve in water as much as will drow it and let it reft for one day at leave then wath it in warm water and you will by that means have it correct and well purify ultramarine muft be chote of high colour and well ground which may be know by put it between the tooth for if it feel gritty it be fign that it have not be well ground to know whether it be pure and unmixed puta little of it into crucible and hear it redhot if the powder do not change it be colour after trial it be certainly pure but on the contrary if there be any change or black speck in it then it have be adulterate the pruffian blue be next to ultramarine in beauty if it be ufe in oil though it be not agree on whether it will hold of well as the other parricularly as not have the body of the ultra marine the pruffian blue do not grind well in water becaufe there be fuch a oily quality in it that it do not mix kindly with water and at the beft will change as it be now prepare in the common way attempt have be make to make it blue ink which indeed have hold the colour for or two but then turn to muddy yel low and when you put you pencil with gum water into shell of this blue you will find that where the water pread the blue will turn yellowifh till the body of the colour be well firr up and after all that can be do with this colour in water it will only ferve to thade ultramarine with but in oil it may ferve very well for the prefent to fupply the place of ultramarine blue bice be colour of good brightness and the next to the pruffian blue it be alfo colour of good body and will flow pretty well in the pencil especially if it be well wath as be directed to be do of the white and minium saunder blue be alfo of very good ufe and may ferve as shade to ultramarine or the blue dice where the shade be not require to be very deep and be of itfelf pleafant blue to be lay between the light and shade of fuch fower as be of mazarine blue the laemus or litmus blue be another beautiful colour and will run in pen as free as ink be make of laemus or as some term it litmus which be fold at moff druggift fhop but as this colour be never to be meet with prepare for watercolour we therefore shall give the follow Ithod of prepare it accord to nir mariona take a ounce of lacmus and boil it in about pint of finallbeerwort till the colour be as ftrong as you would have it then pour off the liquor into gallipot and let it cool for ufe it will take become jelly and by degree will grow hard but this colour be to be open again and make liquid by water to as to be ufe in ink and will be either paler or darker as it be make thicker or thinner this afford bright colour and have extraordinary effect for it be not only beautis holding colour this colour if it be touch with aquafortis immediately change into fine crimfon little inferior to carmine and fink quite through the paper of as not to be get out to that when it be ufe as blue it be beft to keep it from aquafortis or fuch frong acid it be good fhade for ultramarine or blue bice where the ftrongeft shade should not be extremely deep and for colour of print it be very good as it be tranfparent colour and go great wave indigo biue make the tlrongeft fhade for bly of any other and be foft warm colour when it have be well ground and wath with gum water by means of ftone and muller it be make of what lightness you pleafe by put more gumwater to it and by how much the less gumwater be put to it the darker it will be before you afe it upon print it will be proper to try it upon dutch tile for it run warmly in the pencil and to perhaps may otherwife prove too hrong for you defign which be always to be take care of when flow colour be to be lay over the dark shade of print which hade will much heighten it be blackness and even make it appear quite black fine blue from mo . boyle take of the blue leave of rue and beat they little in ftonemortar with wooden peftle infufe they in water juice and all for fourteen day or more wath they every day till they be rotten and at laft beat they and the water together till they become pulp and let they dry in the fun this will produce as good blue as indigo and be much fofter but in order to keep it long time when you beat it the laft time add little powder gamarabic to it of which you may put more or . lef as you would have it more free or tenacious in the working this be a excellent blue for fhad have good body and run warm in the pencil transparent blue frem mo . boyle equal to uliramarine this be beautiful blue the chief ingredient of which be the

little alum to it you will have lafting tranfparent blue of as bright fland colour as can be defire fcarce inferior in beauty to ultramarine and very durable as for the outward ffowerleave which be much paler it be not certain that they will anfwer the end but some trial may be make whereby that may be know alfo let the flower be gathered about the beginning of june or in july or auguft but the preparation of the colour by out the middle deep blue flowerleave and preffing out the juice muft be do with all the ex pedition poffible or elfe they will lofe they perfection it be probable that if the leave of thefe blue cornbottleflower be cure in the fame manner as faffron be they would produce much greater body of colour from which tincture might be draw with more eafe than if preff raw or freth from the field in order to do this fuch kiln muft be prepare as be ufe for cure of affron in which may be make small charcoal fire that may communicate heat to the top of the kiln which be to be cover with haircloth upon this should be lay four or five fheet of white paper fuch as be ufe in canring of laffron afterwards parcel of the pick fower be to be lay on to the thickness of two or three inch lay they clofe and flat with knife and fprinkling they with fome gumwater then the cake of flower be to be cover with two or three sheet of paper and board with small weight lay on for few minute after which the board be to be take off and the cake of flower to be turn on the kiln take hold of all the papers with both hand and when it have be rightly place take off the upper papers and prinkle the cake second time with fome gumwater then fettle the cake again with knite let the papers be lay on as before with the board and weight for minute or two after which let the papers be turned again and again till the cake of flower become united and of the thickness of cake of faffron in this operation you will find the flower grow darker and darker every time they be turn till at length the cake will look of deep blue tend to black from whence tincture may be eafily during this operation great care should be take that the fire do not feorch the flower but that it be as conftant and gentle as poffible which will be fure way to bring the cake to good colour but it will not be improper for any perfon who shall undertake the cure of this cofour to confult the method of cure fatfron of which they may be inform either in treatife of the method of cure faffron write by mo . dauglas or in another by mo . brodly in he monthly treatife of hufbandry and gardening ch ap ix of black he proper black for watercolour be ivoryblack which if pure and well ground be of wfe in painting in miniature but it be not proper for colour print be too heavy colour and hide the beautiful flroke of the graver unlet do with great care however if it be neceffary to ufe black for the darkening print rather choofe frong tincture of good india ink than the ivory black but to colour piece in miniature ufe the ivoryblack prepare as follow grind the ivoryblack well in gunwater till you perceive kind of oily liquor fettle to the bottom this liquor mix with as much of the ivoryblack as you think will be proper to make it flow freely in the pencil and it will bear a extraordy nary glof and if the object be fhine fuch as the wing of come beetle mix withfome of it little white upon dutch glaze tile till you find it light enough to receive the fhade and then make another lighter mixture of the same which be ufe on the brighter part of the subject will produce the effect you defire of green reen be allow by all to depend upon the yellow and blue and any green colour whatever you pleafe may be make with they gamboge be one of the firft yellow which may be make to produce five or fix green with verdis grife accord as the gamboge be in the greater or leffer proportion if it abound it will make tolerable oak green and be mix with greater quantity of verdigrife it will make fine grais green but the yellow which some prefer before all other be make of french berry as already describe under the yellow which be either deeper or fainter as the liquor they be boil in be more or lef flain with they if it be very thin it make good glaze all over the verdigrife and as it approach nearer to dutch pink or gallfione command almoft any colour we want be agrecably mix with the tranfparent verdigrife and be fill tranfparent in like manner yellow draw from the root of harberry and alfo that draw from the root of the mulberrytree will in great mmeafure produce the like effect be mix with the tranfparent verdigrife as for the verdigrife itfelt it produce fine bluifh green flow eafy in the pencil and may even ferve as a ink to write with the way of prepare the tranfparent verdigrife be as follow take fix ounce of common verdigrife the diftil verdigrife not antwer this purpofe to well break it into little piece boil it gently in quart of whitewine virregary keep it continually fir and when you berceive it to boil add little tartar break and continue ftill to ftir it till you find the liquor of such colour as you would have it that be till it be of fine tranfparent green with bluiffi caft which you may know by dip in bit of white paper then pour it through linecloth into a open veffel and fet it to cool and when it be quite cold bottle it up for ufe remember to cork the bottle clofe for be expote to the air it will dry however it may be reduce again by comirion water this liquor should be touch upon part of the light and fhade of print and the fhade afterward coloured with fap green in the making of this green remember that it be flrong enough becaufe it can not be ftrengthened afterwards without the trouble of boiling it afresh but it may at any time he render as faint as you pleafe by mixing common water with it sap green be colour like that of a oakleaf if it he ufe thin with common water for this as well as the former want no sum but if if be ufe flrong it will produce as dark greeen as any it will be proper to try the colour firft upon white dutch tile and by thin it with water you may render it of what ftrength you pleafe and may brighten it very much by the addition of very little verdigrife there be two way of make fup green viz firff take the flower of blue fiag iris or fowerdeluce and press they while there be any juice to be get from they beil they gently in glaze pipkin till it grow thick add little alum to and it will make very ufeful and lafting breen you muft obferve this that in the boiling of any juice cot of the colour before mention you should always do it in a earthen pirk fior if it be boil in veffel of metal they will ofien time change it from the colour intend the second way to make fap green mp rij wath and illaminate of print be to take the juice of buckthornberry and though tha quice fimply will yield only dark purple of very bafe hue yet either of thefe colour will mix with the liquid verdigrife above mention and will make delicate flrade for it there be befide thefe another green which be admire by forme perfon that carry good body with it and degree of tranfparency too as it may be make but as it be commonly ufe be colour of full body and fit only for painting in miniature this be make by mixing dutch bink with indigo to what degree of colour you but the high preparation of french berrie with indigo be much to be prefer to dutch pink especially as this anfwer all the intention of dutch pink and carry tranfparency with it which the dutch pink have not ch xi the vse and nature of dry colour dlue bice be the moft excellent blue next to ultramarine which be too good to wash withal wherefore we leave it out here becaufe blue bice may do very well inftead of it and indeed both may be leave out fince small may be ufe inflead of they however it will not work to well as blue bice which without doubt be too to ufe upon all occafion only when you in = tend to beffow fome cofl and pain upon
