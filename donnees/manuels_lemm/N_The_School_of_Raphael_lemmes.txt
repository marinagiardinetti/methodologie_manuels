th school of raphael or the student s guide to expression in historical painting illustrate by example engrave by duchange and other under the inspection of sir as dorign from he own drawing after the most celebrate head in the carton at the queen s palace to which be now add the outline of each head and also several plate of the antique statue skeleton and anatomical figure most celebrate engrave by a eminent rti st . with instruction for young student in the art of design the pa ssion as characterise by raphael in the carton describe and explain by benjamin ralph london print for john boydell engraver in cheapside mdcclxxxii introduction it be usual for thé compiler of draw book not only to complain of thé ignorancé and in accuracy of all that have precede they but to raise new expectation without any sense of the danger of new disappointment the author of the follow sheet however intend not by depreciate the labour of other to procure that credit for he own which the same art of supplantation may as effectually destroy from fincere love for the art itself from desire of communicate the means of improvement to other and from well establish hope that the science of painting for in historical composition it be surely more than a art be revive in all its splendour in this island he have be induce to recommend the incomparabie example in this book and he be persuade they will contiibute to the proficiency of every one whose happy genius urge he to excel in study that not only lead to the knowledge of true beauty but direct the application of it to innumerable purpose of entertainment and use it be indeed at first determined to give only the outline and finish head with a explana tion of the character from consideration that such collection be peculiarly adapt to the use of painter or at least of those who have already attain to competent degree of excellence in the art but as no bound can be set to the genius of youth so no limit ought to be put to the means of improvement and in order to render this work useful to the learner as well as the proficient it be afterwards think necessary to prefix some example even of the rudiment of design as well as of those of the most elegant of the human form and to give with they the best instruction that could be collect and as it be undoubtedly true that the grecian and italian school be the only treasury of design from which could example be take with so much propriety as from the grecian statue and the work of raphael accordingly all the example have be take from they except the geometrical figure and the bone and muscle of the human body which be select from the work of those author that be esteem most correct to whom however no recourse would have be have if the subject could have be supply from the same source though no example of perspective be give yet it must not be infer that this omission of so useful part of science be occasion either by ignorance of the art itself or inattention to the just improvement of this work to the design of which the example of perspective be wholly foreign it be indeed complete study of itself and as such the practice of that incomparable method lay down by dr. brooke taylor and with great pain and ingenuity explain by mo . kirby be earnestly recommend the principal design of this work be to encourage the study of the most profound part of painting the characteristy of the passion in order to which the sacred history represent in the inimitable carton of raphael have be consider separately and the principal charac ter in each describe and refer to in the several head in the work and a index be give for find the paffion under they proper denomination refer to the description of each and also to the design of the character itself le brun the only author who have write on the passion as painter and give rule for describe they have certainly succeed very well so far as he go but he example instead of answer all the purpose of study appear upon compare they with those in the carton to be extremely defective nay it may be affirm that person who have only study le brun will be at loss when he view some of the character in the carton to know what paffion be ex press in they and yet the idea will be find to be in the highest degree exalt just and significant and he will be strike with astonishment and disgust when he return to he former study in which he will find no trace to lead he idea back to the point from which they first set out the carton be indeed vast fund of variety from which every man may enrich himself without diminish the heap or deprive those who come after he of they share of the inex haustible treafure bequeath to the whole world by that incomparable painter if therefofe the explanation of the carton should be find defective let it be remember that the attempt be new that the character describe be those of the holy jesus and he immediate follower who be the greatest and best of mankind and that the carton be the labour of the first genius in painting that have appear in the world since those of ancient greece of whose stupendous performance we have nothing leave but the name this author however he may be censure or ridicule for such a asfertion can not help say that collection of the passion as they be find in nature might be make from the work of mo . hogarth which would do honour to that master and prove of great utility to young student of the study of geometrical figure though this part of the work will undoubtedly be censure by those who be content with superficial knowledge of thé art of design yet the end propose will be suffici ciently answer if it meet with the approbation of the few let those who deride admo nition and chuse to wanton upon the surface of the stream float gently down it and divert they selve with the stick and weed with which they will be insensibly and inevitably entangle . error like straw upon the surface flow those who would search for pearl must dive below however it be not expect nor be it indeed necessary that perfect designer should be perfect geometrician but it be certainly expect that he should be acquainted with the form and con struction of the most simple geometrical figure which be in fact the basis of the art he would study to those therefore who would attain to masterly manner of design it be recommend to study carefully the figure describe in plate to make they familiar and to endeavour to imitate they form rather by the hand guide by judgment than the rule and compass for as fresnox judiciously observe the compass should ratber be in the painter eye than bis hand but as the true construction of these figure be easily attain it will probably argue either self suf ficiency or indolence not to be acquainted with

lave a attempt to shew with certainty how to draw that curve line which the author of the analysis of beauty have with as great propriety as authority term the line of beauty and upon the use and property of which he have oblige the world with very elegant ingenious and instructive treatise it have however be object that he have omit to give rule whereby the precise line of beatety may be find in consequence of which objection and in order to enforce the study of that line this figure be give not as mathematical demonstration nor as a insult upon the author of the analysis of beauty whose meaning be very obvious though perhaps not so fully explain as to silence the clamour of ignorance and detraction but as à line extremely well worth study be in itself simple elegant easily draw and the precise line of beauty describe by that great artist whose plain unaffected manner of refer to the most familiar object for the explanation of he idea we shall endeavour to follow and inform the reader that it be to be find in a ornament well know to every school boy that of six point star of which the contrast half of any two opposite point give the line require the explanation of the geometrical figure in the first plate the construction of the ninth figure divide circle into four equal part by the rule before give the semi diameter or the distance from to will if the figure be draw exactly be equal to one sixth part of the circumference set off therefore half the diameter from to and from to and keep the same distance from the point draw ec and from the point draw cd figure this figure be found upon precept say to be give by the celebrate michael angelo to he scholar marcus de scienna which accord to lomazzo be ee that he should always make figure et pyramidal serpent like and multiply by one two and threek which precept as the auchor of the analysis observe hath remain mystery down to this time and indeed it appear not only to be mysterious but absurd to talk of multiply by the number one be grof impropriety and that michael angelo should advise he scholar always to make figure pyramidal and serpentine and multiply by those number must be mistake for every figure in picture can not possibly admit of such rule for instance it be not to be preserve in figure sit or stoop and consequently michael angelo who well know the necessity of such attitude would never impose such stricture the truth be this famous precept have suffer the fate of many other excellent tradi tional rule before it come to lemazz who transcribe it as it be deliver to he content himself with the authority of the master and the ambiguity of the precept itself it be perhaps more rational to believe that michael angelo endeavour to persuade he pupil to accustom himself to draw figure or line which be pyramidal serpentine and increase in the proportion of one two and zbree as fure means of acquire habit of design the outline of tec human body in masterly manner and thereby as the author of the analysis term it always express the line of beauty and grace louazzo proceed to explain the forego precept thus in which precept in mine opinion the whole mysterie of the arte consisteth for the greatest grace and lise that pic ture can have be that it expresse motion which the painter call the spirite of picture nowe there be no forme so fitte to expresse this motion as that of the flame of fire which accord to aristotle and the other philosopher be a elemente most active of all other because the forme of the flame thereof be most apt for motion for it hath conus or sharpe pointe wherewith it seemeth to divide the aire that so it may ascende to he proper sphere so that picture have this forme will be most beautiful now this be to be understand after two forte either that the conus of the byramis be place upward and the base downwarde as in the fier or else contrary wise with the base up ward and the conus downwarde in the first it expresseth the width and largenesse of picture about the legge and garment below shew it slender above pyramidall wise by discover one shoulder and hide the other which be shortne by the turn of the body in the seconde it sheweth the figure biggest in the upper parte by represent either both the shoulder or both the arme shew one legge and hide the other or both of they after one sorte as the skilful painter shall judge fittest for he purpose so that he michael angelo s meaning be that it should resemble the forme of the letter place right or else turn the wronge way as because then it hath this beauty neither ought he only to observe this forme in the whole body but even in every part so that in the legge when muscle be rayse outwarde on the one side that which answereth directly on the contrary side must be draw in and hide as may be seene in the life the last parte of michael angelo he observation be that picture ought to be multiply by one two and three and herein consisteth the chiefest szill of that proportion whereof mean to intreate more at large in this book for the diameter of the biggest place betweene the knee and the fcote be double to the least and the largest part of the thigh triple in the observation on the art of painting of du fresnoy it be say that the outline which be in wave give not only grace to the part but also to the whole body as we see in the a see haydocke translation print at oxford see dryden s translation of du fresnoy s art of painting tinous explanation of the geometrical figure in the first plate tinous the venus of medicis and other and further it be say besides that the figure and they part ought almost always to have serpentine and flam form naturally these sort of out line have know not what of life and seem motion in they which very much resemble the be tivity of the flame and of the serpent elsum in he art of painting after he have quote the above precept of michael angelo have this remarkable passage but for as much as there be two sort of pyramid the one straight as be that near st. peter in rome call the pyramid of julius caesar the other waive like flame and be call michael angelo serpentine this latter also painter must imitate he contour must turn and wind like serpent it be presume that the tenth figure have all the property mention by the forego author it actually express motion as that of flame of streamer agitate by the wind be true represent ation of the decrease swell of wave and be consequently proper study for those who be emulous of excel in design the outline of the human body and though it may not carry with it suf ficient proof of its be the very precept of michael angelo it be hope the time which be bestow on its consideration will not be throw away the construction of the tenth figure upon the line draw circle cat pleasure take the diameter of that circle and from the cir cuiference of the circle upon the line ab draw thie circle which will be twice the diameter of then take the distance from the center cand and from the circumserence of the circle draw the circle which will be three time the diameter of the lesser circle and proceed to draw the curve in the same manner as describe in fig figure x i shew the manner of divide line into any number of equal part this figure will be find to be of great use in form square for drawing from picture whether they be to be enlarge or reduce and be construct in the follow manner draw ab the line propose and from draw the line at plcasure then set the com pass in cut the line ab and ad in ef and keep the same distance in the compass from cut the line ab at then take the distance ef and set it off from to draw the line bi upon which the line in the example be divide into eight part set off at pleasure seven equal part and do the same upon ad observe always to set off one part less than the number require draw line from the mark in to thole in ad and the line will be divide into eight equal part see elsum s art of painting after the italian manner print at london the art of design or draw the theory of design be the knowledge which be acquire by read the best author who have lay down rule for the attainment of the art scientifically and give they judgment upon the performance of the greatest painter by thorough knowledge of the theory of design those who be themselves unable to draw the most simple object may be qualified to pass sentence upon the work of the best master and in this case theory be separate from practice be usually con sider in another light and distinguished by the appellation of taste there be also another way of acquire taste without reading and that be by frequently examine good picture in the presence of such as be esteem judge of the art who seldom fail of give they opinion without reserve and thus accord to the portion of knowledge they possess and the understanding of those who be attentive to they decision theory or taste may be obtain in greater or lesser degree theozy therefore in this sense of the word have hitherto be the great support of painting have tafte be confine to practical study only so many noble and invaluable piece would not now have be find in the palace of prince and the house of great man whose avocation could not per haps otherwise permit they to acquire any taste at all for this art and consequently painting would have find no patronage the practical part of design be the constant application of the hand assist by the understanding in the imitation of variety of form those object whether person or place of which we have but transient view be in the memory like sketch make with charcoal upon paper which either the slightest rub or blast of wind will entirely deface how then shall the hand unaecustomed to exercise in this art perform its function when the mind itself after the object have be remove from before it short time can retain only confused idea of its resemblance theory and practice therefore ought to be in separable and the knowledge of either without its affociate can never produce any thing like per fection from what have be already say it be obvious that draw consider only as such be nothing more than a habit by which the hand be accustom to follow the trace of the eye convey upon paper or other material the similitude of object and can only be obtain by unwearied ap plication and great attention by practice the hand acquire facility which give freedom and this frecdom must constantly be correct by judgment in place every particular part in the object to be delineate in its proper order it must be observe that judgment be not here mean to be that exertion of the understand ing which would be requisite to compose a historical picture or well imagine landschape but re late only to proportion or a accurate consideration of the distance of one feature limb or part from another it be no unusual thing for such as draw very well practically to be utterly inca pable of compose or invent which ought to be with more propriety ascribe to genius the manual part of design consist in two operation outline and relief the first of these with regard to buman figure comprehend anatomy and proportion the second light and shadow and these be produce by batch with chalk pen and ink and black lead or wash with indian ink bistre proportion and relief be also absolutely necessary in other part of design as landschape orna ment the necessary material for design be charcoal red black and white chalk indian ink bistre black lead pencil crow quill pen and camel hair pencil the the charcoal should be choose with fine grain such as will mark freely and may be discharge easily by brush it either with feather or silk handkerchief it be of great use in sketch or mark ing out the general idea of the figure or part to be design and the stroke be easily efface the draw may by degree be bring to its due proportion and be afterwards more ccrrectly finish with either of the chalk it have be already say of what importance the geometrical figure in plate be to the art ofde signing let thiem therefore be carefully study and frequently draw even while the student think himself qualified to proceed further for as confinement to dry study often create disgust it be rather recommend to the learner to blend the practice of they with the most easy example in the other plate let not the student be deter from proceed by the appearance of difficulty what be think unsurmountable may be conquer by repeat trial and the wonder will be that it should ever have appear in so discouraging light it will be sound extremely advantageous to hold the port crayon or other instrument something more than two inch from the bottom for freedom be the very essence of design begin rather with part than whole figure a attempt to draw the figure of man by one who be unable to mark the outline of head will be unsuccessful and such a effort instead of applause will certainly meet with contempt proceed therefore with design the different feature of the face and each of they in different position and when these can be perform with accuracy it will be proper to begin with whole head the example of the oval for draw the face and head in plate should now be carefully con sider and fig xiv in that plate be a example of a head accord to the most exact propor tion the oval be divide by perpendiculaf line from top to bottom and that line into four equal part the upper division describe the space from the top of the head to the lowest hair upon the forehead the next division pass between the eyebrow and eyelid and not through the eye as have be erroneoussy teach from thence to the bottom of the third division be the length of the nose and the fourth contain the mouth and chin this last be again divide into three equal part the first of which shew the space from the bottom of the nose to the middle of the mouth the second contain the under lip and the space between that and the chin and the chin fill the third part of the lower division of the face the length of the eye be reckone one fifth part of the breadth of the face which be also the breadth of the nose from the extremity of each nostril and the mouth be nearly of the same measure the ear be of the same length with the nose observe therefore to place every feature properly let the nose be set directly under the center of the forehead and the middle of the mouth exactly under that of the nose place the eye upon line that there may appear no distortion and be careful that the eye and mouth be parallel to each other of three quarter face and profile there be many fine example in this book and therefore little more need be say of they it have be sometimes recommend to provide piece of box turn in the shape of a egg to mark off the several division upon it and by turn it various way to observe the different appearance of the line but it would be much better to try the same experi ment with small plaster head which may be more easily procure and will certainly answer the purpose much better the student have frequently and carefully design the head and its part may now turn he attention to the other extremity of the human body which be the hand and foot these have ever be esteem difficult part of design and various author consider they as almost al way ap pear foreshorten have give they proportion and lay down rule for draw they under those appearance but these it be apprehend be so many fetter to the understanding and stumble block in the way of genius cautious judgment should be we conductor the eye hardly ever see they in any other situation and it be by the eye the hand should be guide the hand must mark nothing but what the eye direct and the eye can discern no part but what the docile hand may delineate in its proper place in short strict attention to nature or good imitation of she will always lead to truth and elegance and if the design of any subject whatever happen not to be per fect when finish we observation must have be erroneous and nothing remain but by repeat effort to amend those part which the judgment will discover to be incorrect the forego study will naturally lead to the arm trunk and thigh of all which several ele gant example may be find in plate iii iv and in plate be two view of the celebrate torso of michael angelo of which no greater recommendation can be give than that it be the chief study of the great painter and sculptor whose name it bear it will next be proper to attempt design whole figure and as this depend in great mea sure upon proportion as the foundation of symmetry it may not be impertinent to give the meafure of the human body accord to the rule lay down by mon du pile in he observation on fre noy s art of paiut the measure of human body the ancient have commonly allow eight head to they figure though some of they have but seven but we ordinarily divide the figure into ten face . that be to say from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot in the follow manner from the crown of the head to the forehead be the third part of the face the face begin at the root of the lowest hair which be upon the forehiead and end at the bottom of the chin the face be divide into three proportionable part the first contain the forchead the second the nose and the third the mouth and chin from the chin to the pit betwixt the collar bone be two length of nose from the pit betwixt the coilar bone to the bottom of the breast one face from the bottom of the breast to the navel one face from the navel to the genitory one face from the genitory to the upper part of the knee two face the knee contain half face from the lower part of the knee to the ancle two face from the ancle to the sole of the foot half face man when he arm be stretch out be from the longest finger of he right hand to the longest of he left as broad as he be long from one side of the breast to the other two face the bone of the arm call bumerus be the length of two face from the shoulder to the elbow from the end of the elbow to the root of the little finger the bone call cubitus with part of the hand contain two face from the box of the shoulder blade to the pit betwixt the collar bone onè face if you would be satisfied in the measure of breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other so that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body you must observe that the box of the elbow with the bumerus and of the bumerus with the shoulder blade bear the pro portion of half face when the arm be stretch out the sole of the foot be the sixth part of the figure the hand be the length of face the thumb contain nose the inside of the arm from the place where the muscle disappear which make the breast call the pectoral muscle to the middle of the arm four nose from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand five nofe the longest toe be nose long the two outmost part of the teat and the pit betwixt the collar bone of woman make a equilateral triangle for the breadth of the limb no precise measure can be give because the measure they selve be changeable accord to the quality of the person and accord to the movement of the muscle the forego rule strongly impressed upon the memory will prove of infinite advantage as well in compare the proportion of the antique statue with one another as in judge of the different production of nature in the formation of the human body when consider in design ing from the life but as variety in composition be absolutely necessary care must be take that too strict a observance of the above measure may not destroy it nor will the subject always this depend on the age and quality of the person the apollo and venus of medicis have more than ten face see the figure the apollo bas nose more see flate fig xiv plate x and xi the apollo have half nose more and the upper balf of the venus de medicis be to the lewer part of the belly and not to the privy part allow that the figure should preserve the same proportion which the ingenious author of the analysis of beauty have in he chapter of proportion very judiciously remark in he observation upon the celebrate statue of the apollo belvederex in the follow word may be can not throw stronger light on what have be hitherto say of proportion than by animadverting on remarkable beauty in the apollo belvedere which hath give it the pre ference even to the antinous mean super addition of greatness to at least as much beauty and grace as be find in the latter these two master piece of art be see together in the same apartment at rome where the antinous fill the spectator with admiration only whilst the apollo strike he with surprise and as traveller expref themselves with a appearance of something more than human which they of course be always at loss to describe and this effect they say be the more astonishing as upon examination its disproportion be evident even to common eye one of the best sculptor we have in england who lately go to see they confirm to I what have be now say particularly as to the leg and thigh be too long and too large for the upper part and andrea sacchi one of the italian painter seem to have be of the same opinion or he would hardly have give he apollo crow pasqualini the musician the exact proportion of the antinous in famous picture of he now in england as otherwise it seem to be direct copy from the apollo although in very great work we often see a inferior part neglect yet here it can not be the case because in fine statue just proportion be one of its essential beauty therefore it stand to reason that these limb must have be lengthen on purpose otherwise it might have easily be avoid so that if we examine the beauty of this figure thoroughly we may reasonably conclude that what have be hitherto think so unaccountably excellent in its general appearance hath be ow to what hath seem blemiss in part of it but let we endeavour to make this matter as clcar as possible as it may add more force to what have be say statue by be bigger than life sas this be one and larger than the antinous always gain some nobleness in effect accord to the principle of quantity but this alone be not sufficient to give what be properly to be call greatness in proportion here the author refer to two figure of dwarf or lilliputian in the print give with he book and proceed with say that be they to be draw or carve by scale of ten foot high they would still be but pigmy proportion as on the other hand figure of but two inch may represent gigantic height therefore greatness of proportion must be consider as depend on the application of quantity to those part of the body where it can give more scope to its grâce in movement as to the neck for the larger and swan like turn of the head and to the leg and thigh for the more ample sway of all the upper part together object be greater or less by comparison there be no other way of convey the idea of giant than by comparison he must be accom pany by one or more figure of the same proportion but they must be draw upon lesser scale but if to a extraordinary stature it should be requisite to add superior strength it must be do as the before mention author ingeniously observe by judicious exaggeration of particular part of the body the farnesian hercale be fine example of uncommon bodily strength see plate vii it be entirely ow to the neglect of compare object that particular view of mountain rock and lake of water be almost generally deficient the tree building vessel and figure which be necessarily introduce with the principal object be usually draw in much greater proportion than they ought to be and this error never fail to destroy the effect de sired that which be intend to represent stupendous mountain convey the idea of paltry hill huge rock appear like inconsiderable heap of stone and vast lake of water be diminish to the size of ordinary fish pond the knowledge of anatoux be the basis of design the truth of this affertion be clearly prove by mon du pile who in he principle of paint ing say as it be in vain to desire to profit by bare sight of fine thing if we do not well conceive they so it be impossible thoroughly to understand the beauty of the antique any more than truth in nature without the help of anatomy we may indeed by secing and design the antique acquire certain greatness of design and in the main get practice tend to good taste and delicacy but these advantage if void of knowledge and principle can only dazzle the spectator by specious shew and by ill place remembrance of thing man may be in rapture on see the fine work of antiquity and yet be far from know the genuine source of those beauty which he admire at least if he be ignorant of that fundamental part of design anatomy if then anatomy be the basis of design and enable we to discover the beauty of the antique can not but observe that the knowledge of so much of it as the painter and sculp tor require be easily retain and that the neglect of this attainment proceed only from its be think to lead towards driness of design and pedantry of manner anatouy be knowledge of the part of the human body but to painter that only which relate to the bone and the principal muscle which cover they be needful nature have furnish we with bone for the solidity of the body and strength of the mem ber to they she have fix the muscle as exterior agent to draw they whither she please the bone determine the measure of length and the muscle those of bigness in the part of nature at least it be the office of the muscle to settle the form and exactness of outline tis indispensably necessary to be well acquainted with the form and joint of the bone because motion often alter they measure and likewise to understand the situation and office of the mus cle since the most strike truth in design depend upon they the bone themselves be motionless and stir only by the help of the muscle the muscle have they origin and insertion by they origin they be fasten to bone which they be never intend to stir and by they insertion to another bone which they draw when they please towards they origin every muscle have its opposite muscie when one act the other yield like well bucket one of which descend as the other come up the act muscle swell and contract next to its origin the other that obey s dilate and relax the largest bone which be move with the greatest difficulty be covcre with the largest tmuscle these be often aid by other which be design for the samc office and there by increase the force of motion and make the part more apparent we often observe in the naked part of antique figure and even in nature itself certain swell the reason of which we can not discover without consider the situation and office of the muscle which be the cause of they eut those who be skilful in anatomy see all in see part and know how to remove from the eye what the skin and fat seem to conceal and what be hide to those who be ignorant of this science as the knowledge of anatomy be absolutely necessary for the attainment of perfection in design very particular attention to the example of the bone and muscle in plate vi vii viil and ix be recommend when the student have acquire tolerable habit of design and also make himself equally conversant with the bone and muscle it will be find of the utmost advantage in draw the human body to sketch out in the first place the ofteology or skeleton of the figure in its pro per proportion and in the attitude require which may be do either from print painting or nature itself the next operation will be to delineate the proper muscle mark each do tinctly in its place in bold manner after which the figure will probably appear over charge with muscle and now it will be of the utmost importance to recollect the idea of the wave line which be describe in plate fig for it will be only by thorough comprehension of the use of that line that the draw will appear to be well or ill execute when sinish the skilful in anatomy know that where the insertion of the muscle appear too hard and over charge and the hollow too deep which be always the case in prepare muscular figure that nature have wisely contrive to remedy the defect and fill up those vacancy by place therein certain quantity of fat which soften the harshneis and inequality of the line and produce that inexpressible grace which be always find in the outline of well proportion body and which have be so happily imitate by the ancient as naked figure can not be introduce with any propriety except in some particular subject where there be a absolute necessity for they it become matter of the greatest importance to cloath they gracefully it will now therefore be proper to give some rule por design oe drapery the gradation before recommend for design naked figure by begin with the osteology may with equal propriety be apply to the design of drapery for as that method will be sound of the utmost utility for place the muscle correctly so first design the figure naked and afterwards proceed to cast the drapery will be find in this point equally beneficial it will not be necessary to finish with that exactness which be require for such as be intend to remain in that state but the just proportion be give and the part boldly mark the mistake that be find in the performance of those who proceed with less caution will be prevent the best author who have treat upon the manner of design drapery concur in enfore the utility of this method it will also be necessary in design drapery to observe the follow precept carefully avoid overcharge the figure with a unnecessary quantity shew as much of the form of the body under it as possible where large drapery be requisite throw they into few fold but let those be large and graceful on the contrary loosen those from the body which be close and short by small fold judicioussy place which will take off that stiffness which would be the consequence of they sitting too strait when much drapery be necessary let the greater part of it fif convenient be throw into shadow observe to give tender shadow to those fold which fall in the light that the hollow part may not appear too deep and cut let the fold be well contrast and avoid strait line as much as possible make the fold contrast the body and limb judicious repetition of fold in circular form contribute greatly to characterise fore shorten limb the drapery of figure move with great activity should play as if agitate by the wind but that in proportion only to the velocity with which the figure appear to move on the contrary in fixt attitude keep the drapery still ii numberless example of fine drapery may be find in print after the great master but none be fitter to be consult than those of the carton let they be design carefully and the artist will be better enable to cast they himself in true taste when he afterwards make design from real drapery when the student have make considerable progress and be able to copy picture draw or print with freedom and exactness let he proceed to finish he study by consider the a tique and nature the collection of cast from the antique statue at the royal academy for painting and sculpture be accessible to the ingenious it will be necessary to conclude with one useful caution let the student be careful how he study the statue let he remember that the best of they be only memorial of the intense application of those great artist whose life be spend in eadeavour to express they own idea of perfection which varied accord to the different genius or taste of each master and the different nature of the material he wring upon and that those performance which come nearest to nature be the best and let it be further remember that design correctly make after the finest statue will never convey any other idea than that of statue there be stiffness inse parable from marble or plaster which be convey to and infallibly distinguishes the design make after they from those make after nature and that stiffnef should be avoid with the ut most care and assiduity description of the carton of raphael urbin when man enter into that awsul gallery at hampton court ssay mo . richardson in he essay on the theory of painting he find himself amongst fort of people superior to what he have ever see and very probably to what those really be indeed this be speak of grace and greatness the principal excellence of those wonderful picture as it must be al low to be that part of painting which be preferable to all other these inimitable piece be call carton from they be execute upon paper and be nothing more than coloured drawing upon wash ground previously prepare for that purpose the shadow of which be make by hatch with the point of large pencil and the whole be very highly finish they be originally intend as pattern for tapestry and be entirely the work of that great master raphael urbin it be almost impossible to consider these picture without supposing that as the miraculous draught of fishie be the only miracle of we saviour to be find among they it be more than probable that what this country now happily possess be but part of most stu pendous work of this great man and that many more glorious carton of the life and miracle of we saviour have perish in oblivion for it can hardly be conceive that this single subject could particularly engage the attention of raphael among many other which would undoubt edly have make better picture and be more suitable to he genius and the carton of christ s charge to peter and the regular succession of the act of the apostle seem greatly to confirm this opinion however as it be a argument that probably will not be contest and can not be prove it can only be lament that perhaps some accident or the premature death of that great master have deprive the world of a invaluable treafure carton the miraculous draught of fish and jesus say unto simon fear not from benceforth thou shalt catch man laujke ch .. be a amazing event but as the principal person be few and half of they necessarily engage in the management of they nets the historical expression be confine to three figure only which be those of we saviour peter and jame the principal figure in this picture be christ who be pronouncing the word above quote in order to remove the apprehension of peter who in fine posture of supplication have just utter these word depart from I for am sinful man lord we saviour s figure and action be per fectly great and graceful and in he character divinity benignity and tenderness be express ed in the highest degree in peter s countenance fear wonder and solicitude be blend in most extraordinary manner and compose character of expression worthy of raphael the figure in the same boat suppose to be that of jame be also finely imagine and draw awe and attention be strongly mark in he face and he seem by he action to have acquiesc in the supplication of peter as acknowledge himself unworthy of be the companion of di vinity ithe rest of the figure as have already be say be chiefly concerned in attend to description of the they employment which as they be in another vessel naturally engross they attention only the nearest of they seem to have catch some part of the conversation and appear to listen this last figure and another who be pull up the net be finely draw contrast and foreshorten and the whole figure of the old man in the stern of the boat who be very attentive the he businéss be extremely fine the perspective in this carton in which the point of sight be place pretty high occasion the sea to make fine back ground for the figure which from its natural hue fail not of shew the colour of the figure to the utmost advantage at great distance upon the sea shore appear several groupe of figure design in masterly manner the principal of which seem to consist of number of person who be employ in the baptism of infant nothing need be say to the objection commonly make by small critic to the size of the boat that have be fully answer by mo .

receive some injury and be not at present what raphael make it this supposition it be believe have never be contradict and whoever attentively compare the taste of design in this figure with those of the apostle in the same carton or that of we sa viour in the miraculous draught of fish must be convinced that it fall many degree short of that great painter perhaps by some who may contend for its be raphael it may be urge that like leonardo do vinci in fimilar case he be baffle by thie greatness of he own idea but whichever argument hold good we must be content to take it as it appear mo . ri chardson also observe that the time choose be the moment of we lord have just spo ken and that in consequence of we saviour interrogate peter lovest thou I more than these the rest of the apostle be eager to reply to that question by assure they lord that they love for he be at least equal to peter and this solicitude be finely express in every character the next principal figure be that of peter who accord to the history be re present upon he knee with the utmost humility attend to and receive the charge give he by he divine master the head be dravn in profile and the face be entirely in shadow it may be here observe that the shadow cast by peter s body serve admirably to bring the figure of we saviour forward and also to keep the principal groupe together the third princi pal figure be st . john whose expression and attitude mo . richardson mention as a improve mient upon the story he say we saviour by command peter to feed he sheep seem to indicate preference in favour of that apostle as have be observe and that st . john who be the beloved disciple may therefore be suppose to have be under particular con cern on that account accordingly he appear to address himself to we lord with extreme be dour as if earnestly endeavour to convince he of the sincerity of he love the atten tion of all the apostle be direct to we saviour except one who seem to press forward and by turn he liead which be see between two profile hinder the repetition which would have unavoidably happen if he have be look the same way the head of the apostle be amazingly design and full of expression and they attitude be finely varied and con trast thé drapery be noble and well cast that of we saviour only appear to be rather heavy and unsuitable to he at this time as be after he resurrection but admit that this figure have suffer the injury may in this particular be attribute to the alteration of it by some other hand mo richardson who have study the carton observe that the small piece of drapery in part of the garment of the outermost apostie be of great consequence to this picture which be fold as under he arm breal the strait line of a unplcasing maf of light and give more graceful form to the whole which artifice be also assist by the boat of the same consequence to the principal figure be the flock of ffieep place behind which help to break the line of the drapery detach the figure from its ground and illustrate the history carton iii the lame man heal commonly call the beautiful gate of the templ es then peter say silver and gold babe none but fuch as

great composition be divide into three distinct groupe by means of the magnificent column which appear in the front of the picture and be part of the co lonade which support the roof of the portico the two apostle peter and john the cripple and four figure whose head only be see compose the groupe in the centre one side of the picture be fill with people go to the temple and its opposite with other come from it which disposition raphael have advantageously employ in contrast these two subordinate groupe by oppose the back of some of the figure to other which be see in front and further con trast these by several which be in profile there be not perhaps in the world picture so thoroughly characterise or so artfully manage as this carton the moment of peter s have pronounce the word in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk be the time choose by raphael and be the instant when the lame man find himself suddenly enable to rise when the muscle of he limb release from the contraction which till now with hold and deprive he of they use be expand and a extraordinary impulse urge he to the exertion of they hitherto useless function all which be most amazingly conceive and express at this period those who be apprize of something extraordinary which be then transact be endeavour to thrust forward on the side of the picture where the cripple be place and these with woman and boy who be hastily pass on to the temple together with the inimitable boy in the front of the picture who be eagerly pull back one of the figure remarkably characterise the princi pal subject of the carton which be that of the agent of divine power give strength and agility to the torpid limb of the man who be bear lame wonder and amazement be finely express in the character of the spectator and on the side of the picture next to peter who with great dignity have confer the divine gift every thing be still but expresl silent amazement thus in the part where dignity should be preserve all be quiet and where strength and activity be give every thing be in motion the character of the cripple be sinely imagine it be persectly that of mean person and the expression of joy and gra titude which appcar in it be finely balance by mixture of doubt and astonishment and he seem scarcely to believe the reality of the bless he be receive the character of peter be devout and majestic jfand that of john be full of divinity and superlatively graceful he be represent with the utmost pity and affability concur with peter in this act of true piety and charity the rest of the head in the same groupe be finely invent and draw particu larly that of the old man lean upon he crutch jand of he who be look over john s shoulder iit be remarkable that the same air of the head which raphael have give to the two apostle be nearly the same with those of the man and woman on that side of the picture and the action of peter s arm be repeat in the same man with very little variation he have also introduce another cripple into this groupe whose character be not altogether uilike that of he who be heal but the expression be of another kind and shew malevolence and disinclination to believe the truth of this miracle which seem to be one reason why he be place behind the apostle as à situation most properly adapt to one of he way of think but this figure be of prodigious use and be moreover fine eontrast to the other and the repetition in the rest be so judicioussy manage that it have no ill effect but of this groupe particular notice will be take in speak of the by work or ornament of this carton there be wonderful expression of malignity in the character of the man who press he lip with he singer in the same groupe the woman with the child in she arm have character full of expression be exquisitely design and perfectly great and graceful ithe fine boy in the fore part of the picture who be unconcerned be eager to be go and pull the man s garment be à fine contrast to the figure of the cripple and at the same time break mass of shiadow which would otherwise have have very disagreeable effect this boy be also con trast by another who be lead along hastily by woman with basket upon she head ff and these as have already be observe give motion to that side of the picture the drapery upon this woman s arm be artsully swell and fold towards the elbow and break the straitness which would have appear from she action and could not but have offend the eye it will now be proper to speak of the ornament and other accidental decoration which be usually call bye work the principal of these be the column which with regard to the picture be the finest that could possibly be imagine and in themselves be proof of the amazing genius of raphael the effect of the wave line as a ornament be perhaps no where make use of to such advantage nor better prove its gracefulness to confirm this assertion let any one substitute in they stead or ideally substitute the lonic or corinthian or any other order and let it be enrich with fluting and all the decoration that can possibly be give to those order and then compare it with raphael what a astonishing alteration must ensuel how cut how disagreeably heavy will the innovation appear and how very considerably must the picture suffer by the change besides as the column be arbitrary and the painter have once deviat from the establish rule he be at liberty to do what he pleased and therefore raphael have apparently make use of this licence for the purpose sollow lt be doubtless necessary that the principal groupe should not only possess the centre of the picture but occupy more space than the other in order to maintain its character of distinction from the subordinate one in consequence of which raphael have make the intercolumination greater between the first and second column than be tween the second and third part of which be cut off by the side of the picture this be allow it will not be difficult to give what be apprehend will be think sufficient reason for the repetition before mention and why the same number of figure nearly in the same attitude the cripple except be introduce into this groupe it be certain that if this part of the picture have be otherwise manage than it be by too great variation in the attitude from those of the principal groupe the inequality of the intercolumniation would have be more apparent and consequently every common observer would have take the liberty of condemn it as a oversight in raphael the great artifice therefore be concéale in the similitude of the figure which compose these groupe the same number be employ in both in the principal groupe the whole figure of the cripple be see in the other the body be large but be upon he knee he leg be hide by the columin and the space occupy by he hand and arm which rest upon staff be by no means equivalent to the room gain by the disappearing of he leg and yet this staff and limb seem to fill up the space the distance from the knee of the cripple to the column be greater than that between the foot of the lame man and the sume column and boch be near the ground line or front of the picture cause great deception he woman witl the child in she arm be similar to john but she be place much nearer thie column jolin arm be employ in hold the child and consequently do not appear and light well fald piece of drapery supply the place and form mass which receive the shadow part of the cripple s head and body the man be in a attitude similar to that of eter but the column be place so as to be partly hide by he hand by which he express he astonissment falls exactly in the centre between the two column as do that of peter in the principal groupe but lest this should be too remarkable the hand of the woman be see close by it naturally and grace fully apply to she breast and this with the infant s head make sufficient variation and do not in the least destroy the principal intention it be absolutely necessary to introduce the whole arm of the figure of the man and the hand be to be place in the centre the arm be un avoidably require to be bend rather more than that of peter but this be not sufficient vari ation and therefore kind of short open sleeve which reach about half way down to the elbow be add and this also produce another variation to carry on this artifice in every part raphael judge it expedient to have the same number of figure in each groupe but whercas in the principal one there be three head between that of john and the column and none be tween that of he and peter so in this there appear but part of one between the woman and the column and the other three be place in the space between the man and woman the same artifice be also finely keep up in the distant colonade where in the same space two row of the same column appear in perspective and by they contrast occasion the distance between the column on the opposite side to appear larger than it really be in short this carton be altogether the most consummate picce of art that probably ever be or ever will be produce carton iv the death of ananias but peter jaid ananias wby bath satan fill thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land whilst it remain be it not thine cwne and after it be sell be it not in thine ovn power à why hast thou conceive this thing in thine heart à thou bast not lie unto man but unto god and ananias kear these word fall down and give up the ghoft and great fear come on all that hear these thing act chap ver all the various way ordain by the almighty for put period to the present exist ence of human nature there be none so affect or alarming as the stroke of sudden death whenever therefore this happen it appear more or less terrible to those who survive accord to the state of the soul at that moment when it be separate from the body the death of ananias be therefore subject capable of exciting horror in a extraordinary de gree supposing it to have be only common accident but the circumstance of he death be much more terrifying as it be manifestation of the divine wrath upon he who have not lie unto man but unto god this alarming event happen at time when the mind of the peo¬ ple be fill with the amazing thing which they both see and hear when universal benevo lence possess the heart of those who adhere to the doctrine teach by the apostle there fore such a event must have strike those who be witness to it with horror and reverence with detestation of the act itself and with reverential awe for the apostle whose fore knowledge of the fraud practise by ananias make he openly accuse he in the word above mention raphael have tell this story in manner worthy of he sublime genius and the time choose be so very evident that it need not be mention this carton be compose of three distinct groupe and ananias be the principal figure but it require no less than the profound skill of this great master to make he appear so the figure be prostrate by necessity must have appear to some disadvantage have the spectator be all stand even though they have inclined as much as the two man who be stoop over he ra phael therefore have most judiciously give all the figure in the fore part of the picture such atti tude as at once persectly correspond with the story and make the figure of ananias more conspicu we accordingly the subordinate figure be all either kneel or stoop and these at the same time give a inexpressible dignity to the apostle who be stand and form distinct groupe in the middle of the back part of the picture in the centre of which peter be place who be describe as have just pronounce the accusation the whole figure of ananias be inimitably fine but the expression in he character be amazing there appear to be strongly mark in the feature not only the stroke of death as corporcal suffering but the agony of wounded conscience à from which immediately proceed the writh contorsion of the body and limb the very extremi tie of which appear to be contract and convulse the character of peter be also finely ima¬ gine and design there be holy severity in he countenance which be inexpressibly great he attitude be majestié and though he situation be something remote it be impossible to avoid see that he be the second principal figure in the picture the whole groupe of apostle be character of great dignity each seem collect within himself and revolve upon this terri ble catastrophe and one of they who be next to peter appear with reverential awe to address himself to the almighty and be fine character horror fear and amazement be blend in the character of the man who be oppose to ananias who by he situation and attitude appear also to be render up he goods to the apostle and possibly be intend for jose call barnabas who be mention in the latter part of the precede chapter and this figure make the finest contrast imaginable to that of the die man the woman next to he do cover she terror in manner perfectly adapt to she sex as well as the circumstance of the story she féar compel she to turn round the natural preparative for flight and this occasion she figure to contrast that of the man before describe in fine manner the character of john who be very properly employ in relieve the necessitous person who compose part of one of the subordinate groupe be extremely graceful compassion and benevolence be strongly express in he coutenance ** and he action discover that he not only relieve they with money but likewise bestow with it he advice and appear to exhort they to make proper use of it the apostle who seem to beckon to some who be suppose to be out of the picture to bear testimony of the punishment inflict on ananias be character of great dignity and he attitude be finely varied from that of peter s yf the drapery in this carton be perfectly fine and extremely well cast particularly those of the apostle which be remarkably graceful and the fold finely dispose and contrast that of ananias require particular observation he have less than any other figure in the picture he arm leg and foot be entirely naked this possibly to some may appear absurd but it be fine artifice the violent agitation of the muscle be thereby make apparent and the limb of the figure near he be mostly cover serve to shew he figure more distinctly and of course help to discover its consequence in short the whole composition of this picture be perfectly great and strike and be remarkable instance of the genius of raphael in the carton of the lame man heal there be luxury of fancy display in the ornament with which it be enrich in this its grandcur dignity and effect be totally derive from the invention and disposition of the charac ter ornament there be none and the bye work be extremely plain and agreeable to the sim plicity of the church of christ in its infant state the chief of they be the curtain which be behind the apostle it be indeed simple but then it be finely fold and serve admirably to break the straight line which be make by the head of the apostle which without this help must have appe red somewhat disagreeably the back ground be also artfully varied and relieved by a opening on one side and flight of step with figure ascend they on the other carton of raphael urbin elyma the sorcerer strike with blindnef nd nou behold the hand of the lord be upon thee and thoit shalt be blind not see the light of the sun for à season and immediately there fall on he mist and darknef and be go about seek some to lead bim by the hand act chap xin ver terror and astonishment be strongly express in this picture yet it appear of different kind and produce different effect from that in the carton of the death of ananias the punishment of elyma be to he dreadful and grievous and to the beholder terrifying and wonderful but be apparently consider by they no otherwise than as it relate to this instance of the divine judgment inflict on he the death of ananias inspire horror also not without mixture of pity for the sufferer who before the discovery of he crime be probably esteem as good and devout man on the contrary the sorcerer be person of whom it may reasonably be judge the people stand in awe and that he be rather fear on account of he power than beloved for he virtue this will evidently appear when the manner in which raphael have tell this story be consider every one of the spectator discover terror and surprise but none except one of the lictor who stand near the proconsul discover the least expression of pity elyma though in the midst of number appear to be alone and he extend he arm in vain seek some to lead he by the hand nor do the admirable figure who stand between he and the proconsul and who with the utmost amazement look stedfastly in he face seem inclinable to offer he the least assistance indeed there be but few of the spectator who appear to give any attention at all to he the majority of they be employ either in relate or attend to the relation of the punishment inflict upon he elyma who be the principal figure in this picture accord to the observation of mo . richardson be blind from head to foot and be altogether most inimitable character perhaps raphael hardly ever conceive one more expressive and though this great master think proper to assist the understanding by make the subordinate figure more fully explain the principal subject yet this figure be alone sufficient to have do it deject arrogance be amazingly describe in he character together with that shame and confusion which must natu rally have appear in it when he feel the irresistible force and superiority of the divine power he attitude be also extremely fine and can only be thoroughly understand by view the picture itself or good copy or print after it the apostle paul be the next principal figure he be place opposite to the sorcerer and be represent with one arm extend as have just de nounce sentence upon he to the execution of which with look of holy satisfaction he seem to demand the proconsul s attention he be likewise distinguished by book which he hold under the other arm in he character which appear in prosile the expression be awful and maiestic he whole figure be finely imagine and draw full of dignity and perfectly graceful the next be the proconsul sergius paulus who be more affect than any of the spectator terror and astonishment be express in he countenancet and evidently discover that he feel the force and be sensible of the equity of the divine judgment but it appear in manner perfectly become he character and he sit amazed at the punishment of elyma and convinced of the truth of the doctrine preach by the holy apostle the apostle barnabas who stand be hind the sorcerer be employ in explain he fate to those who by they situation must necessarily be ignorant of it as be place behind he which he be represent as do with great zeal and energy ithe man who stand between elyma and the proconsul be prodigieusly fine he be indeed all amazement and attention and in he character there be express mixture of doubt and a eagerness to discover whether the sorcerer s blindness be real or not the man whose head appear between that of paul and the side of the picture be also full of expression he be apparently believer which be shew by fine mixture of fear and devotion in description of the he countenance there be likewise great expression in the lictor who stand upon the step and also in the rest of the character which compose this picture the drapery in general be extremely fine particularly that of paul which be noble well cast and fold that of the forcerer be also finely imagine and suitable to bis character the scenery or back ground of this carton be magnificent and well adapt it will be sufficient to say that in order to break the stiffnef of unilormity raphael have take some liberty in the architecture which produce a effect that make ample amend for any seem irregularity carton vi paul and barnabas at lystra and there sit certain man at lystra impotent in bis foot be cripple from bis mother womb wbo never have walk the same hear paul speak who stedfastly beholding bim and perceive that be have faith to be beal say with loud voice stand upright on thy foot and he leap and walk and when the people see what paul have do they lift up they voice say in the speech of lycaonia the god be come down to we in the likenef of man and they call barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he be chief speaker then the prieft of jupiter wbich be before they city bring oxen and garland unto the gate and would have do sacrifice with the people which when the apostle barnabas and paul hear of they rent they clothes and run in among the people cry out act chap xiv ver ê— this carton the simplicity and purity of the christian religion be finely oppose to the pompous idolatry and superstition of the heathen the divine behaviour and modesty of the two apostle be infinitely more strike and greater than all the tumult and parade of the sacrifice which the priest attend by the people be about to make to they the manner in which raphael have describe this ceremony be perfectly fine and agreeable to the custom of the roman and be entirely take from the bas relief of the trajan column the priest and boy employ in the intend sacrifice be almost exactly copy from thence particularly the priest of jupiter who be in all respects the same except in the drapery the figure in the column be without any in the character of the priest and people there be general expression of enthusiasm and superstitious fear which be finely describe paul be the principal figure in this picture he be represent as stand upon kind of step from whence he be about to descend in order to stop the mistaken religious fury of the people and at the same time with the utmost grief and perturbation which be admirably express in he coun tenance be rend he garment and expose part of he breast which produce fine effect in the imagination the apostle barnabas who stand behind he be sine character he be see intirely in shadow but he attitude and expression be incomparable grief and pity be blend in he countenance and he clasp he hand together with fervour not to be describe mo . richardson in speak of this carton and the sacrifice represent in it say the occa sion of all that be finely tell the man who be heal of he lameness be one of the for wardest to express he sense of the divine power which appear in those apostle and to shew it to be he not only crutch be under he foot on the ground but a old man take up the lappet of he garment and look upon the limb which lie remember to have be crippled and express great devotion and admiration which sentiment be also see in the other with mixture of joy mo . richardson might have add gratitude also and indeed if it be allowable to which be visibly express in the character of the cripple censure so great à master the place in which this man be find be liable to some objection paul in look siedfastly upon he perceive he have faith to be heal and he be here represent among the erow of idolator and appear to be one of the most zealous to assist at cere mony so utterly disagreeable to he holy benefactor to this it may be object that as he pro carton of raphael urbin bably have not have time to be fully instruct in the christian faith this be the only way in which he could possibly testify he gratitude but it be submit whether he might not with moré propriety and equal advantage to the picture have be introduce in the place of the man who be on the fame side of the picture with the apostle employ in bring ram to the sacrifice à or at least in some other situation in this particular more agreeable to he dispo sition to receive the religion of christ the whole figure of this man be finely design and vastly exprefsive but the leg which the old man be look at be remarkably elegant and be undoubtedly paint from nature the figure of the old man be also finely draw and imagine and he attitude whiei be stoop

whole together exhibit noble composition carton vii paul preach at athen then paul stand in the midst of mar hill and say the man of athen perceive that in all tbing ye be too superstitious for as

remarkable that he be shew to the greatest advantage that can possibly be conceive the man who be about to ascend the step the woman behind he and eight other figure who be represent stand compose the second groupe and the third be form by six person who be sit this last be place between the first and second nearly in the centre of the picture the character of paul be universally allow to be the most sublime performance that ever be produce by the pencil of raphael and mo . richardson who passionately admire this figure with warmth peculiar to himself swhich perhaps upon this and some similar occasion carry he little too farl say but no historian or orator can possibly give I so great a idea of that eloquent and zealous apostle as that figure of he do all the fine thing related as say or write by he can not for there see person face air and action which no word can sufficiently describe but which asfure I as much as those can that that man must speak good sense and to the purpose thus much be be yond contradiction that nothing hitherto produce can give so great a idea of the person of paul or can better help to illustrate the divine zeal and elocution which that apostle so eminently possess than the awful majestic and expressive character which the hand of raphael have give themf raphael have employ every artifice in order to make the apostle particularly conspicuous all the figure in the picture be subservient to that purpose the man and woman at the bottom of the step be actually nearer to the eye than the apostle but they situation cause the base line of the picture to cut off part of they height and as they be both stoop they be effectually prevent from lessen the importance of the apostle he have manage the figure that appear behind the apostle in the same manner by place two of they lower than paul and the third sitting upon the upper step by which mean they be sufficiently degrade the figure in thé second groupe who be see stand be situate upon the ground they head mostly inclined and be also at considerable distance and those who compose the middle groupe be at still greater distance and be represent sit but the gigantic statue of mar which be introduce with great propriety be of infinitc service to the picture it be place beyond the outermost figure of the second groupe therefore the distance of this statue be consider and the height and bulk of it compare with the figure of the apostle it will be find to reduce the last to moderate size and also serve admirably by its magnitude to balance that side of the picture among great variety of fine character in this picture next to that of the apostle be that of the man who be ascend the step in whose countenance awe and reverence be finely blend nor need the most common observer be tell that this man and the woman behind he be intend to represent dionysius and damarisf who we be inform by the history be converted the expression of extreme attention in the three figure nearest to dionysius in the second groupe be most admirably describedf nor be that of the man in the same groupe who press he lip with he finger less to be admiredi the three figure behind the apostle who be apparently displease with he discourse be finely invent particularly that of he who be sit and rest he chin upon he hand in he character envy and malignity be finely describe ** leonardo do vinci in he treatise upon painting have give it as precept that in grave and serious composition when asfembly arc hold and matter of importance debate let but sew young man be present it be contrary to custom to intrust affair of this nature in the hand of youth who be not less able to give council than they be willing to receive it and who therefore have two reason for absent themselves from these kind of meetingsff this precept be no where better illustrate than in this carton where there be wonderful ex pression of attention decorum and gravity in the old man and on the contrary the few vo person who be introduce in the picture appear froward impatient and impetuous and con tempt and dislike be strongly express in each of they character for which reason part of these turbulent person be judiciously throw into the most distant groupe and other be place behind the older man in the distance between the building in the centre of the picture be see two sigure who appear to be talk together and seem to be of no consequence to the composition but they use be great they not only serve to break the straight line make by the head of those who be sit as also the parallel line make by the column of the temple and the adjacent piazza but connect the principal and two subordinate groupe together and without they the picture must have suffer considerably the attitude of the figure be extremely sine and expressive the drapery noble and well cast particularly that of the apostle which be admirably design the architecture be elegant not rich but suitable to the taste of the athenian and properly adapt to the picture as be the distant view of the country it be customary for they to place the statue of mar as the guardian of the city at the entrance into it upon the whole it may not be improper to conclude with compare the idea of two such great painter as raphael and leonardo do vinci in similar subject by the follow extract from the writings of the latter who in describe
