of other within door painting and whether the shade should be ftrong or not fince it certain that the object whether great or tmall have different efect in thefe two inftance and now if the perspettive be also well manage and the colour lay fresh and proper and well bundle by gently uniting they with large pencil the piece will be good if this hindle and meling of colour be not yet

when we paint in vernith or tough or fac oil becaute painting with ftarve colour on dry ground can never have fall this smoothness ih painting after the life we ought to ule large pencit and thoughto

the class of moveable picture as well as pourtrait wherefore they ought to be neater handle though fometime place higher at the time lower if it be ask whether a upright piece or go foot deep front floor to ciel ought to be imoothly handle and finith throughout fay no but rather to be to paint as high as you can reach less finith in the middle and less than that as it advance in height and yet with fuch general care that all part seem to have like ferce and einiss and though we find different condult in ferdaan magi nificent triumphal piece in the houfe in the wood neaf the hogue yet that can be no rule becaute the painting be large the eve can not diffinguith whether the upper part be less fnish than the under moreover the firure be bigger than the life but here methink difficulty may be start suppofe in keont where fuch large piece be another be to be paint by it fmalter as fingle figure no bigger than the life how shall we manage in order to give this latter picture the same force as the former antwer that force and warmth he in the colour not in the roughness of picture whence it be that the small pifture muft be handle in the same manner as the great one to make they look agreeable for heighten ing and shad it with the fame force will produce the fame eiffect and if not immediately by the pure strength of colour yet by icumbling and glaze we fetch it out but then

the force of the figare otherwife the effelt will be difagreeable and uncertain but if the main compofition contill of figure or other large objelt only be better to begin where you intend the greateff forct whe the it be on the firft or second diltance and then work to the off part of the picture now in order to proceed with certainty we muft take care that general harmony of part be well obferve that the tint and colour be justly manage accord to the law of depth and diltance to that nothing appear offentive to the eyc and then the work will be in fit condition for second colour with little trouble many painter indeed err in not know where to begin rightly and only confult what object they like beft heedietly tall on they firft for inftance if it be gold vafe they begin with that and then proceed to blue drapery then red one toc other begin with the nudity and to run thro all the nakeds in the picture by which ftrange disjunction the work become mif hapen and the paintor make more uneaty than by a illprimed cloth but fuch painter never think on any means to extricate themfelves to of this labyrinth to what purpofe be it to thew they they erfor they be fatish with what they have do and falve all by lay the picture be but dead coloured on finish it shall be tberwife what be now too light shall be bring down and what teo dark beigbtenbut all this while the work do not go

particular part and to to work on the former good ground but to do this in the bell manner we mull as lay begin from the greateff lointain the sky and werk forward from thence by this means we have always wer ground to mell in with the outline of the forward figure which otherwife they would not have befide another pleaf advantage that the piece go forward all part well support and good harmony in the whole whence the rye mult be fatisfied and the mind concinually spurrthis manage ment be one of the prime quality of painter for what can encou= rage he more than a affurance that he work on fure bafis and which he find without feek it but unhappy be he who work diforderly for muddle on one thing as long as he fancy for it laft and then thoughtlefly proceed to other and dwelling on they in the same manner he miffe the necellary become air of he piece and at laft all appear out of joint and difrelithing have come thus far we proceed to the manner chap of retouch or finish the french call it recovcher we revile fure painter be have get thus far let experience and he own reffection be judge for the figure have they proper dillance strength and effect and all part due harmony and keep nothing remain but to give the piece the laft force of light and shade todo which well rub you piece or to much as you think you can paint of it at one time and before the vernith grow dry with good thin pifturevernis mix with some fat white oil then work on this wet ground by clapping you light on the lightef part and by secend tint and beauty book by ventle scumble unite they with the wet ground aforefaid ann the tendernct of the nudity and drapery in foch degrce as be neceffary for each then put in the vellow or glow of the reffection if after all the light of the nudicy should be here and there too frong reduce they by mixing little light oker vermilion brown red lake or afphalcum accord as the colour be tender or rrong under the vernith glaze thinty over they then heighten upon this with fuch colour as you thirk fir do the same by the drapery thus the work will fucceed and the colour be prevented from go in in drying chap vi of the secend tint and the relief it occasion she be many who whatever pain they take can not be bring to relith thing in which they find to much difficulty they who have long practife after nature be vex to fee the work of other mafter beter coloured and more pleat than they own infomnch that with difficulry they reaffume they profeffion and thea eagerly hope to do wonder find they old veration fill return would thefe menrightly fearch the caute they trouble would end for though we be narurally better pleated with great maffer work than we own becaute of we inferiority in knowledge yet we muff not be therefore difcourage but as faid fludy where the fault lie let we then make good reffeltion on neat pilture in order to profit by they and alfo converfe with better mafter than ourfelves tis to be lament that thefe man fomerime fee fine thing in another mafter but can give no reason for it becaufe they work rathe by accident or chance than on fure principle as be the cale of young painter some vear ago who shew I fome of he piece faidthis piece paint fix tear age this four and thot less yet can perceive no difference between they in goodness now though the difference be vilible the laft piece appear hetter manage in all part than the former yet he would not believe I try thar notwichilanding all he endeavour he picture be grey and muddy when other be clean and pleafant and they light broad —ilay on my colour tays he fine and warm as they do and then expediciously scamble thew into eack other now pray tell I what mus p mast tint and beauty chap of penciling then eccason this foulnessteld he —certain painter with whom you daily converfe spoil you and as long as you follow they all woy advice be to no purpose as jor you thought and ordennance like they very well but dislike you handling you de not lay on you second tint clean enough by the secend tint mean that which be lay on the light part cowards the out line by means of which all relieved or round part be force to unite with the ground and to go off round ing this you mult lay on clean and beautiful in the same colour as that of the light but it mult not be muddy and like sbade for being alfo light by the day the darknel and it be grey can have no effelt upon it relief or roandness be nothing elle than light receding or ge of which ought to partake more or let of blue in proportion to the colour of the carnation which if yellowifh the second tint mult be greenith if red the tint mult be violet and if whice colour the tint be medium between the two colour aforefaid from all which premife tis ealy to apprehend that this second colour be to be get and mix with bine but not with foul colour becaute it then lofe it fleshinesshere he ask I in what manner then he should make it darker antwer that as the diftance of object caule faintnel in colour and what we call ir make bluiss interposition between we and they to he mult mix nothing with he tint but fine blue or small in proportion to such diftance this be colour if may of fay which give no colour or do it without much alteration this conduct relace not only to nudity but allo to landskip grounds stone drapery and in fine to every object have either roundnel or diftance moreover another perfection neceffary to this tint be that we muft not let it be too dark upon the relief becaute broad light look manjeflic and fipne when between it and the broad shade tender difference only appear —he return I thanks and go off there be many who know not the importance of the thing they rlight and in comparifon with other think they of no great moment as be the cafe of another painter who copy piece of poutin oblery nicely the colour temper even the half shade and tender tint exactly on he pallet but have finith the piece he in other picture fall again into he old road he himfelf law very well great difference between this piece and thofe other and be forry for it but the mifchief lay in not retain the manner which of penciling second tint and beanty book which he have before imitate with to much pain and this occafion ed he stigbtness we find even painter who believe that the second tint mult upon excremine be quite dark mixing in it the colour of the ground and fay the great mignard do so which intirely deny it be true that once read fmall trearife write by the famous bofe ehtiile le peintre converti or the converted painter in which among other thing he precend to prove that mignard make he secend tist too dark on the extreminy of he object but fay that it muft not be underftand from thence that he muddle the tint with foxter groundcolour but rather that in proportion to the lightnet or darknel of the ground he make it either lighter or darker without uting any red vellow or black in it as they prerend moreo ver we know the vall difference between foreright face and aforechorten one that the one on the near side grow larger than the the as the face in plate plainly thew which by observe or regled give the painting either great elegance or indecorum the greateff difficulty fome painter meet with be that one of the quanty of good picture lie in broad light this they imagine to confift in fiarness reafon thus if it be truth that pic ture with fuch ligh be beft more round one mult need be worle very loofe argument certainly since narure and daily experience of round object teach we the contrary especially when it be not sun thiny weather have faid before that the contour or out line ought to wwite in the tint of the groand that go off from the more enlighten part ii say sof appear to much as the other to illultrate which we exhibir here in placel aforefaid round pillar againtt ground half light half shade to that the light side of the pillar be fer off by the shade of the ground and the shade of the pillar by the light side of the ground now it muft need follow in order to ovtain the relief that the shade of the pillar ought to be make lighter on the excremity that it may round off towards the light ground therwife it would be but semicircle on the oppolice side tis the tame except that the light do preferve itfelf and its own colour becaute the air which interpofe caule the welme to recede and fall back and in the shade the fame with this difference only that there fn chap of penciling second tint and beauty if there it be deuble by the lighiness of the background partake more of lef of its colour if this be not well apprehend let the next example explain it place globular body againlt light yellow ground as in the say plate then view it at some diltance you will perceive the outsnderly to melt into the ground without any line on the hade hardnel this relate to the roundaet only now let we obferve how much the colour partake of if this ball be of blue colour the extremity will be greenith apainn the vellow if the ball be violet they become purplith and if the ball be vellow as well as the ground they will be more yellow in the shade as we have already teach in treat of the naked the fuperficial roughness or smoochness of the ball caufe litle alletation except with respect to its nearness to or dillance from the ground look now on the light side of this ball we shall find that if the ball be lighter than the yellow ground the colour of the ground can not then have of much force on it fince the fuperficial colour of the ball can not be overcome by leffer colour than it and therefore the yellow ground can not add to its colour whence it happen that the meer interposstion of the he caule the relief or the ourline to round and go off again be the ground darkith or black yet the diminish of the coloar caute by the interposition of the air will be nither less nor more but will be more or less fet off by the ground and feem let round arcifl err in think that the balf tint which be lay next to the excremity on the light side and call mezzofint be the fame with that place between light and shade under the name of middle tinr for this laft be whole tint and the other but a half tint and not to broad as the mezzotint which more than half mix with the shade and confequently be olser althosome give it upon the edge of the light side another colour more like shade than the colour of the objecl the mistake of which we have already thewns bur when the light be fronce or come directly from before then this merzoint be half mix with the middle tint let I not here be mifunderflood for speak not of the side light which bainter generally wtc from of penciling second tint and beauty book from all which premife he plain that this tiat though call mer of broken tint can not be confider as shade fince it partake of the light again it happen frequently that in the fame piece of painting than ather tome object be rounder or darker upon the may gdid till do she point which ought to be of when by means of of sight we can difcover more than the semidiameter of they roundand but semidiameter or less in other as in the det two pillar in the plare aforefaid for if the point of sight be in the middle of the piece and the light fall in it obliquely from the right side then the object on the right side will have broader shade and thofe on the leave broader light as thefe two pillar plainly evidence but if now on each side of thefe two pillar be fome other pillar place alike diltant from the point of sight and both cut from top to borrom through they center parallel with the horizon it be certain that at the proper diftance we thall fee not only the in ward split but alfo some purt of the hindermoft half as in pil lar now obferre as the pillar to the left thew that the part which be feen beyond the half on the light side round off of much the further and confequently become darker than where the main light round off on the contrary view the light side of the right hand pillar you fee as much less of the foremolt diameter or half as more of that on the shade side wherefore the weline can not round off to far on its light side nor the extremiby be to dark as on the other pillar where more than the half be vifible chap vil of beasty and the proportion of the member in a buman body vt be the moft valuable part of painting it muft therefore be the firft and chief object of we work but my derign be not to mention all that can be faid of its power and infinence fince daily occurrence furhith we with fufficient example the wifel of the ancient

beautiful figure confift in good proportion and pe potition of its part with relpect to action and paffion yet it can not be say to be abfolucely perfelt till further improvby beautifil lightss for we often fee that too faint light render object dilagreeable anot produce a effect contrary to we intention which make we unealy becaute we firft purpofe be fpoil and we know not the reafor of it but of it will happen when without minding the effect of we object we chufe a improper light as violent paftion in light which loofe at once its effect and motion contrarily ter falat of penciling second tint and beauty book tender and pleafant object may by teo prong and broad light and shade burg be quire break and it be grace go hence it be of the laft moment to confider thoroughly before we begin we work the nature and effect of the subject we intend to handle as whether it be the murther of tulius cafer in full senate of the death of cato or the nuptial of stratonica with a fiectus or the reception of the quce of sbeb with she retinue of lady by solemon cc becaule different pustin be to be incroduce in those different subjert in the former we mul uppoie great hurry and conttenation frght and confuion nay all be in motion in the latter nothing be feen but tender beauty eaty carriage graceful modelfy and auchoriry and now who will not agree with I that the two former subjeltsought to be handle with frong and sirp light and the two latter with joft and more tender one this effect lie alfo in the very toture and quality of light themfelves fome produce strength and sharfne other sweetness softness and pleasure but contramanarement render thing fulje and contradistory becaute then we two former example may be call graceful confussm and the two latter fevere amour wherefore conclude that figure well proportion and ditpote have graceful motion and sway and light agreeable to its outline and motion may be call perselt figure chap viii of the motion of the member et we proceed now to the second of the part wherein beauty contifl namely the motion of the mfember this depend chiclly on contrar or oppesstion of all the member of the bodr and on they light and skaass which give figure morion and life and this be chiefly obtain by wind s as when the face be fronce the body mult turn little fidewar and the leg again front see fig plare vii lecond obfervation be contraft in the incline poise of the bofrom hend to foot for inftance if one shoulder rife the other mull fink the hip knee and foot the fame as in the fame fig wherein the right shoulder rife the right hip falls at chap of penciling second tint and beauty the right knee or foot rife again and the contrary on the op pofite fide of the body third obfervation be that when the right arm and leave leg at vance the left arm and right leg fall back but this motion double when the right shoulder be feen front for then the head and under part of the body muft be the fame fame figure thew when the breaft rife the headought to fink and the contrary see fig the head mult always meline to the upper shoulder as in fig in a erect pofture the foot mult make rectangle to wit the heel of the one with the inward ancle of the other as in fig hund mult always have contrape motion if one be see inwardly the otherought to be ourward if one hang down the other should be rail up the under purt of the arm be forethorten the upper part should be feen direct if the thigh be forehorten the lee should be direct as in fig the motion of the leg be almolt like that of the arm compare the upper part of the arm with the thigh and the under part with the leg if the upper part of the arm fink the thigh mult rife and contrall it when the right arm be raif and the leave depretsd then the knee or foot mult be contrary if the hip fwell the upper part of the body fink into the under part if the shoulder heave the neck fink into they here take efpecial care that the hand and arm be not on line but that each contraft the other in a oppose turn as we fee in the good and bad example fig the cross line of the face be never parallel with that of the body either front or profile wife nor the upper part of the body with lower in these motion confift in my opinion the beauty of the body respect to as for other afotion thefe three be the principal that of the head that of the hund and fect laflly that of the body thole of the head be foursold forward backward and on each side thole of the hand and foot be the fame the rm and leg have but one motion to wit one on the et bow the other on the knee the arm bend and the leg draw back the motion of the body be threefold foreright and on both side of penciling second tint and beauty befide chefe there be yet four other sort of motion proceed from the fame member to wit the simple the active the paftive and the violent the simple be when the member move naturally as in walk one foor be fer before the other in drink or earing the hand be lify up to the mouth the head turn and the other member be make tubfervient to the prefent altion and to which child as well as aged perfon naturally incline the active confilt in carry pull thrult puth climbing and the like which be do by knowledge and judgment this be only in part proper to child see plare viil the paffric arife from difquiet of the mind or what the soul thew by the body in the paffion as love hatred anger sorrow por spite scorn and fuch like the effelt of thefe though morly inward yet be feen from without the body chieffy in the fmall member as the eye nofe mouth finger and toe see plate ix the vielent proceed from fright fear defpair rage cor or any thing that be nufual and fudden and perturbare nature either by hear or fee fuch as fudden thunder spectre or frightful sight thefe caule shrink fretch and wind of the member to both which vo and old be subject see plate but all thefe paftion together can not produce perfelt figure without the affiftance of the member becaute we

though manny would be better think of yet they thew the contrary by daily converlation with mean people whereby they slip the opportunity of get better idea of genteel carriage content themfelves with

they hlandle enough to fee fine people and to obferve how they behave as for I before have the happinet to which we may fometime arrive by the smile of friend mift no opportunity of make obfervation and noting they in my pocketbook which a hiltorypainter ought always to have about he wherever he soe and with good reafon for thought be often of volatile and llippery as to be retain with difficulty as have before intimate in the firff chapter about ordennance nay when faw a handlome gentlewoman walk in the street make it my bulinet to enquire into the recson of ber grace and in what it contift and wby she appear more agreeable than other and on the contrary why ych refealch as thefe we come to the lother be less agreeable and tas well by the one sort of knowledge of what be people as the

knowledge and by which we obtain the finell thingss no ii of ordonnance or composition which as have faid when once loft may perhaps never be retrieve many miltake who think that magnificent garb and rich ornament as jewel pearl gold and filver stuft cc be infallible mark of the greatness and power of people but can the moft difcern certainly conclude they to be fuch by thefe token without enquire whether they education be equal to they grandeur even then allo they may be deceive fince fome mean people have naturally or by imitation fuch a air and carriage that be they dress anfwerable they would be take for great one the reafon of which be that at firtt sight there appear uttle difference between falfe jewel and true thoughon nice enquiry may be find as in the jewel of in they altion and behaviour fuch difference as point out they true character again if thefe different condition depend only on rich cloath nothing would be more ealy to painter than this difficult part of rt fince at that rate there could be no fathion or broomsick might become lady hood nevertheless there have be and sill be painter enough infelt with this opinion and follow it as law think that drvid solomo and abasucrus would not be know for king do not they crown thew it thefe forfooth they mult always have wherever they be and as well in the bed chamber as on the throne and the sceptre as well at the

faid to be good without they nay think they the very soal of geed piftare but as noble soul in wellhape body without the addision of ornament vifibly shew itself to of courte tirch be needlet in

difference between one ordonnance and another though in some the greatness and likelibood be well preserve but to conclude the matter of this chapter mull lay that my precept ought not only to be obferve in a ordonnance of many but of few figure alfo fince it be very difficult to bring they all into one story but if the subject be courtly as of solemen abaswerus or fuchlike it muft be know that the perfon to whom majetty and grace be moft proper ought to exceed in it viz the king mong he courtier the queen among she lady governour among citizen and thus the greater above the let accord

the difference between touth and age in both sex he artiff ought not only to mind nicely the action but allo the difference of the perfon who be to compofe he ordounance and he mult have great regard both to univerful and partiuler difference as well in the sex as they age child alter commonly every three vear and till they be fix vear of age have always thort neck and round finger the difference between boy and girl be vifible in they outward part without open they leg as tefa do in the imall member the difference be not very vifible though girl be fomewhat thinger have fmaller ear and longer head they arm be likewife more round next and above the wrift and they thigh thicker than thofe of boy but the upper part of boy arm be thinner and fmaller thofe of francefco quefneyare incomparably fine to paint after nay nobody have attain he perfeltion we fee he often reprefent either without hair or but very little whether he think it more beauti ful or it be he choice in make model can not

sex boy of or year old may have hair finely curlgirl more thick and diplay another difference in the sex may be this that girl hair be more foft and long boy more curland short child of or more vear old ought feldom to be reprefent with clofe mouth they upper eyelid be generally hide under they fwelling brow they have commonly quick look vo damfel have vigilant and lively look raif forehead nofe

they face turn little fideway the nofe alike with the forehead and eye mouth thur and double chin it be necellary to take particular notice of the different make and form of person to far as they be defcribe in hiffory in order to expret the better the nature of the matter as alexander and hephestion in the tent of darin wherein hephetion ought to be taller than alexander in saul and david the former tall and the latter less and ruddy and thus of any other circumftance of hiftory we should here have bring in some example of phyfiognomy but as there be lately publifh on that subject fine treatife write by mo . le brun and trantlate by de kaarfgieter we think it not necellary to fay any thing about it but refer to the book fince its of service not only to painter statuary and engraver but allo to poets hifforian and other in the obfervation about take and bolding any thing have take notice that infant be very fickle and harmlet in it and becaute they member be very feeble and commonly ply any way they all as if half lame they hand be always fquab and therefore moll open toung girl be wanton in they taking and hold as in the manrer of goltzius virgin and pay woman be modelt and mannerly in they taking and hold as have shew before but aged people have fiff and dry hand for which reafon they be moft time thut and they can not extend they finger althodifferent accident caule a alteration in the face and polture thole alteration be neverthelel very unlife each other therefore each ought to be handle in diftint manner chieffy when any particular passion move we to this or that action whereby the feature and lincament of the face be deuble by the faid unlikeness suppote of ordennance or composition book ii for inflance that all face be call in one mould and euch govern by particular passion as sorrew gladnel hatred envy anger madnel coc hence its certain that they will be very unlike and different as well as the action of the body and if now you give each particular make and lincament this will angment they difference this obferration be of great ule to face and hifforypainter and the contrary as ufeful when nature and circumflance induce we to make fue or three to be like each other in one compofition namecompany of figure all of one family who therefore may well take after one person in likeness as the son of tacob the ho rotis and caracis for thus we evince the truth of the story again in handle the fuble where the daughter of gecrep open the basket in which be ericbtonin here we be oblige to make they fare alife to thew that they be sifter for otherwife who would know they to be of though reprefent alike beautiful and it would be ask how the affinity appear fee tis not enough to tay they be sifter or that pallas be tupiter daughter or the long beard esculagin the son of young apello but if you give thele three sifter one and the same aspect yer to each diffintt passion they will then differ very much for inftance let the youngeft who open the basket with surprize flart back as if the be lay good god what be this the fecond full of fear run away call out dear siffer face I from this monfter and the third be elder and more ftay fepring back with amazement fay what this be monfer thus proceed three different motion from one aspect of likeness for though the retemblance be fomewhat alcer yet the same proportion

thote emperor or whether the cotemporary mafter who be wellskillin phyfiognomy have not thus alcer they accord to they char of ordennence or composition nature father to reprefent they innate faculty than they outward appearance it be admirable to contider how we senfe be furprized when all the particular aspect be well oblerve accord to the passion which they reprefent methink we there by difcover mens inmoft secret that this perfon fing a high tune that low one that one bellow with pain another inwardly laugh the tooth of one chatter with cold another parch with heat and thirf thus fmall line can let you into whole countenance less or more fatness alto much al ter face but for the artiff benefit think proper to thew he way of find out all sort of aspect after certain and ealy

introduce capid who in nasos description be not mention and give this reafon that he be the eldeft of the god and accord to hefso bring forth of chae and the earth by he contequenly all thing be

they can have no place but where the subject be purely emblematic and emblematic figure the principil character as in the fecond mianner they muft come into play becaute each figure then expreff its

fly from she which in my opinion be right and proper in the mafter but we difpute be whether the figure of sorrow have any bufiness there he juftified it by very plautible reaon lay that altho by the prefence of the compaffionate god she sorrow be at a end yet it abace nor luddenly becaute the be to give he relation of she difaffer and then to wait for favourable anfwer and to long sorrow mult be

cupid and becaute frisdne know not whom the have with she man or god love difcover he godhead and make she fentible of he power this piece be in my judgment fine yer think sorrow should have be leave out of the compofition becaute accord to we poli tion no pasfion can aft in two place at ence for though the princelss no ordonnance or composition book ii fufficieatly thew it yet as be overcome it

becaute he countenance do it effectually but when we defire to make know love and sorrow which be internal affection of the soul thefe mult be expreft by means of hieroglyphic figure and yet if the body be difturb and move by thole paffion the aft passion may be clearly perceive without the help of hieroglyphyphyphyphyphyphyphyphyphyphyphyphyphyphy notwichftanding the necefficy of this knowledge in all who have any relation to painting yet many young statuary imagine that be generally concerned in carving fingle figure only it do not affect they but they mistake for suppofe they should be require to fet off figure with emblem whether on pedefisl or in niche in bat or whole relief in order to blazon the quality and virtue of the perfon it reprefent they would be at sland and the rather as we fee painter exhibir moft of they emblematic figure in stonework in order to make a hiffory clear now the statuary not able to truff to he own sirength rely on the painter aid to defign he fuch

what relate to relief be stranger to the nature and effect of stutt colour and tint and therefore he mult find all thing by means of light and shade only but painter have more liberry and advantage becaufe he can belide the shade effeet eve thing by he colour and tint but the difference be further vi ble from the set of print daily publithed whether in lapdskip perfpeltive view architelture or anrent or modern story in all which the deligner generally travel the old road of compoliion and the ercher or engraver as clofely follow he but when good painter handle they all the part will be improve and be come more excellent as well the invention difpofition and harmony as even the motion by which mean perfon of fmall ability can not but be better pleafed and often for the fake of one or two fine print buy whole set as in ouduen book of the romin night in which one plate engravby abrabam blotel do by it nearnet and elegance eclipfe all the reft and this be the more remarkable becaute in he medal the figure be shade not with hatch but with thick stroke and touch on the hady side now agreeable to the tirle of the chapter we thall pass to the necellary management of a ordonnance with large figure in fmall compal it mult be grant that a ordonnance in large extent require more circumitance than fmaller althoin either the chief marcer lie ber in three or four fgure for what in the former come clofe and fill mut in the larter be ppread in order to till up large space and to do this artfully we be oblige to introduce other bywork and thote though inlignilicant yet probable and not repug nant to the subject tend to explain the story for inftance in landship to introduce fome building fountain pyramid of sta tve of in a hall or other large apartment hanging alcove bal of ordennance or composition and fuch like either for ornament of to make larger croup in thort any thing that will entertain the eye fince jmoll figure in large compass be not of themselves cupable of do it wherefore with respect to fuch the byornament ought to be large in order to create broad light yet thefe ornament mult not be to mondrous as some have they who in order to rell the compofiti on make pillar bigger than three of the figure can fathom with caftlelike capital and frizal figure almoft in full proportion nor to out of the way as thofe where in landskip be feen tree or foot high terme mere coloffule and pyramid higher than any in the world to which add houfe in the offskip where before people can poftibly approach they they muft be loft by diflance but this be egregious condult for we should always bring together tuch part or object as neither leff the figure or cause any obfiruction in the composition meas that large compat mult either look large or elle be fill and adorn in moderate manner as we shall thew in two sketch of the mourn vous plate xvill each repre fent in different mianner to demonfirate that in large compass great mass of light be absolutely neceffury the story be venus inconfoleable for the deach of she dear adonis even the aid of cupid fail whole bow rrew and extinguished torch nay she beloved garland of rofe the trample under foot mur though fetretlypleafed at the adventure however pretend to tympathize with she im she sorrew but in wain for the flighis he offer and puthe he frow she the reft on the tomb of she lover wherein erther

fince it owe its origin to he blood on dae compariton of the plate we miy difcover the difference between the two compofition in the uppermoft the mass of light be neither to large or pread as in the undermoft which prove that in great and clofe oxdonnance in lmall compat as the upper fixt great riat of light be not neceffary much let bywork infordey to encreafe it becaute the figure there principally govern and she ing large have on that occalion the greateft forez as well in the execution as beauty and colour the bywork ferve to thew the place and occafion but not to draw the eye whence be cafy to fee that whaticreate decorum and elegance in the one appear infignificant and difagreeable in the other speak of the ligtt ont which requir of ordennance or composition book ii diiint management in both wherefore fince in large compat the brornament make the greateff part they muft con sequently caule greater maff of light there and contrarily in imall compat where the bywork be leave the main light ought to take the figure only and to confirm this mult fay that what in the undermoll repretentation pleafes the eye and fet off the compolition even be it as large again be only caute by the light be caute the bywork be the moll abace the light of the figure wnich have in the upper with the dark tomb more force muff create fuch confution as to weaken the strength of the principal figure in word the larger the figure the more shade ouget to be about they and of consequence the smaller the figure the thor ligrt ch ap kviil of the ordennance of hiffery pourtrait stilllifc xc in small compass re we end this book or leave this subject tis proper to conii fider further whether it be not more artful to reprelent story natural and clofe in fnall compat than larger which think to prove from the example of raphael caracci dominichine pouf pa le brun and other excellent mafter moreover daily experience confirm it les cerrainly troublesome to be confine to fmall compat especially to thofe who affelt to load they compoficion becaute largenet be very entertaining to the thought the difference between both management be the fame as painting as big as the life and in lirtle where we fee that in the former lie the moft art fince we can more eaily go from the large to the fmall than contrary though both be do from the life the cafe of thefe two arcift be like that of skilful steerfman who capable of wreftle with storm and danger fail unconcernedly in imooth river when meer ferryman would be pur to he shift to fteer on the occan he then be happiell who have be always ute to large thing fince the small spring from they like a inlend river which lofe it be strength the further it go from it s spring of which the old mafter be not infentible who though much employin small painting yer lay in for large work be ing confcious that what require the moff trouble and skill get they the greater name and profit the of ordennance or composition chap force of large painting beyond small one and its advantage be thele the natural reprefentation have better effect for view it near it raif love pity anger or any other paftion as if we lympathize with the story it raif the mafter fame laftly the work be much effcem itwere needlet to mention other advantage wherefore ishall confirm my opinion by example we read of picture of stratenica that the sailor in storm take it for deity and accordingly worlhippit and that in june temple she fland figure be to artfully paint that she eye feem to look every way and at any beholder wherever he place himfelf appear fevere to the criminal and gentle to the innocent the reaton of which effelt be that the two picture be of highly finish and have of natural a human shape that they feem to be rather fleth and blood and to have motion than to be painting this thew what inffuence large reprefentation have on the senfe let we now fee what paffion currofty raif as in this example fuppose murthercorps lie fomewhere near it perfon weep little further the seizure of the murtherer and the people run some towards he other towards the body now it may be ask whether all thefe circumftance do not fufficiently thew the fact without other perfon or greater paffion to which antwer nega tively for we ought to fee whether the wounded perfon be dead or not and in what part wounded next whether know the affaffin whether the woman lament he be of quality or ordinary and whether to be related to the wounded perion accordingly come nearer think know he be affright behold the wound which appear ghaftly to I and be the more affect by the tear of the troubled woman who fland at he head ilook for the murtherer with concern and revenge and fee he dragin lron between two officer he look pale and he heart forebode the worl in fine every one be varioully affelted some concerned other indifferent with respect to the fate of the wounded or murtherer now if such variety of object occur in fimple accident what force mult the life have when feen near in fuch reprefentation especially if naturally expreft but we need not wonder that of few tread in that old path fince they feck eale and want the ambition to excel by a exact inquiry into nature ionce of ordonnance or composstion ii ionce think get reputation by painting in little but be af terwards convinced that large work or the life feen near be the turelt way to excellence but envy and strife foppmy career ihat the painter in large in thefe country merit may be eafily determine fince few of they do it mafterly

by fingle paftion by fingle reprefentation of the perfon on whom the stret lie the unnatural be thofe wherein the fame perfon be reprefent more than once and there by two accident mix together which happen at different time as the one by day and the other by night which be contrary to nature and wherein be often ule more than one point of sight secondly the moft pertinent and intelligible hiftory be fuch as that of heliodory defcribe in the maccabe when he be punifh by the angel to which add the highprieft profirate before the alcar intreate the almighty and further the widow and orphan lament

object in frontifpieceplate and they obfervable as be of different nature from other ordonnance and tend in all respects to embellifh the book only like fine gardenwalk where the objell whether vafe statue tree coc be place to anfwer they purpofe the figure which denote the subject of the book ought by all means as the principal to appear in the middle of the plate fet off by other byornament over head or beneath mult be large table or flat face with the book ticle thereon either in thick black letter or elfe doublelind one and the other figure which ferve for illuftration place of equal height on each side either fland or fitting thus much for the fore cround the offskip have litile concern in the matter we may difpofe where we think proper with low or rife grounds in order thereby to give the uniformity of the subject greater luftre and painterlike decorum the principal vifle of ordennance or composition beok ii ought to be in the middle but if two be neceffary for the fake of hew fomething in the offskip they muft be on each side and equally large and extenfive ber we mut take especial care that the title be encompaff with arctrecrure or rockage or tree or at leaff remain within the fore ground which we ought to confider as thearrical stage open on one or both side with curtain fomerime fet it off with colonade frontifpiece or elfe incloling it in moulding or compartent in which cafe there should always be found fame either before or behind let the subject of the book be what it will even the fame alone with the title of the book will look more proper than the figre of the book without the fame look well to interibe the title in the pendant of the trumpet wher be in the middle of the plare and in doublefirokletter but it it happen to be on side of the plate tis improper the can pral biack lecter fuic the middle and bottom of the place however when the title muft be place high the open letter be beft becaute the other would take the eve too much and weaken the reft of the york thus much in general itith refrest to particular we mult obferve that the figure reprefent the book should alwar poffet the chief place in the middle of the plate and that to be elevare the figure of less contequence fomewhat lower and further in and thus with the other each go ing off accord to its rank action and qualiry to the ofsskip and if other additional ornament be neceffary they muft be contrive here and there in batsrelief but to explain myself shall give plate example and take for the subject book carrle and militaria or treatife of military exercife bellon as the subject of the work fit exalt on a high and large pedeftal in the middle of the plate fet off with all kind of warlike inftrument as ufual beneath she on one side fland perfon in a offentive pofture and on the other defentive perfon thefe three figure make the whole story the latter be reprefent as brave citizen with table in he left hand whereon be draw the plan of forritication and under he right arm sheaf of wheat the former appear as vigorous young man with spike head staff in one hand and spade in the other and at he foot crow or wall breaker on one side in the oftship be townwall and on the other some armed man feer houfe on fire behind the former htand vigilancy and behind the latter subtilry now chap of ordonnance or composition we may oblerve that the aforefaid uniformity in the figure accompany bellona and which help to explain the senfe be unavoidable for if one of the hieroglyphic figure next she be fitting and the other fland it would caufe a abfurdity in the ordonnance becaute thole two figure ought to thew a altiviry or at leave to be in readinet to undertake some encerprize wherefore they as well as thofe behind they muft be fland the latter be placed there not as capital figure but to aid and subferve the two thers and therefore be rather ornamental than neceffary they may be leave out as alfo may the offskip fince the subject fufficient ly appear without it neverthelel it may be retain when it do not obfcure the main delign but should rather chufe to contrive it in bassrelief in stonework all frontifpieceplate should have the three follow quality to delight the exc to fend to the praife and honour of the author and de figner to be advantageous to the seller thefe obfervacion though little heed yet be very necelfary fince all thing have reference and tendency to fomething and though by proper application we muft thew they qualiry as in the three in ftance aforelaid yer we have liberty to make further addition if not foreign to the main delign of the compolition fay then that if the capital figure be fet off by a area palace or other building that ornament mulf come on the right side of the plate next to the bind ing of the book and run off to the leave as fcantily as the delign will permit it would be improper to repreient table pedettal and vafe or such like holf in the piece unlet the print have border broad enough to be suppote to hide the other half or it be on third or further ground we allo remark that the light fall on the object muft be suppote to come from without the book that be it proceed from the left side or opening of the book and thoot to the intide of it in order thereby to create between they mean the print and the book perfect union and sympathy like that of the soul and body fuppoling the book to be the body and the print the soul which move it to which add in confirmation of my polition that the back of the book give rife to the print and leave the reafon why difpofe the object thus whether light or heavy becaufe think the contrary very improper and illgrounded as the decorum of it may be leen in the frontifpieceplace of my drowbook ordonnance or composition ii book delign in that manner which shall explain and give proof of in the two follow example ekample place on the right side of the defign fine frontifpiece or porch of court or temple with wing come from it on each side and on they fome people lean over balluftrade all run to the point of sight which be in the middle of the piece at the entrance rland prince princel or vefal virgin and before he or she on the step manor woman kneel and receive staff or roll of paper fame on high found towards the leave and on the second ground alloon the left side but half withour the piece some affright people take they flight on the same side the offskip should appear villowile like gallery up to the point of sight now the defisn be light from the lett and only flightly sketch with black chalk or pencil and rub off on another paper the former will fsre the boot and the reverfe the contrary ekanipl ii in landskip on the right side be mafty tomb fupport by sphinx and fet off with other stonework as pedeftal and vafe the foremoff whereof be more than half without the piece and all run to the point of sight as in the forego behind it be clofe ground of cypress and other tree up to the point of sight and beyond it be the offskip from the left side on the second ground may be see in part only some people come forward as priefl boy with focrifce urenfil the axbearer and beaft for sacrifice before the tomb on the plinth should fland fmall ltar forward two or three hargy take they flight and from the tomb cupid fly after they with a arrow in he bow as drive they from thence now reverfe this draw alfo and then obferve the decorum it pro suce alchothis method of proceeding be found on reafon and good grounds yer fear many will take it for chimera on suppotition that we precend to amend fomething and lay down politive law for what have be feveral hundred vear leave free and unlimitted fince book may without the aforefaid obfervation be good fall well chap of ordonnance or composition and bear price again if book be good and have but tidepage without frontifpieceplate that enough even plate ever to poorly handle will pass if it but thew what the author treat of but let I ask whether tis not more acceptable to give print great decorum and make it better with little trouble than to beat the old road especially when we can fupport it by certain rule which will difcover the error of former management some perhaps why have not other mention this fince the politimay fay on be to poficive but anfwer that though many thing have be find out fomething still remain to be difcover by the study of curious and inquifitive man we grant that if book be bad the frontif pieceplate will not mend it however if the proverb may take place thing well set off be half fold and therefore elegance be very neceltary in all thing of the representation of dream apparition anusual tbought and fiction at leifure time who can blame ftudious arciff for amuling himfelf fometime with sketch odd conception or for painting they think it have commendable and true take of creatness of mind and the beft method for excel in delign it certain that they who make they art they diverfion have double advantage in it becaute they exercife they judgment with ufury in the molt abfirufe delign which the senfe can comprehend let we only confider with respect to the people how acceptable fuch a artiff muft be fince moft man have a lich for novelty as in play which draw the greateff concourfe of people the more uncommon they be if any think ought rather to maintain that fuch artifl ought not to be regard and that they should find they pleafure in better thing let I ask in what whether in hearing idle talk read ufelet book walk the street coc all which be rather walt lime than improvement les not unknown that raphael michael angelo and many other famous mafter do fomerime exercife they judgment with out of the way thought whence infer that they think it no shame but con trarily what good can come of exceffive drink and dip into other thing as if painting no longer concerned we certain we can not ferve two mafter at once and as certain that he who fiudy difficult

painter will not give themfelves the trouble to delign unutual or barbarous hiffory fuch as the indj a tapsn of chinese and find that yis becaule no author have write anr thing abour they worth skerching thofe nacion afford no other scene than cruelcy murther tyranny and tuch like ditagreeable object which would rather offend chan delight moreover that the oddnet of they dreff mfannersand cultom do not at all quidrate with the grace and beauty of the ncique ii certain that the principal bulinet of a hiftorypainter be to express the story with proper and livelr paffion that he incertion may appear plain and fa risfaftory to the curious and yet ths would be no more than the read it in the author if the grace of the figure be not alfo to accompanr it would hat difgult in fine play more

especially thofe who be converfant with they hiffory and indeed this novelry of prospect be no way to repusof ordennance or composition to art or nature as the people and they manners in spoiling the shape which god and nature give they if it be faid that fuch landship be improper without figure of the fame country it mull be grant neverthelel as the by ornament of landskip be ufually the leave

who may add to its improvement as we introduce white into the black country and black into greece but perhaps another difficulty may be ftart againtt fuch land skip namely that they can not be handle to natural and true we can have the life before we which indeed be probable however it mult be grant that the author treat of thofe part be to many and to particular that man of judgment may gather fufficient instruction from they the temperature of the air fruitfulness of the soil shape of the tree and other green and they nature and colour be plainly fet down and if the green happen to be little lighter or darker or the ground more yellow or rulfet who will go about to difprove it if artfully manage for my part should make no scruple to paint fuch piece fince painter ought to flip no opportunity of get praife and with to have do it accord to my prefent ide of it if we omit do many thing for want of proper knowledge of they what can not the pencil of judicious mafter do if he will but fet about ir vet some man will not go out of they old road as be the cale of fellowpupil with I un der my father who on my ask he why he paint not other subjell as well as bibleffory antwer that

prone to but let we refielt on the two art noble and ignoble or antique and ardern and fee how much they differ both in object and execu tion the antique be unlimited that be it can handle fylery facr as well as profane fable and emblem both moral and piritual un der which three head it comprehend all that ever be be and shall be the pr present and to come and that after a excellent manner which nover after but remain always the same the modern contraribe so far from be free that it be limit within certain narrow beand and be of small power for it may or can represent no more than whit be prejent and that too in manner which be always change what be pal anl to come be without its power as alfe hiftory fable and emblem as well paetical and philesephic as moral hence we may judge what the modern art of painr be and why it can not be call noble much less have any harmony with the antigse could affign more caufe for this dilunion but shall at prefent omit they for two reafon firff becaute mens judgment be to various and each argue accord to he paffion and inclination in proportion as he like or diffife thing secondly which be the principal that may not be think to raile any sufpicion of partiality or prepoffeffion but why should refirain my thought ler I peak plain in spire of other fay then that altho modern thing feem to have some prettiness yet they be only to be efteem as diversion of the art moreover mmaintain that fuch painter as never produce more than one choice of subject may truely be rank among tradefman fince fuch reprefentation can not be call a exercile of the mind but a handycraft trade by fuxh remark as thefe we may fufficiently perceive that from apprebension knowledge and judgment pring ine luttre and elevaii on of the antique art of painting and contrarily that ignorance weghgence and selfwill debale and fubjelt the modern so that the ancient have not improperly place mlinervy by the one and midas by the other intimate by the former skill in the art prattice carefulness and a beavenly talent and by the latter imprudence blind leal worldly defert and hindrance but if any one would perhaps examine whether there be not mcar to make the modern noble as well as the antique that they might both march together they would find it to be labour in vain since thing ntique and modern chap fince defect once get foor be not ealily

who be accut tom to pobter manner view the lite with knowledge and judgment that be not as it ordinarily appear but as it ought to be in its greateff perfection whereas the other blinded by cultom

virtuon one for as much as the soul differ from the body and the body from the dress do nobility from commonalty virtue from defeel if any one ask where he shall find thofe beauty refer he in the

whence we may eafily conclude what great difference there mult be between painter who make the modern or defeitive life he study and excellence and one who follow the antique or make therough inquiry

bur firft he will much oblige I if he will pleafe to examine what have hitherto say and thall fay on this head becaute he will then be enable to judge whether re impoffible for I as some imalicioutly report to make the difpolition of a ordonnance with the due action of the figure and in they proper place and colour accord to rule becaute of my want of sight for would thefe man themfelves but open they eye they would quickly perceive that difpolition depend on politive and certain reafon firlt difpofe the apariment with the immoveable object after thefe the figure and laftly the colourg whereby affign regularity shall er of the moveable objeft at the fame time as laffert the por plscesof the window table and clbiet now do not fay on which side of the table either right or leave the lady be fitting becaufe tis needlel and the can not be difpot otherwife than the be fince the lookglat mult be place againft the light confequently the ought to front the light that the may fee shefeel in the glass for how could the thew she breaft front when the face be to be in profile and be the to bring the lock of hair over she bofom with she right hand and to put the left on the table she would be without sway or good pofture and from head to foot in profile let we next confider whether the pbilesopher could be otherwife dif= pose than where he be on the left it can no way be for two reafon becaute the globe be on that side very much in shade and therefore unfit for he conclation becaule he would then be partly in the light and shew almoff the fame polture as the lady where ver ought to be a oppofition again be he fanding before the table or clobe then we should nerther fee he motion nor he contemplation wherefore no place fuit he better or be more proper than where he rand by which this advantage alfo accrue that becaute he now receive more shade than light the lady there by get more beauty and decornm he can alfo more commodioutly view the globe and make he remark by turn he body becaule ofe side be juft fronting the light and the other contrary to it it may be the fame with the old weman next the clolet fince its i be poffible that the and the reft of the figure can be otherwile dispote with to much dvatttage and decorum no of thing antique and moder book iii this defiga could alfo be well manage in pountraiture especially in fumily piece of man wife child and servant for we find daily occurrence enough agree with fuch reprefentation but to difcourfe clearly on this compoficion and to thew that its found on good reafon we shall make some further remark upon it ifaythen that it will bear diver increpretation though as will appear below they may be bring intoone the lady at the table and the old woman at the clofer both fignify funity and yet it may poffibly be faid that the former may as well be take for pride and the latter as slanding before the plate and with finiling countenance rub she hand naturally expret coverousness the old man feen here as philolopher may confequently lignify philosephy but fay that this only teem to be of becaute if the explanation take that turn it can not be compendious emblem but confuled medley of diver thing from which no inference can be draw therefore tis proper to explain we thought of this composition thoroughly even to the fmallelf objelt gradually come forward from the greatell diffance the bullo and fountain in the offship as alfo the servant cleaning the hand rail tend altogether to funity as the old man with the globe reprefent vain contemplation for who can penetrate the secret of god and narure the senfe of the young lady and old woman we have explain before wherefore the true meaning of this subject be only to thew that all be funity which yet could not be ablolutely conclude from it be not the child there fince the other figure and object might be divertly apply to wit to pride covetoulness philolophy oc and therefore the child who imploy themfelves in blow bubble be now the soul of the work and without they there would be neither cornexion nor conclution even each figure would have dittint signiication and each call for diffinet apartment and though we be minded to exhibit different paffion into the fame picture yet fomething mutt be appropriate to each of they in order to thew ir meaning for picture be not in the fame cafe with froncispiece plate wheren be general reprefentation of the whole subject of the book vis the feven wonder the twelve month c aforefaid delign be alfo not much unlike true hiftory and might likewife ferve for moral or emblem foreach figure have its particularand proper charalter man incline to fudy woman to gathe ricne and goods daughter grow up in luxury and mif spend they chip of thing antique and medern time young and innocent child buty themfelves in triff to that on the whole the conclution muft be that each perfon in what he incline to love vunity if any one here object that affrenemy mathematick and philesophy be not vanicy as be afcribe to wife man he mull know that wife man themfelves be by some account fool wherefore pythagera though a heathen would not be ftile wife but friend and lover of good discourf and science knowledge often make wife man prefumptuous and prevent they confider with the phi lotopher that science be vanity thus we lee daily that the rich be haughty and difdainful the handfome proud and voluptuous thoughbeauty and pleafure like morningffower decay with the evening and we may well fay with the poet that voluptuoufness be shadow and momentary delight and therefore peer creature they be who covet shadow and tranfient happiness all which thing occur almoft daily even in one and the same family as we have more largely intimate in the precede chapter some perhaps may centure I for incroduce into the aforefaid example fuch trifle as pair of sandal which feem to belong to the old woman but fay they be not trifle but proper for luch woman as make idol of they houfe and chule rather to go bare foot over they floor than bedaub they though they have they maid always at they elbow with wooll cloths to clean after they but fince this satrifice to neatnel of houle be here in holland too obvious we shall urge no further but for peace fake filently reflect ob the vanity of too spruce durch woman even the maid as dependant on the miftress humour she vain defire however fince thofe serviceable creature in they condition have likewife fomething which thew vanity givethe servant in the example before we she coral or pearl about she neck altho the be as ugly face as vizard or like the peafant in latong time when turn into frog for how ordinary foever thole woman be they think themfelves handfome if they have but coral necklace and curl hair wherefore tis plain that fuch circumftance be needful and have in they place good effect t sopbiff term wifdom foolith fcandalous and vile pyrhrgora of same he rejed the name of syc which be give he of thing antique and modern book iii as for the ordonnance of dreff in this example modepainter may difpole they as they pleafe agreeable to they choice have on ly skerchthey here to thew that we may reprefent vanitas as well in the astigse manner as in the common way of modepainter chap of drese need not doubt whether the art of painting be or will be otherwife than tis at this time with respelt to its different choice becaute from the beginning there be melepainter and as each climate have its particular cullom in dref fing to each nation follow ir own fathion whence it appear that ancrint as well

who paint all changeable drapery with two colour only as yellow changiable stuff with blue reffexion they make the main light yellow and the shade blue and thus they manage all other truly great

viz purple violet blueand green ber we mult not ue colourof pure lake and white nor fingle light and red orpiment without urgent neceffity and then very spar ingly the green and red of one iint either

againtt durk and close boscage whire have fine effect especially naple velow red and light orpiment vermilion and fine light red again in light aparement of whice marble or light freeftone of in landskip paint light clear and full of sky blue purple violet green and black have good effelt whereas the colour before name be in this cafe not only difagreeing but they alfo fook veak and without strength except white which can not be ufe too much fince yis no colour and therefore fuit any where except gainlt shy nevertheless do not here affert that the eprbelliffiment in the aforefaid picture muft confiff only of light and warm colour but that they be incermix with some durk and weat ane and that in the latter pilture where we ule dark and weak colour for the byornament we mult difpofe fome light and warm ofter among they now fome may poffibly think becaute we place blue by the other colour that fuch would obftruct the ofsskip or that the lrointain which by reafon of diftance be commonly reprefent blue would be damage by so beautifiul spot but this doubt may he foon clear up by confider thatl do not chufe here all dark colour but that the offskip wiil thereby in some meature appear mere diffant faint and uniting it be alfo true that blue in landskip be often harth and make the painr look flar but by the darknel it bechme in this cafe foff natural and tender befide blue mention alfo violet green coc but my meaning thereby be not that tis indifferent where thofe colour be place as blue againft the blue of the sky green againtt green tree vialet againft violetffone or ground or light againft light and dark rel colour chap there nets againtt darknel for that would be improper becaute be light and darknel in landskip to we have always means to give dark and light colour they place with candlelight either within or without door or other light proceed from fire fuit violet purple blue green white black red without exception thefe be piece in which thofe colour have a advantageous effelt and wherein they predominate on they proper grounds for vellow and red be almoft the fame as burn candle which have great effect by night as it have none in the daytime becaute the sunfhine make it hardly perceptible now as the two former pilture confift of flrong colour viz white vellow and red and the two larter of purple violet blue and green yet thofe of the one sort may be join to thofe of the other in order to create a agreeable elixture and harmony by place with the rong some that be weaker and the contrary let each in its place have the matery on its proper ground but have particularly obferve that out of the three aforefaid predominant colour other may be temperof less force viz brown oker with naple vellow pink with white and fuch like and place they by the other as middle colour we may in conjunction with thote other setch out great mass fince white have its degree as well as red always obferve that the principal muft predominate both in force and beauty and that chole colour which be draw from it be dispert here and there thro the whole piece as be beft set off gainft the general ground have now plainly thew the quality and ufe of the colour and they difference we may ealily think that the picture wherein they be confider mult need be very affect we shall not here fay what where and how one colour mix with another be to appear becaute tis impoffible and unconceivable the principal method for obtain this secret be to obterve to robat pitch we work up we firft and strengeft celour and to let this colour predominate for which reafon tis maxim with some that we mult not introduce into picture more than one capital colour or colour which reprefent it but have already shew that fireral may in that manner be bring together in the same piece wherefore the eye and judgment muft decermine this point for if we find it proper to incroduce beautiful colour where we have mind to place fuch a one why should it be bad this only make it of its be becompany by by colour not well order as warm colour againft watin no colbax book iv and grey near bine whereby those colour have no eff of elfe by place too ftrong and too many capital colour by one nether which overcame the aforefaid beautiful colour and make the painting look fiar but that we may not mittake in this point let we chule any colour and in order to find a affociate for it take one which be difcordant as if we puch upon red take grey one if dark light one coc thus they be as proceed from each other join together and by fuch means we can never be be lot in tind different colour for different drapery ver with this provifo that in all thofe colour the ferce or distance of the figure muft be obferve for the ready obtain thefe thing have find out very eaty method which alwar thew I the particularity and harmony of the colour it even ofien help I with cerrainty over the difficulty about the difference of the colour in drapery especially tuch as be changeable firff temperon my pallet out of my general mixture three particular colour viz one for the main light one for the halfthade and one for the shade then take card and feverally paint they with one of the aforefaid tempered colour when they be dry place and replace and chift they to long as till have fansn my judgment sometimes when this would not antwer my purpofe thuffid they and then cook parcel from they at random which if they happen to pleate be my director this method help I moft in reffect drg fery which there by often produce very advantageous and of fine colour it be especially ufeful when have any doubt whether fixh or fuch colour would fint well with fuch or fuch a one or net for the card certainly shew I the thing as well as if have the stuft themfelves and fave I the trouble of uncertain in quiry it will not be amil to fay fomething further touch backgrounds ir often happen that perfon feesa colour in picture which feem to he very agreeable and yet on imitate it he find he colour have not the lame force and effelt thro he not obferve againtt what ground that colour be paint point worthy of the uimofl atten sion if we would avoid mistake in colour wherefore we mult al way obferve the greand and place of the colour if we would have we colour predominate order the moft difagreeing againlt it for inttance to make the vellow predominate place blue againft it or elfe the dark of other colour would you abat the force of fellow of colour place green near it and to bring it lower put colour which proteed from tellow whether it be free ftone of any thing elfe yellowith the fame manner you may handle all the reft of the colour obferve that as the object diminith by diftance to the colour mult proportionably be fainter and gradually more grey nature thew it and yet have find that we may place even capital colour in the offckip and it shall be prevent from approach by accompany it with colour like it and draw originally from it as we have before thew ch ap ii of the property nature and colour of drefe have before faid that the art of painting be a imitation of nature in she vifible pare nothing be impralticable to it and yet observe due order in all thing and as we have before thew the general order of the colour to we shall now handle it in particular with respect to drupery wherein it chieffy lie drapery confift of four kind of thing linnen silk stuf and clotb and thefe have each they particular nature and manners of fold they property be alfo different and to thew they by a ex= ample shall divide the kind into the four time

intelligibly there be four particular condition of man viz infuncy touth manhood and old age and each provide drel accord to he vear child should be dref in linnen young people in silk fullgrow man and woman in stuf and old people in cloth the colour for the leveral stage of life be thefe for childhood white for touth green for manbood red for old age dark violet and for death black in the firft chapter we have thew that whire and black be not account among the colour fince the one be but the parent of colour and the other the depriver of they wherefore we introduce whire light without which no colour be vifible dark fillemot or tawny shall ferve to repretent the earth or green nets white to thew the water blue the fir red the fire and black x colour iv black the darkness above the element of fire for there be not any mat ter or either beyond it which can contain or be penetrate by the sun be know that there be four seafon viz the joysid spring golden summer fruitful hutumn and melancholy winter in the spring we begin to leave off cloth or heavy winterraiment and to wear thin staf summer and hurumn permit we to drel accord to they heat either in linnen or silk wherefore certain authorlay that we cught to suir we dreff as well as we word to the seafon the seafon may be alfoexpreft by colour as the spring by green summer by vellow auturn by red and winter by black vet

alchoreffexion can not be well obferve in small figure yet we ought to fee by the courfe of the fold whether the drapery be silk cloth or other stult neat painter in lictle ought aifo not only to diftinguith the thick nets and thinnet of he dripery by they fold and corour but in the particular nature and colour of each drapery they diminution and variation as between thin and thick silk oppose to sattin and more iuch for if the eye at tirff sight can perceive and diffinguith they we ought allo to make they appear what they be chieffy in fmall and highlyfinith picture as absery and other

eafily mistake in the choice of colour and drapery bur mult here give some painter a hint about the nature of sruss especially coloured one they believe they can paint sattin after white silk and changeable silk after coloured silk but this be lame work for of colour chap what in plain silk be thine in the light will often be find quite dark in sattin wherefore in this nature muft be confult for thefe reafon the eye be pleafed when in painting of concourfe of people or publick shew it can eafily diflinguith all sort of people and the condition and age of both sex and at the same time they

and the relt of changeable or break colour for when they be feparate and the drapery large each in particular be to be fet off in the manner have before lay down for latlance if all the imall drapery be feparate from the large one and we dreit as many figure in they then each muft he further adorn with ocher small dra colour book iv drapery of colour fuit with it in fuch manner as the large one be before in word if we only confider that fingle colour ought to be incermix with changeable one and changeable colour with fingle ors we shall perceive what order this affair require in order to look decorous and pleate the eyc bur for further explanation shall give two example of it the fird company of be or fix aged people either without or within door now if thefe figure mult be all dreft it require no art nor be it sig not knowledge to give each finglecoloured and equally large drapery altho we might find as many different colour in order to join they agreeably and this for two reafon firft becaute that can not pappen in the life without premeditation and secondly becaute the figure may not see to be emblematic for though to the twelve apople be appropriate they particular colour yet we mult not infer from thence that if they be all affemble together we ought to give they colourfrom top to toe becaute though we break the colour tsey yer regain the same as blue with green reffexion remains blue fellow with purple remains fellow and of of other we fecond example be wanton meeting of yoing man and girl modithly dred accord to they year thefe be skip about and play in fieldor room now ie would not be at all proper to join all they dreff of break colour rogether though they be couple in such ors dera they require and for the former reafon namely that it can hever happen but thro premedication and necellity and though it would appear elegant and pleat yet not at all artful without a intermisture of some single coloured dragery nevertheless we find many do it or the becaufe they take no delight in changeable drapery or elfe becaufe the can nor paint they and therefore make thift with broken colour again there be other who have no value forfingle colour and therefore on all occation introduce changeable or broken one we have allo meet with chird sort who do not know how to make difference between changeable stuff and broken colour though its certain that reffeet or changeable drapery be a intermixture of two of more colour and break coloured drapery but of two as violet with red and blue green with vellow and blue coc whence they be call break or mix colour in the firff chapter treat of this management we have fpoken of refleit or changeable drapery and as we be now again embarked in the same subjet it will not be amil to explain the matter further many of colour fancy they make good reftel drapery when be well fold and different in colour in the main light greateff shade and reffection even rapbact and other great mafter have be mistaken in of do whereas good changeable drapery ought to draw ir refettion from the colour of which the main light sonfiff the shade likewife proceed from the ruling colour yet have fome tintture of the changeablenct and altho the drapery be changeable yet it have conflant groundcolour of the main woof of the silk thus tis wtual expreftiongreen and tellow changeable this then be the true quality of reflelt silk that all that be see frent on the relief keep its main colour but the side of the fold go of cause the changeableness which we may eatily perceive on lay changeable stuff fmooth on table or floor for view it perpendicularly from above it will then appear red or yellow but if feen parallel along the stuff often appear blue whence it follow as we affirm that only the fold which go of become changeable and alter in colour when the other in the main light and shade keep they own colour gain what in one stuff change red will in another appear green or yellow accord to the woof or warp by reafon of fuch accident we be oblige to have piece of par ticular stuff in order to thew the difference which can not be learn by heart becaufe of the nicety of the matter we have faid in the forego chapter that in a ordonnance of many figure we ought to obferve the sex age and condition of people and that each muft have he proper stuff the golden fuit deitie and thofe who be deify purple become prince thus each down to the slave now to thofe of weak memory shall thew good method for they become mafter of this point in chort time set down in you pocker book the follow head or title old

thefe notesyou mult often confult and especially when jou be about a ordennance of few or many figure voumay allo make column for the colour of drapery fet they down under one another as white vellow blue green red c and againtt they write they lining and ornament as have be fore mention it will not be improper here to obferve fome particular on diffe rent occafion in a ordonnance of many or few figure with reno colour book iv to colour not as if they be unknown of not obferve by in geaious artift but becaute they be ofcentime neglect and flight either thro carelessness prepoffeffion of a opinion that they need not be to strictly confine or elfe becaute beautiful colour be moft pleat to people and therefore they muft especially facisty the eye witho reflelt that they there by injure the art and they own reputarion such painter be like great talker who fay little to the purpofe truly the colour have great efficacy when well order and fuited but they raife a averion when unskilfully and confuledly dif pote a ingenuous perfon will undoubtedly agree with I that there be purticuler character which diftinguith one man from another prince from a officer a officer from vulgar perfon rich man from poor one by what mean then be this difference perceive be it not by he authoritative countenance grandeur and stately carriage and by he garb longer and of more coftly stuff and beauty than the other if of it will be eafy to apprehend that though fuch perton be nor endow with all the aforetaid quality but with the con irarr he ought neverthelet to be make know by fomething or other as we have thew in treat of ordennance wherefore tis needless to fay anr thing further in this matter to bring we to the prefent point touch the coisar namely to thew on what occafion they ought to be ute trastifuly and on what not for which purpofe shall exhibit tere principal occurrence as example whence we may deduce and order all other the firft may be council or triumph or fuch like wherein all the dreff ought to appear incirely of the moft magniticent rich and beautiful stuft in the second contil of bucchanal countrymerrymakings and herefmen sport the colour ought to be half beautiful and half droken each agreeable to the condition of the party and in the third be publick sigbt viz pleading mountebank tugghr merryandrew and fuch like make up of common and mean people coarfe stuft and dirty colour ought to be moft vi here be shill to be remark that in the one sort of colour as well as the other the moft beautiful excel and as thofe three occarrence be not common muft lay that among the meaneft as well as the bert there be some which have the preference among the beal of colour be some more beautiful and among the mean meaner one thus much as to colour in order to know good malter but ere we finith this chapter let we obferve in what part the colour stuft appear most beautiful fince stuft be very different in this relpect and have they diver proper beauty we lay then that black stuf be moft beautiful in they srongeft shade white tellow and red in they main and greateff light and blue green and purple in the half tint but all stuft not have gloss ought to be much more beautiful in they light than they shade becaute light give life and make the quality of the colour appear when contrarily sbade obfcure and extinguith they beauty contequently all object will thew they natural colour better when they surface be less smooth and even as we fee in cloths linnen leave and herb which be rough or hairy in which no glol or shine can appear becaule they can not receive the reffexion of neighbour object but thew only they true and natural colour unmix nor ting with that of any other object except the redness of the sun when by he fet he make the cloud and horizon partake of he colour chat iv of the disposstion of shady object either diffant or near against light ground againfl light and shade againft shade naturally unite againtl light ground fuit well dark figure and againtt dark ground light one in order that they may be ttrongly fet off however the fecr off of object either much little or less on the firft fecond and third grounds certainly differ very much now it may be ask when parcel of figure fland or fitting have white background and appear fome far from other near thers againll it whether dark colour would not be proper in all the three group fay they would but then they ought to be confidered in another manner for without intermix some of they with light colour they could not fubfift wherefore tis necellary to give tome more other let force the figure clofe to the white ground ought to be mix with light colour in order to flick to the light and to break the let they force and yet the dark colour will predominate the light one be only as fay to have communicativ colsure iv on with the white ground thereby to keep they diffance and to nite with the great light of the back ground the figure on the frond ground which come more forward ought again to have less tgbt celoar and the group on the fore ground the leaf whereby they have let comminication with the whice ground and confequently more force againtt it tis the fame with light againtt darknet for we can eafily perceire thar whice and black never approsch each other without partiapation the more black be mix with whire the more it incline to whire like large and thick felloon mottly light place againt dark ground now if vou would have this feftoon appear clote to the wall for tis not with nature as with picture you muft need ule in it some dark flower and leave order they about the exgremitr the mot whire or light to be in the part myt relieved darkening it gradually cowards the two excremity nearet

gradually diminith on each side tis certain that it will not thow tich decorum and relef though its shade be in proportion as flrong of the former ver tis oaly to be ute in cafe of neceffity when the marter and condirion of the place require it wherefore we muff accommodace ourtelves to all exigency this erfelt be not only proper for flower but alfo for fruit ornathent eren all kind of gold and silver ornament may with elegance be join together by the colour after the fame manner now follow a example in plite xkl dispote after the aforesay manner here on the fore ground appear five figure of man and woman againit white buck ground the three middle one clofe together be dark and slrong and the two on either side of litrle lighter colour whereby the croup keep a agreeable relief and ion on

muft always place darkness againtt light and the contrary but this be only medium thew agreeable to that polition how and in what manner light and durknet may appear either clofe together or diffant like the forefaid feffoon but it mult not be confider otherwife than as purt of pifture if we would have perfelt ordonnance we can order at pleafure fuch dark figure as thole againtt light grounds and the contrary for inftance would you have on the right side of the piece dark buth in the middle viflo and on the other side houfe or stonework neither light nor dark you may place gaintt the buth light figure or other object and in the middle gaintt the oftship dark one and againtt the houfe other again which fuir beft execute each correctly and in particular accord to the say example and then nothing will be want that concern the tine the colour join to it make the work compleat think have fully explain this point of darkness againtt light and the contrary yet feveral thing ferve my purpole hill occure ring to I which be forgor in the firft chapter judge they plo= per to be mention here fay then that all light colour cith be they break appear well againtt dark ground but not with

colour with which they ire intermix and fuit the ground as we have already intimate that in order to form great maff of capital colour viz vellow red or blue and they to predominate in a ordonnance we may enlarge or break such strong part with mixture of the same as red gniment with brown oker umber or tuch like which nevertbeless tellow after fuch manner we may handle all the colour to wit beautiful green with other green red with purple vio let with blue or grey yellowith white with grey and to forth in word if but one of the two be less beautiful chap of the harmany of colour hey who be converfant with book be fentible that few author have write of the harmony of colour and what they have do be to obicure and unintelligible that shall endeavour to make the point clear ir muit be grant that in every part of the art narure be we pattern fince the difpofe herfelf in the moft perfelt manner if we at any time difcover fomething fine and pleaf in she which we often of colour often do and yet know not the reafon why it have fuch elegance and decorum we ought to confult the rule of difpofition and shemony and examine with which of they the object agree by which mean we shall foon apprehend what decorum be and on what reafound harmony proceed from place faint colour againft rrong one and the contrary wherein fuch a union appear that the one seem naturally to flow from the other as in this inftance let we fuppofe a ordonnance to be divide into three grounds or di ftance place the principal figure in the middle on the foreground and let lome of they be firongly coloured and the whole croup as rrongly fing off by shady hollow rock come behind they place to the right on the second ground some figure beautifully coloured yet tint darker than thofe on the fore ground and behind they a airy greyithgreen buth and further on light offskip fill here and there with fmall tree let this buth be tint darker than the second groundfigure on the left side of which ground place other figure as of girl and young child in faint colourdras pery which though come againtt light building and the blue sky of the offskip will notwithflanding appear beautful and harmonious now in fuch difpofition we be enable to perceive hew each of the three part keep its diftance by the nature of the ground bebind it the foremolt as the ftrongelt and confift moftly of light ap proach with force againt the greateff shade and thofe on each side though almoft as light yet be limitted by they buck grounds which differ but one tint from they whereby they appear nelitferi further nor nearer than they really be from all which premife nre may plainly perceive that grant these three part or croup have like strength and colour yet they may by means of they back only grounds be bring down in fuch manner that at pleature one of they shall predominate and the other two retire would jou and have the foremoll figure dark reverfe you former conduct you purpofe be antwer thus you may cafily join grounds and ob jelt in order to fetch we harmony and by harmony one of the perfection of painting but the more clearly to evince the force of colour againtt proper grounds with respect to disfance thall explain the matter in fe cond example see plate kxil reprefent the boat as the neareff objell gill with gold and frongly glitter againtt the shade of the tree and rock to the foremoff

be frong colous yer the be diftinct in narare for as the vellow in itfelr egner than the red to the red require darker colour than the fellow in order to be fing on again if inflead of the figure by the riveride which be cloch in applebloffom blue we would I ocker colour as green or red we may do of provide as before we gave taem tuch proper back ground as will king they on with reipea to .. dillance for it muft be remark that alhg the be ceas vet there be no neceffity for give fain or broaen colour maxim with I that any colettr low erbry terere versus nelerate and refrain accord to its dzirr he colsir in this example be difpot accord to they rank of colour chap the ftrongione forward and the weaker in degree of dit tance accord to they nature only to thew the method of place they in word whether they be to approach because of they no tural strength or to retive by reason of they natural weakness but it fcarce posfible that in any subject all the colour should accord to they nature happen to fall to advantageoutly and there fore we may on any occafion alter they for inftance if inflead of the gill boat we be to introduce piece of white marble adorn with moulding and balsrelicfs and flrongly light the vifto behind turn into clole ground and the tree behind the stonework in read of greyith more fentible warm and approach this stone fay would have the fame effect as the boat and come forward with force though whire we all know be not to frong colour as vellow forherein it will happen as in camp where in the general abfence the lieutenant general command and in company the lieuignant for the captain and the enlign for he even the serjeant be not without he power therefore when ttrongnature colour be not in pilture the weaker tupply they place in greater or let degree as the matter require wheren lie the crisss of the management let I add to this inftance of the white stonework that it muft be the rrongelt and moft carch object in the whole ordonnance and that no arong object muft come near it to leff its force or kill it unlet they be weaken and bring down either by miftiness or by means of they backgrounds whereby they may then have no more force than braken golour chap vi of the disposstion of irregular object and light gaint darkness and the contrary place and ordering of object be of great moment for if after we have choien they all moft beaunful we difpote they careletly they will abace of they luftre again good ditpolition will make a object though unelegant in itfelf look agreeable to give some example of it thall begin with place kxiil on the foreground on the right side be lie a overfet pot gaintl large stone and both of they frong and warm in the light againtt the darknel of some high tree which be on the second ground on

chiefly about the figure this sketch thew as the irregularity of object in a ordonnance and how we ought to difpose they accord to art some bigh other low together with they force in orderto create diverfify decorum by object mean both the moreable and immoveable viz man cattle bird tree hill building csc as well horizontal as fall back behind each other as to force it confift in light againft darknel and the contrary for except by the diverficy of colour there be no other way than this to fet off object againft one another we have faid that the three foreground figure be flrongly colour ed and come againft the faint offskip whereby thew that in one piece there ought not to be two light on the same ground alcho they be both frongly fet off burthar one part mult confiff of frong light and the other of darkness yes allo eaty to conceive that the three figure becaute they come againtt the light offskip and not into shade mult need require dark colour contrarily the pot and stone be fer off againt the dark tree by general rule that when there be some bigbr object on one side of the compolition thofe on the other should be durk let we now view second example in plate x xiv as be a ob fervation depend on the former fee neither can fublift without the other this rend to illuftrate the management of light boch above on euch side and bebind one anotber and that we ought always to order after fuch manner when the former example shew we the irreculariry of objett in they high and low disposstion the forward firting figure be with the firff ground dark as be ing thaded by drive

fufficient to place here or there ground shade we mult alfo thew the occation of it that it may not be ask what caute it for all shade be not alike fome be more dark other more clear moreover they differ alfo sometimes in colour wherefore it will not be amil to fay fomething of it here though we shall treat of it more at large in it place the groundshade of tree often appear less of more green

allo of the fame colour thofe of a houfe or other heavy piece of stonework be grey and dark coc but to return to we subject les plain that what be demonftrate in thefe two example touch light and darkness above on each side and behind one another be the same when reverf namely if that which be now dark be light and the light dark les alfo indubirable that if one of the light be take away the ordonnance and agreeable harmony would be fpoil at once even to much as not to be bring right again without general alceration for inftance fuppole the walking perion be dark above how could he be fet off by the column since we have before faid that darknel againft darkness be improper and be the column to be light how should we manage the sky and if the sky be dark behind the column that would be as bad again for the whole fore ground and all upon it be dark and the fecond ground be light again wherefore every thing would be in diforder and indecorous from thefe premife we may planly perceive that this be conflant method for management and when good difpolition of the colour accord to they qualicy be join to it for we know tharobject have various colour of which we can chule the moft proper the decorum will fill be the greater and the eye more pleated tree though they appear always green be yet diverfify accord to the seaion and they toture some be seagreen other deep green this rullet that greygreen thefe again light green other dark green groands likewife differ as hilly sandy clayith and muddy stone do the same all which we have fully shew in the firft chapter of this book as for colour pv meas pone except what colour have they not in fine he who well underfland the ordering of the colour and the face they will never be at lot but let he especially observe that in any ordonnance whether of hiffory landskip or any other branch one side maft be contrary to the other not only in light and shade but allo in height and dench the defign of thefe two example be not much unlike that in the forego chapter yer here be greater variety for the former be of the force of object either dark or light againit contrary grounds hereas thefe though grounded on the fame obtervation thew we how they be to be order above one another when it to fall out for inftance we fee group of figure on the fore ground againll another on the second groand fomewhat higher and that againtt another silf ligher and to on to the ciel or sky we have thew in chap how we ought to let off object behing one another and to unite they with the ground but thefe example reach firft how light and dark object on another ought to be manage to as to ferve each other and that each may keep ir dillance secondly how for want of shade we mult make thife wirh the of colour lattly how irregular object ought to be place againtt each other which be the soul and life of a ordonnance especially where there be many people bur tis not confine to human fioure for it respects all sort of

especially as there be some object go off which thew the point of sight the second obfervation be the harmony of light and sbaile as in the former example this examplethen thew what method we may take in order to fetch out fuch esfelt and tis for that reafon that this point be exhibit feverally and in different manners which we may make ute of as occafion offer as much or as little as we think proper though never too much fince variety tire no one but be always pleat as here viflo there bolcage houfe coc here wind road there again build hide part of the offskip here level ground there river befet with tree partly run towards the point of sight and then bend either to the right or leave cross the piece round rock and at lalt to difappear variety feed cor tinual delightful defire but we mult know that it principally respects ordonnance in the open air or landskip chap vii of agreeableness in irregular and contraft object we have not knowledge in compolition all that we endeavour at be extravigancy even should we bring out good difpofition it would be ow to luck when wellorder piece though indifferenely coloured will always have a harmony the truth of this find clearly evince in irregular object which give life and motion to a ordonnance as we have leveral time thew in treat of ordennance and alfo in the firft and laft example of the forego chapter this motion be happily ferchout if the contraft object be confiderately join for by this mean they will meet each other to colour iv agreeably as perfectly to pleafe the eye not as place thus by toture but as the refull of a artful compofition by the irregularity of object underfland they form as when one be high another be oblong this point that quire round oval c bur ere proceed further shall thew the ealy mechod take in order to get the knowledge of irregularity firft draw all fort of figure in different action as fitting stand foop lie walking coc and cut they out with scif for next make skerch of my ordonnance and lay it down fat and put my cut figure upon it move they about cill be farisfied where to place fitting fland or lie one how many fair here how few there and thus after much thift bring forth good ordonnance which then delign fair make fuch alteration in the action of the figure as think proper yer retain ing they pofture in general leave large and fland one where they ought to be and the small one lie or fitting in they place and to forth by this means have find that landskip with many and small frgure ought to confift of lurge bywork for fet they off viz large and crofe tree heary stonework broad grounds coc and withindoor in palace or apartment there ought to be behind small figare large and flat wall with few ornament for be they to confilt of many part all would feem alike large and be we to place by large figure lome large part all would appear small or to speak better equally turge large object mult make another small a oblique one anothererell and square one other point or round for contrary muft be bring together that the one may thew the other it be the same with light if large part confiff either of light or shade let one be the ground for the other for inftance if on the fecond ground large part be in shade let the third have some charp and glitter light this will help the broad shade and wanton light but thole two choice require different management the principsl ought always to precede and the other to be fubfervient to it in landskip the immrecable object predominate and the moveable one ferre only for ornament contrarily in a ordonnance the figure be fird dispose and then the bywerk for when we fay that a upright fland figure mult be place by bend tree and crook ed stem by ftand figure we underlland by the former the stem to be the prinip and the figure the affiliant if in landship but colour a hiffory the figure be principal thus it be allo in a apartment with architecture statue bassrelief and other ornament the irregalarity of object do therefore give particular decorum and elegance for what satisfaction would it be to the eye to fee some beautiful grape and melon lye each in feparate dith but if grape melon or other gibbous round oval and large fruit be groun together they would add luftre to each other we know that lmall houte vifibly magnify temple or pa lace and that long and low building make tower or maufoleum look high such contraricty as thefe be many and to name they all would be as tedious as impoffible wherefore shall content myfelf with mantion some of the chief plate xxvl the example no

alwar predominite chap viil of gring object againt faint grounds and the centrary or dartress againt light and light against darkness in already speak largely about the management of the colour which be one of the capital part of painting have take great pain in build some rule thereupon with view that when occation require might give good reafon for to do under my prefent misfortune this comfort be leave that now have nothing to hunder what firmiy purpote and therefore can confider it with more vigour than ever even imagine it in degree equal to nature herfelf fince lnow perfeclly the strength and nature of colour and they efict confider then the follow example plste kxviil whether it be of moment the man warm fillemor drapery be againtt the faint offship the woman in light blue draperr agaumithe tree behind she or beautiful skycolour blue and pale red again dark beautiful red and rofecolour or purple and whire thefe be the principal and moll luitable alceration befide changeable stuft some perhaps may ask whether the blue drapery which we place here againt the oftship do not contradict what we have formerly faid namely that blue be rechone among the weak colour andyet here we affert warmth againt faininel and the contrary to which a iwer negatively becaute wecall warm colour thofe which be purc and unmixed erz beautiful skvblue beautful fellow and beautiful red whereas when thote colour be mix with whire they warmthnolonger lubill becaute they durkness give the glow we fee on the contrary that light blus lighe fellow and light red even whireirself ferre for weak colour againtt the dark as this example shew the reafon why ought now to be of fingle or capital colour be becaute the ctiship be make up of to many tender and faint colour of colour chap shall have no communication with it which make the one the better retire and the other approach do the fame contrarily this small example be of fuch nature that any ordonnance of what kind foever as well within door as in the open air aterfrom must thereby become good if we incroduce inflead of the offskip building with batreliet figure or other ornament of weak colour or elfe of marble it will antwer the fame purpofe and if inflead of the tree we exhibit curtain grotto rock or other building of warm stope it will be the fame again with respect to colour but if come againt fist ground of one colour whether grey or white then that figure map be of different colour or changeable stuff likewife if we place bagainll a hlange or partycoloured ground that figure muft need be of fingle colour or drapery wherefore we be enable to judge how far this obtervation extend yet as this example shew only light and darkness we shall fubjoin another in plate xxvill aforetaid with third or middle tint which with the former will fuffice for give right notion of compote all sort of ordonnance as well within door as in the open air as before faid alchothe delign be to confifl of or more group observe the grounds againft which they come whether faint flrong diffant or near to the end those croup may by the force of light or weak colour obtain they due beauty speak not in reference to any one in particular but all in general we find that when dark colour be place againtt faint offskip they be vilibly fet off and make the one appear diftant and the other near and the more when we fet some light and weak colour on the fore ground whereby shey fill have greater effect as we may obferre in figure from which premife tis plain that the fame can be effect by the contrary method to that the argument of some namely that rrong and warm colour ought always to be place forward in order to approach the more and the weak one to be in proportion to they diftance the fainter the further be intirely overthrown for want of contider that the strel lie meftly in the back ground the example now before we be like the former the fore ground excepted which be add to it the better to explain we mmeaning in the order the colour to advantage by which method we can difpole we ordonnance with cafe and to as to ferch out beautiful harmo see plate xxviil aforefaid no colour iv place on the leff

againtt which the basket be ftrongly fet off chap ix of the painting object dustily there be rill one thing which many painter careletly pat over though very ufeful and elegant if well and naturally obferve it relate to suck object as be duly as well in roomsa in garden for though the former be fomerime fweep and the latter clean yet pedettal balluftrade parapet vafe and statue always elcape gallery and publick place for walk in be likewife feldom clean ed it be therefore in my opinion very improper in thofe who with great care reprefent the prvement of the faid place with stone of diver colour very difinctly joint one dark another light without the leave spot of unckanness which make it very difficultto get good decorum or caule thole pavement to look fat without offence to the lyc caut moreover a exceffive stiffuet be the colour ever to well order whereas ufually in large apartment daily walk in we can not in the aforefaid dittind manner perceive what the colour of the floorare except towards the extremicy and next to the wall wherefore the middle where be the moft walking must appear dull wiit of colour and almoff of one tint some painter expret the compart ment of fuch floor so diffinttly that you would even imagine they be wer grant indeed that lometime in the life it be of by means of the dark stone yet if we break and make they lictle lighter they will then not pare so much and yet be no let natural if a apartment be furround with marble surbafe and in the middle of the room be gill ciftern by which the floor may very well appear prong becaule of its agreement with the marble and the glitier of the ciftern for my part should rather chule plain floor than compart one but if we lie under neceffity to introduce the latter the beft mechod will be to unite the colour in fuch manner that the tint differ but little from each other this obfervation do in a especial manner affect landship fince tis certain that the part which abound with tree whether wood or side of road be fubject to rain and wind and by means of dufl or sand the green tomb pyramid vafe and all other object in fuch place be to fully and cover that the true colour of the faid object be hardly perceptible for inftance in fuch as we now speak of fland red tombon black plinth now if we make this tomb or plinth too dark or too frong it will look as if it have be wake whereas contrarily it ought by means of the dult of the branch and leave which fomerime fall on it to be to cover over that we shall fcarce perceive whether the tomb be red or the plinth black alcho some may think this obfervation too triffing and far ferchbe nevertheless highly neceffary in order to find befide by other Ithods the litelibood in picture whether it be for break thereby in fome meafture and uniting object which through the nature of they colour would have too great force or for any other caule fet not without reafon that it may not appear too affect but here methink hear some object that if we thus oblerve in every thing this dull and sully long gown and train cloath cannot be free from it especially thofe of woman which be commonly of beautiful and light colour and muft confequencly be at the bottom as well as they white sandal more or less dulty to the no fmall laughter and wonder of the people to which antver that ishould more wonder to fee perfon come dry out of the water than cleap out of dufl and dirt for though we do not fee it obferve by other who have always make the sandal beauriful and white even those a colour book iv of common soldier as well as of general and train gown the fame yet fay that this obfervation do not tend to countenance aetake pot to make we mindful of the nature of thing and to expret then in we pilture with all likelibood more or lel as the mat cer require not fuperffuoulty but in moderacion virtue which tak = ing place in other thing should not be neglet in this point ju dicious mafter will obferve a equilibriam in order to prevent

as in poor people countryman and fuch like with old and tatter cloath which wear not without foil and gather dult but this obfervation be of no ufe to thofe who not apprehend the caufe of thing will

rxenenynernkgsgnsnynanryyaratayexkrrearrenrrennrafenrh chap of the different light of pitture jvdge this point to be one of the moft important in the art of painting for without thorough knowledge of it tis impostible to make good picture wherefore shall thew all that by discourfe can bring as the refule of what have learn by many observation and long experience of common light object in common light have no broad fharp light and they shadesare uncertain the lecond tint and shade keep they own co lour much better in clear he without cloud becaute the object be light on all side without vapour appear fentible and more relieved than in sun fhine this light think beft for pourtrait and fuch object as we would have enlighten from without the picture as a open gallery or fuch like place and though the object thus light have d light and shade no great force we neverthelet find that the may teuch both in light and shade be firenger than in otber light this light get great elegance and advantage by low horizen when if make greater shade as under the leating of tree mould ing and projecture of building and fuch like of the light in cloudy sty we need not wonder why the object in cloudy air appear more fentible than in sunthne or clear weather becaute the air or capour be moftly exhal leave the object below without mis riness and thus afford much charper tranparency for view every thing without the leat obstruction for which reafon thing in cloudy air teem lel to go off from we and appear dark and near and of more beautiful colour especially the green of grat and tree of sun shing light object enlighten by the sun be more or let mifty as the sun thine frong or weak for this reafon that the atom or mote between we and the point of sight feem more deafe by the strength of the sun than in common or clear light and be more or lel tinged by which mean the shale of object become faint at ence and go of more suddinly than in another light wherefore we may ealily conceive that though the shade be broader and more fenfibly limit than in another light yer they appear not to charp as fome mafter have by mistake expret they efoecially berchem in he object let than the life this indeed would be well enough in cover place as gallery palace apartment where there be no he where by the object then appear more perfelt plain and less retire suppofe for intlance you walk thro tome fhady tree it be cer tain that comin towards the end of they you will fee the object in the open air plainer and better than in the field the prospective glat evidencly prove this be the day ever of clear obferve then in general that as have faid the object grow faint more fuddenly and difappear in sun fhine which herein principally differ from com mon light of of light and sbade of the light in hall room and other apurtment for piece to be hang againtt wall of apartment the common light be moft proper if the difpofition of the light of the place will permit as be the moft moderate and agreeable when well and naturally expreff this conduct then be principally to be obferve in it that the figure and other object be light more or less ftrong and bread accord to they nearness to or distance from the light of the window and though fland on the same ground they ought neverchelet to be different in force of light and dullness of shade so alfo the groundpade on wall grounds and other object should be some sporter fironger and more sensible than other the figure clofe to the window mult therefore certainly receive they light from on high and have sorter groundshade than thote which be further from they but as it may havpen that the object diffant from the aforelaid light may receive light from other window to they sbade ought alfo to break more or let and to become faint becaule they be encompatt by alarger light besides reffexion from the wall the shade of fuch object be alfo warmer than in the open fir where the blueof the sky and vapour very much weaken they and make they faint we mult likewife oblerve in general that in a apartment hang with red vellow blue of green all the shade of the object be there by reffect and partike of the same colour but the touch and shade of the fainteft object will appear the firenger compendium of the light in cloudy weather the object be let retire more warm and more fentible in clear weather without cloud little more retire in sun shing weather sill more retire and less fentible in fogey weather as at the latter end of the vear or in winter the moft retire and more fuddenly difappearing the groffer the air the more body it have and the more body the more vilibly light whereby the sight be thorten and the object appear more indiffinct thus much as to object in the open air thete of light and shade thefe four particular light naturally handle be certain proof of skilful mafter and it would in my opinion look very agreeable to fee fuch piece king by one another embellifh as follow in lgudy weatfer the

the cindition of the he or sky sky be wide expantion feem lower or higher as tis more or less replete with vapour now the sky be certainly never without vapour fince be there none it would be very where blue as well on the horizon as over we head but we fee it appear lighter next the horizon than vertically becaute the vapour fog and diminiththe beautiful bluetbere tis allo plain that the nearer the air be to the earth the more denfe and gross it be and in proportion to ir afcent the more rarify and tranfparent the vapoursare likewife more or let fentible in proportion to they dentity of rarity we of light and shade muff obferve here that when the sun rife in the eoft it be then in that part lighter on the horizon than in the three other and at noon tis lighter in the south and to round becaute this large heavenly body communicate its infiuence to every thing near and bout it shall now demonterate by a example the reafon why the va pour the further they be from we become the lighter take thin gaule or to vard long and ftrain it in the open air on four pole mark each vard with crotline number to place yourfelf under no and look along to the end of you will perceive the blue of the sky less in the second the strain divifion and the further fill lefer becaute the thin thread doubling before you eye there by thicken the gaule more and more and abace its thinness or tranfparency infomuch that at latt you perceive nothing but a intire white stuf suppofe now that the star be up and you be to make the same experiment you would find they to appear most diffintt in the firft division and ditappear in proportion as they go off which be plain proof that though the air be ever to rare forward or near yet it become groffer the further of and confequently more body must beceive more ligbt tis for this reaion that the star be never feen very near the ho rizon and if we do perceive any thereabout they be but small and weak between the air and water there be no difference the one feem to be a impreffion of the other to wit both of they light towards the horizon and the air over head and water forward both dark as for the ground or plan which receive it be light from the sheven do not find it necelfary to arlign other reafon for prove that the cafe of this be quite contrary to that of the air fince perpeltive thew that every thing enlighten if it have but folid body darken more and more the further it go off from we suppofe for inftance a open gallery foot long have a even floor you will perceive the firft foot to be the lighteff and to on to the further end less and less light the same may be obferve in figure cleathed in wbite and how much the firft will differ from the lall peak only of what be in the light for the cafe be quire different with what be dark and in shade as we may fee when figure be dreft in black that then they become lighter and lighter by the thickening of the vapour no light and sbade the object which appear in level field when the air be without cloud and the sun hide either behind mountain or tree will receive light from all side and jet keep they relief by reason of they firong and dark tourb they colour be not break but retain they nacural beauty and though the sun as before faid be hide den by fomething and can not then shine on the object they will neverthelet receive more or let light from the fir on the side where the sun be hide without alter the colour that the blue of the sky be no colour we can plainly perceive by the object in a open field when the sun or light cloud fhine not on they which be not in the leave tincture by it as be nothing elfe than vafl remotenct or height from whence it come forth and therefore not able to impart this colour to the object as they do they to one another for want of body since we be treat of the virtue of the he it will not be mil to fay fomething of its reffexion matter worthy of obfervarion fince in that point be offen commint great miltake and to explain it we thall exhibir the three follow example the number fignify the tint as be one tint one tint darker and tint darker than the precede the figure plare kxik be tint darker in shade than bfor this realon that the trunk of the tree have rough superficy which can gire no light and the white houfe contrarily can give great light or reffexion now if the houfe be not there but lerel field inflead of ir would rather be lighter than darker and if the trunk and buthe behind it be alfo take away thofe two figure would have like shade whereas now we fee two fr gure on one line or ground one darker and the other lighter thoughthe darkeff shade in the latter keep they own force which do they appear otherwife would be againt nature and the rule of art the second exemple have the fame obfervation now be well alture from experience that if we be to give to tome who have never feen this sketch or know the reafon of it a oatline of the follow or fuch defign difpot alike and one figure as far from the tree as the other be near it fland in line parallel with the horizon in order to shade they accord to they own notion they would reprefent they both alike in light and shade though by a infallible rule he who fland furtheff from the tree have more light round about he than be who be nearer and therefore it can not poffibly be otherwife than as we fee here exhibit to wit bone ti of light and sbade in shade and in the ground shade and tint in shade and in the groundshade now behold the woman on the fore = ground who like have one tint in shade by reafon of the re flexion of the stone fland near she the groundshade upon that stone confift of three tint and if the stone or any firch hindrance be not there the ir would caute the fame effect though not of rrongly some may poffibly think that the houle be too far to caule fuch reffexion and that then the figure ought not to differ to much but fay that the trunk with the maybube behind to interpole that the figure can not receive any reflexion from the houfe and therefore it mult naturally be one tint darker in shade than would you make farfeichopposition and dress in white fay then that there would be no need either of the tree or houfe when yet ir plain that the one as well as the other be thus order to ferve for a example the third example plate xxk confirm the two former in which we plainly fee the reafon why object be weaken more or less in they shade not only by the reffexion of other object but allo by the fir on the left side and the groundshade the fame which be darken more or less beyond the reach of the faid air or reffexion as it appear on the three column in which tis evident that the groundthade of and be tint fainter than that of the pillar by the light of and the air and by the airalone the pillar be about halfway from the bottom darker in its reffexion than above and its groundthade one tint darker than and by reafon of it be fland nearer to and whereby pillar come to caft it be ground shade on which groundhade cover the light of whereby this laft can not reflect thus far againtt nor in its ground thade thefe effect happen as well in sunfhine as common light without the leave alteration we exhibit here another example in plate x xx aforefaid which afford no lel confideration than the forego and whereby thew the force of light and the mainlight touch upon object and how unlike they appear in two object alike accord as the horizon be high or low and bare the inttance and cand the proof of it that it can not be otherwife the cafe be the fame whether the light be sunfhine of common or whether it be front or fideway the horizon be as we fee between both hlead and the point of sight b light and shade sight in the middle or fomewhat more to the right side the light proceed allo from the right now confider how the two head and though have one and the fame light differ in they main lightouch have thofe touches on the forehead and all the project part as nofe and chin under lip and to forth and have they on the rife of the brow corner of the eye befide the nofe and along the check tip of the nofe and chin cc which atteration be only caul by the point of sight accord to its pofition either high or low when the objelt be they of what kind foever if but smooth and even as marble copper or the life ittelf fland under a high horizon the aforefaid mainligbttouch go upwards and on the contrary defcend the more the objelt be elevate above the horizon as we have faid and be here demonftrate now obferve cd of the fame stuff as the foremoff head and light by the fame light where have flrong height ening on the rife part which defcend more or less as it rife above the horizon this example be of great mloment and procduce uncommon thing in which we should fometime be at loss and which would not occur to we in many vear peak in reference to thofe who be too contident of quick conception and do not duely weigh thing for it mull be allow that without the knowledge of perspective it be impoflible to trace truth from the secret of nature in order to bring it to pat in we work tis true we can imitate the life gold or silver por kerle dith or other chine piece of houhold fluft as fine as the life but may be vaftly miftaken in the ule of they in we ordonnance if we do not regard the motion of the glitterings which be as various as incredible and yet all thofe thing may be eafily apprehend if we underfland and fometime prattile per feftirc chap iii of reffesion in the water he reprefent reflexion in the water be certainly not of the leave moment and they agreeableness make they worthy to be naturally expreft but as there be not affign or will be find any certain rule for they without the id of perspettive to be lofl labour to feek any for which reafon some land kippaint light and shade often pat over the reffexion in the water to avoid the trouble of perspective neverthelel the incomparable pousin have not forget to make ule of they and he have get great reputation there by lpeak of nicholy who be as famous for landskip as figure and who never meet with any difficulty which he do not furmount have earneftly apply to this point confider whether there could not be find other thorter means to effect it than by planning line coc that to agreeable part of art might not be neglect and after long trial difcover the follow method take a oblong board of what size you preafe and place thereon some waxfigure as clofe to the edge as you think proper or according to they diftance from the water which they ought to have in you pilture bend thefe figure into fuch action as you sketch require and place they by means of little bit of wood or potter earth as high or low as you defire then take trough make for that purpofe of lead wood or tin paint within fide with fuch as you want whether black umber or terrevert and fill it with water and fet it againtt the board and figure as high or low as you skerch s ground direlt next fix you point of sight and after have find you diftance place yourfelf there either rand or lit and thus defign the figure with they reffexion hlighily allo mark the shade then fet you layman to each figure and delign it very carefully fix the layman each time in the place where each figure ffood to as to fee its reffexion like that in you sketch here especially take notice of the length and breadth of the rerexion for it always shorten more than its object becaute it be to much lower under the horizon when you place the model or layman as much above the horizon as it reflect under it and delign it thus correctly in order to paint after it you hold the draw uplide down here you will poffibly fay that the reffexion ought to be reverwhich do not difown but then you can make a impreffion of you sketch on another paper and there by perceive the good effelt have proceed thus far and paint after you skeich you may be affure every thing be right but here let it be obferve that the reffexion mull always be perpendicular with the object above they as if grow out of each other as we may fee in plat exxl this light and shade book this merhod relate not only to the placin of figure but all the object of what kind foever as horfe dog pyramid stone with batsrelief vafe por and other thing and whether they be forward backward or at the side of you painting you may inflead of watertrough ufe lookglat but tis not to narural as the water which may be make to look deep or shallow and as dark or light as you pleafe by place little mud grat or sand in the bottom of the trough as for the colour experience teach that the more the water be enlighten by the sky the more ancertain the reffexion be and when the sun fhine directly on the warer the object will appear ib be uncertain as well with respect to we as thofe who view themfelves therein for the reffexion then appear only as defcend ray without any shape as we fometime fee by candle the moon or other thing which give only reflexion on the surface of the water whether in sunthine or by night becaute we can not then perceive the trantparency of the water the reffexion in the warer though it be quite dark and clear be never so light as they object witheut but always tint or a half durker now to reprefent the reffexion in run water you muft firtt paint it with light and shade on ground rub thinly over with firtle rough oil then take large foft pencil and here and therecross harch it but better way be to take long hair s fitch and make the stroke as clole as the vein of the waterrun take care not to itrike out too much of the we line but as glass be diaphanous body and therefore have so confancy or fixednel nor can effect any thing but by means of fomething elle have more body as by the earch which be firm body this we fee when the glass isfilver or pirched to with water the cafe be the fame which will produce no effect nor receive the form of any object unless there be firm ground to fx its transparency as we mavice by piece of ice have lay enough of the reffexion which concern object out of the water it will be neceffary to oblerve fomewhat about object pand ing in the water point well worth we notice on account of the uncommon occurrence which happen in it though as little heed as if they be on the land and no water thereabouts we mult fuppose the water to be like the air and that the object between it and the air feen from topto bottom appear the fame as if they be uplide down againtt the he there be no other dif ference of light and shade chap between the light of either than that water be little fainter than the air as may be apprehend by lookglat in which the object though they appear ever to plain do not come up to the life irtelf thefe thing be premife tis eafy to conceive that object rand in the water be enlighten as well from below as above peak not here of the reffexion of object but of the object theyfelve and they shade as may be see in plate kxxl aforefaid the man who extend he right arm over the water receive flrong refexion from below of violet colour like that of the air above he along he chade side and he left arm across he breaft receive double reffexion to wit from the water and from he body whereby tis of more warm colour than the other the young man bfooping over stone view himself in the water in the shade of the tree by he thew that the reffexion of the water be like that of the air but little fainter as faid before the face on the stone exhibit the fame but more fenfibly be allo light from below here we muft further obferve that the further or higher object be from the water the more reffexion they receive as may be feen in the mand who with he breaft be close to the warer without any reffexion becaute the light over he can not thine on it fince he be flooping forward and thade the warer to the ground with he body thus far have experiment and from whence other circumfance may be deduce by practice in the mean time we may obferve how much thofe object differ from thofe on the land of which latter we muft note that the more theyrife from the ground the less reffexion the shade receive be caule the light of the grounds be on the superficy they maincan they own conftant colour touch the reflexion in the warer befide the contraction and reffexion have be long doub about the irregutarity between they and the object themielve fince perceive by the rule of optick or prattical perspettive that there be fomething more to be take notice of apprehend alfo that as there be air and sun above and below to thote two light mult need caufe a uncommon effect in the object and they glitter or main heightenings but yer could not firmly conclude how or in what manner and the rather becaute which be much furprifed at never hear that any perfon have certainly demontlrare it atlaft find the greateff difficulcy in explain my concepbook of light and sbade do to give sketch of it caute a inquiry to be make into the truchirfelf as plate xxkl aforefaid fhew wherein we plainly fee how far thing may fometime go beyond we gueffe thofe who try nice experiment mult be rejoice when they make greater difcovery than other we fayhe who seek find but nothing be to be obtain without labour and practice obferve then that the stress lie here in the mainlightteuch as the aforefaid figure plainly thew but they may be qualified accord to occalion and as you think fit both in the object and they reffexion we take then for example the object fland on the water be under the horizon equal to they height and receive they light from the right they fland on each side of the point of sight and have they proper light and shade accord to perspective as allo the mainlight touch or gless on the relief the same experiment may be make with all sore of object in all which we may perceive how much the reflection in the water as well as the contraction will differ from the object themfelves this be a uncommon obfervation but study will make it familar chap iv of ground shade accord to the difference of light will not be improper to make some obfervation about the ground fhade of object and the course of those shade accord ing to the different light proceed from the side round to the fore part as perspective decermine exactly the length breadth and depth of thing to tis impottible to reprefent any thing duely and well without it though as may fay we be to practife the art a hedred vear and the ordonnance to confift of but two or three fi gure s will not fay of ten or more tis no wonder that we to early caufe young arrift to learn perspective before they take to com polition tis even commendable if they underfland it but indifferently and thun thofe who not only reject its rule but laugh at thofe who fiudy they converfation very prejudicial to young and unexperience tyre but to return to we subject we of light and shade chap find great dvaniage in uing sidefight in we ordonnaice with respelt to the greandpade becaute thole shade whether for ward or diftant always run parallel with the horizon without any forefhortening which we may eafily find without perfpective as may be feen in plate xekil fig becaute they may be conveniently meafure with pair of compaff or clfe gueff at we may then well perceive how much eafier this be than where the light be more front and the groundhade confequently run tomewhat oblique and thorten and therefore not menfurable by the compaff much less to be gueff at thro they great variety and diffimularity if the object change they place the ground pade alfo after one run almoft parallel another more oblique and thorter and other kill more in proportion as they go off from the side whence the light come as in fig whereby be thew method for finding fuch groundthade thout trouble or loss of time in what manner foever the light fall as to the frentlight as in fig mult further premife that as in such cafe the groundfhade go off backward to we need nothing but the point of sight in order to find they and they forefhorten ing can be only find by means of the gradationline which thoughfmall trouble may be fooner make than read my method be this firft skeich no for my ordonnance fix my horizon and point of sight at pleafure then begin with the foremoll fig and shade it and ftrike its groundfhade at random accord as fuppole the light to be little front next fet my line whereon be mark the gradation foot on the right side further draw parallelline from the foot of fig to the aforefaid line which thew its distance now in order to exhibit the courfe of it s shade lay my ruler to the foot of fig trace its groundshade up to the horizon where make uttle star from which star fetch all my other groundshade both fore and offone from one side to the other whether figure stone coc now to find the length of all thefe ground chade draw again from the end of the groundhade parallelline to the gradation line then count the degrade foot suppoting the figure foot high and ii groundhade feer long go foot into the piece as smark on the gradation line thus may all other object be manage by ly count they height in order to give the depch of they ground thade accordingly to ses no light and shade tis now eaty to judge how difficult it would be to find the variation of shadow without fuch line as aforefaid this method have further advantage in affift thofe who will finith all they figure after the life for by the courfe of the say groundfhade we can prefently know where to place the model or layman with respect to the light of the piece as we have demonrrared in we drawbook chap of reffexion in general make this obfervation plain have think proper to it luftrace it by one or two example becaute tis one of thofe principal beauty of picture whereby we every where dif corer the malter ir not improper for weary huntime or nymph to reft in shade as in this example plite kxkiil here they fit forward in the left corner of the piece on green bank againtt wall quite over run and shade by the tree on the top whereof here and there be feen some lmall frong light the fland figure receive the frongelf light almoft down to the knee and the remain part uniting with the ground fhew its diffance the light of this figure have however not to much force as to give the wall behind the fitring figure any reffexion partly becaute those figure be between and partly on account of the roughness of it as be full of break hole and project branch and leave which double the shade and admit little or nothing of the reffet ray of the figure we fee con trarily that the figure fitting over againtt the light object or figure receive without hindrance firong reffexion the one from before the other fomewhat fideway accord to they firting either behind forward or in the middle tis of great moment to thew plainly the true caufe of the faid rerexion as to diffance colour and force of the colour shall lay this for the diftance have already shew that be the faid light frgure drel in beautiful light red and frongly light by the sun and the four firting one dreft in purple vellow blue and whice they would certainly be adulterate by the red reffexion and parly lofe they own colour in order to take that of the other and be mix with ir as for inftance the purple will become red the blne of light and shade viclet the fellow rulfet or fillemor and the white applebloffom of flethcolour vet some more than other accord as they receive faint or flrong reffexion diftant or near moreover the naked will become more warm not all over but in the part which be ting by it for the air round about be feen let or more whe the in the shade of between it and the part which receive the re fexion the second example in plate x xxiil aforefaid shew the break ing of the shade accord to the place as well in colour as force the stonewall be of ruffet and warm colour the fland figure dreft in white or light colour be with the stone and ground about they lighten by common light or sunthine thefe object hew we that though the light which come upon they be pure and unmixed they shade be neverthelefs quite adulterate becaute they be hide from the air and furround with warm ground and receive no other light than from the refiexion of the faid ground the colour whereof the shade take we fee the contrary in the undermoft fly figure to wit that the more the object approach the air the cleaner they become and keen they own colour as appear in the uppermolt figure which be half in the air and not the leall alter in its shade lave that it become little more purplith accord to its distance which may be vifibly see in its underpart and in the loweff fly figure which be flitl in the dark and can not be rouch by the blue of the air be of quite different colour from the uppermoft to wit more warm as be allo the figure which fland below formerly few mafter underfood reffexion especially among the ialian among the french we find some make ufe of they however freely own that fuch of the iration be there but one who obferve they underffood they in perfection and the french but indifferencly though vouter oot he repuration by they have therein do much more than all the french and iuhan which make I believe that the reffexion have not be long in praftice fince we yet find many old piece wherein they be not at all obferve can not but think that at that time they be unknown to they buss what be kill worfe fome as laftman rotenhamer cc do not knoty when a object be in shade on which side it ought to be light or dark wherefore they shade it like other which be in the light more or less as if it be glaze to much darker for ifflance in piece light from the right side you will fomcrime fee fisure in cc light and shade the shade of stone or other object now the sharle of this figure imtead of be sn the right side occasion by the stone they make on the left like all the reft true sign that they know nothing of re hexion rrphaet himself be not expert in ii for at that time they know nothing of place light againt light and dark againt darkness on which occason the reffcixon come moft to pass whereas they fight the chief effelt and harmony in oppot light to shade and the contrary and therefore need no reffexion moreover they avoid all great shade and broadness but nowday the manage ment be quite different we be for great sbade and what make a ordonnance look finer than great shade and light whether building with figure and batsrelief woody grove or any thing elfe quise in shade agreeably light by the reffexion of greand rir or other light object certainly give the eyc great satisfaction with respect to pariety and at the fame time produce a agreeable union and tendernet as well in the whole as the part of picture ne verthelet it fare with riffexion as with all other thing superffuity caufe surfeir there be allo fome who to delight in reffexion that they thew they at all adventure and will often expret almoll imperceptible one with the greateff force by vermilion ultrama rine red orpiment ccc we find fuch chiefly among the fleming as yordaan ruben and many other we mall take then particular care not to reprefent any reffexion without thew the reaton of they and how far or near they be to they caule that we may rightly judge what force or weakness they receive or give in word that we need not be oblige to ask wrence the reffexion proceed why it be red tellow or blue so brong so faint ch ap vi that sunskine have no more force than common light with respect to sbade certain that object light by sunchine have no darker or fronger shade than thofe in common light though they seem to have tronger for the blue of the air be light more or let be cording to the sun s strength or weaknel and therefore keep atways the same tint asi prove by the firtt example in plate x xkiv the of light and shade column whether plain of ornament with bat relictlike the traja or antenine be fet up in the middle of the field and at diffance from it at the side of the piece a high tower or bulwark the groundhade whereof above half cover the column wherefore the sup chine powerfully on the upper part only and yet we shall aind the shade from top to bettem of one and the same tint tis the fame with the light of candlein darkith room or in the evening which though fronger and of more force than the other light yer do not in the leave darken the shade of the part on which it come but let they remain alik as we fee in the second example the lantern in the boy hland light the object near it in part when the refidue be light by the window we lee then fay that the part illuminate by the lantern do not become darker in the shade than if the say light be not there and if the dayhappen to be thut in and night approach it will not only be darker about the say light but all over but its quite the reverse with transparent objett luch as stuft laballer horn cec for want of the solidity of the precede objett as we fee in the third example suppofe that the column either of paper or alabafter receive its light thro small opening either from the sun or candley you will find the shade about the part of light to be more or let light accord to the strength of the light in fuch manner fiat it may be plainly diftinguithed from the other shade whereabout be no licht this obfervation especially prevail in nudity and transparent drapery in nudity light by the sun we shall find the small or thin part to be always more or less transparent as the eyelid nofe ear finger coc and therefore they muft not have firm shade but tis contrary in stoneface for though the sun fhine ever of frong againtt the thinneff part yet they will not be tranfparent but remain as dark as the thicker and be this face to be paint with beautiful and natural colour it can not be like the life but rather dead perfon fpeak with respect to tranfparency for we know by experience that the blood be warm be thin and tranparent but when chilly or coagulate it be corporeal or folid wherefore its certain that in this cafe dead perfon be more like stone than natural figure we can plain ly perceive this in flaughteroxen when the entrail of light and shade eotrail be take out and candle fet within the carcass the breaft and part between the rib will be more tranfparent while the fleth be warm than after be cold and have hang loager it be the tame with dead body for if candle be fet behind a ear or next to the nofe they will not be tranfparent the fingle fold of thin drapery appear more tranparent in sunthine than in common light and have therefore sainter shade than coarfer and more thick veftment but the shade of double bang fold especially when they be clofe together appear in sunfhine mach bronger than in the fingle fold of thick stuft leave of tree do the fame the difficulty be thus folve namely that the strength of sun thine or candle do not make the shade darker than they be in common light we fhall to accomplish we purpofe thew wherein the sum strength confift matter eafily to be apprehend by thofe who have well weigh what have be before faid we find by experience that object light by the sun have much greater force than thofe in common light which be not effect by rrong shade but by they broadness and sharpness which common light do not gize either within door or in the open air some imagine the strength to be greater in the sun than in common light which can only make object approach in proportion to they magnitude di= ftance or nearnel as mall life and large life yet fay that common light have this property as well as sun thine what difference then be there between either no other than in the one broud and sarp sbade and in the other more round and melt one the formercaute plain and long groundshade and the lawer short and uncertain one hereby we properly dillinguith sunthine from common light that the one be more forcible than the other be no wonder the proof appear in the two follow example in plate xxkv better than can express it in word of thefe the firtt be light by the sun and the second by common light both alike in darkness of shade the one tharp with long plain groundshade and the other the contrary once paint a emblem or rather narciffus view himfelf in the warer cook the light more front as tis commonly order ed in sunthine with a incent only to thew how apprehend sun thine with respect to the melring of the sharpness and alfo to avoid groundhade which child head near he would have caute on the cheek of nurciffus the principal in the piece and he left check already of ligbt and shade in shade if the light have come fideway which would have lookto very offentive that he view could not have thewn the beauty wherewith he be to much enamour it be moreover indifferent to I whether the light come from side or be more or let front becaute it respects the general delign no more than if it be intirely front tis true that large groundhade caufe the greatelt elegance in sun fhine if they come not too clofe together for then they look dilagreeable and caule certain melanchoty in pilture but appear more pleafant when intermix with gleam of small light to break they too great breadth call this piece a emblem becaute the poct fay that this vouth fee he own likeness in the water fall in love with himfelf now this fort of love difcover vain conceit or weak paffion in man to far cloud he knowledge and judgment that he be infentible of what he be do for the more natural expreft which senfe have place near narciffus child with fool cap fawn on and embrace he and decking he hair virginlike with flower and to thew the delight he rook in he folly he motion and look bespoke one affect with the reffexion which the child shew he in the water this piece be richly fill with bywork as figure architec ture bolcage cattle flower and water with delign to reprefent all the particular object light by the sun each accord to its qualiry and in the moll faitable manner .. it be thoroughly finith by nish undertland when every thing be in it to the moft minute circumftance not when only the principal part be expreft and manny small circumftance leave out or when thing be curioutly foftcaed as fome by the word would make we believe be that as it will have not leave every thing unfoftened becaute the difference would then have be to great that the piece muft have have too much nearnets fince ir certain that as object go off they become more uncertain the fmall and fubile thing luch as fmall fold and feature difappear yet the painting might well be faid to be finith fince very thing be in it that ought to be with respect to its distance have before paint the fame delign for model of that above be lay on flat and not in the leave loffen whereby the difference between they be very vifible now mult own that foften be havery allur and have a apparent distance however we may always perceive that the one have as much force as the other we have before affert that object light by the sun caute greater force and motion than in common light which fome imafine of light and shade gine proceed oply from the sharpnet of the shade nowg irlis to in some meafure with respect to they broadness but principally for the plainness of the ground hade which the object caft on each other whereby thingsare often break and divide in fuch manner as if all ire deable even lix figure in common light will not fometime give to many piece as four in sum fune whence we may plainly perceive that sampney grve nearness foften more and more as the object go off to that no object whatever can thew any sharpness untys they ire mir becaute of the air interpol between we and they if this seem strange and unincelligible due inquiry will make it ev dent wherefore fargue that the nearer the object the more plain and fudden be they shade for as let he interpofe between we and the near to it muit increate in proportion as they go off here it will not be unneceifary to relate particular accident as contirmation of my aftertion have formerly faid that in my vouth make many delign in watercolour now have one time among other paint one which by reafon of its farve and hard pencite of diilik that purpot to try to give it better face though be to tpoil it inirely firt irry it with the glare of a esg which not fucceeding fix it on paftboard and make brim of wax round it then pour clear ifinglat on it and let it dry by which mean the painting become as neat and toff as poffible and thew it to one of my incimate he be to furprized that he could hardly believe it to be the fame piece be caufe the body of the kinglat have take away the aforefaid hun griness and hardness but afterwards on inquire into the toture of thing this experiment appear not firange or wonderful to he by this occurrence would intimate that mill or he take away all shargness make thing gross and rough feem light and fmooth like vernith or gluegloffing every thing in nature before we eye touch object light by the sun they can not by means of rrong and dark shade and with tellowisness only look natural or fimay becaute there be no difference between this and other light with respect to force mean in objectslet than the life the sharpnets of broad shade and the form of groundshade with the co lour of the light and they rellexion how weak foever can natu rally effect it but object as big as the life be beyond we power if they be only to confift in force now fome may paffibly fay that then it be the better to be represent in little to which mull antwer of light and shade that then the painting would not go off in proportion fick to the frame of which we shall fay more in another place chap vil of the groundspade in sunshine certain that the groundfhade in sunfhine which contribate much to the decorum of picture confiff not only of length broadness and sharpnel but in conformity with the object which caufe they whether pillar pyramid square coc the groundsbade of a upright fland figure fall on the ground or any thing elfe must be perfertly see even to much that though the say object be not feen or be hide behind fomething yet we may judge by its groundhade what shape it have which be one of the principal token of sunthine some think this no great matter and that when they have ftruck on the ground long stripe of certain breadth that be fufficient without shew whether it be the shadow of pillar or man speak of this can not omit mention blunder of certain great mafter he have reprefent st . francis in the wildernel on he knee at praver with extend arm before crucifix as he be generally exhibit the piece in itfelf be very fine but caft my eye on the crucifix which be compofe of small twig of tree perceive that it make diffinct shade of the whole on the ground though be almoft balf in the shade of the saint but what more furprifed I be that he body with the arm in the same po fition as the crucifix but ten time bigger do not caf like sbade on the ground but the shade of mass or block without arm now we have faid before that though figure or other object be hide behind fomech yet we can judge by the groundshade what shape or form it bas as shall thew in few word for inftance place perfon in palace or apartment behind pillar or the like and let he be light by the sun he shape will plainly be feen on the ground by he shadow again would you introduce into landskip pyramid tower of bulwark which be not there it may be do by means of the ground hade when it fall into the piece from the side of the light whereby the object and every thing be longing to they will be plainly vifible no light and sbade book ingeious pritter of sun frine have still a fidvantage above other that they need not make any high tree hill or building in order to create here or there large groundfhade for bring forward fore object and fling off hinder one they order they shade where they think proper and can always fupport they of do with reafon becaute we often fee in sunfhine fmall driving cloud shadow whole piece of ground and another ground shall be light again and to feveral behind one another thus they can divide field at pleafure into light and shade in order to thew thing greeably have with great attention obferve the colour and shade of the sun light and find especially in the month of september bout er in the afternoon when the sun be ftrongeft that the sky have clear blue colour intermix with small driving cloud as for the object when the sun chine flrong they appear as if heighten ed with red orpiment and whire and the shade reddith grey as white black and little brown red mixt together not uniting with the blue as in common light as some imagine but become gradually liitle more violet and grow famter towards the horizon where no blue be to be feen the treeson the fore and second grounds appear finely green the blue of the object be greenith the red be orange colonr the violet ruffet and thus all the colour in pro portion deep ltater thone on become greenith grey this exact obfervation agree perfectly with what have formerly experiment ed in bright sunthine by means of fmall hole in the window of darken room by which faw naturally on the white wall as on paper the reffexion of every thing that be move withoutdoor but let we proceed further to confider whether mit chape shadow do not make object unintelligible beaury in general fublift either in figure landship of other object exhibius all thing plain and diftinct in they shape and form without dimination or breaking then for thing contrary to each other can not poffibly raife a agreeable beauty in we eye nor convey to the sent true idea of they form unless by medium confift of second or middle tinr which unite the two contrary part namely light and shade when they come too sharp on each other thereby to foften the deformity on the objeft and to unite they fpeak of thing which be the broud which make round objelt inflead of look ing relieved feem quare or angutar as if in sunfhine where fore of light and shade they appear not beautiful but mif hapen and the reafon be plain people be not fenlible of any other deroram than what occor to they eye for its certain that thing alter by the leall accident whether of unufral light or shade which make they frange and unkhown let fome boatt that be broad and the bett manner maintain that though it be sunthine it be all one and the fame and if we be to fpeak of what be agreeable and perfect that it ought to be know that pitture with common light be the most perfect light which fiew as more exactly and plain the preper form of object what be round remain of and the square alrering not as for the mifhape of thing exhibit in san thine we have fufficiently thew they as alfo that the sharpnet of deform shade spbil ifie true propercy of the object for inftance fuppofe two fland figure talk together be light by the sun if now the one call shade on the other to as half to cover he face we need not doubt but he will becomelel know even where he parent in arcbiteffure or moulding it happen as bad becaute the ofenfive sharpness of the shade distigure and confule they form and neatret at once think it therefore sign of pufillanimity not to fay cowardice in landskippainter always to make choice of sunfhine which be certainly but fmall part of he arc as if a architect be to be continually imploy about cheff or box flowerpainter about cattlepainter about cow or sheep stilllife painter about scull or hourglass seapainter about sloop or boat of statuary about crucifix he be no hifforypainter who al way repreient a herodin with st . john s head in charger or rab herfelf or tael with a hammer or st . take with lamb all which be but particular incident which fcarce deferve name a arriff therefore mult not be afraid to exhibit every thing that can be repretent with every sort of light but the opinion of molt paincer of sun chine be as ridiculous as that of thote who always practife common light boch proceed from millake or ignorance whereby they can not rightly judge of thing difter from what they have be always ute to now they judg ment be only conclution agree with they apprehcation in poilt which they precend to undertland and which therefore ought to be thus and thus when yet it certain that before we can judge of thing we ought firft to inquire into they and by comparifon between boib to observe wherein they differ dd light and shade book sun fhine be not to proper for hiftory as for landskip and bechirelture arife from heace that on fuch occafion it be obftruct and appear hard and unpleafant by reafon of the sharpnet of the shade and ground hade as we have before incimate neverthelet if the matter require it it muft be ule yet with fuch caution that no mit chape ground pade appear to obttrult the sight or create a averfion but if sun fhine be the beft and moff advantageous light facepainter would certainly ule no other of which to this day we have not one inftance becaute firft the colour do not fhew themfelves in that light to be what they really be secondly becaule be impoffible that either man woman or child can without trouble and a alteration of countenance especially dour the eye and mouth fir any time with they face in the sun thirdly becaufe the sunnever fland sill but be always alter fourthly becaule the sweetnet of the feature would thereby be poiledatonce and laftly becaufe it would be very improper to hang fuch picture in roomout of which the sun be keep ii would be ridiculous and abfurd to fay of woman that the be unlike man unlet they to refemble that we can fee no difference be tween they for as the woman be like woman and the man like man to there muft need follow one of thefe conclution to wit that he can not or will not beeir we could add third as contempt of the woman namely that the be not incirely like man but this laff which arrend moft people judgment be moft ridiculous and to be especially thunnby thofe of right apprehention as be often the source of hatred and envy and even ruin as experience daily thew in those who thro prepolfeffion defpife every thing that difagree able to they work and fancy shall not enlarge on this point but keep to my purpofe of thewing the prepoffetfion of sunthinepainter as well as other and to be the becter underftand premife that there be three thing wherein the whole matter contift and which we muft firft fix and diflindly ob ferve namely sunshine common light and faint light which differ from each other as much in fact as name the firft be grong and shurp the second bread but not sharp and the third faint and mekting the firft caufe di hintt groundshade the second make melt one and the third faint one the of light and shade chap firfl receive ir colour from the sun the second from the cload and the third from the blse of the sky we will fubjoin that the firft may be confider as man the fecond as woman and the third as child who will now fay that the child be not good becaule be not to lut ty frong and bright as the father or mother or that the woman be not of becaute the be not intirely like man obferve then how thefe unthinking sun fhine painter judge further of the second and third light it be not broad fay they whereby weare to underfland that tis not of funny and charp in shade as in they painting broad broad they fpeak to they difciple in to low tone that no stranger muft hear it as if it be secret unknown to the very

propoficien may peffibly feem flrange to fome and perhaps fein but be in fact to far from it or be tritle that tis matter of moment and found on good reaforn we take ir for grant that the sun differ in force from other light and be tint lighter weather abound with drive we often fee in changeable cfoud that the sun be obfcure by very thin and hang airy vandour in fuch aianner that whole tralt of land howle hill cc even whole wood be overfhadow which shade however be thin and exhibit all the object more or let plain than in common light but let we come to the point which be to reprefent in commonlightpiece sunfhine with one and the fame force of colonr each in its degree without impedimet to each other mean when the sun be not forward or in the front of the picture or be not too much fpread which would there by feem too flar to do it therefore accord to the rule of rt divide for in ftance landskip into four grounds of which let the firft be whire and the three other diminithing in proportion let the fecond whire ground ferve for the sunfhine now tis plain that as the common light on the fore ground alrerdy pefeffe the force of the coloar it muft need follow that the sunffune which be one iint lighter as before faid and have no other force than the fame white can alfo have no nearer place than that of the fecond ground plain proof that if it be place on the third ground ir will dit for to much more in force now in order to diftingwith the ditte rence between this light on the second ground and that on the firfl and to reprefent it narurally we ought to exhibit the shade and ground shade of the object parp broud and long whereby we may per of lishss and shade di perceive that this be sunlight and the other with dall and pert groundshade to thew that it comm light but the better to con ceive the nature of sunlight obferve its colour in the morning and evening to aid thofe who may not prefencly underlland what have faid thall lay down fhort method of management in certain and ealy manner have sketchyou delign and fetile the part which you would have enlighten by the sun dead colour it neatly as if it be to be throughout common light but in the fecond colour you mult fomawber mere beighten the part which be light by the sun whether whiter more yellow or more ruffet accord as you would have they and to as to perceive visible diference the shade allo to he mere diffint and bread without make they glow except here and there in the reffexion now if on the fore ground or about it there be no white we have a opportunity to throw here and there on it some sunrays by the force of white fellow or ruflet accord as the sun colour then appear which could not be do if we have before lay the sun force in the offskip here let it be obferve that if we enlighten some forward object by the ray aforefaid they ought not to be of ligbt and brightcolour marrer fuch as whice marble or light free ftone very light drapery or beautiful carnation but of fuch tint as appear dark in common light becaute thefe frongly heighten with the sunlike whice will teech out the same light now to finith the work with certainty and to find with eate the proper tint of object light by the sun proceed thus temper you white with red or yellow orpiment more or less tellow as you would reprefent the sun early or late then inflead of pure white mix it with you light firff tint of all the object which be light by the sun whereupon you will find each colour to be break accord as its qvality or force with respect to its body differ much or little from the reft thus the work will have the detired effect as experience the daughber of irath can reftity chap book of light and shade chap ix that the sbade of object in sunshine be not more glow than in common light ny be fuch stranger to the truth of thing and to iide enquire inco they that to retain they groundless habit they flight reafon and maintain they erroy this be evident from they univerfal opinion that the shade aff object be more glow in simhine than in common light which intirely deay but that the shade and reffexion become lighter and lighter in proporton as the sun chine rronger be true that the sun light be more glow than common one be indif putable for as the sun light be more or less vellow or red tis natural that every thing he thine on should partake of the same colour not only in light burallo in the shade which receive the reffexion of the grounds and other near object but as there be no object what firong reffexion foever they receive which do not here and there preferve some un reffect shade as when one object be cover by the groundlhade of another to the say shade ought fince they have no communication with the sun or he reffexion and be of another toture to be moregrey like thofe in common light as receive no co . lour bit what the airgive they hereby think we can beft diffinguith between sum thine and common light wherefore be ftrange that people who commonly feek shade for the sake of coolness will notwichttanding hove they warm tis therefore no wonder to find to few winterpainter have teen winterpiece of brengel as warmly coloured as if for midsummer even the very lee and snow as glow though in winter all thing receive light refiexion and have little of no shade the groundfhade be lighrith and blue and yet every thing have it diftance and go off though fome contrarily make they offfhade as warm as the for ward one for this reafon tis neceftary for the artiff fometime to exercile himself in sunfhine and make due obfervation on the narure of it not make it he conflant praltice but particular and agreeable study if he can not be perfect in it he ought at leave to know as much of it as of common light in order to ule in he work fomerime the one fometime the other as occation require some think becaute of the of light and sbade the broadness that sun thine be more eafy than common light but it be not of lince think it as difficult for sunthine painter to repre feat common light as common light painter to exhibit sunchine with respect to nacuralness many perhaps may differ from I in opinion becaufe in sun fhine the groundshade be diffintt and li mite whence they deduce this argument that in piece light intirely from side and the sun have meridian alcirude the groundfhade of all the object appear third let than they full length and therefore they may be correctly meafure by the com pafle each in proportion to its length on to the offship which willingly grant and to which will fay further in they favour that be to be practife not only when the grounds be level and horizon tal but likewife in up and down grounds where the compaly be utelet if the ground drip the groundffade will do the fame do itrife they do to too as the know in perspective well underfland thus far fay they be in the right but fuppofe it thould happen that the piece be light from within or from without be it not thes as uncertain as in common light and becaute the compaff be ufe less much more troublefome to find the shade and ground hade and they enlargement forward and offdimination which ought to be as fentible as the sun be either off or forward contrarily how ealy be it in common light where they be small and dull the task be therefore not to ealy as fome imagine who endeavour only to reprefent right or lett fide thade to reprefent the sun in all pofition be quite another thing and there be few fuch painter for we do not eafily find sunthinepainter meddle with common light but contrarily that commonlight painter will fometime practife sum thine and the reafon be plain the common light take in every thing wherefore he who underfland this well can eafily give inco sunthinc the point be only that sunfhine be warm in the light but not in the shade as fome imagine now it fometime happen that two piece sun fhine and common light hang together both have the utmoll force of colouring and to alike as hardly to diflinguily the sunthine the light be in both alike and broad for fince the word broad be come into fathion some will paint bread whether it be sunthine or not as well within door as without moreover the light and shade warm what now be to be do when two fuch picture muft hang together in order to diftinguish the sun fhine nothing edia verily than to abate the strength of the one fomewhat and heighten the force of the no the light and shade book the not by make the shade darker but by more warm and bright light with long and diffinet ground shade not only broad but barg underfland here that the common light piece ought not to be inferior in goodness in its kind but not broadlight or shaded unlet the caule plainly appear bur we feldom fee too fuch piecestogether do by the fame mafter becaute moll painter make but one of the kind they bufiness and if it once happen yet they do not think the one ought to be lighter than the other and if they be do by two different hand each mafter endeavour to make the colour anfver he own inclination thus it happen that the sun fhine painter be in little concern bout it for they thinkbe my objeft to appear by the force of light will by the strength of fiery shade maintain the superierity we have faid before that in proportion to the sun strength the reffexion become lighter the reafon whereof we shall now explain we find when the sun be low and the object be firongly light that they receive flrenger reffexion from each other becaute the sun ray fall not obliquely and glancing on the object and thofe on other dut ffrike directly upon they and return reffexion contrarily when the sun be high the reffection of the light object can not touch the other with fuch force becaute the reffexion of the light mutt heed revert to ii origin for inftance if in a high light two man fland in difcourfe and the one receive the sun on he breaft and the other on he back the light which fall from on high on the breall muff need reflect again upwards whence it come and therefore pat over the other head to that the former figure can there by receive hone of but very weak and almoff imperceptible reffexion thus think to have thewn that reffexion in sunthine ought to be reprefent much fronger than in common light the proof of which may be deduce from the life itfelf chap of the difference of ground shade preceed either from the sun or radial point piste x xxvl the firft example thew the suh place of quarter which obferve as eafl and opposite to it in the well be building which be light throughout from the eall not ray proceed from point and grow wider but by fuch as light and shade chap parallel to each other mean not from the ceater of a affign sun at the side of the piece but from the whole quarter wherein the sun be or from the whole side of the piece as wide as the open throwhich he thine into it the second example thew the contrary to be falfe when the sun be directly behind the object the groundhade be not ferchfrom the radial but another point for if this be good it mult follow that when the sun fhine directly thro the middle of street he would enlighten both side of it which be contrary to nature and to what we have shew before and in the third example tis plainly vifible that when the sun be in the eall and the room in the well the objelt on the ground muft need be light directly from behind as well the one as the other without the leaff difference which they groundthade and the line of the floor fufficienly thew both proceed from the point of sight and the latter shew we the eall and weff through the whole room the fourth example in plate kkkvil affirm the fame repre fent southern colonade light direct by the sun which be in the oppofite point of which bund each column throughout call its shade againtt the pillar behind it not proceed from point but by parallel accord to the rule of perspective the fitth example contrarily thew great miltake which yet be often commit in make the groundshade proceed from a aftirn point each column feem to caufe particular ground shade which be against rule and the nature of sun fhine it will not be amiss to fay fomething here of the light of grounds to wit that in what manner foever the light come whether from behind fideway or front the plan or ground will always appear alike that be in the front of the piece the moft light be the sun ever to low nay on the horizon and not only the flat grounds but every thing that receive light the reafon whereof be to evi dent that it would be superfluous to fay any thing more about it than what shew in the fixth example of fide frome and backward light which perspective fufficiently jultify if some think that when the light come from behind or fide the ground mult be light otherwife than front for many keep it always moft light on the side whence the light proceed allow it with respect to candle or torch but peak of the air muf lay ligbt and shade book fay they do nor at all underfland the mitter indeed it would not be very improper in ground run off from the light but level floor or grounds can not admit of diminution be they if may tay of thouland scep long nay the ground will always be moft figbt forward without any difference let the light come from behind or forward think no arriff will be to foff as to ask how then it shall appear whence the light come since tis general rule that the shade and groundhade of the object plainty thew ii and in cafe there be no object on the ground the air if there be but the leaff cloud will make it fufficiently apparent ch ap xi of the representation of different light in the same piece think ir impoffible for different light in the same piece to look well for fay they if it be good raphact caracer tition pouffin and other great mafter would not have reject but approve that manner even the french hcademy which be arrived at to high pirch unanimoutly agree that no more than fingle ligbt be necelfary and reject picture which have more wherefore they judge that double light be only the invention of dutch maf fer who do not underfland the antigue but only follow nature in order to pleafe ignorant to all which antwer that though rappact poxfrm and other great mafter have not thew it in they work but only keep fingle and common light we muff not infer from thence that they defpite or reject that manner as contrary to toture but they neither think nor know it art not be in they time get to its perfection in this particular ver do not fay that piece with different light be better than one finglelight if naw rally reprefent mean only that if it to fall outand be judiciouly manage it give painting diverfify elegance believe many common painter will not much thank I for dit clof this matter becaute should lover defire fuch piece they would have more trouble in do it however ler every man do what he will or can it fare with we art as with other if man will learn all thar neceitary to become good mafter he may do to or if he be content with halfinquiry no body will call he in croftion for ir but he who be able to repretent fingle light well maj of light and shade in my opinion alfo do the other well how many brave malter furmount every thing they undertake what should hinder they exhibit three or four light as well as one but let I not here approve the manner of some land kippainter who introduce many small light into piece fond conceit without any bafis think it proper to handle this marter of different light to thew that we ought not to regard the partial opinion of ignorant but always chule what be moft natural and agreeable mean that we should enrich we ordonnance in general accord to occation and without affectation for which purpofe we shall here exhibit a example with different light plate xxkvill in expeltation to hear what difficulty some will raife againt it we fee here building or gallery and before it mote of water on the brink whereof be man faften boat near the water lie a heap of various

be light forward receive it light from southegf from south from eqt and like from southeqt appeal now to man of judgment whether the light ought not to differ from each other as well in tint as sade and the fieldd to the step receive as aforefaid they light from south ealt in which point fuppofe the sun to be wherefore the air be there lighteff the south a the right side which light the gallery only through a opening thereby become ettle darter than the forepart of the piece the step in the offskip cover by the rightlideiedge from south and south eall and by the left from north mull need

think to have fufficiently clear the point touch the nature and effect of different light and alfo shew the advantage of know they as well in sunfhine as common light with respect to the variety either in landskip or other subject together with the abundant means they afford for carich a ordonnance and that above the common method fubjoin that in judicious ufe of they we muft be very careful in they difpolition that they may not as have faid seem force but natural and neceffary that there be general union and that the principal part have it predeminancy xil curious observation on sunshine

by thew the miltake of fome and the good qualines of other as precedent for thofe who would get honour by live embellifhment three young painter have once controverfy about the repreten tation of sun fhine they be each of different temper one cross and politive another meek and of good judgment and the third be by the other generally account filly in the end they befolve of light and shade chap each to make a ordonnance and to thew they skill the two firft chofe one and the fame delign see the sketch in plate x i the firfl have give all the object without diffinction yellowith light and make the shade firong and glow there by precend to express the sun as fet not confider that he there by expote he ignorance as have make the groundthade too thort the second have expreft the shade and groundfhide not to charp or to long as repretent the sun much higher and little fainter yet herein thew to much more conduct on make the woman and boy who be look at a huntlman found he horn over the wall whom the man come out of the gare thew they pur they hand over they eye as nature teach when the other who have repretent the sun much sronger have not take any notice of that circumflance the firft place man before the tree sleep in the sun the second contrarily have place he in shade behind the tree and tome other people be fitting in repofe againtt the wall in shade to avoid the sun heat the third have make delign of he own fee plate xll to thew he nice obfervation on the sun which the other as count he filly at firft latch at he have reprefent naked boy firting in a open window and make bubble with pipe the child receive he light forward from the common light of the room thro the window appear the top of fome houfe and part of column with sundial affix to to now on nice examination it appear that this latt have bett bellow he thought on the sun and that neither of the other have thewn to many good effect in they piece as he in to small compat for firft he exhibit the colour of sunfhine in the sky and on the top of the houle fufficiently differ from the common light secondly be not enough to reprefent the sun ftrong or weak or with long or thort groundhade but we

xiil of the sun three quality we ought not only to view as far as we be able the win der of narure but allo to reprefent they likeness so we shall now make we obfervation about the moft beautiful of thing wtho can be infentible of the three quality of the sun viz he splender hest and colour can any light exceed the sun in bright nets and clearnel or any fire be more invigorate or confume or ant colour have greater power the sunbeam fay certain poet penetrate the depth of the sea and render the fundy grounds ligbt imperceptible thing sensible cc what light can effect what this do it be faid that lightening can blind the eye though this be rather caute by its suddenness than its light as for the sun s hear ovid tell we that phacton be of a ambitious temper infortuned he father to let he

themselves be all weak and faint if compare with the absolute beanty and splender of he lively colour therefore very much wonder that fuch a ignorant can be find as meet with about gor year ago even he who fat up for great mafter plainly affer that the sun be blue may asure bluc be there ever harbour more abfurd opinion than one which make the moft trankcendent brightnel and most penetuar object

manr painting wherein the object be by sunfer more light from unternenb ton which be contrary to nature as we may dailr experience in walk againt the sun how troublefome it be to thate the eve he rum we head lideway or hold a hand ferchief before we eve even the hat be no defence and yet the sun never take it uneernen this may be plainly evilence by perspertive to wit that as the honzon limt we eight and the sun can not with respect to the exe delrend lower therefore he can not find he ray upwards but long the grckel or faral thefe rar isen in they pallage unless you pull you hat over eve mut need ihine into they even dare to lay that be the brim of you hat ren acre broad and parallel with the horiit would not call shade of pin breadth over you eye nor the sun to much as take the under part of the brim though we be fland on a eminence bur to be the better underftand let we confider plate x l. will where on the foreground place figure with board on its head like the americans lerel with the eyebrow next we fee a high building with project cornice run towards the point of sight and on the other side a high column with figure on it have fuch board on its head as the other now you may perceive that the sun do not prite underneath againtt it but fend he ray parat fet mean when he be fetr draw then ray from the sun pa rallel with the board of the foreigure and fee how much shade it be eve will have ferch another ray from the front or cornice to the sun center to find how much shade the projecture will throw on the frize do the same by the figure on the column then you will perceive that the joint of the scone in the building will be parallel with the sun ray and that the offcorner of it though lower than the nearone will yer be alike with the nearone and the frize pa rallel with the ground ifit be object that when we he out at window the sun be lower than the windowboard we lean on and do not fhine on it antwer that we only imagine so for if we rightly obferve we shall perceive small groundshade of the crosspiece of the window thoughever to faint wherefore we be enable to conclude that as long as the sun chine nay if but finger breadth above the horizon the ground of light and shade chap muft receive some light and of contequence as long as the ground be somewhat light it be impoffible for the sun to thine on any thing from underneath suppole for inflance column fix foot high light by sunfet if this column throw any vilible shade on the ground the ground mult have fome light and if to how be it pollible that the sun should fhine from above and from underneath at the same timel and if it be grant that the sun do not light the column on top ir groundhade muft need be infinite in which cafe the capital ought juft to be light from underneath and the ground of neceffity to be without light this be a undeniable truth though the point be little handle by writer even feldom heed by mafter tis allo no wonder to fee some fail in it the moft probable reafon for which as think be they ignerance in perspective ap xvi of the application of sun shine and other light be a old and root evil and there by almoff become law rather to gratify we fancy and paltion than confult reafon molt painter verify this in they choice and ufe to represent sunshine fay they be pleafant and delight the eye therefore we must always introduce it but this can not be fince the variety of the seafon and change in all thing vifible demonftrace the contrary this light be indeed very agreeable in landskip but very differviceable within doer for how ridiculous in great encertainment would sunthine appear on the table and how could the guelt fee one another or how could the glitter of the plate be expreft without obicure every thing elfe what fine piece would that be where the whice tablecloth mult be mix with black and how agreeable would it look to fee the groundthade of the windowframe and square expreit on the table and floor sun thine be not always proper and yet some will not give themfelves time to think whether the subject require it or not in chrift crucifiaion it be improper becaute the scripture mantion the sun to be hide the better to explain my meaning shall exhibit three different light in as many ordonnance relate to the perfon of we sajiour of of light and shade crristcrucifixion here on mount gelyoth be the place of sufter

as be light from on high and little forward becaute of another piece of rock rife up there by the side alike with the former obterve the three figure on the fecond ground fland between the two rock thofe want the forelight mull need receive it from behind somewhar further on the third ground which be the common road some people be come clofe by the tree fland on the right side of the piece who on the other side beyond the large rock receive they light from the left side plan proof that be they more diftant in the field they would be light from all side my principal remark on the piece be this this bury place be long to toseph of arimathe and lie near the city of tcrufalem as the text thew he be there with he people who carry in the corps now my intention be to light this foremoll croup as prongly as poflible and yet without sunspine the light come almot frent by reafon of the siderock which obstrult sidelight to that they can fcarce have any shade other than from bebind through the rock or buryplace little from some cypreff slanding on one side of it between the two rock shew that the people come forward mult need be light from bebind fince they be hill half in the

on the right side of the tree againtt which they ground rhade fall the other croup and the stone heap in the field on ground thew to be light from all site and to have no other shade than from below and the decpelt hollow becaute the sky be fercle and without cloud row irscertain that few will relith to nice a obtervation fince they follow they own fancy wittout further inquiry vet if any of the circumftance be omit the matter would allo be lel apparent the chief regards have here be to the light the tine or heur the situation of the euryplace and the quality of the man who perform the funeral rite not only as to he perion and authoriry but alfo with respect to he dress together with the alanner of the sotemnity accord to scripture all which appear plainly as for itr no of light and shade in the offship they be bury place raif up and down about terufslem of which the aforefaid be one we fee they fmall and mean large and ftacely accord to the condicion of thofe who caute they to

this head we shall here lubjoin some particular which could not before have place a light and shade chap for the sun my opinion be that he can not be represent in any picture firft becaute the eye be too weak to behold he and therefore he force can not be expreff otherwife than by make all object dark and black secondly becaute when he thine directly in we face we can not perceive the right shapeor colour of thing unlet we shade the eye as nature teach for the fame reafon think we may not reprefent burn candle torch or other matter give great light unlet we allo exhibit the object as this light make they appear to we and not as by they colour stir and uunion they really be for the further from the candle the more faint they become tis therefore folly to raintain that the natural force of candle light especially it the flame be feen can be imitate fince it be paff we skill to give the other work its due appearance for when the light of the candle thine in we face the mot deep and dark colour even black it felf appear neither darker nor blacker than they would in dark dav but we shall afterwards treat more largely of thefe light and therefore now proceed to lay that thofe who love to paint sunshine may obferve that tis pro per for sacrifice combar bacchanal dancing sport of herdfman and fundry other jovial occurrence and hiffory which require great buffle but very improper and oblirult in council pleading en tertainment acadeny weddingceremony and other such circumstance but cloadlight give a uncommon decorum and nacuralness in solemn afair such as affembly of

like elpecially in the open air the sun appear agreeable and delightful in the open field when thro thick buthe and tree he ray here and there light the grounds and the people be feen repoling or divert in the shade bur he act againtt nature who exhibit tender and beautiful virgin bask in funthing field far at the sun and talk and behold each other with as little concern as if it be but candle

of the day favour the enterprize of great general in befrge or ferm town no time more proper for it by the the example of joshn in taking of fericho this rule thoughnot without exception have be

fuch subject jndicious mafter alwar chule the hour of the day which beft agree with they story this time be of fingular advantage for the haff tint it give exhibit all thing in they natural corour whence arife a uncommon agreeablenet and decorum the morning this time principally rejoice nisture even inanimate thing be fentible of it the glitter light take the top of high mountain and caute both in building and landskip great shade appear very delightful this light at break out give uncommon sweernets when the object shine in the water as allo certain freshness mixel with vapour which bind the part of thing of well together intirely to pleafe the eye of the know at this time the herthen offer they sacrifice and we read in the book of mofe that the child of irael have not only cheir fornoblation but allo worthip the golden calf at that time the tow recain thole cultom to this day as alfo do the ancient chrifian who offen baptize in the mforn as be likewife chrif in fordin the persun moreover honour the morning by they ofering wherefore we ought to have due regard to the time of day on all fuch occafion and take especial care that the light fall on the principal object and place accord to poufin con duct in picture of cbrif refer the blind to sight wherein the greatell and flrongel light be intirely pread over we saviour the light between morning and noon this light be not very fir for object if it be not break by fome accident of rain sterm or tempel such time may be prope for of ligbt and shude mournfal ocsason fuch as the lall judgment and we saviour suffer when as faid in the laft chapter the sun be darken which look frightful and caule a expreffible amazement wherefore fine and pleafant weather would on fuch occalion look ridiculous noon at this time the sun darcing he glitter ray thine in full splendor wherefore defire thofe who ufe this seafon to think that nature effelt by the force of this light what can not be represent fince we often fail in we utmoft actempe for that purpofe whereby it happen that in endeavour to make thing come forward we often ule fuch force of light on the foreground as far exceed that of the sun as in the cale of drapery of fiery colour or the like certainly a unaccountable way of proceed neverthelel the sun light may be bidden behind mountain building cc this hour give ret to human labour the scripture tell we that chriff tired with he journey fat to reft on the well which give the woman of samarra occation to hear he wonderful prediltion he difciple alfo weary lad down near he he who en deavour truly to reprefent the nature of thing mull especially obferve the time and hour proper to they the afternoon as this seafon be moft liable to diverfity of weather by means of driving cloud which occafion many overcall tis very proper in the reprefentation of bacchanal and licentious aftion but thele be not always fix to that time the evening labourceal at this time it give liberty for all sort of paf time as dancing walking xc if you would reprefent the marching home of a army or herdfmen drive they cattle out of the field this time be the moft proper for they this light frequently change its colour by the interpofition of rite vapour which it draw but do notwithflanding moft time enlarge the superficy of object when of light and shade book the shade do not receive the reffexion of other object they ouger to parrate of the light this seafon be quite different from the morning vet not less agreeable by its small glitter light if we keep the general light fomcubat dasky which create great mase or part eipecally when the colour be fomewhat difpert by guto mate be noon the jun light muft proceed from on high give thort crrourdthade ber in in evening he light muft be low and caul tmr grcurleikis the morning be like the evening and with this the alcenlight siz ap kvill of the moan and ber representation ion sot ber many of my polition and obfervation in this pome will be cenmure as heccrodox for be contrary to both ancient and modern practice nevertheless shall not fear to enforce they that diterect arcift may enquire whether they be found on reaton or not especially fee they be not new invention but correction of oid mittake as think shall prove tuppole then that ts grot error to reprefent the moon tiss the life becaute how diftant foever the be we nevertheless fee she like the sun alear retain ber natural bigness and if this be grant the concrary muit be unnatural and therefore forbidden to paiter who be the imirater of true nuture have mind to paint moon skine would without injury to nature manage it as have before faid would reprefent the sun that be to exhibit she shine but not she body for the light be of great or moment be picture than the body of either the sun moon or lighting my object there by either from behind fideway or forward and as well in figure as landskip somewhat darker than the duylght that it may appear true moenlight and not sunthine which it very much affect by its fudden light and tharp groundshade make the blue sky here and there with some glitter star and to make ir fill look more natural we may if the subject permit introduce up and down torch or other light burn pile of wood offering or other fire as occafion require and thereby mate the light the sirenger and the colour ruffet and more jellow yet the shade not to light and shade so harp as those of the meon this would in my opinion have fine effect especially if the faid accidental light be moftly order in dark place but we ought principally to obferve that in the whole there muft be feen more darkness than light and that no colour appear to beautiful as thofe of the sky in reference to the moon unless they be red yellow and fuch other as be peculiar to burn light as we have thew in the firtt chapter of the fourth book for light red and yellow become dark the moon s brightness contrarily make dark blue and seagreen appear lighter but black keep its poft wherefore little light red and as little dark blue ought to be feen in the picture by fuch difpofition we gain two advantage natural light a uncommon variery in the colour if any one find any difficulty herein he may pleafe to know that he be no more oblige to exhibit the moon than the sun in he piece becaute the former take it courfe round the heaven as well as the latter and may therefore be place as the elegance of the figure and bywork require fince both illuminace the earth and its object forward backward and fidewife as to quality in three particular the moon be to like the sun that there be no difference between they as she always throw she ray parallel as well as he all that be light by she be broad and tharp the shade on the ground be plain and conform with the object but the reffexion be not to hrong as in sunthine becaule the moon light be weaker than the sun by reafon of the oppofite nature of thofe two luminary the one be warm and the other cold and as the moon receive she light from the sun the cantherefore not have to much power to impart it to the earth nor the object light by she appear to diffind to the eyc again as the sun often alter he colour by means of the vapour which he exhale to we lind the fame in the moon who by the fame mean become alfomore pale or yellow in proportion to the vapour about she or the air rarity or denlity can it be doubt wrether fuch piece of moonlight without the appearance of she body be fuch when the darknel broadness and sharpnet of the groundhade and the palenct of the colour be well obferve all which conjunctively express evening or night if it be quchion whether this be the former practice lay no buliness to enquire into that fince we ought not to accommodate the art to fancy but we senfe to the arc tis to as linle purpote of light and shade purpofe to confider what be do but rather what may or ought to be cose accord to the dillate of right reafon in short tisimpoffible when the threeaforefaid quality be well observe in piece it hould fail of reprefent very natural moon light as my polition run counter to old cuftom and therefore not to caly to apprehenion have endeavour to explain myfelf by the three example in plate x llil in the firtt fhew the moon in she natural bignel yet without the piece becaute the would otherwife come too near the horizon and caule too long and difagreeable groundhade in the lecond the be exhibit after the old ltay and in the third thew only starry sky with the frong light of moon who as in the firtt example be without the picture if any one think that the moon body give firong glitter elegance and life to piece fay the sparkting light of the star do the same effecially if we make they as large as they appear to we but not in perifeltive way as be berween heaven and earth like the moon however we need not reprefent they all but the chief only fuch as the charict the triangle the serpent the nort and evening star and tuch as make know figure all which as have no figural be but only the shine of very fmall light may be eafily expreff by fmall point we may allo make the moon though without the piece appear in the water and caute a agreeable reffexion in the wave surge and by chule fuch sidefight we have the advantage of reprefenting alf teing q berutifal neither more nor let than in sunthine or common light mull fubjoin another important confideration which be that as the moon light be fomerime obllrut by high object fuch as rock palace tree hill coc to some part mut need be dark in which the reffexion of to weak light have no power to enlight en or feigh we the object or body in they though ever to near for this reafon painter ought to avoid juch accident and not to incroduce they unlet through neceffity to create a harmony or forbe and to place they mathr forward or in the offskip againft the sky for fet they between bork cannor but make dijagreeable spot un ley it be break by fome water wherein the reflexion of some star orother light of the air appear and into fuch choice of land ship or vitto you may introduce white marble image building light by work and light coloured stuft which all together loon agrce of ligbt and shade and as the night vapour be more deafe than thofe of the day to the diftant object become more faddenly dark and undiffinpuispable forger not that in windy weather the moon as well as the northstar be encompaft with yellow ring if any perfon be not yet fully fatisf let he pleafe to weigh the follow palpable realon tbe sun moon and star can not diminish becaute we can neither approach nearer nor go further from they but all fublunary object can by we recel or approach leff or magnity and to prove this take glass of the size you intend you picture place it before window and draw on it the prospect with the moon as it then appear to the eye which do you will fee how large the ought to be paint now if you approach with this glat some thouland step nigher towards the sun or moon they will not appear bigger on or through the glass but have the same magnitude whence arife the falficy of those reprefentation which diminish the sun moon or other meteor as well as the figure conclude then that the picture exhibit nature contrary to what the ought to be be liable to cenfure and that we ought to feek truth by ratiocination and then wave old cultom and prejudice to believe we own eye hall further illultrate this matter in the chapter shaw what be mean by table and of the use of magnifying and diminish claff and of the difference between large and small warm and weak painting to which we refer the curious artift ap xi of the effert of artificial light as of lorch lamp candle or fire ving in the moft plain and concife manner treat of the effect of the sun moon and starlight we shall on the same foot peak allo of the auxiliary light which necetlity for the eafe of mankind have contrive and art bring to perfeltion think it not amiss to thew here in the firft place the force and property of thefe particular light in fuch manner as conceive they .. no light and shade book of flumbern or forch be at night the moft powerful and beautiful have two qualiry to wit of afright and rejoice light be very proper for bacchanal entertarnment play and the jofal merting and on the comrary frightful in sercery ap pirision of gror and tuch like nocturnal and unexpected accident the lamp be melancholy faint and gloomy and therefore proper for barial prison near fick and die person and on other mournful occation this light be moft agreeable withindoor and in gave grett or frightful and unfrequented place of small extent the astare of this light and ir efef on colour be the fame as thote of the sun with respelt to ir falfify the colour but the light and reffexion be not to frong for which reafon the arrift be often at fland in the ule of they arife moftly from he flighting this light as matter not worth he obfervation in reference to shade they be not much unlike thofe of the sun well in brondness as sharpness yet with this difference that the sunlight fall more uniform on object as he be more diftant from they and becaute in the evening but especially at night the vi pour be darker and more deate than thofe of the day whence it follow that all object deprive of the lamplight ditappear and by reafon of it nearnel can be light but in part to contirm this we thall exhibit marhematical inftance in plate x lii fx point for the center of the light from which all the rar ffow draw under it candleftick of certain height as above the ground then skerch or column go off fur the and further from the faid point of light ler thefe be foot high next fet one foot of the compaff on the faid point and extend the other to as to touch the extremity of the firft pillar tweep segment of circle on the shaft do the same with the other pillar now you will perceive that the firlt pillar be leave toucb bur receive the fronge light and that above and beneath the touch the light fall weaker and weaker moreover that the furcheff co lumn be mof touck by means of the greater sweep of the compaff and therefore it will be light almol all over but allo moft weak ithence tis plain that object light by fuch light be never light intirely and uniform nd be they rouch and light alike it would be to faint and dark that we should perceive nothing diffindly either in colour or we line more than in weak moonthine of light and shade any one want further information how apply this to practice shall now freely impart it firfl skeich my ordonnance on blue or dark drawpaper then make my plan to thew the place of the figure and other object which flightly feratch next affign point for my light either high or low as occation require on this point fet one foot of the compaff and with the other touch circlewife with a extent equal to each object diftance from the faid point all the object wherever it happen by this means find the part which as nearef the light ought to have the prongeff light and confequently the diminution of the light and colour thew itfelf in proportion as it go of from the draw circle as for the reffexion they be in the fame cafe with all light the brighteff largeft and rrongeft give the frongelt and the purer the light the more yellow appear the colour both in the light and refexion contrarily the fouler and more vaperous the light the more russet seem the colour candle be yellowith the light of lamp be ruffet flambeau or torch be more red artifis who delight in reprefent fuch light ought to regard the three follow ufeful precept to keep molt light together to take especial care in the meling and lighting of they outline to obferve the naturalness of the feveral light whether candle lamp or torch it muft allo be note that the space between the eye and the light as likewife the firft object or figure if it come before the light ought to be the durkeft but if it be behind the light it become weaker and weaker both in light and shale occation by the vapour which as before have be lay appear more denfe in the evening the night light more affect they and enlighten they add to this that the mainlight be temperwith light vellow ruffet or red the diminution and breaking of thofe colour ought to be find by black mean by black and the proper colour wherewith the object be shade and more or less weak in proportion to they diftance for the foremoff darkness and neareft to the light be more warm than the hinder and furthermofl which in pro portion to its diftance become more blue yet much more in the hh light and shade gen sir than withindeer becaute the vapour of the air be more iubtile than thofe of conine light which be make with lampoil rofin or the like emit foul smoke but as the foremoll object mult by means of confine light withi reed be fubjert to much shade whereby they often main tain but small light on they extremity it will be find that luch eutaarl light appear more or lois frong than the object light freght forward accord as the stuff whereon it fall be either rough or mogtr as for the reffexion with the light thine thro thin fold obferre the fame management as prefcribe for sunfhine touch thote part but in break the colour let I fubjoin that the foren darkness mit be the greateft and therefore let fallined by the light than thole which be more diftant the colour there by keep cleaner and be let foul and hill let in the open air than with door be even not afraid to add a eafy method for find the diminufir of ti linis on object accord to they diftance not from the pon of sgar but from the candle torch or lamp cut strip of paper or cilum as long as from the center of the light to the fur thet corner of the piece ler it be finger and half broad at bot rom and awar to point at top then paint the point with fuch colour as vou give you light yellowith or ruffet diminithing it gradually in proportion to its go off from the light next with pin fix the faid point in the center of the light to as to more it about at pleasure to all the object near to or diftant from the light then divide this strip into degrade fict small at the point light end and from thence gradually larger by which mean the scrip will the withour trouble the right tint to temper for the object go into the picture towards the point of sight you may make another strip the reverfe of the former to wii light at the bortom and diminithing towards the top or point to be fix on the point of sight you would ule any more help for the diminution of the co jour and let troublefome try the follow method in my ordonnance exactly defign the figure after the life paint it like common light piece without break the co lour more than perspective require the light take as from candle or other mlatter proceed from point within the piece whether within door or in the open air after which take thin glaze vellow of the fame tint give to my light and scumble light and shade chap nealy and thin over both light and shade this vellow muft not be too dark becaute my main heightning be take only from common light wherefore asphalium yellow lake and dragon blood would be to warm and fentible as to take away the mipiness inseparable from nighhpiece unlet it be before paint accordingly to the no small trouble of the rtiff now as glared thing commonly abate of they neatnel you may if it be neceffary retouch the mainlight as well in the face as other part and there by ferch out they force again the advantage arife from this method be that there be no kind of night light whether of lamp or other oil pirch brimftone candle or torch but it may be reprefent with the fame trouble becaute it depend only on the temper the glaze colour the bett of which in my opinion be cumbooge light pink or yellow lake mixt with little vermillion think thefe very good method becaute fomerime in night piece elpecially in great brytle we use two three and more particular burn matter for light and by this means we obtain fure nicthod for fetch out thofe light and fire not only be night but allo in the daytime in the evening nay in sunskine where we often meet with flambeaus torch burn allar or pile of wood but let I not propofe thefe precept as law but example to exercife the artift curiofity and for they proficiency wherein with my lahour may be of service chap xx necefary hint in the use of perfpective have be long confider point which in my opinion be very remarkable and yet have never be fertle though think ic may be do it relate to the execution of hiffory either within or withoutdeer and landskip embellise with figare my thought be that as perspective affign certain diftance for view pilture with respect to its magnitude or smallnet or large piece with large figure and other object go off to wit on the second and third grounds thofe object ought to be as nearly finithed as thofe on the foreground provide they keep they faintness caul by the interpot aair this pofftion think be found on certain and natural principle but of light and sbade book mult prerioully fuppofe that when we fay piece be well iked it mut be underffood that the whele be of and not part on if we begn inquiry we ought to puth they as far as polhible to enable we to lay tuch piece be artfully execute nay to perfect that nothing be want for that can not be affirm when the foreground be hnich and well paint and the fecond and third grounds but flarely rouch grant that we fomerime fee piece with imall figure though loofly handle account finer and more artful than large picture labour and highly finith yet it mult be allow ed that more work be necelfary in large finith piece than fmall looly handl the very word fnishel and feofy imply it mo opinion be that if we be not want in trouble and time as artful piece may be produce as what have be hitherto do yet only by thole who underfland arr and its rule in theory and prac tice and though ir feem ditficult to aftempt thing new we mult not therefore be difcourage for what great thing have not be experiment and perform what do not afexander have he fear danger and trouble he would never have go the length he do he have mind to do it rhis create refolution and that finith he hope but to return to we subject let we fuppofe that picture ten feer high with figure as big as the life ought to be view at ten feer diulance and that lmaller one five foot high with figure half as big as the life muft have five feer diftance and thus the smaller the nearer accord to perspective now the quellion be which of thote three piece ought to be moft finith many will certainly fay the but my opinion be that each of the three piece mult be paint equally neat becaute each have its determinate diftance with respect to its bignet again there be another fuch piece ten foot high but divide in to three grounds whereon be place the fame figure as in the three former to wit thote as big as the life on the foreground thote half as big on the second and the lat on the third cround the queftion now be which of thefe three grounds ought to be moft finith ed be all in one pilture the judge will contrary to what they before affer fay the first and that the hindermoft muft not be to near and finith fince they can never relish that the figure on the second and third grounds ought to be paint as neat and elaborate thote on the foreground for lay theywho would por ob light and shade it at ten foot distancez nay who ever faw such painting or do it but the cafe be not whether there have be fuch picture but whetber they ought to be sof we be not ignorant that tis the cultom to finith fmall piece the fmaller the neater and large one contrarily bold or loofe now would fain know the reafon why there should be more work in figure of three foot than in one of lix can it be prove that the fmall one ought to have fold nay a hair more than that in full proportion but what other anfwer can be makeif the cultom be not good it would not have prevail nor lafted to long neverthelel as long as we reafon thus without foundation and bigor ourfelves to common practice and old cuftom we shall never advance ir not the proper way to go forward and therefore many keep they old station but want to be inform of now thing without which art can not improve variety nourish the mind grant that man fometime produce new thing which meet not with publick approbation but whence come they either from falfe grounds and inconfideration or elfe a immethodical way of explanation to express my thought perfpicuoully have exhibit they as plain as could in plate xl and queltion not but you will apprehend my meaning numb have three piece front with they diftance of foot and a half numb be the fame in profile with the meafure or vifual ray which limit the diftance whether great or fnall be the same polition where they be all three in one now my original quettion with respect to numb be which of the three piece ought to be moft finith if any one fay tbe small one because it muft be view neare ask again whether there mult bemore work in the small than the large one now behold numb where they be all three in one accord to perspective and let the queftion be which ought to be moft finith the foremoll or the hindmoft vou will certainly antwer that it thew itfelf that the figure on the foreground muft be more finith than what be further off and that there muft allo be more work in the large as be rearer but how agree this with what be juft now faid that the smalleft of the three piece ought to be moft finith fince now you fay the turgligbis and shade gi mull be to for the example and object be the fame and it be al ready grant that the fmallerit be the nearer be the distance affign and that in the imalleff or furthermoff when nearelt there ought to be as much work as in the feremoit and though you will fay that the latt figure be fainter than the foremott yer there be not fold let in it than if it be quite forward and as big as the life jurge further when lhighly finith figure in full proportion after the lte muff fir be learl as near as the model be high to perceive eren the morl minuce part of now if would make another figure half as big allo after the life to place it on my fecond ground how multi then fer the modet ought to keep the same fitting or mud remove further from it this laff be never do for if it be we thould intead of paintingroom want wetminfterhall in order to mokil a offtigtgure after the lifc but suppoting it be of mul then fir sofar of that mayfee it more nataralty les certain thatl should not joe tre balf of it and though it may be say to this that whit cannor be feen in the life ought not to make it look natural to come into picture yet pray obferve that luppoling make in the oftship figure of foor and half high and the subject require it to be hold thread to which hang medal of the bignet of half guinea the queltion be whether mult expret the medal but not the thread again be to reprefent window without the glaze or lead work or door without hinge or keyhole what would thole thing be take for if thefe do not appear metal drop we of the hand a open window and

follow ex ample in plate klvi there be gallery foot high and foot long divide into three pannel each five foot wide and to foot high the two outward pannel be cloath from top to botcom and the middle one but half way from the top downwards and under it be a handlome bear thele three cloths be to be paint by three feveral malter itarpose with lindskip all have like horizon but different poince of

for the light muft in all the three picture fatt alike either from the leave right before or behind the air mult be the fame fince they all ought to appear as one landship feen through three opening as two door and window but now another queltion arife whether the figure in all three ought to be as big as the life this will beagreed to with respect to thofe on the foreground but how then will it be in the middle pilture which be but half the size of the two other how shall figure be incroduce there in full proportion for half foot of ground or five foot be too much difference now if the mafter who be to make the middle as the fmalleff piece paint it as firong and warm as he be able nay as face in full proportion of rembrant it would be intirely againtt nature and the rule of art but to return to we example suppole the ofship either in imall or large piece to be one and the same even be the one as fmall as the palm of the hand and the other ten vard high the reafon and example whereof have fufficiently shew in the laff chapter and shall further enforce in its light and sbade book place in that treat of what be to be underftand by paint of ble whether lanmiskip hiffery pourtraiture cc bur before leave this subject mult hill fart another difficulty we know that large painting be often copyin little and the contrary now if for inftance all that be large in the original be lef fend in proportion in the copy how can they look alike as in the delign with the two door be exhibit in both which be large cloud and in the other small one and all that be in the offskip teem more diftant in the one than the other if the offskip in the small pitture be that of the great one by what can you prove ir fince the object which in the greateff diftance in the fmall piece be hardly vifible appear in the great one to large and diftind to which iantwer that every thing appear in the one be and remain in the other always the same out so much nearer and this be evident for be there any thing in the world which how remote foever can not be fill remoter it have be formerly faid that every thing on earth be subject to the law of perspective except the sun moon and star and what elfe be feen in the firmament with respect to they form as for the cloud they be moveable body and there fore muft be confider as earthly object leften and enlarge be cording to they dillance height and lowness all thefe thingsl tay can go off and appreach be diftant and near betide there be difference between copy and a original as well in the form as iiss itay in the form becaute the one ought to be view afar off and the other near moreover it never happen that the copy be hang by the original but the fellow to it chap x xii of the diference of force in large and small paint ing and the effect of magnifying and diminish glaffe be the berter underffood we shall begin with the air and take thefe two point for grant namely that all dark object in proportion as they go off become on they light part tight or and lighter and the light one contrarily darker and darker how clear foever the weather yer less in sunpine as experience fuffici eatly thew now if it be ask whether the colour of the object do not there by allo loofe its nature and purity think it can loofe but light ile light and shade chap and only in the shade which break by the other side of the light be gradually transform into the blue of it in proportion as the object go off or to peak better till uniting with the ofship they at laft disappear confider allo the difference between fmall painting in the open rir and thofe within door in reference to the go of and the cofay firtt that the fir without be the moft clear and bright light in the abfence of sunfhine and though a aparement mult need be light from without yet it will be less in force and brighinel and therefore the object more darkish both in light and shade secondly the object can not of vifibly grow faint in they go off becaule by the smallness of the diftance few or no vajour be per ceptible thirdly the shade be not subject to any alteration or mixture but retain they natural quality becaufe there be no other light within door than what come thro the window and this have not power enough to cause any reffexion lave some little near the window nor give any colour so that by the darkithnel the object whether pourtrait figure flower cc retain they natural colour intirely as well in sbade as light wherefore fince the beauty and purity of the colour appear beft by the serenity and brighiness of the air they muft contrarily abace in they effect and force by means of the darkness hall here propole small inftance for explanation let good maffer paint any thing as pourtrait landskip figure or cattle in oil as fmall and neat as miniaturepainter and let both thefe mafter chufe they subject moff beautiful and natural now view the two painting together and you will find that the one differ as much from the other as within door light do from the open air tis therefore unnatural and againtt the rule to we thet warmih and strength of colour in order to force small and diftant object out of they proper plice or to make the window fy tewards we inlead of go off from we we ought moreover to know that thing paint in little can never be take for the truth fince tis undeniable that the life appear therein no otherwife than as at distance viz through door window or other opening whether within or withoutdoor wherefore they ought to be paint in fuch manner that when hang up they may not appear like paint board clotk or flat but natural windew or deor through which the life be really see light and shake book which can not he effect by the force of warm shade or have colear but by the recire and tender one break by the interpot air accord as the weather be more or less clear or mifty and this withour exception of any ordonnance whether landskig hisjory experience will confirm the truth if you view you picture thropiece of fne gaufe somercbat bluiss for then you will find the light of you object gradually grow weaker in proportion to they diftance without lofe the beauty of they colour it will even give piece certain sofinel and sweetness and great decorum vou may make the fame experiment with another piece of gause of grey coloar in imitation of forey weather and it will not only darken the of the object but alfo foul and maddle it and make the paint ing look cold and ditagreeable have thewn that the vie of the greateff force of sbade in small painting be annararal and againft rt as well in within as wichour doorreprefencarion we shall now peak of the contrary to wit piece with lnge orjeft in order to thew what therein without prejudice think the moff parural tis conmtant maxim that the life feen near be in greatness force and colour tuperior to what be diflant the one be nature it felf and the other pemingty so for figure in full proportion be like we who view they in every particular of force afpelt and colour except motion which be grant it may be calily apprehend if we will fubmir to reafon that there be vall difference between large and fmall ordonnance of figure in full proportion and thote half as big with respect to the interpesing fir the only true caule of thing be more or less faine and they go off as well in within withour doorreprefentation let we then rightly oblerve in what manner fuch large object ought to appear that they may be natural and artful but previouly contider two thing whar light be the moft proper for they what hundle be the moll natural for they execution as for the light think the common bet and much more proper than sunthine and though fome who let up for the buono guffe be continually talk of painting broad it be nevertheless great errot as we have often lay always and without difference to ule that mar ner fince tis not proper in common chamberlight especially in figure as big as the life which ought to be in all respects like the spect of light and shade even to much that if paint on board and cut away they should not be take for painting but the lifeitself to give they broad shade but dubious and melt one to the end they may rise and round not black like spagnoler nor grey vellow or ruffet like rembrant john lieven and many other italian duich and flemisss painter who without difference bring warmch as they call it into the shade to fuch degree as to fire they on ly to caule force let this be duly weigh leave the colour of the natural and perfect life be neglet in my opinion be belt to make the shade of the same nature as the stuf exhibir in all object whether nudity drapery wood stone either red vellow blue of green the moft proper colour as well in light as shade as to the force should not be fpar either of white or black though many have pretend that we mull not wte white good painter will attempt any thing vou muft not fuffer yourfelf to be tway by this or that manner follow nature and you will content away then with drudgery and muddle handle you work boldly yet not with rembrunt and lieven to let the colour run down the cloth but lay they fnooth and even that you object may feem round and relieved only by art not by daub let the agreement be to general that in truth it may be faid the figure be large srongly paint and beldly handle people nowday think that painting have attain fuch perfection as not to admit of further improvement fince the beautiful and great manner the bon gout and hot colour be at this time mely perform in france italy the netherlands and other country where art ffourithe but we do not find nowday wit who en deavour to diftinguith themfelves among the know by nere invent on we have feveral of they some time fince of whom thall name but two rembrant and john lieven whole manner be not intirely to be reject elpecially that of the former as well for its naruralnets as uncommon force yet we fee very few follow he and thefe like he fall thort at latt notwithllanding some be and hill be who affert that rembrant be able to do every thing which art and pencil could effect and that he furpaff all arcilt even to this

different from theirs though muft own have formerly fingular incli nation for rembrunt manner for as foon as begin to be fentible of the infallible rule of art find myfelf under neceffity of repounce my miltake and quit he as be found only on loofe him and uncertain grounds without precedent and now methink can not any where better than here thew the effelt of mignife and diminish glaffe and the various opinion fouch they many imagine that painting in little and the life feen through diminithingglat be one and the fame and that the fmall lite see through magnifyingglat and large picture

the glat ground rie or convex contrarily exhibit faint and dif tant object in full proportion dull and break now ler any realonable man view the two piece the small one werm and iring and the large faint and weak and decermine which of they be molr like the life or nature my opinion be againtt both they be like man dreft in woman cloath and the contrary for one be tor fring and the other too weak but admite thefe man to be in the right and we be to fide with they we should by this they pofition and application of it dilcover they wrong notion fince they make the large strong and the imatt

difference between large landskip ernament with small figure and small one with large with respect to the he the day be suppose clear in both be short and incelligible we premife that in landskip the fir be so govern that all the piece contain whecher offskip water field tree coc muft from it receive they decorum and naturalnel and at all time of the day whether morning noon or evening nay at night alfo for as the airalter all the object light by it do the fame if the day be bright and the air clear all thing appear of if it be evening they be dusky and at night dark the mafter who have regard to this effential point mult need fucceed and be think artful and why becaule he have in that part fimply follow nature as a infallible guide vet he ought to be certain in lighting the object accord to they feveral nature and to obferve with I whether there be differ rence between large opening without embellissment and the contrary with respett to the ir by the air be mean the fuperior part which in clear day be commonly call the blue of the sty we lay that the two unlike object in landship to wit one onament and the other plain ought in order to look natural to be tike clear and neither lighter nor darker if they both exhibir the sume hour of the day and if one be of darker blue than the or the tis miftake and unjullifiable for one of they mut need be contrary to truth now it may be here object accord to the old way of thinking that maffer of he art may for decency sake freely cor rect and alter narure when the be obstruct but anfwer in few word that in that cafe nature ought to command and art obey what can be the purpofe to paint in landskip the blue of the sky two or three foot above the horizon as dark as if it be evening when all the object in the piece be light with the urmofl brightnets and force either fidewife or frome altho the sun be fet even the shade lighter than the upper air confider how fuch reprefentation mult look in the eye of the know and whether it be otherwife than dayoccurrence or stageplay reprefent in the evening what advantage would accrue if every body have trus knowof light and sbade dook and judgment in the art if we do not thew they art what lore can gam he who know be be very fenfible of what it aim at wherefore lover of truth ought to fhun fallity picture be probable dementration of tbing and the knowledge of visible

affect the former delighting moff in mean and common thing and the latter in fublime and grand but to return to the point and from the small to full proportion mean piece from or to or foot high the queltion be whether the light blushness of the styought not to begin higher above the horizon in piece of ro feer than in one of think it ought not becaute in boch the armof dilance be the same and there be no other dirference between the great and small picture chan between window half and quite open as the example in plare kl vil natu rally thew where be two wvindow of equal height and breadth one half fhar and the other quire open through both which the landskip and horizon be feen to rife foot and a half now we generally perceive when the sky be clear and without cloud that it appear blue as if we faidtwere all lightaffume its colour flowly and far above the horizon and therefore some land ship painter act very improperly herein and againtt narure but fi farepainter especially be moft culpable fuch mean who in they piece though ever to small exhibit the rir suddenty durk and deep blue without confider the origin of blueexperience reach that it proceed from whire and black and be

be unneceffary on this occafion to impart think of mine touch warm and weak puint as well in landskip and hiffory as fnall and great life fince it allo take its rife from this fountain of the light we find that thofe who be accultom to particular manner of painting have not the power to alter it of any occafion whatloe yer they who make large figure or landship they buliness and uil chap light and shade great force and warmth paint every thing frongly without dif ference though ever of small contrarily one ufe to small thing if he manner be weak retain that weakness even in the largeft thing and can not ferch out the force and warmth of the other vall miltake in my opinion becaule it be fuch a ealy matter and yet produce to great a effect mean for he who govern he work by rule for who have judgment be ignorant that near tree have more strength and warmth than one at two hundred step diftance or that figure in full proportion have more force than one of one foot think neither of thefe party can find fault with the colour he in the great that he have not weak one enough or he in the ltthe that he want the flrong and warm or can not make they to by temper if the knowledge be find nothing but will be wanting for good performance but let we confider in what manner we may on this occation arm ourfelves good reafon ought to way every body yet scruple of ten make man fearful of undertake thing out of they way not that they should not be able to perform they but on a apprehen tion of fall from good into bad manner fince experience thew that each fuppofe he own manner the beft think have find out method for thofe accultom to large and rrong thing to fit they for the small and weak the cloth jou defign to paint on ought to be primed with light grey ground for the large

firtt to the blue of the sty the second to the reffexien and the third to the shade have often make it queftion whether it be worth while to mention thefe particular becaute be fenlible some may think they riff as willingly own they feem to be but on better confide ration of the matter and how many thing be neglet which ei the offer of themfelves or seem trivial though of abfolnte ufe my su fpicion

mull firft skeech we thought on paper and then conclude how much or little sky or ground muft be paint blue or green vellow or black in thofe grounds we have no occafion for fine and coftly colour

to manage as likewife sun thine which laft we think as we have often faid very improper to be reprefent in room many have think very improperly of thofe light take in manner the liberty which horace allow to poet and painter and precend to help the defect of nature do it in a extriragant manner make no scruple to break down whole wall of room to let in beautiful light on they object as prongly as in the open air they even go fuch length that though they have door and win dow they give every thing they proper ground fhade except win dowframe crosspiece and pier as if wall be pot folid bo dy as well as man table chair or other furniture imagine they may do of that nothing may obfiract the figure but in my pinion of light and shade it be better to take away the caule of fuch a evil than to spoil the property of thing by reprefent it in painting a apartment we ought well to consider the arcbiteffure to aid it and give it preper division and thew door for pallage as for the window whether many or few it muft appear by the object and by the groundshade of the crosspiece and pier and that plain in sunthine but dubious without it and in order to make this laft point cfear which in this

rock river and waterfalls green field cc delightful to the eye herein lie the stress of landskip and painting be very like nature with respect to thing inanimate not to mention many other as the embellifhment which give it the utmofl perfection however this variety confift not only in the difference or irregularity of the object as tree hill fountain and the like but in the diversity of each

picture draw or print of theirs ex hibir aed vilto out of a hall or chamber wherein they have forgor to expret the thickness of the frame or wall fince therwife they mulf depart from the naturalness and we would fay that inflead of a offditance they have reprefent picture or tapellrj therefore conclude that if nature require this in picture it be still more neceffary when we would have the

there by dockand too much incumber but the child muft have name he imagine that the alteration make the work look larger here let it not be think that my piece be wholly take up with the ordonnance and the thickness afterwards paint upon it becaute that would be great folly frft squar out the thickness and then adapt my delign thereto as be more convenient than afterwards to paint the thickness over it and there by dock too much of the work now to give the findious artiff right notion as think how to compote good landskip after a eafy manner let he confider the nature of he subject what

proceed to feek proper materiats bring they together agreeable to he general design and dif poting the object in they proper place each accord to its toture and quality next let he place the point of sight in the middle of the piece higher or lower as he would have let or more sky or ground confider whether the ground be to be level or not and thus to order the figure equal with the eye to difcover directly whether the painting be leen thro a high window in low ground or from low ground to on bigh for tis commonly know that if thing be feen from a height the figure ought to he under the herizen and when view from low place they mull rife above the horizen have do this let he chule proper light fall in either from before behind or afide to light the object accordingly and then to

military architecture will evidently difcover the prudent folly of the mafter though otherwife excellent in alaaner chap of landskip ii of the light form and group of object in landskip we now proceed further in confider the principal qua liry and property requifite in fine landskip thefe in my opinion confiff in good difpolition of the irregular object as well with resrelt to they matter shape and form as they colour in the number and group they in good ordering of the light by well dispose the irregular object we produce life and motion the object confift of crook frait awry high and low and by the colour we effect the fame when one thing be faint and weak anothe melc this rrong that hard the group confitt in join thofe irregular object as of two body on two different grounds the on the

foreground then three on the second tws on the third and foar on the fourth ground and then again one and to forth and thus as well on single level ground as where they happen one bebind another thefe unequal number in the groug be certainly not of the leave moment in landskip as to the colour mention before tis to be especially note that the collar which be predeminant and have the chief place in

becaute moft people by rrange impulfe feem rather to covet the gift of narure than the heaventy which afford what of landskip chap be whole and most perfett in word they feek only part the all be to be get this proceed from touth and ignerance wanting fundamental knowledge and therefore not judge what be most beautiful and profitable nay what they themselves be fit for but it be moff unaccountable that many land kippainter be not able to embellith they own work to which fome may object that as they have not make it they practice to they be content with handle fin¬ gle prospect well leave any thing elfe to the owner difpotal fad story that they can not do they work without help whence be evident of what moment if be for land kippainter to embellith he own work whether the delign be he own or borrow fince certainly if he be mafter of he art he mull allo know what be moft fuitable in he picture not triff or figure to no purpose but hiftery fiftion or parable take from scripture ovid or tejep ornament which will enrich the work but this be feldom do becaule few have time to pare or love read as for I would rather want print and drawing than book as a hifforypainter make ufe of book and detcription of landskip and bealt but be landskippainter should provide book of hisfory for what should be the better for exercife one particular part of which be mafter and neglect other as neceffary to be know need not learn what already know but tis impoffible to get skill in thing without inquire into they have time for peral novel why not allo for neceffary thing be curious to know the state of the war or defirous of peace for the sake of art of what advantage be the peace if do not qualify myfelf to meet it there be few or no painter who have no particular manner of few be qualified for embellishment fince every one ftrife to excel in tomething and to get name by certain wenderfulness therein er the by beautiful colour extravagant drapery broad and funny light or round and dusky one which offen poil work inffead of better it thefe they can not forbear they chief talent lie in they the they frequently have contrary effect when they be to adorn

more difpleat in landskip than always to see house bekind againt the offskip and on the side nothing but tree and hill or scarce so much as one stone upon another this repetition mult need be difagreeable wherefore tis no wonder that thofe who be ig norant of architeffure avoid it as much as postible but it be furprizing to I that many land kippainter will not be acquainted with that art even rather never delire to exhibit it how beautiful foever than to be at the trouble of learn it or of follow the model of other which be to plentiful and make for fuch purpofe point to eafily artainable and give piece to great decorum have be long rudy the caule of it and can find no other than want of inclination and knowledge of its virtue and value tis eut of the way to think that landskip confift only of tree hill and green field without house or if there be building ruin or triumphal arch that then it be no mere landskip since no one will take a history in landskip for landship or piece with arckitefture and some tree for landskip or hiffory but prospect with building landskip fet off with a hundred fmall figure will never pat for figurepiece but without figure or

which caufe the greateff decorum be the roundness or relief of the tree good method for effelt this be to obferve how large the spread of the tree be fuppole it z foot the apper roundny or nearlide mult have the srongel light and shade diminithing gradually every gor foot and the extrenmity to melt into the sky or other bywork though the light should happen to fall into the piece from side for the more the light approact you the pronger it touch nd if on that occafion you light and heighten the uimoft edge it can add nothing to the relief becaute the light round off too faddenly and have

common nature thew he he error do we not behold sun fhine and fine weather with greater pleafure and attention after and can it have aless effect on we senfe in picture there be even no country to

will he find to fait all he picture can he place they always in the sun in order to thew they naturalness but grant the work to be place in luch light another unhappinet will hill artend it for the sunlight will fall into the pilture from side and the real sun fhine will come upon it front from which premife tis apparent that the common light be not only neceffary but always the moll

necellary to borh in order to make each in its kind equally good together with remark touching the byornament as to landskip in general they be as we have thew in the same calea hiftory to wit that large ordonnance in fmall compais carry more aart knowledge and elleem than the contrary becaute the object require more work and more plain and dittinct exprestion of they qualiry which in fmall object in large compass be not of nicely requilite for the nearer we approach the object the more fentible they become as in hifory variery of thought and object occur for compoling ordonnance either

for people of judgment the former do in some meafure af foot the body but the latter rouch the soul and leave lafting imprefficus the principal difference between small and great landskip lie in the peint of sight in the great in small compass the horizon be commonly fomewhat low and in the small in large compass high in one be high ground in the other valley the one be natural reprefentation and the other look like map the one keep good decorum let it hang ever of high and every thing look upright in the other all teing teem to be tumble and it appear well no longer than while on the eafil in great landskip in fmall compat all be iee plain and diftinct at leall one part accord as the choice be in the small in large compass we can perceive nothing perfectly but the general parly becaute the great light create faintness and partly becaule the piece be view at great diltance as hang commonly above other painting tis even certain maxim that as piture never hang below the eye unless in a auction to land ship with a high horizon mult always need be falfe leave the contrary to any one judgment how much more decorum and advan tage it he when of fuch a extent as to be place high or low ever up to the ciel without fear of be hang below the eye when the other muft find its comfort under its fer height without hope of ever gain its decorum unlet by come calually on the ealel again affel of landskip have thown that great landship in small compass with low horizon can bear hang above the eye and look become and that small one in rarge compass becaute of the high horizon lofe it be true quality to the detriment of the paint er we conclude that there be no better method to be ule with landship of large extent in order to make it become and natural chan to fet as aforefaid the horizon fomewhat lower fince fuch piece be always place above may fay far above the eyc but here perhaps difficulty may be ffarce namely that if the horizon be let to low the sky will overpower the principal of the pilture but in antwer let I ask whether the sky be to be look ed on as a ufelet parch do not the sky moft adorn and invigorate landskip and make it look agreeable mult we suppofe the earth to excel the heaven in magnitude ay but fay they there be nothing to be see in the sty . —— but be beautiful sky tuch triffe and to eafily to be paint be it not more artful to reprefent thin driving cloud than flat ground here and there a hill or plath of water grass or herb beautiful sky be proof of good malter but if it feem too large we have a help for that make the foreground fomewhat large and then treeor tco thick or thinleavwill take up enough of the superfinicy and break any thing that be obttrult likewife building may ferve either front of in profile or inflead of it pyramid or obelisk thefe not to be flung into the offskip accord to ufual practice but bring on the foreground great and firong let the top of thote object ad vance high in order to fill and there by as have faid in some meafure here and there to break the sky but here it may be again objelt that fuch larse tree would not look fine becaute they leaf ing can not be feen but be the leaf of tree of more value than the top of beautiful building pyramid or any fuch uncommon objell muft thefe give place and be leave out for the fake of tree would it not look wonderful and be great pity that one in a hundred should lofe it be leaf let one two or more bough fhoot forth there be enough without they fay then that by this mean the shy will be sufficiently fill and the difficulty remove nd now the sky be moderate and the greateft force lie in the landskip and byornament the fore ground be eleganrly embelliffy the offskip broad and deep with a excent equar to my with and the hotizon tich as need not fear the rumble of the object vi of landskip peak of place forward great tree elovate building prramid and large figare for byornament fome may poffibly fay that then the greand go down bebinl and rise forward fince they can not relith any thing they be not ufe to and which require the object to be fomewhat more finith and larger than in they common way but altho have thus thew the preference of one manner of painting before the other yer do not prefcribe it as law to be al war follow my delign be only to illustrate what be fine in the one abore the other ch ap of painting reem with landskip hin this point to be of moment and weighty enough to be contider with attention the rather fince some painter often happen to fee different management with respect to the rule for painting hall parlour cc and therefore can not refolve on what be molt fntable and advantageous for thofe apartment and when they be to perform fomething therein to many difficulty arife and they opinion fomuch vary that they be at sland whether they shall reprefent picture or painting in the manner of tapestry or ny ture itfelf as to the firl sort we muft be fenlible that the pilture be all of size and place orderly will be take by the know for abaratt paining bre no relation to the room accord to the notion of thofe who be mafter s of good collection be indif ferent where the picture hang whether againtt bare wall or hang ing as to the fecond sort be certain that painting make in the manner of tafefiry will never be take for real iapeftry be they border ever to beautiful and elegant and therefore have not the ef foot which the mafter purpofe the third sert to reprefent narure be certainly the betl for what can be want when the work be natural artful and proper to the place reprefentation of tapeltry be lame picture and picture not agree with natare and the place be alfo deficient wherefore mafter who paint fuch be unpardonable becaufe inftead of dorning the room and preserve its arcbiteffenic order he at once spoil bott iva landskip chap be one time ask whether any certain rule befide the light and point of sight be neceltary for hallpainting antwer that the architecture ought to be observe throughout as far as concerned the compartition and ornament and that whether paint or real they mult correfpond with the deor mantlepiece and alcore and the whole work take its proportion from one order that it may look proper and make up one compact body now if wall be to be cover with fingle picture it mult be handle in the manner of a hlanging but picture be fomewhat more brittle than tapetiry and fooner damage by hang to low chair mull not be fet againtt it if it get hure or dent they be not eafily repair surbafe be much better and belide the wall be fomerime to long that it cannot well be feen at one view wherefore when the dillance be too imall it be better to divide the wall and to ufe more than one point of sight if now there be door in the middle or on each side they ought to be leave free though they be without moulding and even with the cloth for the room mult have at leaff one pallage but not paint over accord to the practice of some with tree hill or stonework as if it be not there very common error and which no mafter will jultify unlet he have greater eye to preft than the general elegance of the werk wherefore tis more advitable to enrich the deor or door with fine moulding or ornament if the deor happen to come in the middle beautrful frontispiece adorn with carving will look magnificent this in order to fave buildingchar ges might alfo be reprefent on cloth yer some artifis who be not ute to it will not eafily be induce to undertake ir but rather to much more landskip though on due confideration and for the lake of decorum and naturalness they have better call in the affiftance of a other hand for they help when now there happen to be door but not in the middle it will be proper for obtain regularity to order alfo one on the other side unless it be even with the wall and the moulding of the surbafe run cross it in which cafe you may make fomething or other on its upper part fuir with the land ship fuch as stone with batsrelief either diffant or near lay jou may do of but for my part should not much like it wherefore my opinion be that two door be much better than none and though you might neverthelel incline to the laff propofal in order thus to have larger piece yet tis inconfiffent fince the ciel muft have its support accord to its comparement under each suim mcf landskip book vi mer ought to be fomething either pilafter or term or elfe the piece mst bave circular head but room be feldom to order perhaps becaute fome man love to engross all the gain to themfelves exclutive of the

each particular reprefentation as will in defign as colour accord to the different light if the building be square and have the opening in the middle and the painting exhibic bassrelief the light ought to be frent but if it be cdole roaf the light muft come more from below again if this building be desg or the opening which give if light far from the wall it ought to be light mesity from the reffexion of the ground icl .. of landship vi yet if the cpen be wide the light may proceed someribat from the sik but contrarily when the summerhoufe be shallow or the opening near and one part of the painting be in the light and the other in shade its own natural reffexion mut be see in the sbady part that the work may look like real garr bassrelief and becaute no tendernel or pleafaniness can be ufe in it as be in sback think the part there ought to be handle fomewhar more large and rong mean with few littleneses in order to make they cor ex and for prevent confulion that at further di

blue stone and chite mharble by reafon of the grcen of the buld which cover ir and commonly bake the pin and impart to it more or let of they colour which how ever look lovely and fweet especially

apotto to they company fomewhat off and fainter fitting play on cloud and thus you may in the moft proper manner exhibic the five senfe however apelo be not to abfolurely necelfary here fince venus or beauty alfo imply harmony but bring in pomong becaute fruit and flower generally go together for flower grow and appear all the vear round as well as the frust in summer and autumn there be allo fruit which bloffom at the fame time as the flower do to wit peach apricot almond cer in pimfical and kirchingarden would place esculapin the son of spell god of phyfic as the principal of the piece and to

fince by asculuprus with he staff twin ed with serpent be underflood prudence in moderate one herb by another and by art to make they work they effect have of landskip ii have thus largely handle this point shall confirm it by fome figural example respect what have be before faid in order to thew what sort of painting and ornament be moft proper in fuch place where we ufually reprefent any thing and which mult govern careful mafter in order to make he delign conformable thereto obferve then begin with the firff skerch what shall further if the proprietor be defirous of have the place paint all round what sort will be the moft proper colour or bassrelief what obfraction may be there to hinder the nacuralness of the work in some delign at what diffance it ought to be feen either from without or within fince it muft be execute boldly or neat accordingly whether the painting be to remain there conflantly winter and summer yow fee then in the firtt example of plare lii place inclofe by two side wall at the end of which be summerhouse equal to the whole breadth the entrance into it be in the middle and on each side be a opening through which the reprefentation of and the one on the right and the other on the left receive they light as the middle piece have it front over the summerhoule and wall appear the top of the hindbuildings now the quettion be what subject be proper for villo or balsrelief green pro speet such as woody country of flowergarden would have no good efielt in this green summerhouse when feen from without where it ought to be view becaufe mixture of green with green afford nerther variety nor delight seabaven or court adorn with statue fountain cafcade and fuch like elegancy would appear exceedingly fine vieiw from within for thole colour look well among the green but feen at its proper diftance without they will be find to be falfe and contrary to nature by reafon of the top of the house which be behind and rife above they difcover general steppage whence it follow that nothing be more proper for the middlepiece than bassrelief let we now confider what be beft for the two sidepiece see from within the one as faid recieve its light from the left and the the from the right bassrelief can not in my opinion be deco jous there becaute the eye mult not be to clofely confine they ought to be viffe as not have the inconvenience which attend the middle piece to hinder they naturalnet the summerpoute beno landskip vi ing roof in the light therefore fall more advantageous on thefe two place than the middle one as be without the glare of it wherefore viffe mult be beft there and even the fainter and blser the bewer as before intimate a hoven with shipping court with fountain iland with hill streetview of fine building temple and gallery together with blue ofship cc thele be very delightful object and produce between the green variety and decorsm now we ought to obferve that the two piece and though they receive they light from the place yet if we plcafe may be light etterwise becaute they be withoutdeer prospett have communication with this within door place as the batrelief have which be confine to it thus much as to that side the fame obfer vation be proper for the side and the fecond example in plare will aforefaid exhibit garden with parterre alfo wall in in the middle be gate of lettice work and on each side shallow lettice seat cover over with green note and in the back of each seat be circutar re presentation and over they appear the top of iree as of large orchard mark now let we confider what subject will be mott proper for the seat and firft then obferve the diftance whence the work be to be feen which be from without on the nearfide of the parterre here as in the precede example viffe be not proper and becaute the place be to full of green more green would not look well wherefore balfraif bassrelief would be beft as for the cclear we have before prefcribe it the side may allo be afforn as before in the laff example oblerve what object rife be bind and above they here on one side be hloule and on the the green wall behold now third sketch in plate lill difcover walk with tree at the end of which

into three ordonnance the firtt be venus make love to he the second he taking leave of ber to go hant or ratber to be kill and the third she find he dead the fable be this venus be accord to the poet very much enamour with the vouth idenis notwichflanding he celdnel and infentibility and yet he refrain not from kiff and careff she for seafon which much incent mar and raif he jealouty and rage as

of sight on the fame side forward fet cross low wall which the hillick fems againtt this wall which be but or foot and a half in rife place watergod fitting alleep by he vafe and encompaff with green and in the corner againt the frame of the piece place large willowfree or one and a half and thus half the piece be fill on the right side forward plant knobby moffy body of tree about or foot high and clofe behind it large and beautiful one fully leave somewhat be you appear a high quare pedeftal whereon fland large and elegant vafe thefe object be in line run towards the point of dight making way between it and the hillock which be wide for ward and diminithing at the end of the foreground where the fecond begin and run out into a open field whence to the horizon be feen some faint hill let we now come forward again in the right fide corner enry kindle the fire of war the be fly with break flink pitch forch in she hand and she head beler with twining serpent secret ly thew mar the

spear and shield lie at he foot lonce faw print of tulie romane wherein he have place mar in the offskip purfue adonis sword in hand which think too oblcure and far fetchthe senfe may be colerable yet tis againt the fable for ovid do not meation that adonis be kill by mers with sword but by wild boar thro he infligation of landskip the mean time doubt not but this my sketch and dispofition will feem rrange nevertheless if well execute it will certainly appear fine with the pedeftal low wall and colonade fince such thing creace great decorum and variety in landskip the light affiga be bright sun thine my intention here be to reprefent the month of may or the spring when every thing be come forth and bloffoming though be very fentible that the green of the tree by the diverfity of colour be in the summer more painterlike however this mult not be like summer belide the ifland of cyprus be not like helland or other cold country where the green come up late for otherwife should not introduce basket of fruit now if it be ask becaufe sill fet on the large pedeftal vale and that directly againtt the hillock where venus and adonis be with the grace whether this would not throw very large groundfhade over thofe figure fay it would not becaute affign the sun meridian alrude moreover do not fet the pederal to near the hillock as to be any obftacle to the figure the foremoll tree becaute it rife to high can alfo as littie prejudice they its groundhade paff by they over the willow in the corner or at leave part of it which make the colonade againtt which it pread fall back though the tree behind the hillock can fufficiently effect the fame fince make they either dark green or elfe in shade and the little leating hanging over the lover in the light in order thus to have below tome darkness for fet off the lover my incention be to place that group directly in the jun in order to have there the principal light but here may be reprove on suppolition that alt counter to my own polition namely that in sunshine people do not sland talking without sbad they eye which do not deny but let it be confider that the god be not fubject to human frailty and therefore they can look againtt the sun and to folve the difficulty with respect to adonis who be not god make he upper part in shade receive agreeable and rrong reffexion from venus and the grace from whence arife another difficulty namely by what mean this ground hade can fall on he only fince they be fitring to clofe to gether that venur arm be about he neck and one of he hand preff she breaft and therefore the mull need take part of the same shade to which anfwer that there be means enough by one thing of landship vi thing or other to find that shade and as for venss the may be to dispote either litile backward or forward as to receive light nough now that alar and eary at the stonework may not draw the eye too much from the principal by make they in the light bring not much sun into that quarter mean that fet the foremoff whole seem of the tree and great part of the hind mofl with part of mar in ground chade occafion by fomething wirboat the piece and to let that shade run on the foreground jutt to the low wall break the relidue here and there fomewhar with buthe and shrub might alfo place there priapusterm of other object in order lictle to fill that corner we have before faid that neither ffouf nor temple muft enter the composition why not they fay fome as well as the terml to which that the fable make no mention of any fuch object and let I ask who should live in the houfe lis not faid that adonis though man have any houthold or that he worship in temple this piece may be richly embellish with ten or twelve figure though afar and enny be but partly figure some land kippaint er may poffibly object againtl of great number for that thote well execuce would better become a hiffery than landskip but the aniwer be ealy the figure be fmall and the landship large we shall now proceed to the colour and aftion of the figure we reprefent tenas in she linnen yet with she opperpart and leg almoft bare under she on the grass appear part of light red garment adonis garment be greenith blue or dark violet the two groce stand next to veny be drest in light coloured garment of changeable sruff and break colour preferve about that group great mat of light for which reafon chule fich colour as do not caute any unteemly reffexion in the carnation of venss or adonis she garment who be crow veus with chaplet be rofecolour second more forward and with one knee bent be in whire and have flower in she hand and the third haveing the fruit and fland on the left side and fomewhat higher on the hillock have a furera or strawcoloured garment we need not fay much about mar and envy fince cafar ripa relate enough conch they nothing be more proper for mers than rulty fil lemot of blood colourcoat and for exny than black one as of landskip chap for the motion of venus and adonis they be front in both but they foot more or let turn to the light donis on the right side incline he upperpart towards veny with he right hand on she breaft and he right shoulder come forward he underpart be front and he left leg excend and he right draw in as if he be about to rife he face fronce in cline little over he shoulder to the child who blow the horn contrarily venus rell on she right thigh apply in some meafure both she knee to he extend leg she face in profile turned cowards he front the sun she breaft be alfo feen front the draw back she left elbow in order to pret he hand on she breal on due confideration thefe two figure will be find to have and ealy contraft or oppofition in motion fince have en deavour to give myfelf full satisfaction touch all the action exhibire before fet the layman but mult return again to the ordonnance forget to place two child behind the foremoft low wall of whom the one be lean over it and with finger on he mouth and head funk be thewing the other the fleep rivergod place they there firft for decorum sake and fecondly in order to break in some meafure that long and fliff piece of stonework the watergod be of brownith vellow hue almofl as dark as the faid stonework and for two reafon firil for the sake of repofe and secondly to prevent mass of light there with the child to the detriment of the principal belide further purpofe to adorn the pedeltal of the vafe with balsrelief reprefent bacchanol or dancing nymph and though it come in shade yet affign it frong reffexion there ought allo to beadded one of two dog afleep of which the one awak ing ftare back with prickup ear at the sound of the horn have before faid that one of the grace should be dref in whire but now caff beautiful blue veil over it as proper to break the srength of the white piece thus execute be fufficient for the production of many other especially if we duely confider how many thing be obterred in it which by few be take notice of the qualiry of each figure ii origin or emblematic signification coc many fiction be paint from the poef dekcription but few people weigh the writors meaning though attend with a explanation which however be oaly general without the ddition of the circumftance though well know of landship vi khnow to the writer as the shape dreff colour paffion and other remarkable ii hence wemay conclude what mult be the cafe of thofe man who do not make themfelves mafter of all thefe thing and how eafily they may miftake even pervert the senfe of the writer or poec if the fact lay in the spring they reprefent it in summer if in wintermorning they exhibit a aurumnevening ought the pening to be folicary place or wilderness they will incroduce di vertion should any perfon have red drapery as proper to he be make blue yellow coc we grant that the fable may be re prefent plain enough and who the charaffer be and wrat they be do prefently conceive but the drift of it be want ii unnecellary to enlarge on this table or ordonnance further than to oblerve that mar here figaines vengeance adonis the winter and jenss the spring which be the realon why thefe two latt cannot agrec the poet wrife that there be four who go under the name of fenus the firlt be the daughter of calum and the day the fe cond be bring forth of the frorb of the sea be conceive in morber of pearl and condute to cypra by the airy eepbyr ii be the who bear capid to afercury the third be the daughter of tupiter and dione who be wedded to valcan chief of the cuckold and the fourth be the syrian call aftarte who court the love of adonis and to whom solemon erect allar to pleafure he concubine whence we may judge what great dilparity there be between thefe fenuss asfor the wild bear it imply the night lgnorance impiety fil sbiness lewdness cc the second ordonnance or sequel of the forego story when adonis be now tired with kiff and flattery or to fay better when he forrowful fate draw near and the dog fcent the boar fet up cry he deaf to venur intreaty wret from she embrace and jump up eager for sport we muft previoully underfland that we be oblige to confine we felve to two principal point namely the general disposstion and the ligbt and though on due confideration it may poffibly feem to be cholenless advantageous than if it be fingle piece which willing ly allow yet as it now ferve to motch anotber it therefore require the same light though reverone might better become it becaute then landskip chap should be at greater liberty but even then the dispesstion would not be different enough from the former we have in the book of ordennance thew that when two piece hang together they ought to have certain conformity efoecially landship with small figure as if for inftance the heaviell work be in the one on the right side and the viftoon the leave in the other or matchpiece it mult be contrary and yet notwithflanding that neceffity or rule which however fublift find fomething which give I greater satisfaction and better expreff the seafe as may appear in the sequel place as in the precede ordonnance the point of sight in the middle of the piece and on the right side a eminence alcend

fince ifthe stress lay in frong colour only rembrant need not give way to titia but whence arife the miltake moft man chime in withthofe fimple judge who approve no hiffory landskip or portrail that be not paint in the iralian manner my opinion be that the whole marter lie more in the difference of climate than in the handling of the matter for let a englifsmans piture hang near a iabia both handle with equal skill and each reprefent ac cording to he hue and nature there will appear great difference between they the weeten sofinet of the englishmon will charm as much on one hand as the

and then the lower and more near one and in cale balluftrade be reprefent it muft be the laft the reafon of thishave thewn in treat of the deadcolour of hiffery and land skifmoreover as in fine landskip the sky principally govern allthing and without it no proper diftance can be give to the pic ture to be the fame in cielpiece with figure fy thro the air for be impostible to make object rife unlet they have some communication with the air nor be it enough for object going off higher or further from we to be paint fainter and faimter as indraw or print but the colour mult alfo be thewn and as the air be coloured to muft the object partake of it mean in their stide for if the fir be blue yellow or red the sbade ought like wile to have mixture of blae tellow or red as to the light of the

greenith andthe violet bluc as the object go off from we and approach the air they be darken white become darker pale aellow the fame and to on in other coloursomething fill remains to be remark with respect to object inthe air viz that fince the air communicate light from all part the broad shade can not poffibly be to dark as in landskip or other piece but contrarily the dark touch will be to much the fronger all that be in shade ought to be lighter and feen more plain yet fomewhat less than in the light muft be likewife know thatround object have no surface especially on the shade side that be to fay the we line againft the sky ought to unite and vanith not quite fcum cieling or plafondchap away but make fomewhat lighter on the edge as we have clearly demonfirate by the example of globular body book chap imply that fuch work in the air differ fromother to wit that the objert againff the sky be mere reand andgo ofvill general observation in painting the cieling of hall gallery ccfirff and principal obfervation on thefe occafion be thatthe quality and regulariry of the architefture be firmly preferved in all its partthe second obfervation concern the grandear of the architecture as be the main matter painting in this cafe be only to be confider as a aid to accomplith it with let charge wherefore fuch care mult be take that the painter delign do not marr thofe of the architelt but that both unite in fuch wianner as to induce the eye to take every thing for truth irfelfby the firff obfervation that the rchitelture ought to preferve itsregularity we give to underfland that the structure of the roommuft chieffy be regard by the painter in he ciel piece to as not to be hurt by make opening where they ought not to be for itsnot allowable to make they every where as big or litle as we pleafe the ciel must remain ciel will that be withour the painting as the summer ought to have they proper thickneffe and be lat and not feem as tumble which yet thro heedleffnel fometimebe the cafe for inftance let we fuppose the ciel to be divide into three pannel line with cloth one next to the window the fe cond in the middle over the chimney and the third to

adornwith sky and the thicknel of the summer which be one foor not paint on the cloth the ciel on thofe side be to much weakened or at leal seem to be so and be beavier in the middle contrary to architelture whereas to make it look natural and accord to or der the ponderolity muft in this cale be on the side and the middle part lighteff that it may not feem to be fall on we headthe painting of book ixwe ought to observe that there muftt be but one opening and that in the middle fince there be but one point of sight and but one place of fland to view the work to advantageas for painting the thicknet of the summer only faid it to rectify miltake often commit when ciel be make alt over oxin and intlead of cover nothing be leave but grate whichcan not be juftity some think if may pat for lantern butthey be much mittaken for lintern rife and ciel lies far moreover the whole ciel can not ferve for lantern becaute of the window in front the principal or middle piece mult predominare and of contequence be open and the other close mean not to have any sky of living creature but bassrelief foliage comparrment of flower all of fuch colour as fuit with the apartment this judge to be the firtl and principal care and study of good cielpainter before he fet about the work for in the divi of ciel it be as with diamond the largelt and moft valuable be fet in the middle and round it the less and lessas to the second obfervation that the art of painting be aid to mecture and enrick it at less expence the point be plain wherefore thail proceed to thew the reaton why the one may fpoil the otherin painting division it aften happen that the summer have not proper ret to he on especially when the ciel be cover all overand the summer hide with fingle cloth and leave to the judgment of a ignorant painter who then without confideration divide itinto or more pannel and thefe part by paint sum mers which do not bear on any thing now to prevent this you mull let each summer reft on discharger pilafter of cartouche as architelture reach for laftance be you to divide the two pan nels next the window and wall each into two part in order to have four pannel this would be improper and againtt archifecture becaute of the flamel over the window unlel it be compals head and then it would not do withour cartoucheif it be ask whether the dirisson be painter buliness fay ic

the upper bale muffhave no more force than the under capital for be it otherwile itwould seem to be nearer it would alfo not rife and confequently overpower the life tis here as in fine landskip where

flrange that few can underfland this story without tome write under it we there fee the parce of three fatal sifter but nothing of the mother and though we luppose diass to be prefentyet that

action and motion fince the chief end of reprefentation be to express naturally and with energy the niture of the matter and this may as well be do in bissrelief as painting if the story require it nevertheless we muft obferve thatthere be some paftion which do not work externalty and ought to be expreft by addrion in order to make they intelligible fuch may be charny mercy fiety liberality and

with it infomuch that we may often perceive in what part they greateft delight lay hence it frequently happen that the part of the same figure be very unlike in goodness and the hland and foot nay fometime the face bungle for the fake of wellfinith ' 92 back it muft be grant thatthe principal part be of the moft importance yet we be not ig no rant how much the leffer can either fet off or

becaute the greateff perfection lie in conjunction of both wherefore it be certain thatif phidias and prairele have be mafter of berninis handling andelegance and this laft the knowledge of the greef

particular remains for the improvement of afterage but let I ask why we shouldnot as well make ple of we bilicy and judgment in order to go forward think we may in other thing especially but paft

place for the former be teen from single stand for which they be properly make andthe latter be to be view round about from all side but of this we shall tay more in the next chapteras to this larter sort of starue they receive not they appellation from the perion they reprefent but from the aftion they perform or to ahsartune they unferwent and herein lie the main point tince without they the

calamity andone who in he lifetime have go thro thouland accident as shecule tbefeus achille hecter and many other who be reprefented by one statue wherefore we may eafily conceive that the ancient have in every respect to firmly fix and orderly dipote their polture that there be no room leave either for alteration or additionbefide we fee that no addicion of the modern maffer be like the antique either in qualicy or goodness as be evident in the work of quellin keyzer bernini and many other who make no dillinction between statue and starueif seem here to contradict myself becaufe have

the handling but the difference berween draw and en be very great the management of the needle be the samethar of chalk or the pen the place lie ffat and firm like the paper to draw upon but we find the contrary in engrave wherein the graver be hold almod parallel with the plate and the larter bemoreable on cuikion or sandbag and as to force there be allolessoccafion for it in erch than engravenow to prove that etch mutt need be more delignerlike than engrave let we only make we remark on both in the courte of they bulinet each have delign before he and then we shall find the reafon to be that in the one both the draw and plate are ixt before the arcid and he only move he hand whereas the otper cannor go forward wirhout fir the plate beingcontinually rurn and boch the hund and

etching whether in figure or building but elpecially landskip andfince painter of deligner care not to have they defiga cenfure andcorrect by other they chufe rather to erch they themfelves than to fet about engrave a art not to be mafter without much expence of time in get knowledge how to handle the tool whereby it would become rather labour than diverfionmany engraver etch for pleafure becaute of its eafiness but faldom any etcher handle the graver unless in cafe of neceffity to this perhaps it may be object that as each painter or deligner have particular choice wherein he labour moft as one in the ordonnance another in nicety of drafc and third in the neat finithing of fome particular thing therefore the tiule of designerlike in etch benot ablolutely due to painter or deligner to which anfiver thatundoubtedly the word muft not be underftand to relate to modern defigner becaute it be in ufe before erch be bring to its prefent perfection as appear by caracci titian

excel he in neatness smoothness and expedition as well in erch as engrave mean in the use of the graver and needle but not in knowledge by knowledge undertland keep the likeness of beautiful face hand

boy if he underffood the divition of square and management of chalk but theymay yet be erroneousenough in trace they object on the plate though draw upon square for miff the outline in the leave either inwardlyof outwardly it prefently become too lirtle or too big but the tyro can not fee this for want of due knowledge and though he may be fenfible that here or there he have little miff the weline yet he pall it over as matter of no great moment and if he propofe to help it in the erch or engrave he may poffibly forget it beforehe come to far in the work he commonly think no farther than what be already on the plate whence we may eafily conclude that he who know not what conflitute beaury can be as little fenlible that mall difference in face rm or hand be of any great confequenceanother difficulty no less than the former be that though the tyro havethe outline correctly draw on the plite yet he may ranover it when he come to sbade or batch and as this frequently

for the laft the hand may be prepare to handlethem with more boldness now the tyro being to eagrave or etch ground behind he figure be it naked or dreft he will not only especially in engrave end he

the few be sensible that the art of engrave in general flow therefrem and that different object require different handling but rather believe that good manner of draw will eafily lead to engrave notion true enough in erch though even therein the point lie moft in the biting and stop as to engrave you mull certainly be converfant with the handling and force of the graver two pomt not to be artain without great experience though in the begnn tis better for a ercher to have no handling at all becaute he may then gradually the better bring the graver to the needle andin a umformity of
