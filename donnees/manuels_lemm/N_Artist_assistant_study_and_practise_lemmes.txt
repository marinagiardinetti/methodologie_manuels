the artist assistant in the study and practise of mechanical science calculate for the improvement of genius illustrate with copperplate print for the author and sell by robinson london and swinney birmingham prefage it be needless to apologize for send forth this production as it be calculate to improve the rise gemius and to render the study and practice of the polite art easy and agreeable to those who wish to tread the pleasing path of science we need no greater stimulation to the study of the art than due contemplation of they significancy to mankind and reflection on the estimation in which they have be hold by the wisest man and in the greatest nation upon carth tn trace they beginning among man we should find they coeval with man hiinfelf the remembrance of the most extraordinary event as well as the learning of the first man be preserve by means of the fine art re call to memory the great action of they an cestor they be the noblest spur to they posterity to imitate they virtue so beneficial to society and all great mind have ever be most sensible to impreffion of this kind it be not easy to imagine higher merit than that of inspiring those who be the most canpable iu exert themselves in the service of human nature with love of glory and imn mortality it be no wonder then if the art be hold in distinguished honour by the reatest king and the most powerful coinronwealth and that mankind consider andhonour artist as the common benesactor to human society and in truth higher antiquity or more noble origin than that of the polite art can not possibly be conccive we shall begin with draw and range the treatise on design perspective colour painting enamel japanning lacquer stain engrave casting bronzing gild silver in regular succession under the respective head illustrate and explain the most material subject with elegant engrave design those mention above be the principal topy by whichthis work be intend to promote the improvement of the more curious kind of manufacture but besides those beticle there be number of other of considerable moment touch upon in tlis volume some in more copious and other only in brief manner accord to the im portance of the matter or the room give for a advantageous enlargement the judgment or skill of the author in the design or execution of this performance he candidly desire to submit to the public and hope that the system of inslruction here lay down will furnissi such idea as with the assistance of practice will readily enable those who wifh to attain thorough knowledge of the art to reach the summit of they desire which be he sole aim in publish this compendium the artist 's assistant preliminary to draw the first and indispensible requisite towards form painter be genius for the absence of which divine gift no human acquirement can compensate as without that spark of ætherial flame study would be misapply and labour throw away painting bear very near resemblance to she sister poetry and the painter like the bard must be bear one picture as well as poem would afford little pleasure though form according to the strictest rule and work up with the most indefatigable attention be genius want to com plete the design design which may be faid to be like the celebrate statue fafhiion by prometheus lovely but lifeless unless genius like the fire which he be fabl to have steal from heaven dart it be invigorate ray and give soul to the finish piece but though genius be absolutely necessary sincenothing can be well do without it it will not alone do all thing but must be assist by rule reflection and assiduity the memory may be not iinproperly call the repository whcre genius treafure up the idca which paf before it in con tinual succession from this repository tlie artist jselect such material as the occasion demand direct by he judgment above all nature be the grand object of he me ditation and ought never to be out of he sight toture be the only source of beauty sor nothing can be pleasing that be not natural the designer who overstep the modesty of nature may court applause from the ignorant and vulgar but must not expect ghe approbation of the discerning and polite design comprehend invention and disposition invention furnishies the subject and disposition place that subject in the most proper situation fon exhibition nature supply the object art contrast diversific and group they but as every painter may not have time or opportunity to view nature in all she various light he will do well to contemplate the work of those great master who know how to make judicious choice of subject and to execute they with taste and effect on these he may rely almost as confidently as on nature sheself and will find they of the utmost use to affist he invention genius need not disdain to call to its aid the production of kindred genius and as wit hath remark the young painter who should neglect the study of the most eminent profefsor of that science on pretence of set up for a ori ginal would be esteem really a original a author whose title to genius be indisputable will not write the worse for have learn he grammar and for be acquainted with what other writer have say upon the subject which he pur pose to illustrate a intimâte knowledge of the beauty of the antient will be of no small advantage for they make nature they peculiar study and transmit to we example in sculpture which have triumphed equally over the rage of time and barbarian example which have ever be considered as form perfect rule of beautyclose and servile imitation however be not what we would wisn to recommend man may find he account in attend to the manner and store up the observation of wellbreed and intelligent acquaintance without ridiculously affecting he gait or copy he phrascology there be not want some who attribute the decline of painting to à dearth of genius whereas it seem to spring from very different cause the truth be sew parent arc judge of the real bent of they child 's inclination another word for genius and fewer still give themselves the trouble of seek for it consider what line of life accord most with they own wilh or convenience but of those few who really discover in what science nature intend they littlc one to excel how rarely do we mect with one who take the right method to insure success by direct they study in the proper channel for though one should be apt to smile at the abfurdity of those parent or guardian who finding boy possess of genius for painting should by way of initiatinghim in that delightful art gravely recommend to he the study of the classic since it seem full as reasonable to expect he to become poet from contemplate the work of guido titian and raphael as to become painter from turn over the leave of homer horace and ovid yet can any thing be more common than to see lad condein to undergo course of latin and greek let the profession for which he be defign be whatever it may but life methink be too fhort to admit of six or seven year and those the most important one be trifl away in learn what perhaps will prove of very little fervice to he in the situation which he be to be hercaster hereafter place however if word instead of thing must be the object of he study it be certainly of as much importance that he should be able to clothe he thought in the habit of he own country as in that of any other living language be at least of as much use as dead one and it have be but too often remake that many a artist who could expref he idea with uncommon delicacy and perspicuity on canvass have so ill succeed when attempt to describe they on paper as to incur no small share of ridicule from the coarseness and obscurity of he diction the subject first propose to the pupil 's attention will be foand to influence he future practice more than may be easily imagine first inprefsion sink deep and last long and ill habit acquire in the early part of life will sometimes adhere too closely to be entirely remove by the strongest exertion of maturer judgment it will be therefore necessary to be careful that the work of none but eminent master be put into he hand every figure nay every stroke give he as pattern should be mafterly that he may be familiarize to beauty taste and symmetry experience have evince that more real improve ment will acerue to the learner from be use to copy thing in relief than from copying drawing he will by this methiod become acquainted with the principle of light and fhade and the nature of the clear obscure by the magic force of which the painting of patrhasius be term reality and the finger of apelles 's fame alexander in the character of jupiter the thunderer seem to fhoot sorward while the lightning appear to slassz from they but but above all the young student must apply he taisk with pleafure as well as with perfeverance or improvement can not reasonably be expect if the mind instead of be sired with emulation loomily contemplate the cmployment as penance or must the patient artist be too easily satisfied with he own performance he must review it and ertouch its again and again he must search for its blemish with the most rigid scrutiny till by repeat effort he bring it as near to perscction be possible in word diligenee in the beginning of any study will render the progress of it easy and the end delightful draw have be by some people esteem as a ornamental superfluity in education but it reality most usesul accomplishinent at the same time so elegant and agreeable a amusement for leisure hour that every neglector of it have feel and confess its loss this be become so universally know that nothing be think more necessary so complete the education of youth than instruction for draw especially if they inclination or genius lead that way for exclusive of its great use to painter engraver architect engineer gardener cabinetmaker carver embroiderer statuary modeller chafer tapestryweaver and number of artist and mechanic concerned in design ing how very agreeable and entertainingmust it be or what can be more useful than for any one lo be able to fketch or draw fine view from building or any uncommon romantic production of nature nothing be more properly calculate for the man of common business or the gentleman in painting it be the sole basis on which excellence be erect and it be in reality the foundation of the polite art the the material necessary for draw be black ead pencil camel hair pencil rule and com pass crow quill pen red wvhite and black chalk crayon and indiæn ink the black lead pencil should not be hold so near the point as à per in write the use of it be for the sketch or first outlinc of the piece which should be draw with freedoin as any wrong stroké or line may with case be erase by rub the work gently with crumb of stale bread in order to acquire knowledge of the face begin with draw the feature ' separate place the copy at such distance as the eye may meafure both it and the draw without move the head sketch in the first outline very light and in rub out leave faint trace of the sirst fketch by proceed in this manner without ithe afsistance of rule or compass the outline should be bring to a approve exactness and in place the fcature à perfect oval should be form through which perpendicular line be draw in the middle and acrof the centre of this diameter line from one side of the oval to the other on these all the seâture of the face be to be draw accord to the follow rule for draw head the perpendicular must be divide into four equal part 's one from the crown of the head the the top of the forehead two from the top of the forehead to the eyebrow three from the eyè brow to the bottom of the nôse four from thenco to the bottom of tlte chin the diamêter line divide into five part ths breadth of thè face be suppose the length eye this be to be understand in fulf tron face only and thiese proportion be raiher inéon stant in dissrent man as to length and ihage bi in well proportion face be nearly right and should be strictly observe when the face turn to either side then the dotance be to be lessen on that side froin you more or less in proportion to its turn most artist begin the draw with the nose that be the centre and then proceed to the other fcature observe that the top of the ear be to rife parallel to the eyebrow the eye to be place so as to leave exactly the length of onc cye betwixt they the nostril should not project further than the corner of the cye and the middle of the mouth should be on the perpendicular line in order to understand better tlie different turning of the face it may be vory advantageous to procure piece of wood make in the shape and sixc of a egg draw line down the middle as before direct divide this in two cqual part and draw another across the centre let the feature be make as accurate as possible from the forego direction by turn this oval great varicty of face will appear accord as it be inclined or gurn but care must be take to observe in what manner the nosé project beyond the round of the oval perfect knowledge of this may cnable the student to form a idea of the face better than merely copy print or picture without it but aster this acquisition let the best drawingsor picture be study that can be procure previus to which those paffion in man ner of le brun may merit imitation thie po sition and action of the hand be of various no per fect rule or method can be give sor draw they time and painshould be employ in bestow care on those member for it be very necessary not not only to avoid all lameness and imperfection but also to make they appear with life and spirit the atfainment of which must be acquire by appli cation and practice carefully imitate such pos ture both in hand and foot as can be procure in good print or drawing line and meafure and such mechanical rule be not only perplex but reject in the practice of the best master the properest method be to lightly fketch the whole shape of the hand or foot with its position or action and examine carefully that it be correct rub out and alter till it be so when the bend of the knuckle thevein joint and tendon may be draw with much ease after the shape and proportion be make perfect in size and attitude after proper study of the leg arm hand foot and the student have reason to deem heself sufficiently practise in draw feature the human figure entire should be he next attempt to meafure which accord to lesson from tressnoy the aritient have commonly allow eight head though some of they have but seven but we ordinarily divide the figure into ten face that be to fay from thecrown of the head to the sole of the foot in the follow manner from the crown of the head to the forelicad be the third part of face the face begin at the root of the lowest hair whick be upon the forehead and end at the bottom of the chin the face be divide into three proportional part the first contain the forehead the second the nose and the third the mouth and chin from the chin to the pit betwixt the collar bone be two length of nofe from the pit betwixt the collar bone to the bottom of the breast one face from the bottom of the breast to the navel one face from the navel to the genitor one face from thé genitor to the upper part of the knee two face the knee contain half face from the lower part of the knee to the ancle two face from the ancle to the sole of the foot half face man when he arm be stretch out be from the longest finger of he right hand to the longest of he left as broad as he be longfrom one side of the breast to the other two face the bone of the arm call humerus be the length of two face from the shoulder to the elbow from the end of the elbow to the root of the lit tle finger the bone call cubitus with part of the hand contain two face from the box of the shoulderblade to the pit betwixt the collarbone one face lf you would be satisfied in the meafure of breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other so that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body you must obferve that thé box of the elbow with the humerus and of the humerus with the shoulderblade bear the pro portion of half face when the arm be stretched out the sole of the foot be the sixth part figure the hand be the length of the face the thumb contain nose the inside of the arm from the place wlere the muscle disappear which make the brcast call the pectoral muscle to the middle of thé arm four nofe from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand five nosc the longest toe be nose long to the utmost part of the teat and the pit be twixt the collarbone of woman be a equi lateral triangle for the breadth of the limb no precise meafure can be give because the meafure themselves be changeable accord to the quality of the person and accord to the movement of the muscle in draw figure there should be slight sketch make of the whole not begin with the head and finish it then proceed to the other part method customary to many in consequence of which the head be often disproportion or some part void of draw sketch in the whole outline of the figure lightly and measure with the eye or draw the pencil or finger over any way to determine exactness without the rule or compaff in beginning the sketch the héad be the first object then the shoulder in exact breadth the trunk of the body next observe with accuracy the breadth of the waist next the leg and lastly the arm and hand the principal difficulty be overcome when perfect outline be procure after which the shado be claim the attention of the student as every appearance of body reprefent animate or inani mate mate in distance shape substance and distinction be perfect by this let they be first make broad and massy without attend to the many little distract part which fall under second consideration thus far be necessary to observe in copy print or drawing but in draw from plaister figure the eye will discover ét that side lightest that the light fall upon most well set figure have broad maf of light which should be well attend to before the smaller part be divide the outline should be exceedingly faint in such part as receive the light the rise of muscle may by its appearance prove deceive and scem darker than it really be but by castin the eye to the other darker shadow true degree of its teint may be afcertain and sometimes tlie light may catch on the projection of bone near the mass of fhadow which must be scumble very tenderly or it will have harsh unpleasing effect this may also be regulate by compare it with the stronger light observe this rule with care and exactneis be the only true means of preserve the consistency of the whole together there be no branch of draw or painting require taste in the execution more than the drapery to manage the fold in such manner as shall give grace and dignity to the figure to dress it without fafhion prejudice or caprice so as the imitation may be take for reality and bear the test of age require the fullest exertion of true genius many artist first draw the naked figure and cloath it afterward form the drapery to the shape and pro portion of the limb easy and flow not sit toò close but seem to have free motion making ing first the great fold and tlien properly divide they by stroke that do not cross nor be yct but somc uscful remark from work lately publish include every other necessary observation concern the human body some artist reject the use of drawing or print for the student imitation it be say they servile method of proceeding because it cramp the idea and hence genius suffer too grcât à con finement notwith stand this the usual practice be to copy after print and drawing at first and imagine experience have determine the advantage accrue from this method to set the drawing ' in particular of the most eminent artist before young beginner at he first commencement must be highly beneficial as it most undoubt edly will prevent rudeness and inaccuracy against which the most exact can not be too much guarded how much more then ought the young student to observe this caution somc geniuse require restriction and when this happen to be the case the place of accurate work besore they must hold they in subjection sroin which alone correctneis be to be expect exact copy be absolutely to be require at first this will im perceptibly produce habit of correctness till by degree the student will make himsel master of those grand essential to perscction truth boldriess and freedom truth will be acquire by this accustom correctnef boldness and freedom will follow after as the certain consequence and on those the excellence of the performance must depend copy the drawing of good master have also another considerable advantage teach ing teaching good method of execution by which many laborious and sruitless effort will be prevent of design design be use in painting sor the first idea of large work draw roughly and in little with a intention to be execute and finish inlarge it be the simple contour or outlinc of the figure intend to be reprefent or the line that terminate and circumscribe they such design be sometime draw in crayon or ink without any shadow at all sometimes it be hatch that be the shadow be express by sensible outline usually draw acrof each other with the pen crayon or graver sometimes again the shadow be do with the crayon rub so that there do not appear any linc at other time the grain or stroke of the crayon appear as not be rub sometime the design be wash that be the shadow be do with pencil in indian ink or some other li quor and sometimes the design be coloured that be colour be lay on much like those intend for the ground work the cssential requisite of design be correctnef good taste clegance character diversity expression and perspective correctness depend on the justness of the proportion and knowledge of anatômy taste be certain manner of correctness pecuiar to onc ' self derive either from nature maf ter ter or study or all of they united elegance give delicacy that not only strike person of judgment but communicate a agreeablenefs that please universally the character be what be peculiar to each thing wherein there must be diversity insomuch that every thing have its peculiar character to distinguishit the expreffion be the reprefentation of a object accord to the circumstance it be suppose to be in perspective be the reprefentation of the part of painting or afigure accord to the situation they be in with regard to the point of sight the design or draught be part of the greatest amport and extent in painting it be acquire chiefly by genius and application rule be of less avail here than in any other branch of the art as colour the principal rule that regard design be that novice accustom themselves to copy good original at first sight not to use square in lest they stint and consine they judgment to design well from life before they practise perspective to learn to adjust the size of they figure to the visual angle and the distance of the eye from the model or object to mark out all the part of they design before they begin to snade to make they contour in great piece without take no tice of the little muscle and other break to make themselves master of the rule of perspective to observe the perpendicular parallel and distance of every stroke to compare and oppose the part that meet and traverse the perpendicular so as to form kind of square in the mind which be the great and almost the only rule of design justly to have not only to the model but to the part already ready design there be no such thing as design ing with strict justness but by compare and pro portion every part to the first all the other rule relate to perspective of the expression of the passion that language which above all other painter should carefully endeavour to learn and from nature herseff be the language of the paffion with out it the finest work must appear lifelef and inani mate it be not enough for painterto be able to delineate the most exquisite form give they the most graceful attitude and compose they well together it be not enough to dress they out with propriety and in the most beautiful colour it be not enough in sine by the powerful magie of light and shade to make the canvass vanisn no he must likewise know how to cloath he figure with grief with joy with fear with anger he must in some fort write on they face what they think and what they feel he must give they fife and speech it be indeed in this branch that painting truly soar and in man ner rise superior to herself itbeinthy branch fhe make the spectator apprehend much more than what she express the means employ in she imitation by painting be the circumspection of term the chiaroscura and colour all which appear solely calcilate to strike the visual faculty notwithstanding which she contrive to represent hard and fost rough and smooth surfage which be object of touch and thie by by means of certain tint and certain chiaroscura wliich have different look in marble in the bark vf tree in downy and delicate substance nay she contrive to expref sound and motion by means of light and shade and certain particular configuration in some landscape ' of diderich ' we almost hear the water murmur and see it tremble along the side of the river and of the boat upon it in the battle of burgognone we be really apt to fancy that the trumpet sound and we see the horse who have throw he rider scamper along the plain but what be still more wondersul painting in virtue of she various colour and certain particular tgesture express even the sentiment and most hideden affection of the soul and render she visible so as to make the eye not only touch and hear but even kindle into ' passion and reason many have write and amongst the rest the famous le brûn on ' the various change that becording to various paffion happen in the muscle of the face whichis as it wcre the dumb tongue of the soul they observe for example that in fitof anger the facc redden the muscle of the lip puff out the eye sparkle and that on the contrary in fit of melancholy the eye grow motionlef and dead the face pale and the lip sink in it may be of service to painterto read these and such other remark but it will be ofinfinitely more service to study thein in nature itself from which they have be borrow and which exhibit they in that lively manner which neither tongue nor pen can express but if painter be to have immediate recourse to nature in any thing it be particularly in treat thofc very minute and almost imperceptible difference ence by which however thing very different from each other be often express this be particularly the case with regard to the passion of laugh and cry as in these however contrary the muscle of the sace operate nearly in the saine manner to lionardo de vinci the best master that painter can have recourse to in this branch be those dumb man who have find out the Ithod of express they sentiment by the motion of they hand eye eyebrow and in short every other part of the body this advice no no doubt be very good but then such gesture must be imitate with great sobriety and moderation least they should appear too strong and exaggerate and the piece should shew nothing but pantomime when speak figure alone be to be exhibit and so become theatrical and secondhand or at least look like the copy of theatrical and secondhand nature « as the famous pietro de cortona be one day finish the face of cry child in represcntation of the lron age with which he be adorning the floor call the hotbathi in the royal palace

afraid least the child when she be dead should for want of milk suck she blood medca murdering she child by timomachus be likewise much cry up as the ingenious artist contrive to expref at once in she

the prince of we poet call visible language erté hadéo ie hedeyrtén perspective derspective be the art of delineating visible object on plain surface such as they appear at distance or height upon transparent plane place perpendicular to the horizon between the eye and the object there be three fort of perspective viz linear aerial and specular perspective linear perspective to which most properly belong we definition and which be branch of the mathema tic regard the position magnitude form of the several line or contour of object and expref they dim inution aerial perspective which make part of the art of painting regards the colour lustre strength boldness of distantobject consider as see through column of air and express the diminution therof specular perspective reprefent the object in coni cal spherical or other mirrour erect and clear whereas on lawn and other planc they appear confuse and irregular these three sort of perspective have cach its particular doctrine but before we proceed on the explanation of the doctrine we must teach we pupil what be plane in perspective of which there be five fort viz perspective geometrical horizontal vertical and objective plane perspective plane be plain pellucid furface ordi narily perpendicular to the horizon and place between the spectator 's eye and the object he view through which the optick ray emit from the several point of the object be suppose to paf to the eye and in they passage to leave mark that represent they on the say plane geometrical plane be plane parallel to the ho rizon whereon the object to be del

plane when that be perpendicular to the geometrical onc at right angles .vertical plane be plane pass through the spectator 's eye perpendicular to the geometrical one and usually parallel to the perspective plane a objective plane be any plane situate in the hori zontal zontal plane whiose reprefentation be require in perspective there be likewise several different line in perspective viz terrestrial line geometrical line line of the front vertical line visual line line of station objective line and line of distancegeometrical line in perspective be right line draw in any man ner on

visual line be the line or ray imagine to pass from the object to the eye .a objective line be any line dravn on the geometrical plane whose representation be seek for in draught or picture line of station accord to some writer be the common section of the geometrical and vertical plane other mean by it the perpendicular height ofthe cye above the geometrical plane whose representation be seek for in draught or picture .line of distance be right line draw from the eye to the principal point this as it be perpendicular to the perpendicular of the plane or table can only be the distance of the eye from the tablethe point of the distance in perspective be point in the horizontal line at such distance from the principal point as be that of the eye from the same there be other point besides this point of dotance in perspective viz the point of sight the third point the objective point the accidental point and the the vifual point wliich term point be use for va rious part or place with regard to the perspective planethe point of sight or of the eye be point on the plane mark out by right line draw srom the eye perpendicular to the plane this be also call the principal

and sweep the arch then without alter the compass set set one foot in and describe the arch next rule through the point cg to intersect the arch hi in and draw the line from to which be the perpendicular require another way sce fig iii from the point take the equal distance and on each side of it then stretch the com passto any distance greater than or and with one foot of they in sweep the arch then with the same extent of compass set one point in sweep the archfg and these two arch will intersect each other in the point from which line draw to the point be the perpendicular require to draw one line parallel or equidistant to another give line ab see sig iv extend you compass to the distance of the pa rallel you require then with one foot in any point of the give line as in describe the arch again without alter the compass fix one foot in any other point as in and sweep the arch gh then rule the line touch the outward part of the two arch and that will be the parallel to the give line to bifect or dividc à give line into two equal part sce fig take with you compass any distance greater than half the give line then with one foot of they in sweep sweep the arch cc and with the same distance set one foot in sweep the arch dd and thefe arch will intersect each other in the point gh which join by perpendicular will intersect in the middle point upon the end of give line ab to raise à per pendicular sce fig vi place one soot of the compass in and extend they to any point without thie give line then set one soot of they in cand turn the circle and and through draw the diameter dce meet the circle in join and that right line be the perpendicular require to turn the cirele through any three give point not in right line see fig vii fix three point at any distance you think proper as at and and join they by the right line and ec then by fig bisect the line with the line which do bisect the line bc with the line fe and from the center where thcse line mect extend you compass to and describe the carcle to draee a oval see fig viii draw give line which divide into four equal part set one foot of the compass at and from that center describe circle ee with the same extent of compafse piace one soot in the center and turn the circle fs then with one soot still in extend extend you compass and turn the arch gg and with the same extent place one foot in describe the arch hh join the intersection with perpendicular from to next place one foot of the compass in sweep the arch will and without alter they set one foot in and describe the arch mm another method for a oval see fig ix draw give line and with the compass extend place one foot in with the other turn the circle then without alter you compass on the line in the suppose point weep the circle ff and through the point gg where the two circle intersect draw the perpen dicular then six you compass with one foot nh and extend they so as to describe the arch to the lower extremity of the circle then with the same extent with one foot in sweep the rch il to join the upper extremity by these example it will appear that a oval of any form or size may be construct at pleafure only take care always to fix the compass equi distant from the give line in the perpendicube hi practical example in perspective to draw square pavement in perspective see fig and xi suppose you piece of pavement to consist of sixty four piece of marble each foot square you first business be to draw a ichnographical plan or ground plot of it which be thus perform hav ing make a exact square of the size you intend you plan divide the base and horizon into eight equal part and from every division in the base to its opposite point in the horizon rule perpendicular line then divide the side into the same number rule parallel line across from point to point so will you pavement be divide into sixtyfour square foot because the eight fcet in length multiply by the same in breadth give the number of square foot or piece of marble contain in the wholc then rule diagonal from corner to corner and thus will you ground plot appear as in fig now to lay this in perspective draw another square to you intend size and divide the base line into eight equai part as before then fix you point of sight in the middle of the hori zon and from the fame point rulc linc to every division in the base after which rule diago nal linc from to and froin to answerable to those in the ground plot and you square will be reduce to the triangle then from the point where tlie diagonal de intersect the line to the opposite intersection where the diagonal cross the line rulc parallel line which be the abridgment of the square then through the point where tlie diagonal cross the rest of thetines wlich go from the base to the point of sight rule parallel line and you square pavement will be lay in perspective as in to find the height and proportion of any objeat as they appear above the horizon on fuppose planc sce fig x ii first rule you horizontal line and fix you point of sight as at then mark the place of you nearest pillar by make dot for the base or bottom as at and another for the summit or top as ' at rule à line from to the point of sight and another from to and these twoline will give the height of any number of pillar as for example suppose you would have à pillar at fix you dot for the base and rule from thence parallel line to meet tlie diagonal at then rule the perpendicular de to the di agonal which perpendicular be the height of you figure require at or if you would place pillar at and observe the same method rule the parallel fg and and the perpendicular gh and kl will give they height at the distance requi red to find the diameter or thickness of pillar at any particular distance you be also to be guide by that nearest the bafe for instance suppose you nearest pillar to be ten foot high and one foot in diameter divide it from top to bottom into ten equal part and set off one of they upon the base of the pillar then rulé line from the point of sight to the diameter and you will have the thickness ofall you pillar on they respective pa rallel or basc the same rule exemplify in object below the borizoxe sce fig xiii if you would know the height of number of figure below the horizon rule you horizontal line qr and fix you point of sight as at then place you nearest figure or mark the dot sor the head and foot by the point and which an swer the same purpose and rule from these dot to the point of sight the line pand bp and ie you would find the height of figure to be draw at rule from thence the parallel to the di agonal bp and the perpendicular de will give the height require the same direction will shew the height of figure at any other distance you have mind to place it as at and by rule the parallelsf and and from each of these they respective perpendicular gh and no which perpendicular will shew the height of the figure at and to drav direct view see fig xiv to illustrate this example suppose you be to draw the inside of church as reprefent in this figure first take you station at the point in the center of the base line from which you have à front view of the whole body of the church with all the pillar on each side then fix you horizon at any height you think proper as at de bisect it by the perpendicular ea and where these two line intersect be the point of sight this perpendicular will paf through the center of all the he arch in the dome or cupola which center may be sound by any three give point as in fig vii next divide you base line into any give number of foot and the visual line rule from these division to the point of sight will reduce all you object to they just proportion by set off heir height upon perpendicular raise at they respective distance the base in the example here give be divide into twelve equal part of five foot each from which supposing you front coumn to be thirtyfive foot high take seven divi ion from the base line of you draw and set they off upon the perpendicular then suppose this column to be five foot thick at the base set off one of those division upon the parallel ik which be the breadth require so that by proportion this scale to any distance by the forego direction you may not only find the dimeion of all youcolumn but also of every distinct part of they as well as of all the door window and other object that occur for instance have find the height and breadth of you nearest column draw from the top and bottom of the say column to the point of sight the line hfand kf after which rule the line from the base of the column to the point of sight and you have the height and breadth of all the rest of the column as have be already shew in fig xii by ruling line from the point to the point of sight you will see that all the summit and basis of you column door window must tend immediately to that point and by line draw from the point on each side of the correspoudent point on the opposite side may be see all the part of you building lie upon the fame parallel to draw a oblique viexv sce fig x v first draw you horizontal linc then if you favourite object be on the right hand as at cy place yourself on the left hand upon the base line as at then from that station erect pependicular which will paf through the horizon at the point of sightf to which rule the diagonal gf and which will shew the roof and base of vour principal building and will also as before directed serve as standard for all the rest observe also either in direct or oblique vicw whether the prospect before you make curve for jf it do you must be careful to make the same curve in you draw to draw perspective viev wvherein be accidental point see fig x vi rule you horizontal line and on one part of it fix you point of sight as at from which rule the diagonal cd and can on the one side and ef and and can ' on the other which will shew the roof and basis of all the house in the street directly face you supposing yourself place at in the center of the base line then fix you accidental point and upon the horizontal line and rule from they to the angles and where the street on each side take different direction towards the acci dental point and and the line gi and gk give the roof and basis of all the building on one side asl and mhdo on the other accidental point seldom intervene where the dotance be small as in nobleman 's feat grove canal which may be draw by the strict rule of perspective but where the prospect be extensive and ary include mountain bridge castle river recipice wood city it will require such a infinite number of accidental point that it will be better to do they as nature shall dictate and you ipen judgment approve to find the center for the roof of house in a obtique view sce plate iv suppose from the point of sight the visual line and be draw bc be one perpendicular give and de the other rule the diagonal rom dto and from eto and the perpendicube fg

the method of prepare the various body employ by painter for produce the difference of light and shade which may be term either pigment or fluid as they be solid or aqueous and be distinguished in they several kind accord to the manner of work they as oilcolour watercolour enamelcolour but they variety be too numerous to be in general use most painter therefore select set out of they and become very unjustly prejudice against those they reject it be no little impediment to they improvement in the profession that they be not more extensively bequaint with all the ingredient fit for they purpose those colour which become transparent in oil such aslake prussian blue and brown pink be frequently use without the admixture of white or any other opake pigment by which mean the teint of the ground on which they be lay retain in some degree its force and the real colour pro duce in painting be the combine effect of both this be call glaze and the pigment endue with the property of become transparent in oil be call glaze colour as colour be obtain from various substance the means of prepare tlieni be conscquciitly variwe some being of simple nature and require only to be purify and reduce to proper con sistence or texture and other be compound of different body to be form only by complex process it be therefore very difficult to give such ge neral direction for the make every fort of colour as may be intelligible to all the utensil to be employ as well as the method to be pursue be ing such as belong to different art and trade where neverthelet simple means and the use of such utensiis as be generally knoin may be sufficient to performswhat be want it be best to avoid all techriical term and more complex method of operation adop such mode of instruction as may be universally intelligiblewe now proceed to the nature and preparation of the different colour as they follow in they clafs class ib of red colour vermillion be one of the most useful colour in every kind of painting except enamel or on glaf as it be of moderate price spend to greât advantage in any kind of work and stand or hold its colour class red scarlet or tend to the orange crimson or tend to the purple vermillion carmine native cinnabar lake red lead rose pink scarle oker red oker common indian red venetian rec spanisn brown terra di sienna burnt the artist 's assistant extremely well it may be prepare in great perfection by the follow process take of quick silver cighteen pound of flower of sulphur six pound melt the sulphur in a earthen pot and pour in the quick silver gradual ly be also gently warm and stir they well together with the small end of tobaccopipe but if from the esservescence on add the latter quantity of the quicksilver they take fire extinguissi it by throw wet cloth which should be have ready over the vessel when the maf be cold powder it so that the several part may be well mix together but it be not necessary to réduce it by nicer levigation to a impalpable state have then prepare a oblong glass body or sublimer by coating it well with firelute over the whole sursace of the glaf and work proper rim of the same round it by which it may be hang in the furnace in such manner that one half of it may be expose to the fire fix it in proper furnace and let the powder maf be put into it so as to nearly sill the part that be within the furnace piece of broken tile be lay over the mouth of the glaf sublime then the contents with as strong heat as may be use without blow the fume of the vermillion out of the mouth of the sublimer when the sublima tion be over which may be perceive by the abatement of the heat towards the top of the body discontinue the fire and after tlie body be cold take it out of the furnace and break it collect then together all the part of the sublime cakc separate carefully from they any dross that may have be leave at the bottom of the body as also any any lighter substance that may havé form in the neck and appear tobe dissimilar to the rest levigate the more perfect part and when reduce to fine powder it will be vermillion proper for use but on the perfectness of the levigation depend in great degree the brightnef and goodness of the vermillion in order thercfore to perform this it be necessary that two or three mill of different closcnef should be employ and the last should be of steel and set as finely as possible it be common perhaps general sor dealer to fo phisticate vermillion with red lcad but to detect with certainty the fraud both with respect to the general fact and the proportion use the sollow mean takc small but know quantity of vermillion suspect to be adulterate and put it into crucible have first mix with it about the faine quantity in bulk of charcoal dust put the crucible into common fire liave first cover it with lesser crucible invert into it and give à heat sufficient to suse lead when the crucible be take out of the fire should be well shake by strike it against the ground if the suspect adulteration have be practise the lead will be sound reduce to its metalline state in the bottoin of the crucible and be weigh and com pared with the quantity of cinnabar that be put into the crucible the proportion of the adulteration may be thence certainly know but if no lead be find in the crucible it may be safcly in serr that no red lead have be commixt with the vermillion native native cinnabar it find naturally form in the earth though seldom of pure as to be sit for the use of painting at least without be purisy by sublimation the mistaken notion that it would stand better than vermillion because it be natural production have make it to be covet by painter who be curious on colour it be however not worth they while so be folicitous about it as it never excel the best vermillion in brightness and what be generally fold or it be pigment compound of quicksilver and ' sulphur red lead or minum the goodnef of red lead may be see by its brightnefs and mixture of any kind will make it of dull appearance it bepn this account not of liable to be fophisticated as white lead or vermillion it be lead calcine till it acquire proper degree of colour by exposing it with large furface to the fire scarlet oker be a ochrous earthy or rather irony fubstance and be the basis of green vitriol feparate from the at acid ofthe vitriol by calcination it be kind of orange fcarlet colour and rival any of the native oker from its certainty of standing and extreme strength and warmth either as ground or in the shade of carnation it be ufeful as colour in any kind of painting the manner of its preparation be be follow take of green vitriol or coppera any quantity and be put into crucible of whicl it will sill two third set it on common fire to boil takirig care that it do not boil over till the matter be nearly dry when it will be greatly diminish in quantity fill then the crucible to the same height again and repcat the boiling and replenisning till the crucible be sill with dry matter take it then from this fire and putit into windfurnace or if the quantity be small it may be con tinue in the same fire the coal be heap up round it let the contents be calcine there till they become of red colour when cold which must be examine by take little of the matter out of the middle and suffc it to cool for so long as it remain hot the red colour will not appear though it be sufficiently calcine when duly calcine take the oker out of the crucible while hot and put it into water in which the part of the broken crucible may be be snake likewise to obtain more easily what shall adhere to they and stir the oker well about in the water that all the remain vitriol may be melt out of it let it then settle and when the water appear clear pour it off and add fresh quantity take out all the broken piece of the crucible and proceed as before repeat several time this treatinent wath fressi quantity of water then purify the oker from any remain soulness by wash over and havitig bring it to proper state of dryness by draining off the fluid by silter in which the paper must be covez with line cloth lay it to dry on board common common indian red be substitute in place of the real kind bring from the eastindy serve equally well sor com mon purpose give teint verge to scarlet varying from the true indian red which be greatly ineliry to the purple and on account of its warm though not bright colour it be much use as well in finer as coarser painting in oil it be afford cheap and may be thus manage take of the caput mortuum or oker lest in the iron pot after the distillation of aquafortis from nitre and vitriol two part and of the canput mortuum or colcothar leave in the long neck after the distillation of oil of vitriol one part break the lump find among they and put they into tub with good quantity of water and hav ing let they stand for day or two frequently stir they well about lade off as much water as can be get clear from they and add fresti quantity repeat the same treatment till all the falt be wash out and the water come off nearly insipid the red powder which remain must then be wash over and be freed from the water lay out to dry when this be design for nicer purpose it should be wash over again in bason the grof manner of lad it out of one tub into another not fitting it always completely to such end venetian red useful to housepainter in imitate mahoganyand be à native red oker incline to scarlet and casily easily prepare by mixing it with the colcothar or caput mortuum take out of the aquafortis pot and wash over it require no other preparation for use than to be well ground with oil unless when it be use in miniature paintingwhen it should be wash over with tlie utmost care spanish brown resemble the venetian red very much in colour but be souler it be à native pigment and use much in the fame state nature produce it be dug up in several part of england no other preparation be necdful than freeing it well from stone and filthi and grind it with oil to render it fit for colourman in the preparation of cloths for picture and other coarse workcaleineel or burne terra di siennx be originally yellow but when modcrately calcine become a orange red though not very bright it be native oker bring hither srom italy in the state in which it be naturally find it be calcine by put lump of it either in crucible or naked in common sire and continue it there till the colour be change from yellow to red it be exceedingly ufeful in oilpainting and admit of no adulteration it may be distinguished fromn other ochrous earth by its semitransparency carmine be bright crimson colour of great advantage in painting as well in water as varnish the preparation of it be keep fecret by thosc who prepare it in persection and the superiority of the french carmine shew that the proper method be want in englandthough some wrongly attribute the excellence to quality in the air and water of france there be several recipe for this colour but rather than insert impersect instruction for a article of great confequence we choose to be silent lak the best of what be commonly sell be make from the colour extract from scarlet rag and deposit on the cuttlebone which may be do in the fol low manner takepound of the best pearlash and hav ing dissolve they in two quart of water purisy they by filter through paper add then to this solution two more quart of water and have put in pound of scarlet shred procure of the taylor which must be entirely clean boil they in pewter boiler till the shred appear to have wholly lose they scarlet colour take they out of the solution and press they well dip they aster in water and press they again that all the fluid they have imbibe may be get from they in order to be put back to the rest take then another pound of the scarlct shred and repeat the like treatment of they in the same solution as also third and fourth pound while this be do dissolve pound and half of cuttlefishbone in pound of strong aquafortis in glass receiver add more of the bone if it appear pear to produce any ebullition in the aquafortis and have strain off this solution through flannel pour it into the other by degree observing whether it produce any esservescence on putting in the last quantity which if it do in any great degree more of the cuttlefishbone must be dissolve in aquafortis and the solution very gradually add till no ebullition appear to be raise by it in the mixture if this be properly ma nage the fluid will soon become clear and colourless and the ting particle extract from the shred together with the cuttlefishbone will subside to the bottom and form crimson sediment which be the lake the water must then be pour off and two gallon of hard spring water must be put to the lake and well stir about to mix tliem this be likewise pour off after the lake have again settle to the bottom must be replace by another two gallon and the same method must be repeat four or five time but if hard water can not be procure or the lake appear too purple half a ounce of alum should be add to each quantity of water before it be use when the lake be thus fufficiently freed from the salt it must have the water drain from it in filter cover with line cloth which have be so wear as to have no nap or down remain on its furface after the lake have be drain to proper drynef it must be drop on clean board by means of proper funnel through which the drop be suffer to paf and rest on the board at proper distance they will become small cone or pyramid in which form the lake must be suffer to dry and the preparation be then complete pink the basis of this pigment be principally chalk and the ting substance extract from brasil of campeachy wood it will not stand with oil or wa ter and be seldom employ but for the coarse work of house painter or for paper hang unless secure from fly with varnish when if good it may be substitute for lake it be prepare as follow take brasil wood six pound or three pound of brasil and three of peachy wood boil they a hour with three gallon of water in which quarter of pound of alum be dissolve purify then the fluid by strain through flannel and put back the wood into the boiler with the same quantity of alum and proceed as before repeating this third time mix then the three quan tity of tincture together and evaporate they till only two quart of fluid remain which eva poration must be perform first in the pewter boiler and afterwards in ralneo mariae prepare in the mean time eight pound of chalk by wash over pound of alum be put into the water use for that purpose which after the chalk be wash must be pour off and supply by fresn quantity till the chalk be freed from the salt form by the alum after which it must be dry to the consistence of stiff clay the chalk and tincture as above prepare must be then well mix together by grind and afterwards lay out to dry where neither the sun or cold air can reach it though if it can be con veniently do gentle heat may be use red red oker be native earth bring chiefly from oxsordshire and burnt afterwards by those who prepare it in large oven till by calcination it become red it be very useful as well in the more delicate as coarser painting in oil for it stand infalliby for nicer purpose it should be wash over but for other it may be use in the state in which it be sound in the fhop class ilt blue colour ultramarine be bright blue colour of the highest value in every kind of painting be equally serviceable in all even in enamel it have à tranparent effect in oil and in some degree in watera and will stand without the lcast hazard of sly by reason of its high price prussian blue have be much introduce to the prejudice of painting in ge neral as tlie fky of landfkape and many other part of modern picture shew the loss of ultramarine by they changing from warm or elcar blue to faint green or olive teint the method liave be continually varied by those who have attempte class ii blue ultramarine indigo uitramnarine afh smnalt prussian blue bice verditer litinus or lat muso cendic blue or saader bluc tempte to prepare this pigment the sollow be tlie best of the more modern take the lapis lazuli and break it into very small piece or rather ' grof powder put it into erucible and cover it securely to prevent the coal srom sall amongst it caleine it then with strong fire sor a hour be thiere be any large quantity or less time in proportion and quench it when take out of the fire in vinegar stir they well together and suffer it to remain in that state for à day or two pour off then the vinegar except what may be necessary sor moistening the calcine lapis lazuli in grinding which operation it must then undergo in mortar of flint or glaf till reduce to the greafest degree of finenef those means may effect but if it appear yet too hard to be easily ground give it another short calcination and quench it second time in vinegar the vinegar must then be wash off from ' the powder by the put to it several succcssive quantity of clean water each of which must be pour off when the lapis lazuli have be well stir about in they and be again settle to the bottom it must then be ground on porphyry stone with mullar till it be perfectly impalpable and then dry in which statc it be duly prepare to mix with the sollow cement take of burgundy pitch nine ounceof white resin and venice turpentine six ounceof virgin wax one ounce and hal sand of linseed oil one ounce and quarter mix tliem together by melt in pipkin over the fire and suffer they to boil till they acquire so stiff consistence that be drop into water whilc of this boiling heat they they will not spread on the surface of it 's but form roundisni mass or lump the cement be thus form may be pour out of the pipkin in the water and make into cake or roll sor use of this cement take a equal weight with that of the calcine lapis lazuli and melt it in glaze carthen pipkin but not so as to render it too fluid then add to it the calcine matter by very slow degree stir they together with a ivory spatula till the whole appear persectly mix be thus mix heat the composition to something greater degree and cast it into large bason full of cold water when it have cool to consistence to bear such treatment knead it well like the dough of bread with the hand rub over with linsc oil till all the part be thoroughly incorporate with each other then make the maf into cake which may be cither keep till some other convenient time in cold water or immediately proceed with in the follow manner put the cake into a earthen disn or bason tlie bottom of which should be rub with linseed oil and pour on it water of the warmth of blood let it stand quarter of a hour and as the water soften the cake it will let loose the finest part of the calcine matter which on genely stir the water but without break the cake or separate it into lesser part will be suspend in the water and must be pour off with it into another vessel the quantity of water must be then renew and the same operation repeat fecond or third time and as the maf appear slack in afford the colour it must be move and stir in the manner of knead with the ivory spatula but et not not break into fragment or small part and when so much of the colour be extract as to render it necessary for the obtain more the heat of the water must be increase to the greatest degree the quantity of the calcine matter which be now the altramarine that be first wash off and appear of the same degree of deep nefs and brightneis may be put together and the same of those of the second degree thie last washing make third the water be then poured off from each of these parcel but on lixivium form of two ounce of salt of tartar or pearlafhy dissolve in pint of water and filter through paper after the solution be cold this lixivium must be put on boiling hot and the ul tramarine stir well about in it and then the mixture set to cool the powder be subside the clear lixivium must be pour off and clean water put in its place which must be repeat till the whole of the salt of the lixivium be wash away the ultramarine must afterwards be dry and will be then duly prepare for use uitramarine be subject to be adulterate on becount of its great pricethis be frequently do by precipitation of copper make by alkaline salt and be very injurious because the magistery of copper if the ultramarine sophisticated with it be use in painting either with oil or water will change its hue and turn black and in enamel painting as soon as flux it will become green and consequently make the effect of the ultrama rine vary from what be intend this fraud may be easily detect by pour some dilut spirit the artist assistant of nitre on small quantity which if there be any copper will soon dissolve and forin greenissi blue solution ultramarine ash after the ultramarine lias be extract from the lapis lazuli the residuum or remains from this pigment and when the operation of extract the colour have not succeed well considcrable share of the ultramarine be leave behind with the recrement and greatly enhance the worth of the afh for of course the valuc of the latter be inserior to the former but it be still subject to adulteration which may be discover by put some of it into small quantity of spirit of nitre and if there be any copper in it it will be ting green it be prepare as sollow take the cement of the ultramarine which remain after the colour be extract and mix it with four time its weight of linseed oil let the mixture be set in glaze pipkin over the fire and when it be thus boil fhort time putit into glass vessel sufficiently large to contain it of cylindrical figure of which vessel the diameter must be small in proportion to the length but care must be take that the matter when put into this glaf be cool enough not to endanger the break it this glaf must then be put into balneum mariæ which must be make as hot as possible without boiling and keep there till the colour appear to be all subside to the bottoin the oil must then be pour off till the colgur appear to rise with it and the xemainder with the the colour in it must be put into another glass of the same kind with as much fresh oil as will rise five or six inch above the colour this glaf must be treat in the same manner as the first observe when the colour have subside the oil must be pour off and fresli quantity put in its place this have be likewise pour off the colour must then be well wash to free it from the remain oil first in boiling water and afterwards in some of the lixivium abovemention make boiling hot also as much of the lixivium be pour off when the colour have subside as can be separate from it that way the colour must be thoroughly freed from the remainder by bequent ablution with clean water aster which the water must be take off by the means above direct for the ultramarine till the matter be of proper degree of moisture for grind it must then be thoroughly well ground on porphyry and wasly over that all the harder and insufficiently calcincd part may be reduce to a im palpable powder in order to which the remaining grosser part aster the finer have be separate by tlie wash over must be again ground till the whole be perfectly finethe fame means must be afterwards use to bring the afh to dry powder that be besore direct for the ultramarinc prussian blue lave the earth of alum combine with the fix sulphur of animal or vegetable coal and may be make from almost any animal substance but it be generally make of the coal of blood only it be useful il in all kind of painting save enamel and prepare to different degree of brightness and strength the common kind find in the shop and sell at very low price can be little depended upon in painting of confequence therefore it should be prepare perfect and in the true manner and then consider the high price of ul tramarine and the foulnef of the indigo it may be deem a acquisition to the art of painting take of blood any quantity and evaporate it to perfect drynef of this dry blood powder take six pound and of the best pearlashy two potind mix they well together in glaf or stone mortar and then put the mixt matter into large crucible or earthen pot and calcine it in furnace the top of the crucible or pot be cover with tile or other such convenient thing but not lute the calcination should be continue so long as any flame appear to issue from the matter or rather till the flame become slender and blue for if the sire be very strong sinall flame would arise for very long time and great part of the ting matter would be dissipate and lose when the matter have be sufficiently calcine take the vessel which contain it out of the fire and as quickly as possible throw it into two or three gallon of water and as it soak there break it with wooden spatula that no lump may remain put it then in proper tin vessel and boil it for the space of th ree quarter of a hour or more filter it while hot through paper in tin cullender and paf some water through the filter whenit be run dry to wash out the remainder of the lixivium of the blood and pearlash athe earth remain in the silter may be then throw away in tlie mean time dissolve of clean alum four pound and of green vitriol or coppera two pound in three gallon of water add this solution gradually to the filter lixivium so long as any cffervescence appear to arise on the mixture but when no ebullition or ferment follow the admixture ceafe to put in more let the mixture then stand at rest and green powder will be precipitate from which when it have thoroughly subside the clear part of the fluid must be pour off and fresn water put in its place and stir well about with the green powder and after proper time of settle this water must be pour off like the first take then of spirit of salt double the weight of the green vitriol which be contain in the quantity of solution of vitriol and alum add to the lixivium which will soon turn the green matter to blue colour and after some time add proper quantity of water and wasn the colour in the same manner as have be direct for lakc and when properly wash proceed in the same manner to dry it in lump oc convenient size

will not work with either brush or pencil but by strew it upon any ground of oil paint while wet it make bright blue shine surface proper for large sundial and other such appli cation in enamelpainting and in painting on glaf it be of great ufe bice at prefent several composition of indigo and verditer with chalk and other cheap substance be sell in this name but the true kind be fmalt reduced to fine powder by levigation from its unsuitable texture it be now greatly disus or it make light warm blue colour and be formerly use in oil but more frequently in watercolour litmus or latmus water painting be the only kind in which this can be use and as it be bring from holland at very chcap rate it be almost needless to give the preparation but if any be desirous sor curiosity to know thie process it be form from archal species of mof bring from the canary and cape de verd island and prepare as sollow . `` add quick lime the and putrisy urine or spirit of urine distilled from lime to the archal previously bruise by grind this mixture must be susser to stand till it bequire à very bluc colour after which the sluid must be suffer to evaporate and the remaining maf when it be

bring from abroad it be yellow rather incline to the orange seldom use but in oil painting where it be generally find to stand well it be brighter than other yellow at present in use except the king ' yellow but if it touch iron along with the least watry moisture it will be change by it for which reason care should be take to employ a ivory spatula instead of pallet knife during the grind of it with oil which be the only preparation practise on it as it do not well bear levigation with water yellow oker the fubstance of this be mineral earth find in different place of various degree of

itself from space to space by a ingenious distribution of grand clair and large shadow which afford one another mutual succour by they opposition so that the great clair be rest for the great shadow as the great shadow will be rest for the great clair in the description of colour there must be a becord which may producc the same effect sor the eye as music do sor the ear if there be several group of clairobscure in picture one of they must be more sensible than the rest so that there may be unity of object as in the composition there be unity of subject as to the pencil it must be bold and light if pos sible but whether it appear smooth like that of corregio egio or uneven and rough like that of rembrant should be al way fost as to licence if onc be force to take any they nust be imperceptible judicious advantageous and uthorife the three first be for the art of the ainter and the last regards history the invention which be a essential parf of the rt consist only in find the object which must nter the picture accord to tlie imagination of he painter false or true fabulous or historical as to the compositionsome have consound he first part of painting with the genius other vith fertility of thought and other with the lisposition of object but all those thing be diferent from one another think that to give lear idca of the first part of painting should all it composition and divide it into two viz nvention and disposition the invention find only he object of the painting and the disposition lace they the invention be form by read in the fubject xtract from history or the fable it be pure ffect of the imagination in metaphorical sulyject contribute to the fidelity of the history as to the learness of the allegory and in what manner oever it be ufe it must never keep the mind of he spectator in fuspence by any obscurity as to the design which consider as the second art of painting the quality or condition require in design be correctness good taste elegance character di versity expression and perspective correctness depend principally on the justness of the proportion and à knowledge of anatomytaste taste be a idea or manner of design which arise either srom the complexion and natural doposition or from education one 's master study elegance give the figure kind of delicacy which strike people of judgment and certain agrecableness which please every body the character be what be peculiar to cach thing in which there must be diversity in as much as every thing have its particular character to distinguish it the expression be as already observe the representation of a object accord to its character and the several circumstance it be suppose to be in the perspective be the representation of the part of painting or figure accord to the situation they be in with respect to the point of sight the principal rulc that regard the design be that novice accustom themselves to copy good original at first sight not to use square in draw for fear of stint and confine they judgment to they begin the practice of perspective rule in designing aster the life to learn to adjust the bignef of they sigure to the visual angle and the distance of the eye from the model or object to mark it at all the part of they design before they begin to shiadow to make they contour in great piece without take notice of the little inuscle and other break to make themselves master of the rule of perspective to observe every stroke as to its perpendicular parallel and distance and particularly so to compare and oppose the part that meet upon and traverse the perpendicular as to form kind of square in the mind which be the great and almost the only rule of design justly to have regard the artist 's assistant not only to the model but also to the part already design there be no such thing as design with strict justness but by compare and proportioning every part to the first as to attitude in they the ponderation and contrast be found in nature it perform no betion without shew those two part and be it to fail in it it would be cither deprive of motion or constrain in its action as to expreffionthey be the touchstone of the judgment of the painter he shew by the justness wherewith he distribute they he penetration and discernment as to the extremity viz the head foot and hand must be more finish than any other thing as to draperyit be say in painting to throw drapery or give drapery instead of cloath figure drapery be not to be set in form as we cloath be but the plait must be find as by chance round the member that they may make they appear such as they be and by a industrious artifice contrast they in shew they and caress they by they tender sinuosity and softness as to the landskape .— this kind of painting con tain a abridgment of all the other the painter who practise it must have a universal knowledge of the part of he art if not in so great à detail as those who commonly paint history at least speculatively and in general and if he do not finish all the object in particular which compose he piece or accompany he landfkape he be oblige at least to expref in lively manner the taste and character thereof and to give the much more spirit to he work that it be less finish let landfkape be ever so well finish if the comparison of the object do not render they va luable and preserve they character if the site be not well choose or be not supply by fine intelligence of the clairobscure if the touch be not judicious if the place be not animated by figure animal or other object which be most commonly in motion and if the truth and variety of nature be not join to the good taste of the colour and to the extraordinary sensation the painting will never gain reputation among connoisseur as to perspective .some author have imagine that perspective and painting be the same thing because there be no painting without perspective though the proposition be false absolutely speak since the body which can not be without shadow be not notwithstanding the same thing with the shadow but however it be true in that sense that painter can not do without perspective and that he do not draw alike nor give à stroke of he pencil without perspective have some part in it at least habitually the colour in its general sense take in whatever relate to the nature and union of colour they agreement or antipathy how to use they to advantage in light and shadow so as to shew relievo in the figure and sinking of the ground what relate to the æriel perspective the dimi nution of colour by means of the interposition of air the various accident and circumstance of the luminary and the medium the different light both of the body illuminating and illuminate they reflection shadow different view with regard either to the position of the eye or the object what what produce strength boldnef sweetness in painting well coloured the various manners of colour both in figure landfkape as to the pencilhere the word pencil signify only the manner of use it in the application of colour and when those fame colour have not be too much agitate and as it be faid too much torment by the motion of heavy hand but on the contrary the motion appear free quick and light it be say that the work be of good peneil but that free pencil be of but little signification unlef it be guide d by the head and shew that the the painter be master of he art in word fine pencil be to painting what music be to fine voice since both be esteem in proportion of the grand effect and harmony whichaccompany they the next thing we pupil painter be to provide himself with be colour for which he have instruction fufficient to guide he choice in proper selectionhe next care be pencil brush to apply they there be pencil of various kind and more of various matter the most useful be make of badger and squirrel hair thofe of swan down and those of boar bristle which last be bound on to stick bigger or less accord to the use they be destine for and when large be call brush the other be inclose in the barrel of quill besides pencil we must have pallat which be little oval table or picce of wood or ivory very thin and smoothi on and round which the painter place the feveral colour they have occasion for ready for the pencil the middle serve to mix the colour on and to make the teint require in the work it have no handle but in lieu thereof hole at one end to put the thumb through to hold it with regard to the material in painting the matter whereon they be apply and the manner of apply they be of various kind lience come painting in fresco painting in oil painting in water colour or lim painting in miniature painting in enamel and painting on glass fresco be kind of painting perform on freshi plaister or on wall lay with mortar not yet dry and with water colour the colour use be white make of lime slake long ago and white marble dust oker both red and yellow violet red verditer lapis lazuli smalt black earth all which be only ground and work up with water and most of they grow brighter and brighter as the fresco dry this fort of painting be chiefly perform on wall and vault newly plaister with lime and sand but the plaister be only to be lay in propor tion as the painting go on no more being to be do at once than the painter can dispatch in day while it be dry before he begin to paint cartoon or design be usually make on paper to be chalk and trans ferr to the wall about half a hour after the plaister be apply painting in oil be perform on wall on wood canva stone and all sort of metal to paint on wall . when well dry you must give it two or three wash with boiling oil till the plaister remain quite greasy and will imbibe no more over this be apply desiccative or drying colour viz white chalk red oker or other chalk beaten beaten pretty stiff this layer be well dry you will sketch and design you subject and at last paint it over mixing little varnish with you colour to save the varnishing afterwards other to fortify they wall better against moiture cover it with plaister of lime marblé dust or cement make of beaten tile soak with lin seed oil and at last prepare composition of greek pitch mastich and thick varnish boil together which they apply hot over the former plaister when dry the colour be apply as before to paint on woodthey usually give they ground layer of white temper with size or they apply the oil abovemention the rest as in painting on wall to paint on cloth or canvathe canva be stretch on frame you must give it layer of size or paste water when dry you shall go over with pumice storie to smooth off the knot when the cloth be dry lay of oker must be lay on sometimes mixing with it little white lead to make it dry the sooner when dry you will go again over it with the pumice stone to make it fmooth after this second layer compose of white lead and little charcoal black be sometimes add to render the ground of a afh colour observe in each manner to lay on as little colour as possible as little oil be to be use as possible if it be desired to have the colour keep frefh for this reafon some mix they with oil of aspic which evaporate immediately yet serve to make they manageable with the pencil as to oil the best be those of walnut linseed aspic and turpentine the desiccative or drying oil be à nut oil boil with litharge and sandarach other with spirit of wine mastich and gumlacca the next operation be to draw the design on the canva and afterwards to prime the work whicha be do by lay lay of white all over it except on the linc of the draught which must be keep visible then if the picture be history piecc or portrait the painter begin by the face or face which together with all the other naked part to be pronounce in the picture be call carnation the carnation be make with white and carmine and brown blue and yellow for the shadow becording to the complexion the painter design to give to the figure or figure he be to represent the application of colour in painting be con sider either with regard to the kind of painting in work of various colour or in those of one single colour first in the larger picce the colour be rather lay on full so as they may be impressed or incorporate together which make they hold the more firmly or else the more agrecable one which dry too hard and too hastily be mix with little colour and the clearest of the oil but in both case the colour be to be lay on strong at first it be eafy to weaken those which be to be thrust back and to heighten the other the touch to be bold by the conduct of free and steady pencil that the work may appear the most finish at proper distance and the figure animated with life and spirit for glaze colour care must be take that the under colour be paint strong and that it be body colour and lay smooth in finish work which be to be view near at hand the process be either by apply each colour in its place preserve they purity without fret or torment they but sweetly sosten off the extremity or by fill up all the great part with one single colour and lay the other colour which be to form the litile thing upon it which be the more expeditious way but more apt to decay for the second the kind of picture in one colour be two viz camieux where the degradation of colour of object afar off be usually manage by light or with crayon and baf relievo which be a imitation of sculpture of whatsoever matter and colour in both these the colour be wring dry for the oconomy and dispense of colour in painting regard be either to be have first to tle quality of the colour to appropriate they becording to they value and agreement or secondly to they effect in the union and oconomy of the work for the quality ' it must be observe that white represent light and give the brifkness and heightening black on the contrary like darkneis obthe light part and by that they serve each other to loosen the object proper choice to bemake of colour and the too much charge manner to be avoid both in carnation where red colour be not to be affect or rather resemble thè flesn when flead from the fkin how delicate foever be always of bloom colour in the drapery where the painter have he whole stock of colour to choose out of to procure good cffect and in the landskape landfkape to dispose those colour near one another which mutually asfist and raise each other force and brifkness as red and green yellow and blue to manage they so as that they may be accommodate to the effect of the great part of light and colour that the strong colour lead to the soft one and make they more look at bring they forward or keep they back accord to the situation and the degree of force require for the effect of colour they either regard the union or the oconomy with respect to the first care must be take that they be lay so as to be sweetly united under the briskness of some principal one that they participate of the prevail light of this piece and that they partake of each other by the communication of light and the help of reslection for the oconomy in manage they degree regard be to be have to the contrast or the opposition intervene in the union of thie colour that by sweet interruption the brifkness which otherwise fade and pall may be raise to the harmony which make the variety of colour agree supplying and sustain the weakness of some by the strength of other neglect some place on purpose to ferve as basis or repose to the sight and to inhance those which be to prevail through the piece to the degredation where the better to pro portion the colour that fall behind some of the same kind be to be preserve in they purity as standard for those carry afar off to be compare by in order to justify the diminution regard be always have to the quality of the air which when load with vapour weaken the colour more than than when clear to the situation of the colour where care must be take that tlie purest and the strongest be place before or in the front of the piece and that by they force the compound one which be to appear at distance be keep back particularly the glaze colour to be use in the first rank lastly to tlie expreffion of the subject and the nature of the matter or stuff whether shine or dull opake or ' transparent polish or rough the different colour which you be to employ in you picture be to be mix as follow for violet colour take indigo white lead and lake mix they all well together and the more or less of each quantity will make it deeper or lighter lead colour be make of white and indigo well mix together scarlet of lake red lead and little vermillion ' though in fine painting would prefer carmine with very small quantity of ultramarine and still sialler one of fine ceruss light green of pink and smalt middle and light green of verdigrise and pink deep and sad green indigo and pink purple colour of spanish brown indigo and white well mix murrey colour ofwhite and lake flame colour of red lead and masticot heighten with whitc but these general rule be not to captivate the imagination of painter no more than the follow one for good painter who have good natural genius for he art and take pleasure in the practice thereos make often new discovery to render he drapery moré beautiful as for carnation they be always make of though same mixture of colour the whole secret consist in the judicious application thereof after painter have transfer he draught on he canva and have primed it he begin he piece first by draw the eye or nose have while he work he right hand support with mollstick or stay make of heavy wood not subject to bend about yard long havingat the end which lean against the picture ball of ravel cotton with leather over it the other end hold with the leavehand make the white thereof with white lcad with little charcoal black this sinish he leave from the eye in face full front the distance of a eye then draw the proportion of the nose afterward make the mouth car this do he lay he carnation or flesh colour over the face casting in here and there fome shadow which he work in by degree with the flesh colour which slesh colour be commonly compound of white lead lake and vermillion or carmine this last be best there be no fix rule sor heighten or deepen this colour for it be leave to the discretion and judgment of the painter who must consult in this he own imagination with regard to the age country of the person whose face he endeavour to represent then he shadow the face over as he see cause and finifh the nose compass the tip of it with some dark or light reddish shadow which shadow for the face be commonly compound ofivory black white lead vermillion lake fcacoal black the cheek and lip be fhadow with vermillion or carmine and lake mix togethe and the mouth stroke be make with lake only as to the circle of the eye for grey eye they be make of charcoal black and white lead heightened and deepen at pleasure the black circle of the the eye be make of umber scacoal black and little white mix together the round ball in the eye of lamp black and verdigrise since the lamp black will hardly dry without it the same colour use in painting and shadow the face be use in painting the hand and shadow they between the finger when painter want to make flesh colour of swarthy complexion he mix white le ad lake and yellow oker together and shadow it with mixture of umber and seacoal black for black hair he use lamp black only and when he will have they brighter mix it with little umber white and red lead put in more umber if he want they browner and more white lead if whiter but if quite dark he add à little seacoal black yellow hair be make of mixture of masticot umber yellow oker and little red lead increase the quantity of umber and red lead if they be want redder for white hair he take a equal quantity of ivory black and of umber viz half of each and temper they well upon he pallat with white lead take more or less of those three colour accord as the hair be to be heightened or deepen the tooth be make of white lead and shadow with charcoal black as to the different stuff the figure be to be cloath with it must be leave entirely to the ima gination and judgment of the painter the several colour use in painting be also call teint and semiteint consider the co lour as more or less high or bright or deep or thin or weaken and diminish to give the proper relievo or softrief for distance to the several object and the lessen and rendering dim and confuse . the appcarance of different object in landskape of as they shall appear there as they would do to a eye place at that distance from they be call in painting degradation as to painting in water colour call lim in contradistinction of painting properly so call which be do in oil colour the usual colour be proper enough except the white make of lime which be only use in fresco but the azure or ul tramarine must always be mix up with size or with guin in regard to yolk of egg they give bluc colour greenish tincture but there be always apply two lay of hot size before the colour mix even with size be lay on the composition make with egg and the juice of the fig tree be only use for touch up and finish and to prevent the necessity of have the fire always at hand to keep the size hot yet it be certain that the size colour hold the best and be accordingly always use in cartoon . this size be make of shred of thin leather or of parchment to limn on line the best be that which be old half wear and close . this be stamp with white lead or fine plaister beaten up with size which once dry we must go over it with layer of the same size the colour be all ground in water each by itself and in proportion as they be require in working be dilut with they size waterlf the yolk of egg be desire they must be dilut with water make of equal quantity of common water and vinegar with the yolk white and shell of a egg and the end of the little branch of fig the artist 's

other colour which may render the line discernable the draught be fill afterwards with very thin and smooth lay of white yet some choose to paint on the naked vellum without any lay and in my opinion it contribute much towards incorporate well the colour that the dot may not appear so visible and so coarse as they dowithout it when the lay be dry the painter search with he pencil all the line of the draught lest some of tlaem should be either much weaken or entirely obliterate by the lay of white then he begin as in all other painting by the face dip first the point of he pencil in water and rub it afterwards on the colour he design to employ when thus rub he make the point thereof with the tip of he lip and then apply it on the vellum repeat the famc process every time he want colour and

common method of colour this flower be to begin with lay of thin carmine and to shadow it by use the carmine in degree thicker and consequently darker this manner by its gay appearance at first court the eye but be evidently erroneous for notwithstanding the finest colour we can use be but dirt when compare with the natural gaity of the teint on flower yet the colour the rose with carmine only give it à disagrecable and unnatural glare to prevent which it be here recom mend after the sirst or lightest carmine be lay on soften it with faint wasn of prussian bly then proceed with pure carmine

and stalk be blueish green only at the joint there be for the most part yellowish tinge which be also at the bottom of the cup and scale painting on silk sattin have with the utmost circumspection lay down the rulc for painting on paper we now proceed for the amusement and instruction of those ingenious lady who delight in the abovemention branch with the same care to give the follow necessary instruction when the outline be make accord to the astist ' sancy wash of isinglaf should with care be lay on to take away the glare and sleekness of the sattin otherwise the colour will not work freely the isinglass to be melt in very clear water over the fire so as not to be very glutinous otherwise it will discolour the sattin and consequently spoil the colour in the forego rule we have recommend for the most part the leave the paper for the light part of flower and work with colour mostly transparent but here the light be to be make by small tincture of the colour of the intend flower mixt with flake white so much as just to make degree from the colour of the sattin if white or if any other colour to be mix proportionably the colour of the slower for instance if blue slower the bice or verditer very small quantity of it with the white use less of it proportionally as the snade grow darker and in the most dark indigo alone may be use it be by that time opake enough but great care must be use not to lay the colour on too thick otherwise they will crack little white sugarcaudy will be find very necessary when mixt with the gum water as preventive ventive to that inconveniency if flower happen to be of so deep colour as not to admit of any pure white in the lightest of the part fort of priming of white should be lay on after which when dry begin with the ground colour of the flower proceed gradually with the shade as in the above direction which with lively flower peculiarly choose from nature for the purpose we hope will be sufficient to initiate we ingenious and fair student in this most delightful amufcment painting with crayon whether the painter work with oil colour water colour or crayon the grand object of he pursuit be still the same just imitation of nature but each species have its peculiar rule and method painting with crayon require in many respects treatment different from painting in oil colour because all colour use dry be in they nature of much warmer complexion than wlien wet with oil or any other bind fluid let this be prov ed by matter of factmr. cote paint portrait of sir william chamber which be in lord besborough ' collection a ingenious foreigner have discover method of fix crayon picture so that they would not rub or receive a injury if any becident happen to the glaf thé society for the encouragement of art have before offer premium to any one who should discover so valuable secret for which premium he make application mo . cote be eminent in he profession be desired to lend picture sor the trial and give he judgment which be make on this portrait of sir william chamber the crayon he indeed so perfectly fix as to resist any rub or brush without the least injury which before would have entirely deface or spoiled it but the picture which before have particularly warm brilliant and agrceable effect in comparison become cold and purple and though in one sense the attempt succecd to the de sign intention of fix the colour yet the binding quality of whatever fluid be make use of in the process change the complexion of the colour render the cold teint too predominant for this reason in order to produce rich picture much greater portion of what painter term cool teint must be apply in crayon painting than would be judicious to use in oil without any danger of mistake it be to be suppose the not be acquainted with this observation be one great cause why so many oil painter have no better success when they attempt crayon painting on the contrary crayon painter be so much use to those teint which arè of cold nature when use wet be apt to in troduce they too much when they paint with oil which be seldom productive of good effect another observation would make which requi res particular notice from the student who have be conversant with oil painting prior to he attempt with crayon oil painter begin they picture much lighter and fainter than they intend to finish they which prefent the future colour clear and brilliant the light underneath greatly assist the tranparent glaze and scumble colour which if they we be be lay over any part already too dark would but increase its heavy effect on the contrary crayon be make of dry colour be difficult to procure sufficiently dark the crayon painter therefore will find a absolute necessity to begin he picture as dark and rich as possible except in the strongest light for if once the grey and light teint becomc predominant it will be next to impossible for he in the deep shadow especially to restore depth and brilliancy have no opportunity of glaze or scum bling to give the effect as the grey teint be mixture with whiting underneath will contin ually work up and render the attempt abortive shall now endeavour to give the student some direction towards the attainment of excellence in this art the student must provide himself with some strong blue paper the thicker the better if the grain be not too coarse and knotty though it be almost impossible to get any intirely free from knot the knot should be level with penknife or razor otherwise they will prove excecdingly troublesome aster this be do the paper must be paste very smooth on line cloth previoussy strain on frame the size accord to the artist 's pleasure on this the picture be to be execnte but it be most eligible not to paste the paper on till the whole subject be first deadcoloured the method of do this be very easy by lay the paper with the dead that side of the paper should be paste which have the stroke from the wire most evident that the painting may be on the smoothest side otherwise the line which these wire have leet in the paper will prove troublesome and look unpleasant deadcolour on its face upon fmooth board or toble when by means of brush the backside of the paper must be cover with paste the frame with the strain cloth must then be lay on the paste sidc of the paper after which turn the paint side uppermost and lay piece of clean paper upon it to prevent smear this be do it may be stroke gently over with the hand by which mean all the air between the cloth and the paper will be fore out when the paste be perfectly dry the student may proceed with the painting the advantage arife from pasting the paper æ in the frame accord to this meth after the picture be begin be very great as the crayon will adhere much better than any other way which will enable the student to finisn the picture with firmer body of colour and greater lustre the late mo . cote discover this method by accident and estecm it valuable bequisition and remember on particular occasion he remove fine crayon picture of rozalba ' and place it on another strain cloth without the least injury by soak the canva with wet sponge till some crayon picture be paint on vel lum but the animal salt in the skin very often cause thein to mildew it must be con fess the vellum give tuc picture foft effect but it be use can not be recommend in we unfavourable climate other make ule of smalt grouid le tour lately painter of note in paris often use they with great success the method to prepare they be to brusti over the paper with gum water waich directly strew with smalt moderately fine the superfluous part of which should be sweep off with painter 's brush when the gum water be perfectly dry on this the picture be to be paint but we have paper now in england to be procure of so excellent à texture as to render this preparation perhaps unniccessary till the paste between the cloth and paper be sufficiently wet to admit of separation when painter want to make very correct copy of picture they generally make use of tiffany or black gauze strain tight on frame which they lay flat on the subject to be imitate and with piece of sketch chalk trace all the outline on the tiffany they then lay the canva to be paint on flat upon the floor place the tiffany witla the chalk line upon it and with a handkerchief brush the whole over this present the exact outlinc of the picture on the canva the crayon painter may also make use of this method when the subject of he imitation be in oil but in copying crayon picture he must have recourse zo the follow method on account of the glass the picture be place upon the esel let the outline be draw on the glaf with small camel 's hair pencil dip in lake ground thin with oil which must be do with great exactness after this be becomplifh take sneet of paper of the same size and place it on the glaf stroke over all the line with the hand by which mean the colour will adhere to the paper which must be picreed with pin hole pretty close to each other the paper intend to be use for the painting must next be lay upon table and thie pierce paper place upon it then with some fine pound charcoal tie up in piece of lawn rub over the perforate stroke which will give a exact outline great care must be take not to brush this off till the whole be draw over with sketch chalk which be composition make of whiting and tobaccopipe clay roll like crayon and point at each end when the student paint immediately from the life it will be most prudent to make correct drawing of the outline on another paper the size of the picture he be go to paint which he may trace by the precede method because erroneous stroke of the sketch chalk which be not to be avoid without great expertness will prevent the crayon from adhere to the paper ow to certain greasy quality in the composition the student will find the sitting posture with the box of crayon on he lap the most convenient Ithod for he to paint thie part of the picture he be immediately painting should be rather below he sace for if it be place too high the arm will be fatigucd let the window of the room where he paint be darken at least to the height of six foot from the ground and the subject to be paint should be situate in such manner that the light may fall with every advantage on the face avoid too much shadow which seldom have good effect in portrait painting especially if the face he paint have any degree of delicacy before he begin to paint let he be attentive to he subject and appropriate the action or attitude proper to the age of the subject if child let it be childifh if young lady express more vivacity than in the majestic beauty of middle aged woman who also should not be express with the same gravity as person sar advanced in year let the embellishment of the picture and introduction of bird animal be regulate by the rule of propricty and consistency the feature of the face be carefully draw with chalk let the student take crayon of pure carmine armine and carefully draw the nostril and edge of he nose next the fhadow then with the faintest armine teint lay in the strongest light upon the nose and forehead which must be execute broad de be then to proceed gradually with the second teint and the succeed one till he arrive at the shadow which must be covcre brilliant enrich with much lake carminc little break with brilliant green this method will at first offenlively strike the eye from its crude appearance but finish it will be good soundation to produce pleasing effect colour be much more easily sully when too bright than when the sirst colour be dull to raise the picture into brilia not state the several pearly tcint discernable in ine complexion must be imitate with bluc verditer and white which answer to the ultramarine teint use in oil but if the part of thie face where these teint appear be in shadow the crayon compose of black and white must be substitute in hteir place though all the face when first coloured should be lay in as brilliant as possible yet each part hsould be keep in its proper tone by which mean the rotundity of the face will be preserve let the student be careful when he begin the eye to draw they with crayon inclined to the carmine teint of whatever colour the iris be of he must lay they in brilliant and affirst not loaded with colour but execute lightly no notice be to be take of the pupil yet the student must let the light of the eyc incline very much to the blue cast cautiously avoid stare white appearance which when once introduce be seldom overcome preserve broad shadozy throw on its upper part by the eyelash black and heavy the int be also to be avoid ed in the eyebrow it be therefore best to exccute they like broad glow shadow at first on which in the finish thc hair of the brow be to be paint by which method of proceed the former teint will shiew theyselve through and produce the most pleasing effect the student should begin the lip with pure carmine and lake and in the shadow use some carmine and black the strong vermillion teint should be lay on afterwards he must beware of execute they with stiff harsh line gently intermix each with the neighbour colour make the sha dow beneath broad and enrich with brilliant crayon he must form the corner of the mouth with carmine brown oker and green variously intermix if the hair be dark he should preserve much of the lake and deep carmine teint therein this may be easily overpower by the warmer hair teint which as obferve in painting the eyebrow will produce richer effect when thie picture be finishied on the contrary if this method be unknown or neglect poverty of colouring will be disce rnable after the student have cover over or as artist term it have deadcoloured the head he be to sweeten the whole together by rub it over with he finger begin at the strongest light upon the forehead pass he finger very lightly and uniting it with the next teint which he must continue till the whole be sweeten together often wipe he finger on towel to prevent the colour be sully he must be cautious not to smooth or sweeteien he picture too often because it will give rise to thin and scanty effect and have more the appearance obf draw than solid painting as nothing but body of rich colour can constitute rich effect to avoid this as the student find it necessary to sweeten with the finger he must conti nually replenish the picture with more crayon when the head be bring to fome degree of forwardniess let the back ground be lay in which must be treat in different manner cover it as thin asis possible and rub it into the paper withleather stump near the face the paper should be almost free from colour for this will do great service to thee head and by its thin give both soft and solid appearance in the back ground also crayon which have whiting in they composition should be use but seldom or never without caution but chiefly such as be the most brilliant and the lezast adulterate the ground be paint thin naext the hair will give the student a oppor tunity of painting the edge of the hair over in light aand free manner when he give the finish touche es the student have proceed thus far the face hair and back ground be entirely cover he must carefully vicw the whole at some distance remarkining in what respect it be out of keep that be whhat part be too light and what too dark being particularly attentive to the white or chalky appearrance which must be subdue with lake and carmine the above method be properly put into exccution will produce the appearance of paintin principally compose of three colour viz carminne black and white which be the best preparâation paration painter can make for produce finc crayon picture the next step be to compleat the back ground and the hair as the dust in painting these will fall on the face and would much injure it if that be compleate first from thence proceed to the forchead finish downward till the whole picture be compleate back grounds may be of various colour but it require great taste and judgment to suit they pro perly to different complexion in general strong coloured head should have weak and tender teinted ground and on the contrary delicate com plexion should be oppose with strong and powerful teint by which proper contrast between the figure and the back ground the picture will reccive great force and strike the spectator much more than it could possibly do be this circumstance of contrast not attend to young painter often treat the back grounds of picture as matter of very little or no consequencco when it be most certain great part of the beauty and brilliancy of the picture especially the face depend upon the teint be well suite the dark keep in they proper place and the whole be perfectly in subordination to the face thus sim ple back ground require attention but the difficulty be still greater when variety of object be introduce such as hill tree building in thesc case one rule must be strictly attend to that each grand object be dispose so as to contrast each other this be not mean merely respect thcir form but they colour they light shade for instance we will suppose the sigure reccive the strongest light behind the figure and very near at hand be the stem of some large tree these must have shade throw over they cither from diive cloud or some other interpose circumstance be hind these stem of tree and at distance be see ree on rise ground these should receive the light as contrast to the former if a bechitectural back ground be choose the same rule must be apply suppose building at moderate distance be place behind the figure receive the light column or some other object in shadow should intervene to preserve proper decorum in the piece or what will have the same effect fhadow must be throw over the lower part of the buildng which will give equal fatisfaction or repose to the eye it must be remember the light must be always place against the dark and the weak against the strong in order to produce force and effect and vice versa in painting over the forehead the last time begin the highest light with the most faint vermillion teint in the same place where the faint carmine be first lay keep it broad in the same manner in the next shade succeed the lightest the student must work in some light blue teint compose of verditer and white intermix with they some of the deeper vermillion teint swecten theni toether witli great caution insensibly melt they into one another increase the proportion of cacli colour as he judgment shall direct some brilliant yellow may also be use but sparingly and toward this direction be sor the finest complexion but tlie student must vary he colour accord to he subject ward the root of the hair strong verditer teint intermix with green will be of singular service cool crayon compose of black and white should succeed these and melt into the hair be neath the eye the pleasing pearly teint be to be preserve compose of verditer and white and under the nose and on the temple the same may be use beneath the lip teint of this kind also be proper mixing they with the light green and some vermillion the introducticn of green and bly into the face in painting have often give furprize to those who be unacquainted with the art but there be reason sufficient sor they introduction though it may appear strange at first in order to break and correct the other colour the carmine predominate in the dead colour be as have be observe the best preparation for the succeed teint the crudeness of this preparation must be correct by varioussy intermix green bly and yellow which of these be to be use be to be determine by the degree of carmine in the dead colour and the complexion intend the blue and yellow be of nature diametrically opposite and serve to correct the red and oppose one another the green be compound of both these colour be of peculiar use in many case where the transition be not to be so violent the student attentively consider nature will discover plcase varicty of colour on the surface and discernible through clear and transpa rent fkin this variety will be still increase by the effect of light and shade he will perceive one part inelining to the vermillion red another to the carmine mine or lake one to the blue this to the green and that to the yellow in order to produce these different effect he will apply those colour to which the teint be most inclined yet in crayon painting it be often best to compound the mix colour upon the picture such as blue and yellow instead of green blue and carmine instead of purple red and yellow instead of orange in other circumstance the compound already mix should be use but in this case there can be no absolute rulc give it must be leave to thie experience and discretion of the painter though the student may be greatly assist in the commencement of he study by a able master to direct and point out the best method to treat circumstance of this nature as they occur in practice which may at first appear obscure and mysterious but will soon to good capacity become demonstrably clear upon certain and sure principle tlie circumstance that require different treatment be so various and so many as to render it impossible here to descend to every particular in finish the check let the pure lake clear they from any dust contract from the other crayon then with the lake may be intermix the bright vermillion and last of all if the subject should require it few touch of the orange coloured crayon but witli extreme caution after this sweeten that part with the finger as little as possible for fear of produce heavy disagrecable effect on the cheek as the beauty of crayon picture consist in onc colour shew itself through or rather be tween another this the student can not too often bemark it be the only method of imitate beautiful complexion the artist assistant the eye be the most difficult feature to cxecute in crayon as every part must be express with the utmost nicety to appear finish at the same time that the painter must preserve its breadth and solidity while he be particularize the part to accomplish this it will be good general rule for the student to use he crayon in sweeten as much and he finger as little as possible when he want point to touch small part with he may break off à litle of he crayon against the box which will produce corner fit to work with in the minutest part if the eyelash be dark he must use some of the carmine and brown oker and the crayon of carmine and black and with these he may also touch the iris of the eye if brown or hazel making broad shadow cause by the eyelash red the int of vermillion carmine and lake will execute the corner of the eye properly but if the eyelid be too red they will have disagreeable fore appearance the pupil of the eye must be make of pure lampblack between this and the lower part of the iris the light will catch very strong but it must not be make too sudden but be gently diffuse round the pupil till it be lose in shadc when the eyeball be sufficiently prepare the shine speck must be make with pure white crayon which should be first break to point and then lay on firm but as it be possible they may be defective in neatness they should be correct with pin take off the redundant part by which mean they may be form as neat as can be require the difficulty with respect to the nose be to preserve the linc properly determine and at the same time I so artfully blend into the cheek as to exress its projection and yet no real linc to be per eptibie upon close examination in some circum ance it should be quite blend with the check which appear behind it and determined entirely with slight touch of red chalk the shadow cause the nose be generally the darkest in the whale face artake of no reflection from its ' surround part carmine and brovn oker carmine and black and such brilliant crayon will compose it best the student have before prepare the lip with the strongest lake and carmine must with these colour make they compleatly correct and when nishing introduce the strong vermillion but with great caution as they be extremely predominant this if properly touch will ' give the lip a appearance équal if not superior to those execute in oil notwithstanding the seem superiority the later have by means of glaze of which the former be entirely destitute when the student paint the neck he should avoid express the muscle too strong in the stem nor should the bone appear too evident on the chest be both have a unpleasing effect denote violent agitation of the body circumstance seldom necessary to expref in portrait painting the most necessary part to be exprass and which should ever be observe even in the most delicate subject be strong mark just above the place where the collar bone unite and if the head be much throw the method with which painter in oil express transparency in the lip be by painting they first with light vermillion teint and when dry touch they over with pure lake over the shoulder some notice should be take of the large muscle that rise from behind the ear and be insert into the pit between the collar bone all inferior muscle should be in general quite avoid the student will find this caution necessary as iost subject especially thin person have the muscle of the neck much more evident than would be judicious to imitate as few neck be too long it may be necessary to give some addi tion to the stem fault on the other side be quite unpardonable nothing be more ungraceful than fhort neck in colour the neck let the student preserve the stem of pearly hue and the light not so strong as on the chest if any part of the breast appear it 's transparency must also be express by pearly teint but the upper part of the chest should be coloured with beautiful vermillion delicately blend with the other of the material the perfection of the crayon consist in great meafure in they softnef for it be impossible to execute brilliant pictuze with they if they be otherwise on which account great care should be observe in the prepare they to prevent they be hardin all composition flake white and white lead should be wholly reject because the slightest touch with either of these will unavoidably turn black the usual objection to crayon painting be that they be subject to change but whenever this happen it it be entirely ow to a injudicious use of the above mention white which will stand only in oil to obviate the bad effect arise from the use of sucl crayon let the student make use of common whit ing prepare in the sollow manner take large vesfel of water put the whiting into it and mix they well together let this stand about half minute then pour off the top into another vessel and throw the gritty sediment away let what be prepare rest about minute and then pour it off as before which will purify the whiting and render it free from all dirt and grittiness .when this be do let the whiting settle and then pour the water from it aster which lay it on the chalk to dry and keep it for use either for white crayon or the purpose of prepare teint with other colour for with this all other teint may be fafely prepare the student must be provide with large flexible palletknife large stone and muller to levigate the colour two or three large piece of chalk to absorb the moisture from the colour after they be le vigate piece of flat glaf to prevent the moisture from be absorb too much till the colour be roll into form and vessel for water spirit as necessity and convenience shall direct do carmine aud lake it be rather difficult to procure either good carmine or good lake good carmine be inclined to the vermillion teint and should be a impalpable pow der and good lake to the carmine teint the carminc crayon be prepare in the sollow manner as they texture be inclinable to hardness instead of grind and roll they take sufficient quan tity of carmine lay it upon the grindstone mix it with levigate knife with spirit of winc till it become smooth and even yet the less friction produce by the knife the better the chalkstone be ready lay the colour upon it to absorb the spirit but be careful that it be lay on in proper shape for painting the simple colour be prepare the next step be to compose the different teint by mixture with whiting the proportion to be observe consist of twen ty gradation to one which may be clearly understood by the sollow direction take some of the simple colour and levigate it with spirit of wine add about one part of wash whiting to threc part of carmine of which when properly incorporate make two parcel the next gradation should be compose of equal quantity of carmine and whiting of which four crayon may be make the third composition should have one fourth carmine and three fourth whiting of this make six crayoa which will be good praportion with the rest the last teint should be make of whiting very faintly ting with carmine of which make about eight crayon which will compleat the abovemen tion proportion though these teint make with whiting may be roll yet the pure carmine will not bear it but must be leave on the chalkstone till perfectly dry lake be colour very apt to be hard to prevent which the student must observe the follow particular take take about half the quantity of lake intend for the crayon and grind it very fine with spirit of wing let it dry and then pulverize it which be easily do if the lake be good then take the other half and grind it with spirit after which mix it with the pulverize lake and lay it out directly in crayon on thechalk the colour will not bear roll the simple colour be thus prepare proceed with the compound crayon as direct be' fore aand in the same degree of gradation as the carmine teint vermillion or native cinnabar the best be inclined to the carmine teint to prepare this colour mix it on the stone with soft water or spirit after which it may be roll into crayon bly prussian blue be colour very apt to bind and be render soft with more difficulty than carmine and lake the same method of preparation be to be follow with this as direct with respect to lake only it be necessary to grind larger quantity of the pure colour as it be chiefly use for painting drapery blue verditer be colour naturally gritty and therefore it be necessary to washi it well its particle be so coarse as to require some bind matter to unite they otherwise the crayon will never adhere together to accomplish this take quantity sufficient to form two or three crayon to which add paece of slacked plaister of paris about the size of pea mix these well together and form the crayon upon the chalk this blue be extremely brilliant and will be of great use in heighten drapery green brilliant green be produce with great difficulty which may be procure of those who make it they businef to prepare they yet the follow composition will be find useful take yellow oker and after grind it with spirit mix it with the powder of prussian blue then temper it with knife and lay the crayon on the chalk without roll they besides this use king ' yellow mix with prussian blue brown oker and prussian blue the crayon make of these last may be roll yellow king yellow be the most useful and the most brilliant levi gated with spirit of wine and compose the different teint as before direct yellow oker and tople yellow ground with spirit will make useful crayon orange be produce with king 'yellow and vermillion ground together with spirit and the tcint form as in other case but no grcat quantity of they be require brown roman oker aud prussian blue mix in disserent proportion will be useful brown cullenearth be sine dark brown after six or eight of the simple crayon be prepare several rich compound teint may be produce from it by mixture with carmine in various degree black carminc and this colour mix together make useful teint for painting hair several gradation may be produce from each of these by mixture with whitingum ber may be treat in just the same manner only it be necessary to levigate it with spirit of wine purple prussian blue ground with spirit and mix with pulverize lake will produce good purple carmine thus mix with prussian blue will produce purple something different from the former va rious teint may be make from either of these com pound by mixture with whiting blac ampblack be the only full black that can be use with safety as all other be subject to mildew cinnabar mix with carminethis be compo sition of great use and teint make from this witli whiting will be find very serviceable carmine and black be another good compound of which five or six gradation should be make some partake more of the black and other have the carmine most predominant besides several teint by mixture with whiting cinnabar and black be also very useful compound from which several different teint should be make prussian blue and black be another good compound and will be find of singular service in painting drapery it be impossible to lay down rule sor form every the int necessary in compose set of crayon ' there by many accidental compofition entirely dependent on fancy and opinion the student shoald make it à rule to save thé leaving of he colouy for of these he may form various teint which will occasionally be useful of roll the crayon and dispose they for painting the different composition of colour must bè cût into proper magnitude after they be prepare in order to be roll into pastil for the convenience of use they each crayon should be form in the left'hand with the ball of the right first form cylindrically and then taperéd at each end if the composition be too dry dip the finger in water if too wet the composition must be llaid upon the chalk again to absorb iore lof the mbisture thé crayon 's shoultf be rolléd as quick ' as possible and when fnifh must ue ' lay upenthe chalk again to absorb afl remain moisture after the ' gradation of teint from one colour be formée the chalk and the grindstone thould be well scrape and cleanse with water before it be use for another colour when the set of crayon be compleate accord to the rule prescribe they should be arrange in class for the convenience of painting with they some thin drawer divide into number of partition be the most convenient method of dispose they properly the crayon should be deposit accord to the several gradation of light the bottom of the partition must be cover with bran as bed for the colour because it not only preferve they clcan but prevent they break ing the box make use of when the student painf should be about foot square with nine partition in the upper corner on the left hand supposing the box to be in thelap when he paint let he place the black and grey crayon those be the most seldom use in the second partition the bly in the third tlie green and brown in the fist partition on the left hand of the second row the carmine lake vermillion and all deep red the yellow and orange in the middle and the pearly teint next and as these last be of very delicate nature they must be keep very clean that the gradation of colour may be easily distinguished in the lowest roxv let the first partition contain piece of fine line rag to wipe the crayon with while they be use the second all the pure lake and vermil lion teint and the other partition may contain those teint which from they complex nature can not be elass with any of the former for enamel grounds the matter of the enamel inust be first finely levigate and searce and the body to be enamellead should be make perfectly clean the enamel must be then lay on as even as possible by brufh or pencil be first temper with oil of spikc and the distance of time betwixt the lay on the ground and burn the piece should not be too great because the oil will exhale and leave tlic matter of the enamel dry incoher powder which will be liable to be rub or shake off by the least violence this be the common method but there be much better way of manage this part of the work by means of fearce in which the enamel be spread with very little trouble and the greatest part of the oil of spike save the method of perform this be to rub the surface to be enamel over with oil of spike and then be lay on fheet of paper or piece of leather to save that part of the enamel which do not fall on pioper object to searce the matter upon the oil surface till it lie of proper thickneis but great care must be take in this method of proceeding not to shake or move too forcibly the piece of work thus cover with the powder enamelit be usual to add oil of turpentine to the oil of spike or lavender in order to make they go furthe and save the expence attend the free use of they and other add also little olive or linseed oil or some in the place of they crude turpen tine the use of the spirit of turpentine be very allowable for it be the same for this purpose as the oil of spike or lavender except that it want the glutinous quality which make they serviceable in spread the enamel but with respect to the use of the oil of olive and linseed or any other substantial oil it be very detrimental tend to reduce the metalline calxe and leave small pro portion of black coal or ash which must necessarily injure the white colour of the ground when plate as in the case of picture dialplate be to 's be enamel they should always be make convex on the outside and concave within and all piece of enamel form of metal where the figure do not admit of they be thick and solid should be of the same kind or form otherwise they will be very apt to warp in the heat and cannot be bring straight after they be take out of the fire without crack the enamel for this reason likewise it be proper to enamel the work all over as well on the wrong as right side to prevent the heat from calcine the metal which would both contribute to its warping and weaken the texture of it the enamel be lay on the body to be enamellead when tlie fixt muffle be use the piece must be gentlylist on to the false bottom and put in that state into the muffle fixt in furnace by thrusting the false bottom into it as far as it will go but be best to defer this till the fire be perfectly in order which may be know by put bit of tile or china with some enamel on it of the same tone with that use as proof and another proof of the same kind may be also put along with the work into tlie mussie which be take out may shiew how the operation proceed pitcoal may be use in the furnace where enamel be burnt with the sixt muffle or in coffin which be indeed one principal conveniency attend thre use of they as it fave considerable expence of charcoal but where the open muffle be use charcoal alone should be employ as the fuine of mi neral coal be very detrimental to some colour and destructive of the grounds if whiten by arsenic as the common white glaf the colour be prepare they must be reduce to powder by due levigation and wash over where they be require to be extremely fine and here be no unvitrified salt in the mixture they must then be temper on china or dutch tile with oil of spike or lavender to which most artist add likewise oil of turpentine and some but think erroneously as have before mention litile linsc or olive oil and in this state they be to be use as paint of any other kind but it should be avoid to mix more of the colour with the essential oil than will be immediately use because they dry away extremely fast and would not only be waste but give cohesion to the particle of the colour that would make they work less freely when again dilut with oil the colour be thus lay on the piece to be paint the proceeding must be in all respects the same as with the grounds in whatever manner they be to be burnt éither in the muffle or coffin but greater nicety must be observe with respect to the fire as the effect of any error in that point be of much greater consequence in the burn the colour than the grounds especially if the white of the grounds be sorm from the calx of tin or antimony and not arsenic pitcoal as be above observe may be employ for burn as well the colour as the grounds where the muffle or coffin be use or any other method pursue that wholly hinder the smoke and fume from have any access to the enamel enamel painting of enamel painting differ from all other kind in the vehicle employ for the colour to hold the part together and bind they to the ground they be lay upon this be glaf or some vitreous body which be mix with the colour and fuse or melt by means of heat become fluid and hav ing incorporate with the colour in that state form together with they hard maf when grow cold it answer therefore the same end in this as oil gumwater size or varnish in the other kind of painting the glass or vitreous body apply to this purpose of mixing with the colour in order to bind they to the grounds be call flux and make one of the principal substance use in enamel painting when this flux be easily fusible that be to say melt with less degree of heat it be in the stile of those who work in enamel say to be soft and when it be reluctant to melt and require greater degree of heat it be call hard thefe term be as well apply to the matter of the enamel grounds and all other vitreous sub stance concerned as to the flux it be in general perfection perfection of the flux to be soft or run easily into fusion but the great point with respect to this par ticular be that when seve ral mixture of colour and flux be use at the fame time they should all cor respond to each other in the degree of this quality ocherwise some would be render too fluid and perhaps run the matter of the enamel ground into fusion and mix with it while other remain solid and insufficiently fuse themselves it be always necessary likewise that the enamel of the ground should be considerably harder than the mixture for the colour for if they both melt with the same degree of heat they will neceffarily run together it be requisite that the body paint in enamel should undergo heat sufficient to melt soft glaf the matter of such body can only be gold silver copper porcelean or chinaware hard glass and earthenware and where the metal be use if the painting be of the nature of picture or demand variety of colour it be necessary that ground of white or some other colour should be lay on the metal the body of which ground must necessarily be of the same vitreous nature as the flux but harder as nothing else can endure so grcat hoat that be capable of in corporate with and bind the matter of the white or other colour to the surface of the metal the ground therefore make another principal sub stance use in en amel painting the third substance be the colour which must likewise be body capable of suffer the heat of melt glass and such as will either itself be convert into glaf or kindly incorporate with it in melt statc this of course confines the matter of such colour to metal earthis or other mineral body all vegetable and animal substance be calcine and analize with less degree of heat than the lowest sufficient to work enamel the fourth kind of substance be what shall call the secondary vehicle which be some fluid body for lay on the ground and work with the pencil the flux and colour when mixt together since as they form only dry powder they could not be use as paint without some such medium but as this be to serve only for spread and lay on the matter of the enamel and not like other vehicle to assist in hold the colour together and bind they to the ground that be in this kind of painting the office of the flux it be necessary that it should be some such substance as will evaporate and dry away without leave any part behind as it would otherwise be heterogeneous matter with regard to the enamel and consequently injurious to it essential oil have be therefore use for this purpose as they have the quality of wholly drying away on the first approach of heat together with slight unc tuosity which render they capable of make the matter of the enamel work properly with the pencil the preparation of these several substance have be in great measure monopolize by the ventians except what be prepare at dresden since the establishment of the china manufactory the few other who have have any knowledge of this matter have practise the prepare only some kind and even at present there be perhaps none in this country who make more than small part of the va riety necessary for though many possess the knowledge of some particular article yet they be ignorant with regard to other which be again perhaps know to those who be ignorant of thefe as there have be hitherto no means afford to the practiser of it of learn the particular of this art in system and deeper knowledge of the principle and practice of chemistry be requisite to the attain it with out be teach than could well fall to the share of painter or other artist shall therefore be mope minute in my instruction for the make the several kind of the grounds slux and colour in order that they who be concerned in or may be desiron to apply themselves to the art of painting in enamel which be now become the basis of considerable manufacture in this countiy may furnisn themselves with whatever be necessary in its greatest perfection besides the knowledge of the preparation of the above substance and of that part of the art of use they which belong to painter in general there be another requisitc this be the burn as it be call the grounds in order to form they on the body to be paint or enamel as also the colour with the flux after they be lay on the grounds what be mean by burn be the give such heat to the matter when lay on the body to be paint as will fuse or melt it and consequently give to the flux or vitreous part of the composition the proper quality of vehicle for bind the colour to the ground and hold the part together as this require particular apparatus shall en deavour to shew the method of construct it in the most expeditious and easy manner and give such caution for the conduct of the operation both for burn the grounds and painting as may best teach those who be lef experience in it to attain to perfection in this art it can not be expect nevertheless consider the niccty of the subject such direction can be give as will insure success in the first trial with regard to several of the process or even the general operation but whoever will make themselves master of the principle on which they depend which arc all along intimate will easily be able to correct they own error judgment form by some little experience be likewise requisite for the prepare well the colour with certainty for as disserent parcel of the same substance vary frequently in they quality with regard to the degree or proportion it be necessary to make allowance accordingly in the proportion of the quantity in the mixture this can not be do till some little previous trial be make and the power of judge of they be gain by a experimental acquaintancc with they but as the material in ge neral be very cheap and the experiment may be make in the same fire where actual business be donc whoever would excel in the art of prepare and use enamel should take considerable scope of experimental enquiry into the effect of all the various proportion and commixture of the substance use of the substance use for form flux minum or red lead be use as à flux body for form the enamel for grounds as also in coin pound flux for the colour it require no preparation for these purpose only it be proper it should be pure which may be know by the Ithod before give page this flux render the enamel soft but produce some proportion of yellow colour be not fit for all use fixt alkaline salt of vegetable be sometime use also in form the mixture for enamel grounds as likewise likewise in some composition of flux for the colour it make less soft enamel than the lead but be free from yellow or any other colour and therefore proper for some purposc borax be falt of very peculiar quality amongst which be that of promote vitrification and the fusion of any glaf when vitrify in greater degree than any other substance know on which account it be of the greatest consequence in form flux for enamel it require neverthelefs either to be previously calcine or bring to vitreous state which it suffer srom the application of moderate heat alone and it must also be finely powder before it be mix with other ingredient in slux it be use be not much know in common practice through of the greatest consequence to the art of enamel as not only set of softer colour may be produce by the aid of it than can be otherwise have but the degree of cach may be bring to correspond by the employ it in different pro portion accord to the respective hardnef of the other ingredient which differ so mucl as not to be regulate justly by any other means common salt may be also use as slux in enamell particularly where there be occafion for glazing as it be not only extremely fluid and free of tenacity when use but also less subject to crack than any other vitreous body whatever but for flux for grounds and colour in enamel it be not frequently necessary to multiply ingredient as the above three substance may when properly apply sufficiently answer most purpose the same reasoning extend to nitre and arsenic which though they have the quality of flux possess yet along with they they such other with respect to they effect on several of the substance that compose the calour as render the method of use they difficult and comple of the substance use for form the body of enamel cor flux white sand be use as body for the flux and grounds ofenamel it should be reduce previously to a impalpable powder in order that it may be mix more intimately with the other ingredient which not only accelerate the vitrification but render the glaf much more perfect the kind of sand proper for this purpose be that bring from lynn in norsolk and call by the name of that place flint be use for the same purpose as the white sand and it be proper to use they when that can not be procure of the right kind they require to be calcine before they be apply to any purpose of vitrification this be to be do by put they into any fire and continue they there till the whole substance become white when they must be take out and while in they full heat im merse in cold water and keep there for some time by such treatment they will be render of very brittle and calcarious texture and very easy to be powder which must be do to perfect degree for the reason above give where small quantity of the matter of any kind of enamel be to be prepared calcine flint be preferable to fand as they be much more eafily reduce to a impalpablé powder and the troublé of the previous calcination be very little there be fort of store which the french call milon that form the upper crust and lie round the freestone in most quarry this stone will lofeits tenacity in moderate fire and when calcine run much sooner into vitrification than either flint or sand it be ' therefore when it can bé obtain à better matter for the body of flux or soft enamel ihan either of tlie other it will with the ' same proportion of the slux ing ingredient make much softer flux or it otherwise admit of the diminntion of the proportion of some of they vhich for inany experimental reason be in certain ' cale a advantage of the substance use for produce wbite coloar in enamel for form the grounds putty or calein tin be use as body of colour for the enamél grounds as tin be very troublesome in calcination require fong continuance of sire and to be spread into à very thin surface it be mucl the best way to procure it for the purpose of enamelling ready calcine of those who make it they broper businef to calcine it for the use of lapidarie and other artist who use it for they have large furnace fitly construct for perform that operation in large quantity and can consequently afford it much cheaper than it can be prepare in small quantity besides the sparing the trouble tt must be demand of they by the name of putty and care must be take thatit be not sophisticated which it seldom fail to be before it come out of they hand for common purpose the sophistication which be generally by chalk lime or some such white carth may be thus distinguished pat the putty into crucible with some tallow or other rgease and give it the heat of fusion or what be sufficient to melt it supply the greafe in freshi quantity as it burn away till the calein tin appear to have regain its metallic state suffer then the remainder of the grease to burn away and the chalk or earth if any be mix with it will be find swim on the furface of the metal to which however the afh of the grease must he suppofe to have add some little quantitythere another body with which the putty or calx of tin may beaadulterate that will not disco ver itself by this method of reduction of the tinit be white lead which in this manner of treatment would run into fusion and mix with the ' tin and could therefore not be distinguished from it but it may be easily render perceptible by another man ner of proceeding which be to take the putty sufpect to be adulterate with it and have put it into crucible without any admixture and inverted another crucible over it as cover to give it moderate heat carefully avoid thât the smoke or coal of the fire may have any access to it to change it be colour if there be any white lead mix with the putty it will shew itself when remove from ghe fire and become cold in yellow or brown colour if no such colour supervene but the putty appear equally white as before it be heat con clufion may be safely make that it be not adulterate by white lead or that if fophisticated at all it must be by some white earth which may be make percéptible by the reduction of tin in the manner before mention uitramarine ultramarine the preparation of which we have before give be use in enamel where very bright bly of lighter teint be want and sometimes indeed in other case by those who do not understand the right use of zaffer and smalt but there be sew instance where zaffer when perfectly good alux with borax and little calcine flint or havenetian glaf to take off the fusible quality of the borax will not equally well answer with the best ultramarine the ultramarine require no preparation when ufe in enamel painting previously to its be mixtwith the proper flux and what relate to its general quality and the means of distinguishing its goodness or genuinenefs we have along with its preparation before teach and the follow uitramarine afhy be ufe where light semitransparent bly be want but they be so frequently adulterate with precipitation of copper which of course turn green on flux that it be very necessary to be cautious in the use of any parcél not previ ously try zaffer be use for produce blue green purple and blackcolour in enamel it be a earth obtained by calcine kind of stone call cobalt and when it be mix with any kind of vitreous body it vitrify at the same time assume strong blue colour but for the most part verge to the purple it be to be have in state proper for use of those colourmen who make it ' they particular businef to supply the glassmaker with colour the goodness of zaffer can fcarcely be know but by a actual trial of it and compare the effect of it wiih that of some other know to be good and use in the same proportion magnesia be a earth which when sluxed with any vitreous body produce break crimson or oul rose colour it be ' ' to be have prepare fit for ise except more perfect levigation srom those who sell colour to tlie glafmaker it be uscful not only for some purpose as red but for the several composition for black purple and some brownthe goodness of the magnesia must be determine the same means as that of zaffer smalt be as before mention zaffer vitrify with proper addition which be generally fixt aikaline salt and sand or calcine flint whicl be sometime use as blue in enamel but be hard it require for such purpose to be use with flux which increase the body of glass in too great for the tinge be apt to dilute the colour too much where great force be want therefore the use of the zaffer itself be in most cafe prefcrable there have nevertheless be as be above observe some parcel of smalt or vitrify calx of cobalt bring from saxony which be of a extreme strong body of colour and will bear any proportion of slux necessary to render they as foft as my be require without weaken the colour too much for any purpose common smalt however ground very ine and mixt with fourth part of its weight of borax which be much the most powerful and kindly flux for zaffer will run pretty well and may be use where either full colour be not demand or where the work will admit of the colour be lay on thick the goodness of smalt may be judge of by its bright and deep colour and the less it in cline to the purple the better in order to judge of the strength of the colour the smalt should be reduce to sine powder for in grosser state every degree of fineness render it so disferent that judgment can not be easily form of it smalt be to he have of all colourman and be not subject to any adul teration which would not be obvious on inspection gold be use in enamel to produce crimson be ruby colour which by the mistaken sense of the latin word purpureus have be call purple by all the english and french writer it must be previ ousty reduce to the state of precipitate powder by dissolve in aqua regia and make precipi tation by means of tin fixt alkaline salt or some other metaflic or alkaline body silver be use for produce yellow colour in en amel it must be previoufly reduce to the state of powder which may be do either by precipitation from spirit of nitre or by calcination with sulphur the precipitation of silver from spirit of nitre may be perform by dissolve a ounce of silver in two or three ounce of spirit of nitre and precipitate and edulcarate it copper be use in enamel painting for the forming green blue and red colour but it must be previously either calcine or reduce to the state of powder by precipitation iron be use to produce on orange red or foul scarlet colour in enamel as also transparent yellow and to asfist likewise in the formation of green and other compound colour it be prepare many way both by corrosion and precipitation some of which indeed make real difference but most of they lead to the same end antimony be use for produce yellow colour in enamel as well as the white before mention and indeed it be the most useful and most use of any substance whatever for that purpose it be preared only by levigation to which it be texture notwithstand its be semimetal very well fuit glass of antimony be also use sometimes in enamel painting be itself fine transparent orange colour but as it want body it have no great effect out in composition orpiment have be also use in enamel for producing yellow colour but it be very tender with egard to the fire and require so foft flux while at the same time antimony properly manage will to well supply the place of it that it be rarely usepowder brick have be also use for comounding yellow colour in enamel but as they act only in consequence of the oker they contain they be certainly inferior to the prepare oker we have give the most active flux amongst salt be borax which indeed possess this power in the greatest degree he therto know of any simple whatever the next be dead which vitrify with very moderate degree of heat and asfimilate to glass with itself not only many kind of earth but all metal and semimetal except gold and silver in they entire state arsenic os the next powerful flux only it require to be fix by conjoin it with some other body already vitrify otherwise it sublime and fly away before it arrive at the vitrefactive heat the several kind of salt liave the next degree of slux power and among they sea salt possess the greatest but they be not sufficiently strong themselves to form a enamel flux soft enough to be use in painting though as they be colourless which be not the case of vitrify lead they be very necessary to be compound with lead or use in its place assist by borax where absence of every degree of colour be necessary in the flux painting apon glass the antient manner of painting upon glass be very simple and consequently very easy it consist in the mere arrangement of piece of glass of different colour in some fort of symmetry and constitute what be now call mosaie work in process of time they come to attempt more regular design and also to reprefent figure heighten with all they shade yet they proceed no farther than the contour of the figure in black with watercolour and hatch the drapery after the same manner on glass of the colour of the object they design to paint for the carnation they use glass ef bright red colour and upon this they draw the principal lineament of the sace with black but in time the taste for this fort of painting improve considerably and the art be find appli cable to the adorning of church they find out means of incorporate the colour in the glaf itself by heating they in the fire to proper degree have first lay on the colour the colour use in painting or stain of glaf be very different from those use in painting either in water or oil colour forblack take scale of

silver one part antimony half part put all into crucible and calcine they well those beautiful work which be make in the glafhoufe be of two kind in some the colour be diffuse through the wholc substance of the glass in other which be the more common the colour be only on one side scarce penetrate within the substance above one third of line though this be more or less accord to the nature of the colour the yellow be always find to enter the deepest these last though not so strong and beautiful as the former be of more advantage to the workman by reason that on the fame glass though already coloured they could shew other kind of colour where there be occasion to embroider drapery enrich they with soliage or reprefent other ornament of gold silver in order to this they make use of emery grind to wear down the surface of the glaf till such time as they be get through the colour to the clear glass this do they apply the proper colour on the other side of the glaf by this means the new colour be hinder from run and mix ing with the former when they expose the glass to the fire when indeed the ornament be to appear white the glaf be only bare of its colour with emery without ting the place with any colour at all and this be the manner by which they wring they light and heightenings on all kind of colour the first thing to be do in order to paint or stain glass in the modern way be to design and even colour the whole subject on paper then they chuse such piece of glaf as be clear even and smooth and proper to receive the several part and procecd to do tribute the design itself or papers it be draw on into piece suitable to those of the glaf always tak ing care that the glasfes may join in the contour of the figure and the fold of the drapery that the carnation and other finer part may not be impair by the lead with which the piece arc to be join together the distribution be make they mark wiii the glass as well as papers that they may be know again which donc apply every part of the design upon the glaf intend for it they copy we transser the design upon this glaf with the black colour dilut in gum water by trace and following all the line and stroke as they appear through the glaf with the point of pencil when these stroke be well dry which will happen in about two day the work be only in black and white they give slight wasn over with urine gum arabic and little black and repeat it several time accord as the shade be desire to be heighten with this precaution never to apply new wash till the former be sufficiently dry this do the light and risings be give by ubb off the colour in the respective place with wooden point or the handle of pencil as to the other colour abovemention they be use with gum water much as in painting in mi niature take care to apply they lightly sor fear of efface the outline of the design or even for the greater security to apply they on the other ide especially yellow which be very pernicous to the other colour by blend therewith and here too as in piece of black and white particube regard must always be have not to lay colour on colour or lay on new lay till such time as the former be well dry it may be add that the yellow be the only cowe that penetrate through the glaf and incorpo rate therewith by the fire the rest and particularly the blue which be very difficult to use remain on the surface or at lcast enter very lighttie when the painting of all the piece be finish they be carry to the lurnâce or oven to anneal or bake the colour the furnace here use be small build of brick from eighteen to thirty inch square at six inch from the bottom be a ' aperture to put in the fuel and maintain the fire over this aperture be grate make of thrcesquare bar of iron which traverse the furnace and divide it into two part two inch above this partition be another little aper ture through which they take out piece to examine how the coction go forward on the grate be place à square carthen pan six or seven inch deep and five or six inehe less every way than the perimeter or the furnace on the one side hereof be little aperture through which to make trial placcd directly opposite to that of the furnace destine for the same end in this pan be the piece of glaf to be place in the sollow manner first the bottom of the pan be cover with three strata or layer of quick lime pulverize those strata be separate by two other of old brokenaglafs the design whereof be to secure the paint glass from the too intense heat of the fire this do the glasf be lay horizontally on the last or upper moft layer of lime the first row of glaf they cover over witli layer of the same powder a inch deep and over this they lay another range of glass and thus alternately till the pan be quite full take care that the whole heap always end with laver of the lime powder the pan be thus prepare they cover up the furnace with tile on square table of earthenware closely lute all round only leave five little aper ure one at cach corner and another in tlie min dle to serve as chimny thing thus dispose there remain nothing but to give the fire to the work the fire for the first two hour must be very moderate and iust be increase in proportion as the coction advance for the space of ten or twelve hour in which time it be usually compleate at last the fire which at first be charcoal be to be of dry wood so that the flame cover the whole pan and even issuc out at the chimney during the last hour they make essays from time to time by take out piece lay for the pur purpose through the little aperture of the furnace and pan to see whether the yellow be perfect and the other colour in good order when the an neal be think sufficient they proceed with great haste to extinguish the fire which otherwise would soon burn the colour and break the glaffe of japanning by japanning be to be here understand the art of cover body by grounds of opake colour in varnish which may be either afterwards decorate by painting or gild or leave in plain state thisbe not at present practise so frequently on chair table and other furniture of house except tea waiter as formerly but the introduction of it for ornament coach snuffbox and skreen in which there be à rivalship betwixt ourselves and the french render the cultivation and propagation of this art of great importance to commerce shall therefore be more explicit in shew the Ithods both now and formerly in use with the application of each to the several purpose to which they be best adapt and point out at the fame tiine several very material improvement that be at prefent enjoy only by particular person or not at all hitherto bring into practice the substance which admit of be japanned be almost every kind that be dry and rigid and not too flexible as wood metal leather and paper prepared wood and metal do not requirè any ofher preparation but to have they surface perfcctly éven and clean but leather should bé fecurely strained either on frame or on board as its bend ing or form fold would ' otherwise crack and force off the coat of varnish paper also shoulû be treat in the same manner and ' have previous strong coat of some kind of size but it be rarely make the subject of japanning till it be converted in to papier mache or wring by other means into such form that its original state particularly with respect to flexibility be lose one principal variation in the manner of japan ning be the use or omit any priming or under coat on the work to be japanned in the older practice such priming be always use and be at presend retain in the french manner of japanning coach and snuff box of the papier mache but in tlie birmingham manufacture it have be always reject the advantage of use such priming or under coat be that it make à save in the quantity of varnisn use because the matter of which the priming be compose fill up the inequality of the body to be varnish and make it easy by means of rub and waterpolish to gain a even surface for the varnishi this be therefore such conveni ence in the case of wood as the give hardnef and firmness to the ground be also in the case of leather that it become a establish method and be therefore retain even in the instance of the papier mache by the french who apply the recejve method of japanning to that kind of work on its introduction there be neverthelefs this in convenience always attend the use of a under coat of size that the japan coat of varnish and colour will he constantly liable to be crack and peel off by any violence and will not endure near so long as the body japanned in the same manner but without any such priming this may be easily observe in compare the wear of the paris and birmingham snuffbox which latter when good of they kind never peel or crack or suffer any damage unlefs by great violence and such continue rub as waste away the substance of the varnisn while the japan coat of the parisian box crack and fly off in flake whenever any knock or fall particularly near the edge expose they to be injure but the birmingham manufacturer who originally practise the japanning only on metal to which the reason above give for the use of priming do not extend and who take up this art of themselves as a invention of course omit at first the use of any sach under coat and not find it more necessary in the instance of papier mache than on metal continue still to reject it on which account the box of they manufacture be with regard to the wear much better than the french the lay on the colour with varnish instead of gum water be also another variation from the Ithod of japanning formerly practise but the much greater strength of the work where they be lay on in varnisn or oil have occasion this way to be explode with the greatest reason in all regular manufacture however they who may practise ja pan on cabinet or other such piece as be not expose to much wear or violence for they amusement only and consequently may not find ' it wortli they while to encumber themselves with the prepa ration necessary for the other method may paint with water colour on a under coat lay on the wood or other substance of which the piece to be japanned be form and then finisn with the proper coat of varnish accord to the method below teach if the colour be temper with the strongest isinglass size and honey instead of gum water and lay on very flat and even the work will not be much infcrior in appearance to that do by the other Ithod and will last as long as the common old japan work except the best kind of the true japan it be practise likewise in imitation of what be sometimes do in the indian work to paint witl water colour on grounds of gold in which case the isinglaf size with sugarcandy or honey as above direct be the best vehicle imitation be also make of japan work by colouring print glue they to wood work and then giv ing they ffifr appearance by the use of some white varnisn of japan grounds . the proper japan grounds be either such as be form by the varnish and colour where the whole be to remain of one simple colour or by the varnish either coloured or without colour on which some painting or other decoration be afterwards to be lay it be necessary howe ver before proceed to speak of the particular grounds to shew the mannerof lay on the priming or under coat where any such be use this priming be of the same nature with that call clear coating or vulgarly clear coal prac tise erroneously by the housepainter and consist only in lay on and drying in the most even manner composition of size and whiting the com mon size have be generally use for this purppse but where the work be of nicer kind it be bêtter of employ the glover or the parchment size and if third of isinglass be add it will be still better and if not lay on too thick much less liable to peel and crack the work should be prepare for this priming by be well smoothed with the fishskin or glassshaver and be make thoroughly clean should be brush over once or twice with hot size dilut with two third of water if it be of the common strength the priming should then be lay on with brush as even as possible and should be form of size whose consistence be betwixt the common kind and glue mixt with as much whiting as will give it à sufficient body of colour to hide the surface of whatever it be lay upon but not more if the surface be very even on wlich the priming use two coat of it lay on in this manner will be sufficient but if on trial with fine wet rag it will not receivé proper water polish on accouht of ary inequalitias not sufficiently fill up and canver two or more coat must be give it and whether grèâter or less number be mse thé work fhould be mooth after the last coât but one be ' dry by rub it with dutch rush when the last coat be dry the water polifhi should be give by pass over every part of it with sine rag gently moisten till the whole appear perfectly plain and even the prifhiing will then be compleate and the work ready to receive the painting or colour vamilh the rest of the proceedings be the same in this case as where no priming be ise of common grounds of varnish which be to be paint uponwhere wood ôr téather be to be ja pan and nofprime be use the best preparation be to lay two or three coat of coarse varnish combose in the fbllow manner take of rectifiéd spirit of wine one pint and of coarse seedlac and resineach two ounce dissolve the seedlac and resin in the spirit and then strain off the varnish this varnish ' as well as all ' other form ' of spirit of wine must be lay on in warm place and ifit can be conveniently manage the piece of work to be varnishied should be make warm likewise and for the same reason all dampness should be ' avoid for either cold or moisture chill this kind of varnish and prevent its take proper hold of the substanée on which it be lay when the work be so prepare or by the priming with the composition of size and whiting above describe the proper japan ground miist be lay on which be much the best form of shelllac varnish and and the colour desire if white be not in question which demand à péculiar treatment as fhail below explain or great brightnef be not require when also other means must bé pursue the colour use with the shelllac varnish maybe any pigment whatever which give the teint of the ground desire and they may be mixt together to form brown or any compound colour but with respect to such as require peculiar method for the produce they of the first degree of brightnef shall particularize they below the colour for grounds may otherwise be mix with the white varnisn form in oil of turpentinc bût these varnish haye no advantage over thé shelltac but in they whiteness which preferve thé brightness of the colour and they be at the samé time greatly inferior in hardnef to it as metal never require to be under coate with whiting they may be treat in the same manner as wood or leather when the under coat be omit except in the instance particularly speak of below of white japan grounds . the form ground perfectly white and of the first degree of hardnef remain hitherto desideratum or matter seek for in the art of japanning as there be no substance which can be dissolve so as to form very hard varnish but what have too much colour not to deprave the whiteness when lay ' on ofa due thicknef over the work except some very late discovery not hitherto bring into practice the nearest approach however to perfect white varnish by means already know to the public be make by the follow composition take slake white or white lead wafh over and ground up with sixth of its weight of starch and tlien dry and temperit properly for spread ing with mastic varnissi or compound they with gum animi lay these on the body to be japan ned prepare either with or without the under coat of whiting in the manner as above order and then varnish over it with five or six coat of the fol low varnish provide any quantity of the best seedlac and pick out ofit all the clearest and whitest grain reserve the more coloured and fouler part for the coarser varnisn such as that abovemention for priming or prepare wood or leather take of this pick seedlac two ounce and of gum animi three ounce and dissolve they be previously reduce to à grof powder in about quart of spirit of wine and strain off the clear varnisn the seedlac will yet give slight tinge to this com position but can not be omit where the varnish be want to be hard though where softer will aswer the end the proportion may be diminish and little crude turpentine add to the gum animi to take off the brittleness very good varnish free entirely from all britileness may be form by dissolve as much gum animi as the oil will take in old nut or poppy oil which must be make to boil gently when the gum be put into it the ground of white colour itself may be lay on in this varnisn and then coat or two of it may be put over the ground but it must be well dilut with oil of turpentine when it be use this though free from brittlenef be neverthelefs liable to susser by be indent or bruise by any slight stroke and it will not well bear any polish but may be bring to very smooth surface without if it be judicioussy manage in the lay ing it on it be likewise somewhat tedious in drying and will require some timc where several coat be lay on as the last ought not to contain much oil of turpentine it must be observe likewise that the gum resin such as the animi copal can never be difsolve in substantial oil by the medium of heat without considerable change in the colour of the oil by the degree of heat necessary to produce the solution method of dissolve gum copal in oil of turpentine be however now discover by gen tleman of great ability in chemistry and he have also obtain method of dissolve amber in the same menstruum so that we may hope soon to sce the art of japanning carry to consummate degree of perfection when the public be put in possession of these most important invention or the fruit of they of blue japan grounds . blue japan grounds may be form of bright prussian blue or of verditer glaze over by prussian blue or of smalt the colour may be best mix with shelllac varnish and bring to polish state by five or six coat of varnisn of seedlac but the varnish neverthelefs will somewhat injure the colour by give to true blue cast of green and foul in some de gree warm blue by the yellow it contain wherc therefore bright blue be require and less degree of hardness can be dispense with the method before direct in the case of white grounds must be pursue of red japan grounds for scarlet japan ground vermillion may be use but the vermillion alone have glaring effect that render it much less beauful than the crimson produce by glaze it over with carmine or sine lake or even with rose pink which have very good effect use for this purposc for very bright crimson nevertheless instead of glaze with carmine the indian lake know in shop by the name of safflower should be use dosolve in the spirit of which the varnisn be com pound which it readily admit of when good but in this case instead of glaze with the shell lac varnish the upper or polish coat need only be use as they will equally receive and convey the tinge of the indian lake which may be actually dissolve by spirit of wine and this will be find much cheaper method than use carmine if notwithstand the highest degree of brightness be require the white vamnish must be use it be at prefent however very difficult to obtain this kind of lake for it do not appear that more than one considerable quantity be ever bring over and put into the hand of colourman and this be now expend they have not the means of fressi supply it however may be easily have from the same place whence the former quantity be procure by any person who go thither in the east india company ' ship of yellow japan grounds . for bright yellow grounds king ' yellow or turpeth mineral should be employ either alone or mix with fine dutch pink the effect may be still more heighte ned by dissolve powder turmeric root in the spirit of wine of which the upper or polish coat be make which spirit of wine must be strain from off the regs before the seedlac be add to it to form the varnisn the seedlac varnish be not equally injurious here and with green as in the case of other colour be cause be only ting with reddisn yellow it be lighttle more than a addition to the force of the colour yellow grounds may be likewise form of the dutch pink only which when good will not be want in brightnel tholigh extremely cheapof green japan groundsgreen grounds may be produce by mixing king ' yellow and bright prussian blue or ractrer turpeth mineral and prussian blue cheap but souler kind may be have from verdirise with litile of the abovemention yellow or dutch pink but where very bright green be want the chrystal of verdigrise call distilled verdigrise should be employ and to heighten the effect they should be lay on ground of leaf old which render the colour extremely brilliant and pleasing they may any of they be use successfully with good seedlac varnish for the reason before give out will be still brighter with the white vamnisn of orangecoloured japan grounds .orangeco lour japan grounds may be form by mixing vermillion or red lcad with king ' yellow or dutch pink or red orpiment will make brighter orange ground than can be produce by any mixture of purple japan grounds . —purple japan grounds may be produce by the mixture of lake and prussian blue or fouler kind by vermillion and prussian blue they may be treat as the xest with respect the varnish of black japan grounds to be produce without heat d black grounds may be form by either ivory black or lamp black but the former be preferablé where it be perfectly good these may be always lay on with the shelllac varnisn and have they upper or polish coat of common seeclac varnish as the tinge or foulness of the varnish can be here no injury of common black japan grounds on iron or copper produce by means of heatfor form the common black japan grounds by means of heat the piece of work to be japanned must be paint over with drying oil and when it be of moderate dryness must be put into à stove of such degree of heat as will change the oil black without burn it so as to destroy or weaken it 's tenacity the stove should not be too hot when the work be put into it nor the heat increase too fast either of which er ror would make it blister but the slower the heat be augment and the longer it be continue pro vide it be restrain within the due degrce the harder will be the coat of japan this kind of varnisn require no polisn have receive when pro perly manage sufficient one from the heat of the fine tortoise shell japan ground produce by means of heatthe best kind of tortoise shell ground produce by heat be not less valuable for its great hardnef and endure to be make hotter than boiling water without damage than for its beautiful appearance it be to be make by means of varnisn prepare in the follow manner take of good linseed oil one gallon and of um bre half pound boil they together till the ee oil become very brown and thick strain it then through coarse cloth and set it again to boil in which state it must be continue till it acquire pitchy consistence when it will be fit for usehave prepare thus the varnisn clean well the iron or copper plate or rather piece which be to be japanned and then lay vermillion temper with shelllac varnish or with drying oil dilut with oil of turpentine very thinly on the place intended to imitate ' the more transparent part of the tortoise shell when the vermillion be dry brush over the whole with the black varnish temper to due consistence with oil of turpentine and when it be set and firm put the work into stove where it may undergo very strong heat and it must be continue considcrable time if even three week or à month it will be the better this be give among other recipe by kunckel but appear to have be neglect till it be revive with great success in the birmingham manu facture whère it be not only the ground of snuffbox dressbox and other such like lesser piece but of those beautiful teawaiter which have be so justly esteem and admire in several part of europe where they have be send this ground may be décorate with painting and gild in the same manner as any other varnish surface which have best be do after the ground have be duly harden by the hiot stove but it be well to give second annealing with more gentle heat after it be sinish of painting japan work japan work ought pro perly to be paint with colour in varnish but in order for the greater dispatch and in somc very nice work in sinall for the freer use of the pencil the colour be now most frequently temnper in oil which should previoussy have sourth part of its weight of gum animi dissolve in it or in default of that of tlie gum sanderac or mastie as have likewise before intimate when the oil be thus use it should be well dilut with spirit of turpentine that the colour may be lay more evanly and thin by which mean sewer of the polifhiing or upper coat of varnish become necessary in some instance water colour as before inentioncd be lay on grounds oft gold in tlie manner of other painting and be best when so use in they proper appcarance without any vafnisn over they they be also sometimes so manage as to have the effect of emboss work the colour employ in this way sor painting be as before intimate best prepare by means of isinglaf size correct with honey or sugarcandy the body on which the emboss work be raise need not however be ting with the exterior colour but may be best form of very strong gum water thickened to proper consistence by bole armoniac and whiting in equal part which be lay on in the proper figure
