dittance you have mind to place it as at and by rule the pa rallel it and mn and from each of thefe they respective perpendicular gb and which perpendicular will thew the height of the figure at and to draw direct view see fig xiv to illuftrate this example fuppofe you be to draw the infide of church as reprefent in this figure firtt take you flation at the point in the centre of the bafe line from which you have front view of the whole body of the church with all the pillar coc on each fide then fix you horizon at any height you think proper as at de bifect it by the perpendicular and
