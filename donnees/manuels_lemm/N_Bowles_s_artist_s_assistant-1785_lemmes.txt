the same number rule parallel line acrol from point to point to will you pavement be divide into quare foot becaule the eight foot in length multiply by the come in breadth give the number of quare foot or piece of marble contain in the whole then rule diagonal from corner to corner and thus will you groundplot appear as in fig now to lay this in perspective draw another fquare to you intend

the same rule exemplify in object below the berizm see fig kill if you would know the height of number of figure below the horizon rule you horizontal fine or fix you puint of light as at then place you neareit figure or mark the dot for the head and foot by the point and which afiver the same purpofe and rule from thefe dot to the point of fight the line pand ep and if you would find the height

dittance you have mind to place it as at and by rule the pa rallel it and mn and from each of thefe they respective perpendicular gb and which perpendicular will thew the height of the figure at and to draw direct view see fig xiv to illuftrate this example fuppofe you be to draw the infide of church as reprefent in this figure firtt take you flation at the point in the centre of the bafe line from which you have front view of the whole body of the church with all the pillar coc on each fide then fix you horizon at any height you think proper as at de bifect it by the perpendicular and where thefe two line interfect be the point of fight this perpendicular will pass through the centre of all the arch in the dome or cupola which center may be find by any three give point as in frg
