gracefully in the language of protel tant country to guard against any offence whic skilful painter might be lead to take the publication of this little assemblag of instruction it be declar that it will not intend for they but for the tyro only and novice in the art and suc as can not easily be provide with manter to qualify they for this charmin employment and it be certain the be thousand of person in great bri tian as well as in other nation wha have greater passion for this be than they have opportunity to cultivat it the country afford but few pain ter whose instruction be of any van lue and good piece of this kind art very rare among we while great num ber of both sex of fortune and lei sure who with genius for painting be devote to countrylife languist away many heavy hour for

treatise conceal ' he name but insinuate ugh in he preface to let we know he man of fortune who paint ly for the entertainment ofhis friend ' he private diversion this manto shew the reader that hé need be apprehensive of that falshood and serve we too often meet with in book this subject write by professd painhedrew up he papers of which follow be translation for the struction of some person of quality at listance from he who succeed so pily in they pursuit of this art by the elp of they only that on they instanhe resolv to make they publick ping that every one with the least enius for the art of painting would would he method as plain and intelligible reap as mnch benefit from he inuction as he pupil of quality since have begin at the very element or of mintature and omit not the ne least matter or circumstance thai requisite to full and perfect elucidati of the art isnall only add that the french charm ' with the work as soon as be publisn ' and make such dema for it that it quickly run through veral edition and spread amo they neighbour on the continent be translate with great success ii they respective tongue the art of painting in miniature undertake not here to celebrate the praise of painting many learn man who have so happily treat of the dignity and excellence of this charming art have save I the labour since what they have say of painting in general be also true of miniature in particular will only add in few word the peculiarity which distinguish it from every other specy of painting it be more delicate it require à nearer viety it be not easily do but in little it be wring only upon velum or paper and the coiour be dilut only with gumwater to succeed in this art man should be perfectly skilled in the art of design or draw but as most people who affect the one know little or nothing of the other and would have the pleasure of painting without give themselves the trouble of learn to design which be indeed a art that be not acquire without great deal of time and continual application invention have be find out to supply the place of it by means of which man design or draw without know how to design ii the first be calk that be if you have mind to do print or design in miniature the backside of it or another paper must be blacken ' with smallcoal and then rubb ' very hard with the finger wradt in linnen cloth afterwards the cloth must be lightly draw over the side so blacken ' that no black grain may remain upon it to soil the velom you would paint upon and the print or draught must be fasten uron the velom with four pin to keep it from shift and if it be ano¬ the paper that be blacken ' it must be put between the velom and the print or draught with the blacken ' side upon the velom then with blunt pin or needle you must pass over the principal line or stroke of the print or draught the contour the plait of the drapery and ver every thing elle that must be distinguissied press so hard that the stroke nay be fatrly mark upon the velom underneath iii copying by square be another convenient method for such as be but little kill ' in the art of design and would copy picture or other thing that can not be calk the method be this the piece must be divide into many equal part by little square mark out with charcoal if the piece be clear and whitish and the black a be suirly see upon it or with white chalk if it be too brown and dusky after which as many square of equal dinension must be make on white paper apon which the piece must be design ecause if this be do immediately upor velom as one be apt to mniscarry in the irst attempt the velom may be soil with false touch but when it be neatly do upon paper it must be calk upon the velom in the manner before describe when the origmal and the paperare thus rder ' observe what be in each square of he piece to be design asa head a arm a hand and so forth and place it in the corresponding part of the paper and thus find where to place all the part of the picce you have nothing to do but to form they well and to join they together by this method you may reduce or enlarge piece to what compass youplease makin the square of you paper greater or lesse than those of the original but they mui always be of a equal number iv to copy picture or other thing in the same size and proportion another method be to make use of varnisn ' paper or of the skin of hog ' bladder vert transparent such as be to be have at the goldbeater tale or isinglass will likewise de as well lay any one of those thing upon you piece and thro ' it you will see all the stroke and touch which be tobe draw upon it with crayon or à pencil then take it off and fastening it under paper or velom set up both açainst the light in the manner of window and with crayon or silver needle mark out upon the paper or velom vou have put uppermost all the line and touch you shall see draw upon the varnish paper bladder talc or isinglaf you have make use of and which will plainly appear thro this window after this manner make use of the window or of glass expose to the light you may copy all sort of print design and other piece on paper or velom laying and fastening they under the paper or velom upon which vou would draw they and tis very good and very easy contrivance for de piece of the same size and proportion lf you have mind to make piece look another way there be nothing to be do out to turn they lay the print or draw side upon the glass and fastening the paper or velom upon the back of it remembr to let you light fall on the best side good method likewise to take true copy of picture in oil be to give touch of the pencil upon all the principal troke with lake temper with oil and to clap upon the whole paper of the same size then pass the hand over it the touch of the lake will stick and leave the design of you piece express upon the aper which may be calk like other thing but you must remember to take off with the crum of bread what remain of the lake upon the picture before it be dry you may likewise make use of pounce make of powder ' charcoal put in linnen rag with which the piece you would copy must be rubb ' after you have prick ' all the principal stroke or touch and fasten white paper or velom underneath but furer and easier help than all these for one who know nothing of deign be mathematical compass it be generally make of ten piece of wood in form of ruler half quarter of a inen thick half a inch broad and foot long or more accord as you have mind to draw piece of greater or lesser size to facilitate the construction of this instrument here exhibit figure of it with a explanation of the manner in which it be to be use this little beard be to be of fir and cover ' with linnen or any other cloth because the piece you copy and the velom or paper you copy upon must be fix upon it upon this board must the compaf also be fix with large pin by the end of the first foot deep enough to keep it close but not so deep as to hinder it from turn easily when vou have mind to reduce thing place you original on the side of the foot and the havelom or paper you would draw upon on the side of the foot remove the velom or draw it nearer accord as you intend to redace or enlarge in order to enlarge piece vou have nothing to do but to change the place of you original and you copy place the last towards and the other on the side of and in both one and the other method crayon or leaden needle must be put in the foot under which the velom lie and pin à little blunt in that over the original with which all the trace be to be follow conduct the pin with one hand and with the other press gently upon the crayon or needle that mark the velom when the crayon or needle bear sufficiently upon the veloimn you have no occasion to touch it by this instrument you may also draw in equal dimension but in order to this the compass must be fix in another manner upon the board for if it be to be fasten upon it by the middle at and you original and you copy must be fix ' on each side of this middle foot at equal distance or from corner to corner that be from to when the piece be large one may likewise draw several copy at once of equal and different dimension vi these be all the help can give to such as be not master of design for those that be they have nothing to do with they when therfsore you piece be mark out upon the velom you must paf with pencil of very clear carmine over all the trace to the end they may not be efface as you work then clean you velom with the crum of bread that no black may remain upon it vii you velom must be paste upon little plate of brass or wood of the size you would make you piece to keep it firm and tightbut this pasting must be on the edge of you velom only and behind the plate for which purpose you velom must exceed you plate above a inch on every side for the part you paint upon must never be paste because it would not enly give it a ill look but you could not take it off if you would cut off the little shag and lock of the velom and wetting the fair side with linnen cloth dipt in water clap the other upon the plate with clean paper between they so much as hang over must be paste upon the back of the plate draw it equally on all side and hard enough to stretch it well viii the chief colour make use of for painting in miniature be carmine venice and florence lake rise pink ermillion red lead brown red red orpiment uitramarine verditer indigo gallstone yellow oker dutch pink gamboge naple yellow pale masticot deep yellow masticot avoryblack lampblack true indian ink bistre or woodsoot raw umber burnt umber sapgreen verdegrease flakewhite crayon of all colour gold and silvershell leafgold or silver pallet of lvory and pencilstick lvory box contain lvoryshell in which be put the colour for miniature all the colour abovespecify with every implement and utensil necessary in the practice of painting in miniature be prepare and sell at most printshop in london and westminster the seven transparent colour which be use where writingis see thro the celour lake blue yellow liquid à grassgreen darkgreen purple colour brovn ix as all colour take from earth and the heavy matter be always too coarse they never so well ground especially for delicate work becaule of certain sand remain in they the finest part may be draw out by dilut they with the finger in cup of water when they be well steep let they settle while then pour out the clearest which will be at top into another vessel this will be the finest and must be let dry and when tis use must be dilut with guinwater as . shall shew hereafter this be very good contrivance especially for flakewbite in which there be chalky matter which like the coarse and heavy part in other colour sink to the bottom of the cup it be steep in ir you mix littie of the gall of a ox carp or a eel particularly of the last in green black gray yellow and brown colour it will not only take away they greasy nature but also give they lustre and brightnef they have not of themselves the gall of eel must be fake out when they be skinn ' and hang upon nail to dry and when vou would use it it must be dilut with brandy and little of it mixd with the colour you have diluted already this likewise make the colourstick better to the velom which it hardly do when it be greasy moreover this gal hinder it from scal x i soue colour be make clearer by fire as tellow oaker brown red ultramarine and umber all other be darken ' by it but if you heat the say colour with sharp fire they change for the browon red become yellow jellow oaker become red umber redden also ceruse by fire take the colour of citron and be often call masticot observe that yellow oker heat become more tender than it be and softer than brown red likewise brovon red heat become softer than fine yellou oaker both be very proper the finest and truest ultramarine heat upon redhot iron become more glitter but it waste and be coarser and harder to work with in miniature when ' tis purge after this manner x ii all these colour be dilut in little cup of lvory make on purpose or in seashell with water in which gumarabic and sugar candy be put for instance in glass of water put piece of gum as big as walnut and half that quantity of sugar candy this last hinder the colour from scal when thy be lay on which they generally do when they want it or the velom be greasy this gumwater must be keep in neat bottle cork and never must you take any out of it with pencil that have colour upon it but with quill or some such thing some of this water be put in the shell with the colour you would temper and dilut with the finger till it be very fineff it be too hard you must let it soften in the shell with the say water before you dilute it afterwards let it dry and do thus with every colour except lillygreen sapgreen and gamboge which must be temper ' with fair water only but ultranarine lake and bistre be to be more gumm than other colour lf you make use of seashell you must let they steep two or three day beforehand in water then cleanse they in boiling hot water mix ' with vinegar in order to carry off certain salt which otherwise stick to they and spoil the colour that be put to they xiii to know whether colour be sufficiently gum you have nothing to do but to give stroke of the pencil upon you hand when they be dilut whichdry immediately lf they chap and scale there be too much gum if they rub out by pass the finger over they there be too little it may be see likewise when the colour be lay on the velom by pass the finger over they if they stick to it like powder it be à sign there be not gumn enough and more must be put in the water with which you temper they take care though you do not put too much for that make the colour extreamly hard and dry it may be know likewise by they glewiness and brightness so the more they be gummed the darker they paint and when you have mind to give greater strength to colour than it have of itself you have nothing to do but to give it great deal of gum xiv provide yourself with a lvory pallet very smooth as big as you hand on one side of which the colour for the carnation or naked part of picture be to be range in the follow manner in the middle put à great deal of white prettv largely spread because it be the colour most make use of and upon the edge from the left to the right place the follow colour at à little distance from the wbite masticot dutch pink orpiment yellow oker green compose of verditer dutchpink and nhite in equal quan¬ tity biew make of uitramarine indigo and white to great degree of paleness vermillion carmine bistre and black on the other side of the pallet spread ome wbite in the same manner as for the carnation and when you have mind to paint drapery or other thing place near he wbite the colour you would make ' em of in order to work as ishall shew hereafter x v theuse of good pencil be great matter in order to make good choice wet they little and if the hair keep close together as you turn they upon the finger and make but one point they be good but if they close not together but make several point and some be longer than other they be good for nothing not for dot in particular and least of all for carnation when they be too sharp pointed with only four or five hair longer than the rest yet elose all together they be notwithstanding good but they must be blunt with pair of scizzar take care at the same time you do not dlip away too much tis proper to have two or three sort of they the largest for lay the grounds and deadcolour and the smallest for finish to bring the hair of you pencil to join close together and make good point you must often put the pencil just between you lip when you be at work moistening and press it close with the tongue even when there be colour upon it for if there be too much some of it be take off by this means and enough leave for give fine and equal touch you need not apprehend this will do you any harm none of thet colour for miniature except orpiment which be poison when they be prepare have either ill taste or ill quality this expedient must especially be use for dot and for finisbing particularly the naked part of picture that the touch may be neat and fair and not too much charge with colour as for drapery and other thing as well in deadcolour as in finish ' tis sufficient in order to make the hair of you pencil join well and to unload it when it have too much colour to draw it upon the edge of the shell or upon the paper you must put upon you work to rest you hand on give some stroke upon it before you work upon you piece x vi to work well in miniature you must do it in room that have but one window and fix you self very near it with table and desk almost as high as the window place you self in such manner that the light may always come in on the left side and never forward or on the right when you would lay colour equally strong as for ground ke you mixture in shell and for the thing you design to there be not enough tis but the colour you mix afterdark or too light after have speak of velom colour let we now shew how employ in the first place you would paint piece be it drapery or any thing else you by deadcolour that be to fay you colour on with liberal pencil in the smoothest manas the painter do in oil not the force it be to have for fia make the light little the shade less dark than they because in dot upon they do after deadcolour the way fortify and would at last here be several way of dotdry painter have he own some dot perfectly round other littie longish other batch ce that crof each other every work appear as if 'it have be dot this last method be the best the boldest and the soonest dc wherefore advise such as would painting miniature to use it and to inure theselve froin the first to dot in the plump the soft way that be to say where the be lose in manner in the ground upon which you work and only so much appear as be sufficient to make the work seem ted the bard and the dry way be qur the reverse and always to be avoid be do by dot with colour much do ker than you ground and when the pecil be not moisten ' enough with the colour which make the work seem rough and evenx x study likewise caresully to lose a drow you colour one in another so thin it may not appear where they disjoin a zo this end soften or allay you touch with colour that partake of both in suc sort that it may not appear to be you touch which cut and disjoin they the word cut conceive what manifesti separate and divide and do not run and blend it self with the neighbour co lour which be rarely practis but upon the border of drapery x xi when you piece be finish ' ti beighten they little give they fine air that be to say to give upon the extremity of the light small touch with colour lighter which must be lose and drew th the rest x x ii wlen the colour be dry upon you pallet or in you shell in order to they they must be dilut with water rid when you perceive they want gum ahiich be see when they easily rub off the land or the velom if you give touch tith they upon either as have say alreathey must be temper ' with gum watera stead of pure water till they be in good ondition x xiii there be several fort of grounds picture and portraiture some be holly dark compose of bistre umber id colognearth with little black and bite other more yellow in which be tix great deal of oker other grayer hich partake of indigo in order to paint ground make wash of the colour or dixture you would have it or accord to nat of the picture or portraiture you would opy that be to say verv light lay in hich there be hardly any thing but water order to soak the velom then pass nother lay over that somewhat thicker nd strike it on very smoothly with large troke as quick as you can not touch wice in the same place before it be dry be ause the second stroke carry off what have be lay on at the first especially when you lean little too hard upon the pencil x xiv other dark grounds be li wise make of colour little greenish those be most in use and the properest lay under all sort offigure and ' ort raitu because they make the carnation or to part ofa picture appear very fine arel on very easily and there be no occasion dot they as one be often oblige to do other which be rarely make smooth even at the first whereas in these one dom fail of success at the first bout make they you must mix black du pink and white all together more or lesa each colour accord as you would they darker or lighter you be to one zay very light and then thicker isaid of the first grounds you may make they of other colour if you plea but these be the most common x x v when you paint holy per upon one of these grounds and would pa small glory round the head of you figt you must not lay the colour tco thick that part or you may even lay none at especially where this glory be to be bright but lay for the first time with and little oker mix ' together of af ficient thickness and in proportion as place of the head put à little and to make it lose it self and ith the colour of the ground free stroke of the pencil folound of the glory sometimes we of which it be make and ith that of the ground mixing or oker with the last when dark to work with and do insensibly lose in another and see to disjoin they fill a entire ground with rightest part be lay on with white add more of the ortion as you come nearer the picture and when the oker enough for you must always and darker add gallstone aftle carmineand lastly bistre ying or deadcolour be to be as possible that be to say let ing lose themselves in one ano¬ gap or intersection then dot upon they with the same rder to drow the whole tobe pretty tedious and little cially when there be cloud he ground they light must in proportion as you remove gure and finish as the rest and round the cloudthe bright and obscure part of which must insensibly into one another x xvii for daysky take ultramarand good deal of white and mix thn together with this make lay as sinoch as you can with large pencil and libei stroke as for grounds apply it paa and paler as you descend towards the hclf zon which must be do with vermillion red lead and with white of the sae strength with that where the sky end less make this blow lose it the red which you bring down to of the earth or top of house mixing towards the end gallstone anca good deal of white in such manner tlt the mixture be still paler than the formy without any visible intersection or partiij between all these colour of the sky x xviii when there be cloud in sky ycu may spare the place where the be to be that be to say you need not le en any biezo there but form they if the be reddisn with vermillion gallstone al white with little indigo and if they more upon black put in good deal the last painting the light of one and th the wich masticot vermillion and whit more or less of any of these colour accort ing to the strength you would give then or accord to that of the original you in ding the whole as you dot for ult matter to lay they very fmooth painting and if the sky be not igh you must dot it allo you pleafure to exempt the place ud for you may lay they upon ad of the sky heighten the ts by put good deal of white ying the shadow by use less shortest way night or stormy sky be do black and white inixe togeich be lay as for daysky to ire must be add oker vermillivonr for the cloud the light re to have of masticot or red lead white now redder now yeldiscretion and when it be à temky andlightening appear in some it blue or red it be to be do aysky drow and lose the gether at the firstform or deadand at the finish of drapery to paint blow drapery ultramarine near the upon you pallet and mik part of with the other till it make fine and have body with this mixture must form the brightest part and add more uitramarine form such as darker and go on after this manner you come to the deepest plait and thickest shade where you must lay uitramarine and all this must be don for firstform or deadcolour be to say lay the colour on with stroke of the pencil yet as smooth as can lose the light of the shadcw will colour neither so pale as the light no dack as the shade then dot with same colour as in the firstform small matter deeper that the dot may fairly see all the part must be drou one in another and the plait appearw out intersection when the uliramarin not dark enough to make the deeper dow houv well soever it be gummy à little indigo with it to finish they when the extremity of the light be bright enough heighten they with and very little ultramarine x bxi drapery of carmine be do the same manner as the blue except at in the darkest place there be to be ay of pure vermillion before you deadcoyou with carmine which must be apply top and in the strongest shade it must gumm ' very much to deepen it the lore mix à little bistre with it x x x ii there be likewise make another ed drapery which be first draw with ermillion mixing white with it to deadco¬ you the bright place lay it pure and ninix for such as be darker and add armine for the grand shade tis finish ' fterwards like other drapery with the same colour and when the carmine with ne vermillion don 's darken enough work with the first alone but only in the deepest if the shade x x xiii drapery of lake be make in he same manner with that of carmine nixing good deal of white with it for the right place and very little for those that be dark tisfinish likewise with dot ut you have nothing to do with vermillion nit x xxiv violetdrapery be likewise do after this manner after make mixure of carmine and ultramarine put always white for the bright part if yt would have you violet be columbine there must be more carmi than uitramarine but if you would han it blewer and deeper put more ultramari chan carmine x xxv drapery be make of flest colour begin with lay make of whit vermillion and very pale lake and makin the shade with the saine colour use le white in they this drapery must be ver pale and tender because the stuff of th colour be thin and light and even the shadt of it ought not to be deep x xxvi to make yellow drapery put à lay of masticot over all then one gamboge uron that except the brightei place where the masticot must be leave en tire then deadcolour with oker mix ' with little gamboge and masticot puttin more or less of the last accord to th strength of the shade and when these colcur do not darken enough add gallstone and gallstene pure and unmix ' be use of the thickest shide mixing little bistr with it if there be occasion to make then still darker you finish by dot with the same colour you deadcolour ' with anc lose the light and the shade in one a other x xxvii ir you put napletellow or dutch pink in lieu of masticot and gamboge ju will make another sort of yelloep x xxviii the green drapery be make ra general lay of verditer with which you find it too blue mix masticot for the ight and gamboge for the sbade afterard add to thismixture lillygreen or sapgreen to shadow with and as the shade thicker put more of these last green id even work with they pure and uninix here they be to be extreamly dark you ish with the same colour à little darker by put more telloo or more blue thele colour you may make different rt of green as you please x x xix to make black drapery vou adcolour with black and white and fish with the same colour put more lack as the shade be thicker and for darkest mix indigo with it especially han you would have he drapery appear like elvet you may always give some touch ith brighter colour to heighten the ght of any drapery whatsoever xl white wool drapery be make lay of white in which there must be very small matter of oker orpiment or allstone that it may look little yellowish then deadcolour and finisn the sha with blue little black white and bist put great deal of the last in the dark xli the lightgray be begin black and white and finish ' with the sa colour deeper x lii for à brown drapery make bistre white and little brownand shadow with this mixture make lis darker x liii tiere be other drapery lead variable because the light be of colour from the shade these mostly use for the vestment of angel young and gay people for scarf and to airy attire admit of great many fol and flow at the pleasure of the wij the most common be the violet of wh they make two sort one where the lig be blue and the other where they be low x liv for the first put lay of ult

several other sort of drapery ay be make at discretion always take re to preserve the union of the colour only in one fort of cloth or so but also group of several figure avoid as uch as the subject will allow the put blue near the colour of fire of green ainst black and so of other colour which it and disjoin and whose union be not nd enough several other drapery be mas of foul colour as brownred bistre in digo and all in the same mannt likewise of other colour simple and corpound the agreement between which always to be minded that the mixture man produce nothing harsh and disagreeable the eye no certain rule can be lay dov for this the force and effect of you lour be only to be know from use be experience and you must work accordir to that knowledge li line cloath be do thus after draw the plait or fold as be do in drapery put à lay of white over all the deagcolour and finish the shade with mixture of ultramarine black and wbite use more or less of the last accord they strength or tenderness and in th greatest deepning put bistre mix ' with little white give only some touch this mixture and even of pure bistre upo the extremity of the greatest shadow where the

be under neath especially towards the end of th shade and only do the extremity of the light for the yellow with masticot ant wnite and for the white with pure white they may be do in another manner especially when you wou ' have they alltogether as clear as mustin lavn or gawze to this end form and finish what be to be beneath as if nothing be to be put over it then mark out the light and clear fold with white or masticot and shadowy with bistre and white or with black blue and wbite accord to the colour you would make they of make the rest somewhat fainter yet this be not necessary but for the part that be not to be so clear lv crape be do the same way except that the fold ofthe shade and the zight and the border too be to be markd out with little filament of black upon what be underneath which be likewise to be finish before hand lvi when you would make stuff like zeater tabby make the wave upon it with colour little lighter or little darker in the light and the shade lvii there be manner of touch drapery which distinguishy the silken from the wool the last be more terrestrial and sensible the other more light and fad but it must be observe that this be a effect which depend partly upor the stuff and partly upon the colour and for employ these in manner suitable to the subyect and the deepning of painting will here touch upon they different quality lviii we have no colour which partake more of light nor which come nearer the air than white which shew it to be fickle and fleeting it may nevertheless be hold and bring to by some neighbour colour more heavy and sensible or by mxing they together lix blue be most fleeting colour and so we see that the sky and the remotest view of picture be of this colourbut it will become lighter and fickler in proportion as it be mix with white lx pure black be the heaviest and most terrestrial of all colour and the more of it you mix with other the nearer youbre they to the eye nevertheless the different disposition of black and white make also they effect different for white often make black doappear and black bring white more into view as in the reflection of globe or other figure to be make round where there be always part that sly as it be from the eye and deceive it by the craft of art and under the white be here comprehend all the light colour as under the black all the heavy colour uitramarine be then soll and light oker be not so much so masticot be very light and so be verditer vermillion and carmine come near this quality orptment and gamboge not so near lake hold certain mean rather soft than rough dutchpink be a indifferent colour easily take the quality of other so it be make terrestrial by mixing it with colour that be so and on the contrary the most light and fleeting by join it with white or blue brownred umber darkgreen and bistre be the heaviest and most terrestrial next to elack lxi skilful painter who understand perspective and the harmony of colour always observe to place the dark and sensible colour on the forepart of they picture and the most light and fleeting they use for the distance and remote view and as for the union of colour the different mixture that may be make of they will learn you the friendship or antipathy they have to one another and upon this you must take you measure for place they with such agreement as shall please the eye lxii for the do of lace frenchpoint or other thing of that nature put over all lay of blue black and white as for line then heighten the flowerwork with pure white afterwards make the sbade above with the first colour and finish they with the same when they be upon the carnation or naked part of picture or uron any thing else that you would shew through another finisn what be beneath as if nothing be to be put over it and at top make the point or lace with pure white shadow and finish they with the other mixture lxiii if you would paint fur you must begin with kind of drapery do if it be dark with bistre and white make the shadowing of the same colour with less white if the fur be white do it with blue white and little bistre and when this beginning or firstform be do instead of dot draw small stroke turning now in one manner now in another accord to the course and flat of the hair heighten the ligbis of dark furs with oker and white and of the other with white and little blue lxiv for do building if it be of stone take indigo bistre and white with which make the beginning or first form of it and for shadow it put less of this last and more bistre than indigo accord to the colour of the stone vou would paint to these you may likewise add little oker both for the form and the finish but to make it finer you must give here and there especially for old fabrick blue and yellow teint some with oker other with uitramarine nux always white with they whether before the firstform provide they appear through the draught or whether upon it loose and drow they wich the rest when you finisn lxv wie the building be of wood as there be iany sort it be do at docretion but the most ordinary way be to begin or firstform with oker bistre and white and finish without white or with ry little and if the shade be deep with be bistre in the other they add somenes vermillion sometimes green or black word just accord to the colour they would give it and they finish with dot as in drapery and every thing use of carnation or the toked part of painting x vi trhere be in carnation so many different colourings that it would be difficult thing to give general rule upon so variale subject nor be they minded when one have get by custom and practice some habit of work easily and such as be arrive to this degree employ themselves in copy they original or else they work upon they idea without know how insomuch that the most skilful who do it with less reflection and pain than other would likewise be more put to it to give a account of they maxim and knowledge in the matter of painting if they be to be ask what colour they make use of for make such and such colouring teint here and another there nevertheless as beginner for whom design this little work want some instruc tion at the first will shew in general after what manner several carnation be be do lxvii in the first place after havin draw you figure with carmine and ordered you piece apply for woman anc child and generally for all tender colourings lay of white mix witf never so little of the blue make for face of which lhave tell the composition but let it hardly be see lxviii and for man instead of blue they put in this first lay little vermillion and when they be old little oker be mix ' with it lxix afterwards sollow all the trace with vermillion carmine and white mix together and begin all the sbade with this mixture add white in propor¬ tion as they be weaker and put but little in the darkest and none in manner in certain place where strong touch be to be give for instance in the corner of the eye under the nose at the ear under the chin in the separation ef the finger in all the joint at the corner of the nail and generally in every part where you would mark out separation in shade ade that be obscure neither need you yar to give to those place all the force and strength they ought to have as soon as you begin or firstformthem because in work top with green the red you have put there be always weak lxx after have begin or firstform or deadcoloured with red make blue teint with ultramarine and great eal of white upon the part which sly om the eye that be to say upon the temles under and in the corner ofthe eye both side the mouth above and below little upon the middle of the forehead etween the nose and the eye on the side the cheek on the neck and other plaes where the flesh have know not what blue cast with it yellowish teint be likewise make with jker or orpiment and little vermillion mixt with white under the eyebrow on he side of the nose towards the bottom little underneath the cheek andupon the other part which rise and come nearer the eye 't be especially for these teint that the natural complexion be to be observe inorder to catch it for painting be a imitation of nature the perfection of the art consist in the justness and simplicity of the representation especially in facepainting lxxi when therefore you have do you first lay you deadcolour arha you teint you must work upon the shadot dot with green for the carnation naked part mixing accord to the ruy have give for the teint little blue fe the part which sly from the eye and the other hand make it à little yellow for those that be more sensible that be say which rise and come nearer the eyt and at the end of the shade on the sic of the light you must blend and lose you colour insensibly in the ground of the can nation with blue and then with red accore ing to the place where you paint if this mixture of green do not work dark enougld at first paf over the shade several time now with red and now with green alway dot and this do till they be as thet should be lxxii anp if you can not with these colour give the shade all the force they ought to have finish in the darkest witf bistre mixt with orpiment oker or vermillion and sometimes with pure bistre accord to the colour you would make but lightly lay on you colour very clear lxxiii you must dot upon the clear and bright place with little vermillion or with much white and very of oker in order to lose they dowy and to make the teint nsibly into one another taking dot or batch to make vour the turning and winding part for though the rule be ys this dot or hatch car à little more here because art mixture might make coed if it be always to be use tewise in every part to blend id the shade with blue and ind much white so mix as to except nevertheless that must not be put upon the upon the extremity of the no more than the other mixnese last which must be leave light as certain place of the nose and of the foreupon the cheek which and ught nevertheless to be redrest as well as the foot the he hand and the finger of that these two last mixture so pale that the work shall ble for they serve only to sofite the teint with one another ide with the light and to race care must likewise be take take that you work not too much wit the red mixture upon the blue teint no with the blue upon the other but chang the colour from time to time when yo perceive it work too blue or too red til the work be finish lxxiv the white of the eye must be shadow with this same blue and littlu fleshcolour and the corner on the sidt of the nose with vermillion and white give they little touch of carmine the whole be soften with this mixture of vermiilion carmine white and very smal matter of oker the apple or ball of the eye be do with the mixture of ultramarine and whitethe last prevail little add little bistre if they be yellowish or little black if they be gray make the little black circle in the middle call the cbrytal of the eye and shadow the ball with indigo bistre or black accord to the colour they be of give to each sinall touch of pure vermillion round the chrytal which must be lose with the rest at the finish this give vivacity to the eye the kound or circumference of the eye be do with bistre and carmine that be to say the slit or parting and the eyelid when they be large and bold especially the upper one which must after ward be soften ' with the red or blue mixture lave mention before to the end they nay be lose in one another and nothing seem intersected when this be do give à little touch of ure white upon the cbrystal on the side of the ligbt this make the eye shine and give life to it lxxv the mouth be deadcoloured with vermillion mik with white and fi nish ' with carmine which be soften as the rest and when the carmine do not work dark enough mik little bistre with it this be to be understand of tlie corner in the separation of the lip and particularly of certain mouth half open lxxvi tie hand and all the other part of carnation be do in the same mannér as the face observe that the end of the finger be little redder than the rest when you whole work be form ' and dot mark the separation of all the part with little touch of carmine and orpiment mix ' together as well in the shadowy as the light place but little deeper and stronger in the first and lase they in the rest of the carnation lxxvii the eyebrow and the beard be deadcolour as be the shade of carnation and finish with bistre oker or black accord to the colour they be of draw thein by little stroke the way they oughe to go that be to say give themf all the nature of hair the light of they mustbe heighten with oker and bistre a vermillion and much white lxxviii for the hair of the head make à lay of bistre oker and white and à little vermillion when it be very dark colour ' use black instead of oker afterward form the shadocoy part with the same colour put less white in they and finish with pure bistre or mix ' with oaker or black by small stroke very fine and close to each other wave and buckle they accord to the curl of the hair the light part must also be heighten ' by little stroke with oker or orpiment white and littie vermillion after which lose the light and the sbade in each other by work sometimes with dark and sometiine with pale colour and for the hair about the forehead thro which the skin be see it must be first form with the colour thereof and that of the carnation work and shadow with one and the other as if vou design to paint none then form it and finish with bistre the light be to be heighten ' as the other gray hair be deadcolour ' with white black and bistre and finish with the same colour but deeper heighten the bright and clear part of the hair as well as those ofthe eyebrow and the beard with wbite ind very pale blue after have form ' they as the other with the colour of the fleshi or skin and finisn with bistre lxxix but the most important thing be to soften one work to blend the teint in one another as well as the beard and the hair about the forehead with the other hair and the carnation take especial care not to work rongh and dry and that the trace turning and winding of the carnation or naked part be not intersect you must likewise accustom yourself to put wbite in you colour only in propor¬ tion as you work lighter or darker for the colour you use the second time must be always little stronger and deeper than the first unless it be for softening lxxx different colourings be easily make by put more or less of red or blue or yellow or bistre whether for the deadcolour or for the finish that for woman ought to be blueish that for child little red and both fresh and florid that for man ought to be yellower especially when they be old lxxxi to make cclour of death there must be first lay of white and or piment or very pale oker deadcolour wit vermilion and lake instead of carmine and good deal of white and afterward work over it with green mixture in whicl there be more blue than any other colour to the end the flesn may be livid and of purple colour the teint be do the same way as in another colour bur there must be great many more blue than yelloze one especially upon the part whick fly from the sight and about the eye anc the last be only to be upon the part whick rise and comnearer the eye they be make to die away one in another accord to the ordinary manner sometimes with very pale blue and scmetimes with okerand white and alittle vermillion softning the whole together the part and contour must be round with the same colour the mouth be to be in manner of violet tis deadcoloured however with little vermillion oker and white but finish with lake and blue and to give it the deep stroke they take bistre and lake with which they likewise do the same to the eye the nose and the ear if it be à crucifix or some martyr upon whom blood be to be see after the finishng the carnation form it with vermillion and finish it with carmine making in the drop of blood littie bright reflect park to round they for the crown of thorn make lay of veagreen and masticot shadow it witli sistre and green and heighten the clear ind light part with masticot lxxxii iron be form or first lay vith indigo little black and white and inish with pure indigo heighten it vith white lxxxiii for painting fire and flame he light be do with masticot and oroiment and for the shade they mix ver nillion and carmine lxxxiv smoke be do with black indigo and white and sometimes with bistre one may likewise add vermillion or oker accord to the colour it be to be of lxxxv pearlsare paint by put à lay of white and little blue they be shadow and round with the same colour deeper small white dot be make almost in the middle on the side of the light and en the other side between the shadow and the edge of the pearl they give touch with masticot to make ti reftection and under the pearl be make little shadow of the colour of the groui they be upon lxxxvi diamond be do win pure black then they heighten they wit iittle touch of white on the side of th light it be the same thing for any othel jewel you have mind to paint thet be nothing to be do but to change th colour lxxxvii for make figure gold put à lay of shellgold and shadov it with gallstone silver be do the same way exceptin that it must be shadow ' with indigo lxxxviii thus have particulariset down several little matter to help be ginner for the method of do these and the colour that be use in they will likewise help for such thing as have no mention wait for the skill and facii lity which time and experience be use the give to such as apply themselves to this art one great means to acquire perfectior in it be to copy excellent original we enjoy with pleasure and tranquility labour and pain of other but man nust copy great number before hie be able to produce as fine effect and it be better to be good copier than bad author the instruction have give for the mixture and different tincture for the colour of carnation and other thing may particularly serve for work after print where nothing be see but black ind white though they be not unprofitaple when one begin to copy after picture without skill in the management of colour and without know they force and effect for there be this differencbetween miniature and painting in oil that in the last the colour be take upon the pallet just as they appear in the picture where they be lay on at once insomuch that nothing be to be do but to consider à little what will make such light and what such shade but it be not thus in miniature where pretty often the last lay that be apply do not keep ts colour but take another from the first that have be wring underneathor rather one and the other compose à third which have the desire effect and hough for example it be white green armine blue orpiment bistre of which this colour be compose these olour nevertheless do not produce it if you mix they together for it be not only by work first with one then witl another that the thing be do a when man see this effect without have ing see how it be produce he must least be conjurer to discover the orde and manner of it supposing that he hat neither book nor master for this reasof apply myself to particularize so mant little instruction in this matter and af sure myself that experience will shew the such as be in capacity to make use they that though ' they be small they be no less useful of landskip lxxxix 't be particularly for landskip that the arti le be esteem and the follow on the nature and different quality of colcur because the order and distribution that be make of they will do much towards shew the remote and the near view which deceive the eye and the greatest painter of landskip have always observe to place the most terrestrial and sensible colour upon the first line of they landskip reserve the lightest for the dotance but that may not wander from my design instead of general precept will stop to give beginner some particular instruction for practice xc in the first place after have ordered the cconomy of you landsiip as of you other piece you must form the nearest grounds or land when they be to appear dark with sap or lillygreen bistre and little verditer to give body to you colour then dot with this mixture but little darker add sometimes little black to it for such piece of ground as the light fall upon and which be therefore clear and bright make lay of oker and white then shadow and finish with bistre in some they mix littit green particularly for shadow and finish there be sometimes upon the forepart certain reddish land which be deadcoloured with brown red white and little green and finish with the same puttinga little more green in they for the making of graf and leave upon the foreground you must when that be finiss form with seagreen or verditer and little wbite and for thole that be vellowisn mix masticot asterwards shadow they with lillygreen or bistre and gallstone if you would have thei appear wither ' the grounds or land at à little dotance be form with verditer and shadow and finish with sapgreen add bistre for some touch here and there such as be at greater distance be do with seagreen and little blue and shadowd with verditer in word the farther they go the more blueisp they be to be make and the farthest distance ought to be of ultramarine and white mixing in some place small touch of vermillion xci water be paint with indigo and white and shadow ' with the same colour but deeper and to finish it instead of dotting they do nothing but make stroke and trace without crosling give they the same turn with the wave when there be any sometimes little green must be mix in certain place and the light and elear part heighten with pure white particularly where the water foam rock be deadcoloured like building of stone except that little green be mix ' for form and shadow they blue and yellow teint be make upon they and lose with the rest in finish and when there be small branch with leave moss or grass when all be finisn ' they be to be raise at top with green and masticot they may be make yellow green and reddissi for appear dry in the same manner as on the ground rock be dot as the rest and the farther they be off the more grayisn they be make castle old house and other building of stone and wood be do in the manner have mention before speak of those thing when they be upon the first line but when you would have they appear at à distance you must mix broconred and vermillion with much white and shadow very tenderly with this mixture and the farther they be off the weaker be the stroke to be for the separation ii they be cover with slate it be to be made bluer than the rest x cii tree be not do till the sky be finish one may nevertheless spare the place of they when they contain good number and however it be such as come near the eye be to be deadcolour ' with verditer mixing sometimes oker and shadowd with the same colour add lillygreen afterwards you must work leave upon they by dot without ross for this must be do with small ongisn dot of darker colour and pretfull of it which miust be conduct on he side the branch go by little tuft of little darker colour then heighten the light with verditer or seagreen and masicot make leave in the same manner and when there be dry branch or leave hey be deadcoloured with brozonred or zallstone with white and finish with rallstone without white or wich bistre the trunk of tree be to be deadcowe ' with oker wbite and little green or the light and clear part and for the lark they mix black add bistre and areen for shadow one and the other lue and yellow teint be likewise make pon they and little touch give here and here with white and masticct such as you rdinarily see upon the bark of tree the branch which appear among the leave be do with oker verditer and white or with bistre and white accord to the light they be place in they must be shadowd with bistre and lillygreen tree which be at little distance be deadcoloured with verditer and sea green and be shadow ' and finish with the same colour mix ' with lillygreen when there be some which appear yellowish lay with oker and wbite and finish with gallstone for such as be in the distance and remote view you must deadcolour with seagreen with which for finish you must mix uitramarine heighten the light of one and the other with masticot by small disjoin leave tis the most difficult part of landstip oc and in manner of miniature to leaf tre well to learn and break one 's hand to it à little the way be to copy good one or the manner of touch they be singular and can not be acquire but by work upon tree themselves about which you must observe to make little bough which must be leaf especially such as be below and towards the sky and ' generally let you landstip be colour in handsom manner and full of nature and truth for ' tis that which give they all they beauty of flower x ciii it be a agreeable thing to paint flower not only on account of the splendor of they different colour but also by reason of the little time and pain that be bestow in trimming they there be nothing but delight in it and in manner no application you maim and bungle face if you make one eye higher or lower than another small nose with large mouth and so of other part but the fear of these disproportion constrain not the mind at all in flowerpainting for unless they be very remarkable for this reason they spoil nothing most person of quality who divert theyselve with painting keep to flower nevertheless you must apply yourself to copy justly and for this part of miniature as for the rest refer you to nature for she be you best model work then after natural flower and look for the teint and different colour of they upon you pallet little use will make you find they easily and to facilitate this to you at the first shall in the continuance ance of my design shew the manner of painting some for natural flower be not always to be have and one be often oblige to work after print where nothing be see but grave xciv tisa general rule that flower be design and lay like other figure but the manner of formingand finish they be different for they be first form only by large stroke and trace which you must turn at the first the way the small one be to go with which you finish this turning aid much thereto and for finishing they instead of hatch or dot you draw small stroke very fine and very close to one another without croff rez paff several timy ' till you dark and you clear part have all the force you would give they of rose xcv fter make you first sketch draw with carminethe redrose ly very pale lay of carmine and and ap white then form the shade with the same colour put less wbite in it and lastly with pure carmine but very bright and clear at the first fortify it more and more as you proceed in you work and accord to the darkness of the shade this be do by large stroke then finish work upon it with the same colour by little stroke which you inust make go the same way with those of the grave if it be print you copy or the way the leave of the rose turn if you copy after painting or after nature lose the dark in the clear part and heighten the greatest light and the brightest or mest lightsome leave with wbite and little carmine you must always make the heart of rose and the side of the shadow darker than the rest and mix à little indigo for shadow the first leave particularly when the rose be blow to make they seem fad the seed be deadcoloured with gambogewith which little sapgreen be mix for shadow rose streak with several colour ought to be pale be than other that the mixture of colour may be better see which be do with carmine little darker in the shade and very clear in the light always hatch by stroke for white rose you must put à zay of white and form and finish they as the red but with black white and little bistre and make the seed little yellower yellow rose be do by put in every part à lay of masticot and shadow they with gamboge gallstone and bistre heighten the clear and light place with masticot and white the style the leave and the bud of all sort of rose be form with verditer with which be mix little masticot and gamboge and for shadow they they add sapgreen put less of the other colour when the shade be deep the qutside of the leave ought to be blewer than the inside wherefore it must be deadcolourd with seagreen and sapgreen mix with that for shadow make the vein or fibre on this side clearer than the ground and those on the other side darker the prickle which be upon the stile and bud of rose be do with lirtle touch of carmine which be make to go every way and for those that be upon the stalk they be form with verditer and carmine and shadow ' with carmine and bistre make the bottom of the stalk more reddisn than the top that be to say you must mik with the green carmine and pure bistre of tulip xcvi as there be a infinity of tulip different from one another one can not pretend to mention the colour with which they be all do will only touch upon the handsomest call streak and these streak be deadcoloured with very clear carmine in some place and with darker in other finish with the same colour by little stroke which must be carriedj the same way with the streak and ini other be put first lay of vermillion then they form they by mixing carmine and finish they wich pure carmine in some they put florencelake over the vermillion instead of carmine some be do with lake and carmine mix together and with lake alone or with white and lake for the first form whether it be rosepink or florencelake there be some of purple colour which be form with ultramarine carmine or lake sometimes blewer and sometime redder the manner of do both one and the other be the same there be no difference but in the colour you must in certain place ashetween che streak of vermillion carmine or lake sometimes put blue make of ultramarine and white and sometimes very bright purple which be finish by stroke as the rest and lose with the streak there be some likewise which have fallow teint that be make with lake bistre and oaker accord as they be but this be only in sine and rare tulip and not in the common one for shadow the bottom of themi they ordinarily take indigo and white for such whose streak be of carmine for such as be of lake they take black and white with wnich in some bistre be mix ' mix ' and in other green some be likewise to be shadow ' with gamboge and umber and always by stroke and race that turn as the leave turn other tulip be likewise do call ' border ' that be to say the tulip be not streak but on the edge of the leave where there be border it be white in the purple red in the yellow yellow in the red and red in the white the purple be lay wich uitramarine carmine and white shadow and finish it with this mixture the border be spar ' that be to say let only light lay of white be put there and let it be shadow with have ry bright indigo the yellote be form ' with gamboge and shadow with the same colour mixing oker and umber or bistre with it the border be lay with vermillion and finish with very small matter of carmine the red be forin ' with vermillion and finish with the same colour mixing carmine or lake with it the bottom and the border be do with gamboge and for finishing they add gallstone and umber or bistre the white be shadow with black blue and white indian ink be very proper for this the shadowing of it be very tender lt producc alone the effect of blue and white mix with other black the border of this white tulip be do with carmine in all these sort of tulip they leave nerve or sinew in the middle of the leave that be brighter than the rest and the border be drow with the bottom by small trace turn crosswise for they must not appear cut and separate as the streak or partycoloured they make they likewise of several other colour when they happen to be such whose bottom on the inside be black as it be they form and finisn they with indigo as also the seed about the nozzle or staik and if the bottom be yellow it be form ' with gamboge and finisn by adding umber or bistre the leave and the stalk of tulip be ordinarily forin ' with seagreen and shadow and finisn with lillygreen by large trace all along the leave some may likewise be do with verditer mixing masticot with it and shadow with sapgreen that the green of the shade may be yello wer the emony or windflower xcvii there be several sort of they as well double as single the last be ordinarily without streak some be make of purple colour with purple and shadow they with the same ne redder other blewer someale and sometimes very dark forin ' with lake and white with the same put less without any white at all re forin ' with vermillion and

be shadow with vermillion mix with carmine mixing here and there som stronger touch especially in the hear of the flower next the great leave on tht side of the shadow they finish with car mine by little stroke and trace turn the same way with the mixt or partycolour and the leave they form and finish the streak or partycolour of some other as well as the small leave with pure carmine leave nevertheless in the middle of the last little circle in which be lay dark purple which be lose with the rest and when all be finish ' they give some touch with this same colour round about the sinall leave especially on the side of the shadow drow they with the large one the remainder of which be shadow ' either with indigo or black in some the small leave be do with lake or purple though the partycolour of the large one be do with caniine there be other whose mixt colour be do with carmine in the middle of most of the large leave put in some place vermillion underneath and lose these

finish with sapgreen the leave and style be lay with the same green mixing sapgreen to finisn they should never have do be to set down here all the flower that may be painted but have mention enough and too many to give a idea of other and dozen would have be sufficient be one always to work after nature for then there would be nothing to be do but to paint what one see but think that as print be most frequently copy it would be pleasing to find here the colour with which different fsower be do however to finish as have begin every one be ât liberty to take and to leave what he think proper cxxxii shall not add here any particular instruction upon other subject it be not necessary and this little treatise be already larger than design it will only say in general that fruit fish serpent and all sort of reptile be to be toueb in the same manner as the figure of man be that be hatch or dotted bird and all other animalsare do like flower by stroke or trace cxxxiii . never make use for any of these thing of whitelead tis only proper in oil it blacken like ink when only temper ' with gum especially if you set you work in moist place or where perfume be ceruse of venice be as fine and of as pure white be not sparing in the use of this especially in form or deadcolour and let it enter into all you mixture in order to give they certain body wliich will render you work glewish and make it appear soft plump and strong the taste of painter be neverthelefs different in this point some use à little of it and cther nene at all but the manner of the last be meagre and dry other use great deal and doubtless it be the best method and most follow among skilful person for besides that it be speedy she may by the use of it copy all sort of picture which would be almost impossible otherwise notwithstanding the contrary opinicn of seme who say that in mimtature we can not give the force and all the ' fferent teint we see in piece in oil put this be not true at least of good painer and effect prove it pretty plainly or we see figure landskip picture nd every thing else in miniature touch as grand as true and as noble manner though more tender and delicate as they be in oil however know that painting in oil ias its advantage be they only these hat it exhibit more work and take up less run tis better desend likewise against he injury of time and the right of irth must be grant it and the glory of antiquity but miniature likewisehas its advantage nd without repeat such as have manion already ' tis neater and more comnodious you may easily carry all you mplement in you pocket and work vhen and wherever you please without uch number of preparation you may juit it and resume it when and as often as ou will which be not do in the other which one be rarely to work dry but observe that it be in one and the she as in play in which the greatest or cast perfection of the actor do not onsist in play high or low partbut play extremely well the part they indertake for if he who have the lowest haracter acquit himself better than anoshe who act the hero doubtless he merit greater applause tis the same thing in the art of paint ing its excellence do not depend upor the greatness of the subject but upon thes manner in which it be handle have yot talent for one thing don ' throw you self inconsiderately upon another and you have receive from heaven some sparl of this delicate fire know wherefore it give you and cherisn and improve it some catch the air of face well other suc ceed better in landskip some work ir litile who can not do it in large some art skill ' in colour who know little of design other lastly have only genius for flower and even the bassan get themselvet fame for animal which they touch in very fine manner and better than any thing else wherefore let every one be content with he own genius without affect the ta lean of another and take flight beyonhe strength for it be very idie to force toture to give we what she have refuse we and it concern we prudence as well as modesty not to take it in we head to shew a excellence we have not for this be to discover we imperfection and to labour to we shame on the contrary it be no disgrace to you that you don 's possess alone all the part which have give reputation to great painter every one of they have he perfection and he weakness and every one of we ought to be content with he porion the main point be to cultivate it with be and though this little book will certainly ontribute thereto yet present it you only supplement to better means withut doubt one may learn more advantaeoussy under a excellent master from vhom one might receive all the proper ule and fine maxim of the art and by vhom one might see they put in practice nd though the contrivance for draw vhich have set down at the beginning re infallible yet ' tis much better to get aculty in the true and genuine art of it or if you have not to lupply this defect very peculiar genius and a extraordi¬ ary justness of eye and hand draw you iece as correctly as you may 's twill be iazard but they be spoil ' in the end and lave neither proportion nor beauty beause in the application of the colour you ery easily lose tne scroke and trace and to without great difficulty can ycu recoer they if you understand not something of draw earnestly exhort therefore will lover of painting to learn to draee corectly to copy indefatigably and with the greatest exactness good original in word to rise by easy and ordinary step to the perfection of this charming art the rule of which like all other be soon learn but that be not enough they must be put in execution the theory be useless without the practice and the practi without the theory be blind guide while lead we out of the way instead of cor duct we whether we would go but understand well what one would do and do well what one understand be the tr way to do and understand great deal time and of good scholar to become excellent master for what remain set not up for sul one and yet can asfure such perso as will take the trouble to enter into ti little school with some inclination at aptness to learn that they will have to repent it for though they shou stay in it with no pleasure believe at lear they would not go out of it without son considerable advantage choice receipt nstruction for the making and prepare of several fine colour and other thing requisite for painting in miniature the secret of a italian for the making of carmine and ultramarine oth can excell the colour make after the follow Ithods nor be any thing make with greater ease they have a inexpressible brightness and vivacity never change and be make at very little cost but tlie proof will do they more credit than all can say of em tis sufficient that lay down the method begin then with carmine steep pound of brasil wood of fe nambuca of the colour of gold fe three or four day in a earthen vessel pot of white winevinegar after havin break it well in mortar boil it half hour then pass or strain it through ver coarse linnen cloth and set it again upoi the fire take another little pot of whit winevinegar and in it steep or tempe eight ounce of allum put this allui temperd in the other liquor and stir about well with spattle the scuin froth that rise be you carmine take it off as it rise and let it dry the same may be do with cochineal instead brasil ultramarine take ten ounce of linseedoil pu it in a earthen pot or platter witl seven or eight drop of common water and then set and keep it on the fire till it be gin to boil to this put pound of white virgin 'wax break in small piece wher the wax be melt put in pound of greek pitchmixing with it four ounce of pow der mastick which must be melt befort in pot by it self with two ounce of turgentine let the whole boil for a hour and then let the composition drop into cold water and when it be of the consistence of butter it be do enough but if you find any hard callous bit in it tis sign the mastick be not melt enough and when you must put the composition again upon the fire the whole be do enough put labis lazuli in crucible upon the fire till it be as red as the fire it self then throw it into white winevinegar twill drink up the vinegar till it burst and reduce it self to little piece which must be beat to powder then incorporate this powder with little of the foremention ' composition the smallest matter possible and keep it thus for about fifteen day after which fix board bend little downward upon the edge of table it will be proper tohave channel or furrow cut in this board onder the board place glass receiver and put you blue paste on the top of the channel and over the paste fix vessel of water to distil drop by drop upon the paste and with the small end of sine polish 's stick assist the water to dilute the paste by stir and move it little to and for very genely the first zury which come off drop by drop be the bluest when it come off not so fine afterwards you must change you vessel to receive the second blue after which there come off third which be likewise of use and must be keep let these three sort of ultramarine dry then take and put they separately in little bag of white leaf for the making of carmine and ultramarine after different way likewise fine lake columbine green and other colour after several Ithods all proper for miniature carmine take three pint of springwater which have not pass ' through leadpipe pour it into glaz ' earthen pot and set it on the fire when it be ready to boil put in half or quarter of a ounce of the grain of cohan or dyer red which the feather dyer use reduc ' to fine powder then let it boil about three quarter rs of a hour or tiil the fourth part of ie water be consum but take care it coalfire after which strain this ater through linnen cloth into another gla'id vessel and heat it till it begin to oil then add to it a ounce of cochineal nd quarter of a ounce of arnatto both educ to powder serarately and set this mixture boil away to haif or in better etter term till it raise black scuin nd be very red for by means of boiling it ake colour take it off the fire and strew in it half a ounce or three pinch of pulveriz ' roachallum or of roman allum which be reddisn and better and half quarter of a hour after strain it through linnencloth into giaz ' vessel or else divide it in several little dutch or glaz ' porringer where let it settle for twelve or fifteen day and you will see on the surface mouldy skin which must be take off with sponge and the matter underneath expo to the air when the water at the top be evaporate dry the matter which rest at the bottom and grind it upon very hard and very smooth piece of marble or porphyry and then fift it through very fine searce observe that the quantity of these ingredient be not so fix to the proportion have lay do yn but that you may put in more or less of they at discretion according to the depth or degree of the colour ou desire if the carmine be to be redde hey put more arnatto if more of crim on they use more cochineal but all she be to be pulveriz ' separately ani he grain of cohan or dyer red be first boil alone and the other all together all bove ultramarine take half pound of lapislazulis and put it upon red hot coal and here let it stay till it be all over as red as tha coal themselves then quench it in very strong vinegar and grind it upon porphyry or any other stone that ' very hard vith rectify brandy the more you grincl the finer will be you ultramarine leu lie upon the porphry or in any vessel ill you have make the pastel with which thiet lapis be to be incorporate for the making of this take quarter of pound of bee wax quarter of pound of turpentine the same quantity of rosin and the same of linseedoil melt the whole together over slow fire and when begin to boil pour it into glaz 's pot this be the paste of ultramarine of which take quantity equal to that of the lapis and knead it together upon the porhyry or marble when they be well incorporate leave they for one night and afterwards to bring out the ultramarine which which be in this paste pour clear water upon it and knead it with you hand as paste be knead and the uitramarine will be out for the receive of which place porringer or other proper vessel under bur hand let it settle in this water you see the ultra marine at the eottemn of another take four ounce of linseedoil four ounce of new beewax four ounce the litharge of silver one ounce of roone ounce of mastic in drop four unce of burgundypitch two dram of frankincense and one dram of dragon 's blood beat small each of the dry ingreient in mortar separately then heat ie linseedoil in a earthen pan till it mmer then put in you other ingredinot 's one after another let the dragon 's blood be the last and stir the whole boût continually with stick this you aste will be do enough when it stick to we finger like glow at which time put on you lapislazuli have beforehand make it red hot in coalfire quench ' in white winevinegar ground it upen ne marble after drving it and sift it through one of the finest searce as say before when they be well incorporate and have be let alone for twenty four hour take springwater and no other and with this water knead you paf well you will see the first blue tinctui come cut which be the finest and best thus three time always kriead will spring water finally for the last operatioi take spewater and make it lukewarm with this knead the remainder of the con position take out the afh then pui ting both into a alembick and distillin they you wili find at the bottom the gol which be in the lapis some knead they paste all at once in vessel full of water lukewarm into whic go the ultramarine which they dry the sun they likewise leave the lapifor the space of month incorporate wit the paste before they draw anv ultramarin from it and pur in the paste instead linseedoil and turpentine oil of turpen tine only and black pitch instead of bur gundypitch for the lapis they heat quench it and grind it in the manner be fore shew fine lake ake pound of good brasil whic boil in three pint of lye make wit the ash of vinetwig till half the ly be consume let it settle and strain it then boil again what you have strain with fresh brasil with cocbineal and terre merita nerita there must be only a ounce mind when vou take this liquor off the fire again that you put in a ounce of alein allum beaten very small and dosolve it by stir it about with stick dding half dram of arsenic aftervard to give it à body take two ounce nf the sound or cuttlefispbone reduce it to powder and throw it in let this dey leisurely then grind it with great deal of water in which let it soak then strain through linnencloth after which make little cake of it which let dry upon pasteboard if you would have the lake edder put in zemonjuice and to make it darker add oil of tartar another lake take shred of scarlet and boil they in lye make with old lee of wine or with calein ' tartar this lye have the property of separate the dye from the scarletshred when it have boil ' long enough take it off and put in cocheneat powder mastic and little roachallum boil the whole again then strain it through fine bag twice or thrice quite hot the first time the bag must be squeez ' with two stick from top to bottom then take out the grof matter remain in the bag and wash it well strain the liquid matter which you press out with the stick again through the bag and you will find or the side of the bag paste which spreac upon pasteboard or divide into little portion upon paper and let it dry lake columbine take three pint of the finest distillc vinegar and pound of the fineft brasil of fernambuca which cut in smal piece and steep in the vinegar for above month at the least the longer the better afterwards seeth the whole in balneo maria till it boil up three or four tiny then let it settle day or two after which be prepare fourth part of powder 's allum and put it in very clean earthen pan and ' strain the liquor into the pan upon the allum then let it settle for one day heat the whole again till the liquor simmer and let it settle twenty four hour then prepare two bone of the sound or cutilefisb upon which pour you liquor which ought to be littie warm and stir it about with stick till it be cold afterwards let it settle hour then strain it observe you must strain it with the allum before you throw it upon the bone of the cuttlefish no make fine purplecolour of the gross part or sediment of lakecolumbine besides that make with carmine for oil and water colour take the sediment of lake columbine which fall to the bottom of the vial which be the bone of the cuttlefisb let it dry and grind it there be nosine lake so lively if you mix it with lake you will give the lake more strength and vigour lillygreen take the blewest flower of lilly separate the top of they which be silky and save only they for the rest be of no use and pull out the yellow fibre bruise in stone mortar the flower you have pick ' and when you have do that well throw three or four spoonful of water upon they more or less accord to you quantity of flower but you inust first dissolve à little allum and very little gum arabic in the water afterward grind the whole together very well then strain it through coarse linnencloth and put this juice in shell dry it in the air another way after you have pick and cleanse the flower bruise and put alumi water to they as just now say throvi lpon they little quicklime in powder in the manner they sugar sallet it haf the property to change they colour anc to purify they afterwards press out the juice into shell another and better way rruise allum and grain of avignon and mix they together with water then boil the whole upon the fire or upon hot ash till the water be yellow nexti bruise the lillyflower in mortar and pour upon they little of this yellowi water accord as you would make thef green lighter or darker afterwards strain the juice through bag or cloth make of goat 's hair for linnen take all the colour and pour it into large shell which set full in the sun for if they be place in the shade the green become mouldy and glewy another take leave of lris mince or chopthey very small and put they into glass or delft vessel or which be better into into brass or copper pot with powder illum and quicklime let the whole rot together for ten or twelve day and then be rotten press it into shell for that a blue colour may become green it that the flower putrify the green lave darker and more lively when only the leave be bruise and press immediately without let they rot after have strew powder allum upon thent another with violetflower green of the leave of march violet be make in the same way but you must have greater quantity of they and this green be darker than that of the iris but observe that instead of lime you may put the grain of avignon or dyer 's yellow bruise with allum tis much better than lime for change the blue into green green may likewise be make with the flower of pansy in the same manner sapgreen take small red seed of amomum and fill hog ' bladder with they put in little allum let it hang up in room some time and the seed corrup will change into this sort of green else take buckthorn berry beat they in amortar and throw to they little powdered allum then squeeze out the juice and put it in bladder tie it close and hang it up this green will harden in thei bladder dutchpink be generally make with spanisbwhite and the grain of avignon or dyer 's yelloo but it change when make of those thing tis better therefore to make it of whitelead or ceruse which must be ground very fine and temper ' upon porphyry of which it must be take with wooden spattle and let dry in the shady part ofa room afterwards take the grain of avignon or dyer tellow beat it to powder in amarble mortar with wooden pestle and boil it with water in lead earthen pot till about third or more be consume strain this decoction through linnencloth and put in it the quantity of two or three hazelnut of allum to keep it from change it be colour when it be dissolv ' temper the white with this decoction and bring it to the form of pretty thick pap of which knead it well between you hand make little ball or cake and put they to dry in very airy room when they be dry dilute they again with the same decoction and put they again to dry and thus do three or four time bezording as you would have the pink lighter or darker let it dry very well each time observe that the juice or decoction inust be hot when you temper the paste with it and that another decoction must be make when the first be turn ' and corrupt take care not to touch it with lron or steel but to use wooden spattle the right use of allum he best way to use ailum in lillygreen and other compoundcolour which change without this mineral salt be to beat it pretty smnall and put it in little water upon the fire for otherwise it will never dissolve weli this water you sprinkle on you flower or juice of colour but the less allum the better because it burn when there be too much to purisy vermillion innaber or vermillion be make of mercury and sulphur it must be cleansed from the impurity it have contract from these mineral which darken its lustre and make it turn now this purgation be do in the follow manner grind cinnaber in stone with pure water upon porphyry then put it in glass or delftvessel and let it dry afterwards put urinef to it and mix they in such manner that the urine penetrate all the cinnaber and cover it let the whole settle and the cinnaber be at the bottom turn out the urine and add fresn to it leave it all the night and continue to change the urine for four or five day till the cinnaber be well purg ' after that pour upon the cinnaber white of egg well beaten with fair water and so that the water cover the white mix the whole together with hazelstick and let it settle change the liquor twice or thrice as before and always keep the vessel close stand to keep out the dust which make the cinnaber turn or change and when you would make use of it temper it with gumwater for that will not change it another wax grind the cinnaber already in powder upon porphyry with child urine or with brandy and let it dry in the shade if you would take off its darkness and make it of brighter red infuse in brandy or in urine little saffron and with this liquor grind the cinnaber direction for the making very fine burnishd ggld the wood of the frame or of any other piece which you would gild inust be extremely smooth and to give it farther polish rub it over with the ear of seadog then smear it over twice or thrice with glow make of the clipping of white gloveleather and put on nine or ten lay of white whenit be quite dry sub it over with shavegrass to make it smoother and finer next warm little glow over the fire with water in which dip piece of very fine linnen first make very clean and pass it over the whiterthen apply two or three lay of goldcolour and more if it have not colour enougha when ' tis perfectly dry rub it stoutly with dry linnencloth till it glitter then pass large pencil dipt in the strongest brandy that be to be have over the goldccwe and let you leafgold be ready cutpon the leathercushion to lay on as soon you have pass ' the pencil over and when it be dry polish it with dog 's tooth to make gloveglow take pound of glover 's clipping put thein to steep in water some time then boil they in kettle with twelve quart of water till the water be consum ' to two quart then strain ii through linnen cloth into new earthen pan to know whether the glow be strong enough try when it be quite cold and have get it be consistence ifit be stiff and firm under the hand to make white for the ground gm he glow be make take white chalk and reduce it to powder with knife or grind it upon marble melt the glow and make it very hot then take it off the fire and put sufficient quantity of white in it to make it as thick as pap leave it to steep for half quarter of a hour and then stir it about with bristlebrush take some of this white and put more giew to it to make it brighter for the first and second lay which must be apply by beat with the end of the brush mind that you let each lay dry well before you put on another if ' tis wood you work on you must put on dozen if it be thick paper six or seven be sufficient this do take water dip soft brush in it and draining it with you finger rub you work with it to make it smoother when you brushi be full of white you must wash wash it again and change the water too when it be too white you may likewise sometimes make use of wet linnenrag in lieu of the brush you work be very even let it dry and when it be so rub it with shavegrass or à bit of new linnencloth to make it soft and free to make ground on which to gild and silver in another manner take quarter of pound of very choice and fine bole armoniac that stick upon the tongue and be greasy to the touch dissolve it in water and then grind it add the bigness of filberd of leadore and the bigness of peaof candletallow which prepare thus melt it then throw it into cold waterand finger it about in the water and it will be fit for use the bigness of pea be enough for one grind as you grind you may add little soapsud to the bole armoniac when this composition be ground put it in fair water which change from time to time in order to preserve it when you would use it temper it with melt glow somewhat warm and if the glow be as strong as that you have white ' with add third part of water and mixit it with the bole armoniac to the consistence of cream then apply it with pencil upon you work put three or four lay and let each lay dry very well before you apply another when it be all dry before you gild or silver it rub it à little with sost linnenrag to lay on the gold and silver set the piece you would gild or silver over in recline posture and wet any one place with pencil dipt in fair water then lay on you gold have cut it before upon leathercushion it must be take up with cotton or large pencil when all be gild let it dry but not in the sun or in the wind and when it be dry enough polish it with dog 's tooth to know whether it be dry paf the tooth little over some place if it do not slide easily but tear the work off it be sign it be not dry but on the other hand take care it be not too dry for this make it harder to polisn and take away from it be lustre in very hot weather three or four hour be sufficient to dry it but sometimes it bequire day and night to deaden gold make fine lively red with redlead little vermillion and the white of a egg well beaten grind all together upon marble and put some of it in the deep place with very finepencil to dedden silver take ceruse and grind it with water then temper it with fish or gloveglow the first be the best tis apply with pencil on the placc to be deaden to make shellgold and sbellsilver lay leafgold more or less accordling to the quantity you would make upon very clean marble grind it with new or clear honey till it be extremely soft under the grind stone then put it in glass of fair water and stir it about and change the water till it remain clear get pennyworth or so of strong water put you gold in it and let it steep there two day then take it out and the strong water may serve again the method be the same sor silver when when you would lay either of they of you must temper they with water littl gum and to sleek and smooth they th better let it be soapsud tis proper als to put under the gold wash of gallstone twill appear the finer for it you inust lay but tle least geld and sil ver that can be uron piece in miniature except for fillet and girdle becaus this look affect and give they gaud theatrical air some some general instructive lesson for the art of draw the ingenious author of the preceed little but valuable treatise have lay down several rule for delineating or copy picture or print by such as could not draw know very well that the performance of the former would be very deficient without the practice of the lattera and he recommend it as the surest way to excel in that charming art of painting in miniature of which he have so freely and ingenuously give such fulland plain instructionsa it be to be admire that most person from they infancy have fondness for picture and child love to busy themselves with draw draw colour and handling pencil but this fondness for the generality wear off by degree and be by most quite neglect the chief reason of which as presume be the trouble and pain they apprehend will attend the acquisition thereof it be certain ' that every one be not endue with disposition or natural inclination to that ingenious art nor can it be attain ' by labour and pain without genius but such as find they lelve dispose should by all means come to resolution to attempt the practice thereof parent therefore would do well to watch and observe diligently the inclination of they child and find that by instinct they shew natural genius and capacity for ingenuity when of they own accord they will take delight in draw shadowing and finish any thing they attempt to copy and seem to take pride in they performance they should by all means be encourage and be instruct by good master in the best manner in the fundamental rule and precept requisite to be know in the progress and practice ofeither draw design or painting it frequently happen that bright genius a artist bear have no opportunity to receive the instruction of master or be by distance in the country deprive of the conversation with artist nd ingenious practitioner he only way then to furnishi himself with such book that may guide he in he pursuit after that knowledge he so fondly aim at and for the benefit of such these lesson be intended not doub they will meet with the same encouragement and reception by the ingenious as the preceed work viz the art of painting in miniatare have do so which fourth edition have add these instructive leslon for the art of draw briefly plain and casy as possible ii such as intend to make themselves compleat in the art of draw should first learn the principle of geometry and perspective and there by inform they mind of true symetry and proportion this be subject to be meet with in book write by skilful artist for that purpose shall for brevity sake omit enlarge upon it the common rule for beginner be commonly to draw the particular member of the body of man and first of all the face or head be attempt by draw a oval or the shape of a egg with the several dimension of the cross by which learner may understand the better to express the turning and motion of the face in the different attitude hereafter exemplify to this oval for the head or face belong the eye eyebrow nose mouth anot ear and to place they in they propek situation the cross be draw for thal purpose after you have form a oval draw perpendicular down the middle this cross again in the middle with diametrical line which you divide in five equal part each be the breadth of one eye this be call the ocularline on which you place the eye and be with the perpendiculara which go from the top of the forehead through the middle of the nose mouth and chin call the cross upon which thef eye nose mouth and ear be to bej place in they proper situation as you may observe in fig but for the better apprehension of such as be unacquainted with the use of the cross in the oval ors with the many variation of the same as in turning and motion of the head a experiment have be find to make the use of the crof more plain and intelligible which be this have piece of wood turn in the shape of a egg as in fig then draw line from point to point lengthways through the midst of the egg as in fig divide this in two equal part by cut right angle as you see fig have draw the eye nose mouth in they proper place you may by the position of the egg see the declination or inclination of face and accord to the position of fig you will see it front turn the lgg or oval little from the left to the right the straight perpendicular of the cross will change and present itself in a arch as in fig becording to which you project the nose beyond the round of the oval and place the rest of the member of the face in they proper line as in fig the same be to be observe in turn the figure of the oval the contrary way as in fig again the oval inelining downward the cross will appear as in fig and the face look down as in fig the oval be turn backward the crof will change again as in fig and face draw accord to thole line will appear like fig after this manner you may form variety of face except those which be sideways which be commonly draw by means of perpendicular as you see in fig upen which vou place the forehead nose mouth and chin let they be in what disposition they will see fig be the necessary rule for designng or draw face which if well observe and practise will in little time furnisn learner with lively idea to draw face with good judgment and give they masterly stroke and touch of which otherwise by meerly draw or copy after print he would have be unacquainthave advanced and mount the first step and the young practitioner be well grounded in draw the oval andj face he may then exercise himself to copyl with great care and diligence after goodf draught and print the former be the most proper for such as intend to exercise the art of painting and the latter fori such as propose to practice etch or grave beginning with such as be easy and go forward to such as be more difficult and have arrive to some perfection in this he may adventure to copy after painting and to contract large picture into small observe due proportion and by diligent practice he will accustom heself to guef well and acquire free and sure hand in design next to this young practitioner may venture upon copying after figure of plailter of paris which be more difficult than either draw after print or painting and shall be more fully treat of in its pro¬ per place the best pattern to draw or copy after be life itself or all natural thing here a artist have large field to range in and he need never be idle but may always find innume rable subject to improve he talent which can not be better do than by diligence and application now come to the practice of the art of draw itself and first of draw after draught prinit or picture you must arst of all observe to fix you principal in proper light so as to see it distinct and plain place it at proper distance according to the largeness of the picture or draught vou design to copy put it straight before you and not flat for then you would see it foreshorten the paper you draw upon fix five or six double on board hold that on you knee with which you elevate it as high as you would have it thus you will the better compare you draught with the principal before you which otherwise in case you draught lay flat you could not do so well thus be fix for to begin you piece guess firstthe middie of the picture or whatever you intend to copy after and make mark with you coal in the middle on you paperfrom this mark you will guel at the pro¬ per distance of the figure disperse in the piece if there be more than one and by take heed of the capital stroke with free and slight touch you will soon see whether the position of you figure be just leave the small breaking or parting to the next draw and thus by patience and practice you will not only readily but also judicioussy attain with delight to you purpose have make rough sketch examin whether the disposition and action of the figure answer those in the princi pal before you correct and amend suc part as you see amiss by add or take off ' till you find it answer you purpose and have make thus rough sketch you may proceed and draw it neater and better ob serve the various turning that represen themselves either in the action or drapery take heed not to make the first sketch worse or spoil it by be about to make in better which may soon happen if due cari be not take in preserve that disposition you approve of before and have thus the second time draw you sketch over with charcoal examine and correct it after the principal and suffer not fault to pass without correction for it will be more for you honour to make one good draught than a hundred without observation or judgment in this case it be proper for a artist to divert himself between while by read mufick or look over of print then take fresn view of he performance and examine it he may discover fault he do not see before in draw after figure of plaister of paris you must choose proper light the room you draw in should be large and iave light northward so high that the jhade which you figure make upon the bround be equal or little less than the height of you figure you be to draw after you may also draw conveniently by the lamp which some artist prefer before daylight because the shade appear more strong and sharp for this purpose they hang lamp at convenient height well pro vide with oil and diver wick and to prevent the light spread itself too much but remain more constant they put some oil paper through which the light cannot shine behind it and thereby it spread the stronger upon the model they copy set yourself from the figure you be to draw three time as far as it be high in such manner that you eye may in straight line behold the model hanging plumbline before it and have draw perpendicular line on you paper you observe what come either on the one side or other to you view and then make rough sketch of the position of the figure in the best manner you be able what have here say of draw after plaister of paris paris by the lamp be not to be observen in general for as it cast strong and hari shade they be judge not so natural a sweet as those cause by the light of day and be therefore not approve of by th generality of experienc artist and case they do draw by the lamp they pu frame with oil paper between the mei del and the light and there by break tha harshness of the shade you must set alsi white or gray paper behind the model that you may perceive the reflexion the better vi such as would make further progre and improvement in draw must ne cessarily study anatomy especially as far it relate to the muscle a artist have the fundamental knowledge in this study will soon apprehend the regular motion the member in the human body wher otherwise he will be in the dark and noi able to give any reasen or distinction why this or that muscle be in either this or thai position swell or contraction the muscle which be the principal cause of the changeable motion or posture of the whole body be chiesly these those behind the hip those of the loin of the back those of the throat the muscle of the shoulder those of the breast begin at the nipple ind end at the small of the belly all he motion and change of which may be observe from the life to which refer the practitioner but before he attempt this he will do well to draw first after anatomical figure many of which be extant in copperplate print and then after such as be cast in plaister of paris by which mean and the reading of anatomical lecture upon the muscle he soon will form right judgment and idea in draw he figure to perfection and in they regular posture and motion vii ature or the life be compleat in all thing and to imitate the meanest production of nature require à masterly hand this may invite we to chuse she for we pattern and chief object to draw after this can not be better put in execution than for to chuse company of ingenious ycung man with whom young beginner jointly may spend one or two day in week under the instruction of a able master to draw after life that be to say after naked strong and robust man of broad shoulder fair breast very well muscle thick thigh long leg and of proportionable size and have put this you model in the posture you have agree on and furnish thei room with proper light such as have be describe under the nfth article yot proceed to copy every one to he besi skill without despise one another ' performance but rather instruct and encourage each other with modesty and gooc manners for stand action the person draw by be commonly place on the ground but when sit or lie it will be proper to have he place on table at convenient height viii it be customary for beginner as well as able master to draw with charcoal it be the easiest rub out again in cafe of fault other make use of blacklead with which they draw the outline and afterward finish they piece either with crayon or other thing they be use todraw withbut this be more fitter for experiene ' master than young practitioner the several way make use of in finishing draught depend upon the choice of the artist some use red chalk other black chalk other draw with pencil which be call wafh and be do with several sapcolour as indian ink bistre or chimney soot of wood smoke ground inground red chalk and the like other again finish they piece with writing pen which way be the most tedious and not to be recomniend but to such as intend to practice grave on copperplate some use pen make of reed and many great master have draw figure with they in bold stroke some chuse charcoal dipp ' in linseed oil but this must be use quickly and readily and be only fit for large thing other make use of tobaccopipe clay wherewith they draw on blue or other colour paper and heighten the light with white chalk of this tebaccopipe clay be also make crayon or pastil of various colour with they different shade and they be thus do take tobaccopipe clay and witha little water temper it with what colour you please work it well togethe roll it into pastil and lay they on clean paper to dry some will put gum or size in the water but then the crayon commonly prove hard and become useless these be the common method practitioner make use of in finish they draught most of they chuse paper some indeed prefer parchment and other thing but white paper have be approve of by most artist for sketch hatch and wash with all sort of watercolour crayon indeed be best manage on blue or any other coloured paper learner should in draw afterk draught follow the manner of they principal that in so do they may bel accustem to it all they lifetime if you hatch with pen take heed to avoid scratch endeavour to make the stroke free and bold beginning from the fine or sharp end to the broad some flat and equal shade must be draw with equal hatch let they be sine or coarse in draw with crayon hold you pastil straight forward and they will not so soon become blunt for turn they beveen you finger they will wear and yet keep they pcint continvally so that you may draw whole draught without scrapeing you pastil rousling be also practise by some and differ not much from hatch only to make it look close and blend one in anothe it must be dosl with some cotton fix in goose quill when in this man¬ ner you begin to shadow you draught do it first faint smooth and even so as it may appear as if wash wich pencil then you shade you draught in the darkest place with hatching in graceful and masterly manner thus by hatch and dosling the one upon the other you will accustom youself to masterly hand in draw this sort of dosling or hatch be do with either red or black chalk instead of cotton some make use of hair pencil that be ing blunit at candle as much as this manner of draw be admire by some can not recommend it for it make the workmanship hard stiff and occasion break in the slat part except it be in sinall and curious pieca the custom of great master have be to use but one thing in they hand at once oy which they have compleate the draught without use cotton or the likz however if one design to make something curious and nice the afbresaid maaner of dosling will not be amiss only would not have the practitioner accustom himself to it altogether if one draw counterseit especially upon coloured paper let he smooth the edge of the heightenings with the like coloured paper roll ' up to sharp point at one end with this ou may sweeten or soften the edge so as to appear neither too hard nor sharp there be singular manner some artist use of wash perform with pencil dipt in ink or any other sapcolour and so pencil ' on all sort of either white or coloured paper they wash therewith in any draught the principal shade and afterwards work over they slightly with pen or black chalk this be geod masterly manner and look exceedingly well in wash you must observe to lay on first the soit and faint shade smoothing the edge with clean pencil moisten littie with you tongue when this be dry go over the darker shade with deeper colour thus you preceed with third and fourth shade till you see you draught perfect always rake heed not to make ycur work too hard at first the faint shade especially on coloured paper must be imperceptibly lose since the heighten with white will help you there be two property necessary to be understand in the art of draw the one be general the other particular all thing compose consist of certain part which together carry on correspondencethey make general mass or lump and be by we sight distinguissied either in general or particular if then vou draw either after print picture or life observe the general form represent to you which consist of several part examine whether it be round square triangular lonc or short and this be best observable with a half shut eye without observe the part as be contain in the general for example suppose head compleatly finish the circumferent stroke constitute ute the general mass the eye nose mouth be the particular contain in the general the question be whether this face may be know by the part in particular or all the part in the circumferent stroke shall answer this with the follow example suppose two face be draw with something that may be easily wip ' off very like each other wipe the circumferent stroke of one face clean away so that nothing remain but the sinall part as the eye nose mouth and you will presently find that the likeness of the faze be gohe or ifabout those particular part you draw anocher circumferent line differ from the former you will behold another likeness in the face much differ from what it have before by this it appear plainly that the part themselves do not represent themselves in they be before they be join to they general outstroke as these particular part be observe in the general of the head the same be to be take notice of in the arm hand leg and foot for although in respect to the whole body they be but part yet in theinselves they be general to the part they contain as the arm have its muscle the bend of the elbow the hand have they finger and finger again they member and so on in the saie manner be the knowledge of thing hide in the generality of all for let man whom we know very well be at some reasonable distance so that we can not know he by some small part as by he eye whether brown or gray neither he great or small nose he red or pale face nor any other small part of he body notwithstand we shall knowthis man at this distance by what mean by means of the general for thegeneral lump see by vou even when he back be turn upon you will make you presently know he x i now come to say something concern the nature and virtue of light and shade there be no thing in nature which can be distinguished by we in lesser or further distance from we nor can it be express by the art of draw without this knowledge for without dark and light nothing resemble what it ought to do for it be that which give be and re¬ presentation to all thing to prove this draw counterfeit upon white paper with black chalk when finish it be like the person and judge to be well draw here it may be ask what correspondence have black chalk wherewith you make you shade and the white paper by which the light be represent with the original that be life to which answer it be not the black chalk nor the white paper nor any single stroke draw but it be the effect ofthe light and shade in they proper place that represent life itself to we for it be impossible that either round circle or spot of flat colour should represent globe except the roundness be give it by light and shadow x ii young practitioner or learner should by all means use themselves to the best manner of draw that be to finish they work plain smooth neat and ' easy to blend the shade and light so as to be lose the one in the other this they must endeavour by indefatigable pain and although in the beginning it will seem difficult and they performance displeasing yet let not this discourage they from pursue they aim for none be bear master andhe that never do do ill can not expect ever todo well one day bring on another and with it some amendment till you arrive to perfection which will be reward for all the labour and pain you have take in the acquisition of this charming art xiii picture or draw that want perspective be lock upen as irrational and dead wheresore shall inform the young practitioner what it be and how to attain the knowledge of that science so necessary in design and painting perspective be that which cause all thing contain in draught or picture to come florward or sink backward and cause they from the first to the last to stand in they due and proper place as also the vacuum or emptineis between body and body to no from you or come forward naturally to the eye as though it be accessible and as real perspective shew the distance which every arch or pillar have the one after the other as also the standing of people in they proper and singular place so likewise in draught or picture by the diminution of light and dark the distance must be observe agreeable to the appro¬ priat declination and every draught or picture whether after nature or plaister of paris you must well observe what appeareth forward or backward and how one thing follow another this be one of the most difficult study belong to the art of draw and painting wherefore practitioner ought to inforin himself in time either by the instruction of master or by reading of book of perspective xiv have go through the principal property belong to the art of draw it will now be requisite to sum up what have be say for make you work compleat and perfect in you rough sketch observe to bring in good spirit free and pleasing to the first view correct the first rough draught in the draw it over again and accustom yourself in represent the shadow and touch with the coal in order to be certain in the position of you figure have compleate you design as far as relate to the use of charcoal then draw with either you pen or pencil with diligo care the qutline endeavour to keep or bring in all the beauty comeliness and gentility of the figure take particular care and diligence to obselve and keep the bending and motion of the body and the easy displaying of the foloing of garment in they comeliness and genteel disposition for it often happen that by small bend whole part of pigure be entirely spoil this be fault youth be much addict to by observe those sinall bending too much which they commonly make toobig and there by deprive piece of that beauty which with little precaution they might have preserve and this put I in mind to caution young practitioner not to rely so much on the particular but the general as have observe already in the xth article for in be too attentive in finish and observing the little and insignificant part you lose that which ought to make the most shew of masterly performance therefore let you chiefest care be to observe and finish the general part to pe rfection for the small or particular one may be put in afterwards with more ease this be a article highly necessary for young practitioner tobe instruct in but to the shame of they teacher most of they be keep ignorant in this particular thus some painter will take abundance of pain to draw face near at hand with all it be deformity if it have any as pit of the small pox scar spot and the like when otherwise at convenient distance they might have the general with the particular in more agreeable appearance than it then gepresent itsell and that with less pain and trouble but this be the case with many pretender in the art of painting that they can not draw portraiture to be any gh like except they bring in all the mark wrinkle when vou draw with red or black chalk take heed you stroke be not hard or too sharp especially in the light part in the strong shady part you may carry bold stroke always observe that in the shadowing of you piece the stroke lose and va rnish away so that one might judge as if you have finish you piece without drawing the circumference or out line for thus it will be agreeable to nature where no stroke can be see this you may observe in picture as well as in good print or drawing it will happen that in draw between white and white and against the light stroke or qut line must be draw for to express the draught and distinguish it from the ground especially when draw on white paper but this you should endeavour to shun as much as possible and not do it except necessity compel you to it and you have no other means leave to avoid it but as can not here speak of all the cause incident to this case will only exemplify one for the better apprehension of young practitioner by the two face in the opposite print the face as you plainly perceive be draw compleat with a outline stroke and the face only represent the shadow that be underneath the nose mouth the question be whether a error be commit in the face which might by the outline of the face be amend for my part say no but on the contrary observe in the face ba singular curiosity and beauty where white against white makesy termination without circumferent stroke apprehend well this example you will improve it in you drawing and gain thereby singular and accomplish manner what have say on this head be to be observe with due caution for as rough sketch only consist in circumferent line or stroke nevertheless dexterity give it singular beauty you may by this rule apprehend how to work on coloured paper where by the heightnings you may do much and save many stroke you be oblige to express on white paper x v now come to the finish part here you must not childishily or apishly imi¬ tate stroke for stroke but observe the intent of the master in he expression doposition shade and light in he figure if vou draw face after picture or aster life observe the passion and phfiognomy thereof take notice by what stroke touch turning shade or otherwise such face be make to look sorrowful or merry cry or laugh old or young wild or modest foul or clean homely or beautiful and by observing this you will not only follow the same stroke stroke touch and shade as near as possible to express the same action and passion but also you will retain the same in you mind and understand it with well grounied knowledge when you begin to finish you draught take heed you inake not the shade at first so hard or deep as they must be when finiss you may easily bring they to be darker but net so to make they lighter acquire good judgment in dispose you shade so that they may fling thing either backward or forward for whatever vou draw with let it be red lead indian ink black chalk you must express one extream dark or light and therefore accustom yourself ' from you beginning to draw to shadow very light and sweet faint and even and bring in the perspective of darkness as much as possible and by observe this vou will find yourself seldom deceive but gain honour and applause by you performance be careful to keep you draught in one even and equal condition so that it may not appear as if compose of dark and light spotbut let the light and shade correspond and agree together the lesser dark with the faint and the faint with stronger light otherwise you work will presently incline to hardness and stiffness which if you examine life you will never meet with there when you draw on coloured paper after print or draught observe the evenf likeness of dark and light keep the great part of light and shadow and the imall intermixt part in the same manner that the greater may always have the predominancy over the less shall conclude with advise vo practitioner to observe in all they performance true symetry and proportion especially in all the part of human figure let they first well be master of every particular for it be the or alphabet which when well learn be easily join together into word and he who can delincate well the eye nose mouth ear yc will readily form well proportion face and after he have use himself to draw hand arm leg he will easily cempile whole body there be indeed several eminent painter who have in they writings endeavour to teach young practitioner the art of true proportion and symetry by geometrical and perspective rule how to form a oval out of circle perpendicular into square accord as the one or other object be represent itself to one eye but as this way of proceeding be havery tedious and likely to deter young beginner fertil genius will like many other great master advance in he performance by more easier step and form true idea in he conception of nature in relation to the true symetry of the human body it be to be admtred that from the dimension of toe or finger the whole corporeal substance may be demonstrate so that three sculptor in three different place have agree on the true measure of the height may work on one statue and when the limb be bring and fix together will make perfect image accord to art man that be well proportion be eight time as high as he head that be from the hair of he forehcad to he chin he face be three nose long and he foot be one fifth of he length it would seem incredible to some people do they own experience not convince and satisfy they curiosity without any cost or charge that thread which reach three time about the end of the middle finger should be just so long as totake in the compass of one wrist and that six time of that length be the measure about one waste over the navel this may be easily try by wind thread six time about the wrist and then measure the waste thread which go round one forehead will also reach from the chin behind the neck and it be remarkable that by extend one hand and arm as far as one can the two end of the middle finger will determine one height and man place in that posture will describe quadrant whole centre be the privy

they understand best the management of they tool of light and the usefulness of harmeny as it relate to claro ofcuro which of they in they operation reconcile delicacy and force best and in they production be most senfible and exact that make good use of these light they may have the laudable ambition to equal or surpass these skilful master for the curious in history and antiquity every

exercise they reason and strengthen they judgment they may sill they memory with the most curious thing of all time and all country and in learn the different history learn the several manners of painting they will judge readily by the facility with which they may open few leave and so compare the production of one master with those of another and by this means in spa¬ ring they time they will spare they expence also for it be almost impossible to put the picture of as many master together in room as will suffice to form perfect idea of the work of each master and when at vast charge man have sill large chamber with ' icture of different manners he can not have above two or three of each which be not enough to enable he to make à nice judgment of the character of the painter or the extent of he capacity whereas by means of print one may easily see the work ofseveral master on table one may form a idea of they judge by compare they one with another know which to chuse and by practise it often contract habit of good taste and good manner especially if we do it in the company of any body that have discernment in these thing and can distinguisn what be good from whât be but indifferent such as have any paffion for the fine art take regular method in they collection they do it by the painter and they disciple in the roman school they place raphael michael angelo they

benefit one self by the sight of print yet youth be more proper for it than any other part of man ' life because memory be the gift of childhood and while person be young they ought to make use of it as magazine to lay up thing that may contribute towards form they judgmerit if the ancient have have the same advantage in this as we have and if they have by means of the print transmit what they have do that be fine and curious to posterity we should have dist inctly know know abundance of thing of which we have but confufe idea in history we should see the stately monument of memphis and babylon and the temple of jerusalem which solomon build with so much magnificence we should make judgment of the building of athen corinth and old rome with mare grounds and with more certainty than we now can by thepoor remains that be leave of they pausanius who lias make such a exact description of greece would have accompanie he discoury with demonstrative figure which might have be hand down

of these means that the manchine of archimed and the elder hiero be lose and the knowledge of dioscoride 's plant as also of several finimal and of great many of the curious production of nature which
