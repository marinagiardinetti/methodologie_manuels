imitate by lay fome leaf gold on the shade side of the draw give little to the light side to lay on the gold leaf press it fmooth and clofe with cotton after you have wath it with ffrong gum water but in this part of the performance care muft be take that in lay on the gum you do not exceed the li mit through which you would have the gold ap pear in this cafe the gold be only to thine through the tranfparent colour which be to be lay over it as leaf gold will not receive water colour re gularly it be neceffary that the student should be prepare with water of ox gall and with this li quor to htroke over the ggold leaf by which mean it will receive any colour you be defirous of lay over it and will alfo retain it the red may be lake or carmine the purple lake and fine in digo the green verdigreafe or sap green and for the bly indigo on the dark side and little ultramarine on the light all which colour shall be defcribe in they proper place in june and july there may be find upon

when it be dry rub it with cotton and burnish it with dog toothy and it will by this means appear as if it be really caft in gold there be alfo another way of work in gold which be perform by shell gold but then it muft be pure and not that bring from germany which turn green in few day you muft cover the fhady part with vermilion before you ufe this gold and when you have rectify it with spirit of wine lay it on and when dry burnith it as be fore direct in lay on this gold it be beft to leave the light without it as it will appear to much greater advantage than if all the object be cover but provide the whole performance should chance to be cover the beft way of fet it off be to trace over the fhady part with gall ftone or the fellow make of french berry of which we shall treat hereafter and heighten with minium have treat thus much upon gold we shall ow peak of fellow in general gamboge be be you doubt one of the melloweff colour nature have produce it be of of mild temperature that when it be touch with any fluid it inflantancoufty diffolve to that confequently it want neither summ nor grind it be productive of van riety of the moft agreeable and pleafant vellow pint that fancy

that if you cut the root root of barberry and put they into frong lixivium make of pearldaffy and water from they will proceed very agreeable vellow this experiment have often be make and as often at tend with success he alfo give a account of another fine trant parent fellow make by boiling the root of mulberry tree well cleanfe in the forego lixivium this will produce yellowith juice from which liquor much deeper than the former may be extract fellow oker make very good pale yellow and be ground with gum water will prove ex tremely ufeful another very ufeful vellow may be make by in fule the plant celandine in clear water and gently preffing it and add to the liquor some allum water and then let it boil the virtue of the yellow make of french ber rie be of well know that we need not difcourfe upon it but only give the student the follow direction for prepare it quart of the precede lixivium boil two in of french berry till the liquor be of fine fellow then ffrain it from the yellow berry and when it be cold it be fit for ufc then to the berry put pint of the fame lixivium and boil it till the liquor be as ffrong as gall ftone with which you may shade any yellow this you may boil till it come to brown and will with the addition of little ox gall ferve to shade the gold leaf you may likewife make yellow by infufe saffron in pure water which produce bright rich fellow when this be ffeep in rectify spirit of wine there be nothing higher but it be very apt to hy unless it be high gum good yellow for the illumination of print may be extract from the root of ginger which make good green when mix with tranfparent verdi greafe thofe yellow call english and dutch pink be make with french berry ground to fine pow der and then boil of orance colour this colour be make of mixture of vermilion and gamboge the latter moft predominant in which you be prefent with pleafant and service able colour in painting lilly and all other orange colour flower what induce we

the glass beautiful ed when it be dry which be to be ufe with crum water when the colour have be thus prepare you muft not expect above twenty grain to remain out of four ounce carmine afford the brighteff and moft perfect crimfon and be the moft beautiful of all red for with this colour and lake you may make the shade as frong as you pleafe but we think it neceffary to inform the student that this colour should never be purchafe but by day light for if it be not good it will but fpoil you work lake be fine tranfparent colour not much in ferior to carmine but in painting with carmine on

and quarter of a inch thick and then roll it into crayon second brown take some spanith brown grind it well with water to which add in the grind ing fome fuller earth which will very much en lighten it the spanish brown be of itfelf very dark colour this be do when dry beat it into powder again and divide it into four different parcel to three of which put round of starch in different degree of that you may preserve feveral shade of colour mix each of thefe feparately into pafte with little size of kinglass or pale ale wort boil or thick water cruel wherein gum dragon have be diffolve and to make it into paf til or crayon accord to the former direction third brown take some indian red and spa nith brown and grind they together with you stone and muller and mix they with ale wort till they be as fliff as pafte of this colour you may make different shade by add more of lef white which may be either of the aforemention colour green firff green provide yourfelf with some diffil verdigreafe and grind it with ffrong vinegar with and muller after which wath it well with water the manner of which be as follow pat the verdigreafe into water and let it remain there about minute then pour the water off into cup and let it fettle then pour that from it and wath it again in the same manner and when it be dry make it into paffil of different shade with ground white chalk second green take some of the beft verdi greafe and boil it with fharp vinegar and while it be boiling add to it little powder tartar which be of of sharp nature will foon diffolve the ver= digreafe and you will have the liquor of very fine colour forewhat inclinable to blue then fet the liquor in small gallipot and let it be expofe to the airy and it will foon be congeal and become hard then mix it with as much ale wort as will bring it to paffe and of into paftil or crayon as before direct third green prepare verdigreafe after the same manner as the laft then reduce it and divide it into feveral parcel to which add pruffian blue in different proportion as you would have they lighter or darker and to the lighteff part add little white chalk or little straw colour to variegate the shade as much as poffible mix all thefe with pale ale wort boil as before direct fourth green grind fome blue bice very fine and in the grind add to it fome of the beft durch pink divide they into feveral part and

many shade as you defire bring they into paffe with pale ale wort mix with size make accord to that receipt prefcribe at the end of the direction for painting in water colour and then cut they into length and roll they into paf til or cravon as at firft direct sixth green grind rock indioo with water pon yourstone then divide it into parcel more or less as you think proper and add dutch pink in fuch different quantity as will produce feveral shade after thefe be well incorporate make they into pafte with boil ale wort and roll they into paftil accord to the former direction the artiff will find thefe crayon far preferable to thofe generally buy at shop and for this reafon they be frequently temper to high with gum water rendersthem of fliff and obdurate that they will too often rather fcratch than give any appearance of colour upon you paper on the contrary thofe which we have here recommend may be ufe with all the eafe and freedom imaginable and will ex press the diverfity of colour as pleafantly and agree able as can be defire when the student be defirous of make draw ing in crayon either from nature or from cor reet imitation of nature he should be caseful before he begin that he have every colour that be in he original as he can not here as in painting either in water er oil colour prepare colour at warning which confideration it be that induce we to direct to many shade to be make from each colour the arciff in order to keep he colour feparate for if they mix it will on account of they soft ness be very prejudicial to they should be prepare with box which contain as many partition as will keep each shade by itfelf
