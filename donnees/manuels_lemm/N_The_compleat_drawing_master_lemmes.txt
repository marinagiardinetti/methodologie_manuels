the compleat draw  master contain many curious specimen as the several part ofthe human body whole figure landskip cattle building neatly engrave on copperplate after the design of the greatest master wherein the principle of draw be lay down after natural and easy manner to which be prefix ' some general instruction to form the judgment of young beginner by which that useful art may be attain in short time without master tain in short time without master london print for henry parker opposite birchin  lane cornhill mdcc . lxiii the compleat draw  master the principle or draw or draw in general draw be the art of represent the ap pearance of object by imitation or express by line and shade the form or appearance of any thing in nature or art the copying of another draught or any design conceive in the mind and all this without the assistance of man thematical rule the art of draw be a accomplishment not more ele gant agreeable and ornamental than useful be therefore by no means to be neglect in the education of youth wherein any genius or inclination that way be discover besides its being of all other art the most universally admire and esteem there be few other art or profession to which it be not assist its great use be not confincd to painter engraver gardener embroiderer er weaver and many other concerned in design but the mathematician engineer architect and navigator daily practise it all design and model be execute in it its use appear in every station of life and it be equally admire by child and by adult to be able on the spot to take the sketch of fine building or beautiful prospect of any curious production of art or uncom mon appearance in nature be not only very desirable accomplish ment but very agreeable amusement rock mountain field wood river cataract city town castle house fortifi cation ruin or whatever else may present itfelf to view on we journy or travels in we own or in foreign country may be thus bring home and preserve for we future ufe either in bu finess or conversation this art transmit to we view thing that be long since past or would otherwise perish represent to we the deed of people and nation for many age dead and pre serve the feature and resemblance of ancestor or other valu able perfon for many generation it be therefore no wonder that a attainment so universally useful and admire should be do tinguish as one of the highest embellishment of human life and be patronize and cultivate by all the denerous and ingenious part of mankind chap ii general rule for draw begin with plain gcometrical figure as line angles tri angles polygon arch circle oval cone cylinder and the like be the fundation of all other proportion the circle be of use in the several orbicular form as the sun moon globe che oval in give just proportion to the face and mouth and the square confines picture you be to copy the triangle be of use in draw side or half face angles and arch in perspective and the polygon in ground  plat fortifica tion the cone in spire steeple top of tower the cylinder in column pillar have bring you hand to be fit and ready in general propor tion accumstom yourself to give every object it be due shade be cording to its concavity or convexity and to elevate or depress the same as the object appear either nearer or farther off the light before you begin to work view you original with close attention divide it in you mind into several part observe the length the breadth and the similitude of cach part consider they proportion to each other and to the whole the distance from one part to the other and what part lie opposite to each other after you have do you copy view it afresh by compare it with the original for the discover and amending of fault as it will not only serve to perfect you in that particular draught but will improve you knowledge of line and proportion in general and in time enable you for the nearest imitation the out  line must be draw in glide manner large and smooth which will give they the resemblance of life and motion you muft preferve in you draught strong refemblance between the part and the whole every member ought to be make to agree strong limb have no relation to consumptive body or decay old age and the eye leg hand and foot should be exactly pair have good copy to draw after learn to reduce they to other proportion either larger or smaller and this by frequent practice in draw fruit as apple pear cherry with they leave herb tree of different kind as also in the imi tation of beast fowl fish it be requisite not only to be per fect in lay down the exact proportion but before you procce to the shadow and trimming you work to be well acquainted in the general or outward line and this be still more necessary in imi tate the body of man with all its lineament as head nose eye ear cheek arm and shadow as also in the drapery and imitation of the clothing and the artificial setting off ihe outward covering habit or ornament of the body in they natural and pro per fold chap iii particular direction for draw in draw after picture or print you must take care to place it in such light that the gloss of the colour may not interrupt you view but so that the light and you eye may fall equally and obliquely upon the piece to this end you be to consider from what point and in whar direction the light false upon the object accord to which direction let all you light and shade be piac throughout the work that part of the object must be lightest which have the light most directly opposite to it if the light fall sideways on pour picture you must make that side wlich be opposite to it lightest and on the contrary that side which be farthest from ir darkest let the piece be place be such do tance that upon open you eye you may view it all at once and the larger the picture be it should be so much the more place off at the greater distance but right before you and little recline draw all you out  line at firit very faint with coal which may easily be rub out again with the feather of duck wing or crumb of bread and these out  line should be draw true and agreeable to the pattern before you begin to shadow any part of the object the out  line next the light should be draw more faint and when you have draw one feature it should be direction for you in some measure to draw another by observe with you eye the distance from that to the next feature make full mark at the place with you coal then draw it and so to the next ' till you have draw the whole figure then observe the middle of the picture you would copy and touch upon the paper with the point of you coal afterwards ob serve the more conspicuous and uppermost figure if there be more than one which you be to touch lightly in they proper place thus run over the whole dright you will fee as it be the skeleton of the piece to draw have make out these sketch view they diligently to see if they answer you pattern or not for the gesture of the life ought to shew themselves eminently in the first and rudest draught of the piece correct and amend whatever you perceive amiss add ing and diminish as it vary from the pattern by which mean it will be bring nearer and nearer to the life observe the distance of one limb joint or musele from ano the and the fame in all other accident of the figure they length breadth turning shadow next to the light very faintly and where you see bold and free touch be not timo rous in express the same in draw head after the life or otherwise take care to place the feature exactly right upon the crossline whether it be full face or three  quarter face in shortening you must make the crossline to fly upwards but where the aspect be downwards they must be make downwards in circular manner have draw the out  line true with coal yon be to proceed to trace the fame line again with pen indian  ink draw they with more exactness and by imitate all the hatch with they exact distance one from another they crossing turning and winding with more boldness and freedom perfect you de sign in draw after naked body all the muscle be not to be so plainly express as in anatomical figure but that side whose part be most apparent and of signification in the performance of any action must be make to appear more or less accord to the force of that action in draw young person the muscle must not appear mani festly so hard as in elder and full grow person the lame thing be to be observe as to fat and fleshy person and such as be very deli cate and beautiful and in woman scarce any muscle at all be to be express or but very little unless it be in some very forcible action and then to of they be to be represent very faintly tlic like be also to be observe as to child the motion of the whole body must be confsder in draw of the muscle as in the rise and falling of the arm the muscle of the breast appear either more or less the hip do the like accord as they be bend out ward or inward and it be the same chiefly in the shouldler side and neck accord to the several action of the body the breadth and largeness of picture be also to be consider it should be larger about the leg and garment shew itself flender above by discover one shoulder and hide the other which be shorten by turn the body but sometimes the fi gure be to be represent biggest in the upper part by represent either or both the shoulder or both the arm shew the one leg and hide the other or both of they after one manner at discretion neither ought this to be observe only in the whole body but even in every part so that in the leg when muscle be raise outward on the one side that which be directly on the con trary side must be draw in and hide as it appear in the life the proportion of the figure ought to be multiply by degree in proportion of one to two three four for herein the chief skill consist the diameter of the biggest place between the knee and the foot be double the least and the largest part of the thigh tripple  chap iv of the proper material for draw the material require in draw be black lead pencil crayon of black white or red chalk crow  quill pen rule and compass camel hair  pencil and indian  ink accus tom yourself to hold you pencil further from the point than you do in writing which will give you better command of it and con contribute to render you stroke more free and bold the use of you pencil be to draw the first sketch or out  line of you piece as any stroke or tine that be amiss may by this means be more easilly rub out than in any other thing and when you have make you sketch as correct as you can with the pencil you may then draw carefully the best out  line you have get wich you crow  quili pen and ink the ink make use of for this purpose must not be the common but indian  ink be much softer than the other and not run and by mixing it with water it may be make to any degree of strength and may be use in pen like common ink after use the ink you may wipe out the pencil  line by rub bing the piece gently with che crumb of stale bread have thus get you out  line discharge you next work be to shade you piece properly as you shall be direct below either by draw fine stroke wich you pen where it require to be shade or by wash ing it wich the hair  pencil and the indian  ink as tothe rule and compass they be never or rarely to be use except in measu ring the proportion of you figure after you have draw they to prove whether they be right or not or in house fortification and other piece of architecture red lead and red or black chalk be use in the fame manner as black lead white chalk and tobacco  pipe clay be use in heighten or give strong light and in draw on coloured pa per pastil or crayon or any other colour mix with tobac copipe clay which while soft and in the consistency of paste be roll up in piece about the thickness of quill and two or three inch in length and then dry be generally use on co¬ lour paper and the colour be so rub aud wring one into another in such manner that no stroke appear but the whole look as if it be do with brush chap or light and shade it be the artful management of light and shade that give the appearance of subsitance roundness and distance to whatever body be represent by draw draw circle on piece of paper fill it up with any even colour and it will appear to be body with round circumference and flat side but by colour it stronger in the middle and cause it gradually to weaken towards the circumference it will receive convex appearance like that of ball or globe where ever the vivacity of colour be strongest that part of ihe object catch the sight first and appear nearest to it whereas its weakness and goine off be more and more broken and faint and seem tu fly farther off from the sight in round the part of any object the extremity in turn must lose themselve insensibly and confusedly without precipitate the light all of sudden into the shadow or the shadow into the light but the passage of the one into the other must be common and impercepti ble that be by degree of light into shadow and shadow into light object that be paint light must have sufficient breadth of shadow to sustain they and dark body must have sudden light behind to detach they from the ground or from those ob ject that be place behind they otherwise they will appear con fusedly as stick upon each other whercas the oppolition of shade to light object and of light to dark one give pro jection and separate they from other body there should be ballance preserve between the light and sha dow broad light ought not to be introduce into draught with out large shadow the nearer any object be to the eye it be see so much the stronger and plainer the sight be weaken by distance and the mode remote any object be it be feen in more imperfect manner therefore those object which be place foremost to the view ought to be more finish than those that be cast behind and they should have such relative dominion over each other that as one object by its heightenings cause other to retire more back ward of the fame object must be chase and make to appear farther from the sight than other which be more strongly illuminate it be nor sufficient that remote object be only coloured in more faint and languid manner but accord to they distance the part must appear more or less confused the eye not be able to discover minutely what be far separate from it pure and unmix ' whit e either draw a object nearer or carry it off ito greater distance if it be accompany with black the opposition of light and dark render the object more sensible and bring it nearer to the advanced part but pure white be the lightest of colour unless it be force forward and support by black will fly off to the remotest view as for pure black it be the heaviest most ear thy and most sensible of all colour and bring the object nearer to the sight it must be place in mass be insensibly confused and have its proper repose the representation of body give they always such light be most proper and convenient to they suppose situation if the object be in the field or open air and the sun invisible or ob scured by cloud you must then introduce almost a universal light though not warm and strong and you shade must be faint but when the sun be conspicuous and shine in it ' full lustre then the light must be very strong and bold and the shadow very dark if the object you represent be suppose in room little but not very much illuminate and you survey it from without and stand on level with the light that strike upon it the shadow of that figure must be very soft whereby the figure itself will appear beau teous to the eye and will notwithstanding the softnef of the sha dow seem as imboss and come boldly out small light illu minate body occasion the shadow on the dark side to be large and they extremity to be very bold on the other hand light make the shadow on the darker side to be more distinct and more soft in the limitation reflection be to be use in delineating glitter or shine bo dic as glass pearl silver let the cause of the reflection be it more or less be see in the thing itfelf place all you light one way through the whole work and if the light fall sideways on the picture the other side which be the farthest from the light must be make the darkest that part of the body must be make lightest which have the light most opposite to it if the light be place above the head then the top of the head must be make lightest the shoulder must receive the next greater degree of light and thus must you continue to shade lose the light by degree by how much one part of the body project more than another it must by so much be make the lighter and on the contrary thode part that bend inward must be make of much the darker two equal light must never be make in one and the same picture the greater be to strike forcibly into the middle and wich greater lustre on those part of the design where the principal figure and strength of the action seem to lie diminish it gradually as it approach near est the extremity of the piece chap vi of draw face in draw head it be usually divide into four equal part from the crown of the head to the top of the forchead from the top of the forchead to the eye  brow from the eye  brow to the bottom of the nose from thence to the bot tom of the chin but this proportion be not constant those fea ture in different man be often very different as to length and shape in well proportion face however they be nearly right to direct you therefore in form perfect face you first bu siness be to draw complete oval in thie middle of which from the top to the bottom draw perpendicular line through the center or middle of this line draw another line directly across from one side to the other of you oval on these two line all feature of the face be to be draw as follow divide you per pendicular line into four equal part the first must be allot to the hair of the head the second be from the top of the fore¬ head to the top of the nose between thhe eye  brow the third be from thence to the bottom of the nose and the fourth in clude the lip and chin the line across the perpendicular one or the breadth of the face be always suppose to be the length of five eye you must therefore divide it into five equal part and place the eye upon it of as to leave exactly the length of one eye betwixt they this be to be understand only of full front face for if it turn to either side then the distance be to be lessen on that side which turn from you less or more in proportion to its turn the top of the ear be to rise parallel to the eye brow at the end of the diameter or cross line and the bottom of it must be equal to the bottom of the nose the nostril ought not to come out farther than the corner of the eye in any face and the middle of the mouth must always be place upon thie per pendicular line the mouth when shut be as large as a eye the follow be a ingenious device which perhaps may some what assist the young practitioner in form the face accord to its different turning and in place the featurc properly thereon procure piece of smooth wood turn for the purpose in the shape of a egg which be nearly the shape of the human head draw line lengthways quite round it and divide this line into two equal part by another line draw directly across it at right angles the feature be draw on these two line accord to the rule deliver above will produce fore  right face turn the oval small matter from the left hand to the right and the perpendicular upon which the particular feature be to be draw will appear bent like bow always observe in what manner the nose project beyond the round of the oval the same must be observe if you turn the oval from the right hand to the left and if you incline the oval downwards and to the right or upwards recline to the leave the line of the cross and the feature draw on they will in each case leave different appearance and great variety of face may be shew by this oval accord as you incline recline or turn it more or less but those figure which come sideways be to be draw by means of perpendicular upon which the forehead nose mouth and chin be to be draw as before direct it be to be observe that if the face be fat the check will seem to swell if lean the jaw  bone will stick out and the cheek fall in but if it be neither too fat nor too lean it will be nearly round touch the feature lightly wheere the eye nose mouth and chin should ftand then begin to draw thein more ex actly and so procce ' till you have finish the face after which draw the hair beard and shadow about it you be to consider all those chief touch which give life to face and that discover the disposition of the mind thus the mouth extend and the cor ner turn little up shew smile countenance you must take care that the shadow be not make too dark where they should be light because afterwards they can not be render more light and remember that they be to be more faint and light in fair than swarthy complexion chap vii of the measure and proportion of the several part of the body the ancient commonly allow eight head to they figure though some of they have but seven however the modern ordinarily divide they figure into ten face that be from the crown of the head the sole of the foot in the manner follow ing from the crown of the head to the forehead be the third the face begin at the lowest hair which be part of the face . the face begin at the lowest hair which be upon the forehead and end at the bottom of the chin the face be divide into three proportional part the first contain the forehead the second the nose and the third the mouth and chin from thie chin to the pit between the collar bone be two length of nose from the pit betwixt the collar  bone to the bottom of the breast one face from the bottom of the breast to the navel one face from the navel to the genitals one face from the genitals to the upper part of the knee two face the knee contain half face from the lower part of knee to the ancle two face from the ancle to the sell of thie foot half face man when he arm be stretch out be from the longest finger of he right hand to the longest of he left as broad as he be long from one side of the breast to the other two face the bone of the arm call humerus be the length of two face from the shoulder to the elbow from the end of the elbow to the root of the littie finger the bone call cubitus with part of the hand contain two face from the box of the shoulder  blade to the pit betwixt the collar  bone one face if you will be sa tisfied in the measure of breadth from the extremity of one finger the other so that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body you must observe that the box of the elbow with the humerus and of the humerus with the shoulder  blade bear the proportion of half face when the arm be stretch out the tole of the foot be the fisch part of the figure the hand be the length of pace the thumb contain nole the inside of the arm from the place where the muscle disappear which make the breast call the pectoral muscle to the middle of the arm four nose from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand five nose the longest toe be nose long the two utmost part of the teat and the pit betwixt the collar  bone of woman make a equilateral triangle for the breadth of the limb no precise measure can be give because the measure themselves be changeable accord to the quality of the person and accord to the movement of the mus cle chap viii of draw the body at full length first make you oval for che head and have divide it accord to the instruction already give draw perpendicular line from the top of the head to the sole of the foot and measure out eight length of the head this line be of special use to di rect you in place the figure upright and in the action of the posture where it fall in and where it swell out one head 's length from the chin yon must draw the breast the third mea sure reacheth to the navel the fourth to the privity the fifth to the middle of the thigh the fixth to the lower part of the knee the seventh to the lower part of the leg and the eighth to the heel and sole of the foot observe in every measure what touch there be of the mus cle draw that leg first on which the body stand then draw the other and after that the arm and hand but draw at first all the part very lightly with coal only because there be least trouble in alter and rub out the coal as for the hand they be twice as long as they be broad and each of they part have its length breadth and thickness the nail upon the finger be about half the joint it be upon the length of the foot be sixth part of the heighth of person and the length be five eight more than the breadth the length of the face and hand ought to be exactly exactly equal and make but just the tenth part of person heighth the rule in draw child be as follow some make child to contain five measure of the head viz from the top of the head to the privity three and in the thigh and leg two more the breadth between the shoulder the length of head and half the breadth of the body above the navel the length of one head and the breadth of the upper part of the thigh be the third part of two length of the head the breadth of the knee be just the measure there be betwixt the eye and the chin the small of the leg and the brawn of the arm be of the thickness of the neck in general let it be obderve always to begin wich the right side of the piece you be copy for by so do you will always have what be do before you eye and the rest will follow more natu rally and with greater ease whereas if you begin with the left side you hand and arm will cover what you do first and deprive you of the sight of it by which mean you will not be able to pro ceed with so much ease pleasure or certainty as to the order and manner of you procced in draw the human body you must first sketch the head then the shoulder in they exact breadth then draw the trunk of the body begin wich the armpit leave the arm 's till afterwards and so down to the hip on both side be sure to observe the exact breadth offthe waist when you have do this then draw that leg which the body stand upon and afterwards the other which stand loose then draw the arm and last of all the hand take notice also of the bowings and bending of the body make the part opposite to that which bend correspond in bend with it for instance if one side of the body bend in the other must stand out answerable to it if the back bend in the bel ly must stick out if the knee bend out the ham must fall in and so of any other joint in the body finally endea vour to form all the part of you figure with truth and in just proportion not one arm or one leg bigger or less than the other not broad shoulder with thin flender waif nor raw and bony arm with thick and gouty leg but let therc be kind of har mony mony and agreement amongst the member and a agreeable sym metry throughout the whole figure bur as the essence of all draw consist in make at first good sketch you must in this particular be very careful and accu rate draw no part perfect or exact ' till you see whether the whole draught be good and when you have alter that to you mind you may then finish one part after another as curiously as you can in draw the eye ear leg arm hand foot great care study and pradtice arc requisite this must be learn by carefully imitate the best print or drawing you can get of eye ear for as to the mechanical rule of draw they by line and measure they be not only perplex and difficult but also con trary to the practice of the best master but the action and pos ture of the hand be so many and various that no certain rule can be give for draw they that will univerfally hold good and as the hand and foot be difficult member to draw it be necessary and well worth while to bestow some time and pain about they carefully imitate they various posture and action so as not only to avoid all lameness and imperfection but also to give they life and spirit in draw labour man you must represent he wich strong limb and raise muscle swell and stand out especially in bear burden draw weight scape walking combat or such like violent exercise in represent person asleep you must carefully avoid give any such posture or action in they lie as would not in all probability afford rest for great want of judg ment would appear in represent they limb or body support by they own force and not by the help of something else with regard to the representation of the passion mo . de pile observe that it be absurd as well as impossible to pretend give such particular demonstration of they as to fix they expression to certain stroke which the painter should be oblige to make use of as essential and invariable rule this fay he would be deprive the art of that excellent variety of expression which have no other principal than diversity of imagination the number of which be infinite the same passion may be express several way each yield more or less pleasure in proportion to the painter ' under standing and the spectator discernment though every part of the face contribute towards express the sentiment of the heart yet the eye  brow accord to mo le brun be the principal seat of expression and where the passion makethemsele most know it be certain say he that the pupil of the eye by its fire and motion very well thow the agitatior of the soul but then it do not express the kind or nature of that agitation whereas the motion of the eye  brow differ accord as the passion change they nature to express simple passion the motion be simple to express mixt passion the motion be com pound if the passion be gentle the motion be gentle if it be violent the motion be so too we may farther observe say he that there be two kind of elevation in the eye  brow one in which the eye  brow rise up in the middle this elevation ex press agreeable sensation and it be to be observe that then the mouth rise at the corner another in which the eye  brow rise up at the end and fall in the middle denote bodily pain and then the mouth fall at the corner in laughter all the part agree for the eye  brow which fall towards the middle of the forehead make the nose the mouth and the eye follow the same motion in weep the motion be compound and contrary for the eye brow fall towards the nose and over the eye and the mouth ri ses that way it be to be observe also that the mouth be the part of the face which more particularly express the emotion of the heart for when the heart complain the mouth falls at the cor ner when it be pleased the corner of the mouth be elevate and when it have a avertion the mouth shoot forward and rise in the middle the head fsay mo . de pile contribute more to the expression of the passion than all the other part of the body put together those separately can only share some few passion but the head ex press they all some however be more peculiarly express by it than other as humility by hang it down arrogance by lift it up languishment by incline it on one side and ob stinacy with stiff and resulate air make it stand upright fix and stiff between the shoulder the head also best shew we sup plication threat mildness pride love hatred joy and grief the whole face and every feature contribute something but more especially the eye yet though the passion of the soul be most visible in the line and feature of the face they often require al so the assistance of other part of the body without the hand for instance a action be weak and imperfect they action which arc almost infinite create numberless expression it be by they that partly we desire hope promise call and send back they be the insrument of threaten prayer praise by they we in great measure approve condemn refuse admit fear ask express we joy and grief we doubt regret pain and admiration but to say how these part must be dilpose for express the various passion be impossible nor can any exact rule be give for it both because the task would be infinite and because every one must be guide in this by he own genius and the particular turn of he study chap xi of drapery in the art of cloath you figure or casting the drapery upon they with elegance and propriety many thing be to be ob serve however this art consist chiefly in three point viz the order of the fold or plait the different quality of the stuff and the variety of they colour as to the fold they ought to be so manage as that you may easily perceive what it be they cover and distinguish it from any thing else as for instance that you see it be a arm that be under the drapery and not leg or leg and not a arm again the fold ought to be large and con trast should be observe between they otherwise in the first case they break and divide the sight too much and in the next place the drapery will be too stiff as to the quality of the stuff it should be well confider some fold be abrupt and harsh while other flow more fsft and easy again the surface of some have lustre while other art flat and dead and some be fine and tran parent while other be firm and solid the variety of colour when well manage make the greatest beauty in painting some be not equally agreeable wich respect to each other and some be never to be place near certain other the drapery must never be make to adhere or flick too close to the part of the body but it must seem to flow round and as it be embrace they yet in such manner as that the figure may be easy and have free motion great lightness and motion of the drapery be only proper figure in much agitation or expose to wind the nudity of the figure should always be design be fore you procce to draw the drapery draw the out  line of the garment lightly then draw the great fold first and stroke these into lesser take care that they do not cross one another the drapery that cover those part which be expose to great light must not be so deeply shade as to seem to pierce they nor should those member be cross by fold that be too strong leave by the too great darkness of they shade the member look as if they be break fold in general should be large and as few as possible however they must be greater or less accord to the quantity and quality of the stuff of which the drapery be sup  pose to be make suit the garment to the body and make they bend with the body accord as it itand in or out straight or crook or as it bend one way or another and the closer the garment fit to the body the narrower and smaller must be the fold the quality of the person be asfo to be confider in the drapery for instance if they be magistrate they drapery onght to be large fine and flow if country  clown they ought to be coarse and short and if lady and nymph light and soft fold well imagine give much spirit to any kind of action be cause they motion imply the like in the act member which seem to draw they forcibly and make they more or less stir as the action be more or less violent a artful complication of fold in circular manner greatly help the effect of fore  short ening all fold consist of two shade and no more which you may turn with the garment at pleasure shadow the inner side more deeply the shade in silk and fine linnen be very thick and small require little fold and light shadow observe the motion of the air or wind in order to draw the loose apparel alf fly one way and draw that part of the garment that adhere closest to the body before you draw the looser part that fly off from it leave by draw the loose part of the garment first you should mistake the position of you figure and place it awry rich ornament when judiciously and sparingly use may some time contribute to the beauty of drapery but such ornament be far below the dignity of angel or heavenly figure the gran deur of whofe drapery ought rather to consist in the boldness and nobleness of the fold than in the quality of the stuff or the glitter of ornament light and fly drapery be proper only to figure in great motion or in the wind but when in calm place and free from violent action they drapery should be large and flow that by they contrast and the fall of the fold they may appear with grace and dignity chap or draw mix figure in order to draw the form of any beast begin at the forehead with the lead or coal draw downward the nose mouth upper and neither chap end the line at the throat then view ing it again from the part where you formerly begin continue it over the head ear and neck till you have give the full com pass of the buttock afterwards mark out the leg and touch out the breast with the eminency thereof finish the tail paw tongue tooth beard and the several shadow in draw beast you must be well acquainted with they shape and action without which you will never perform any thing excel lean in this way and whatever beast you draw you must be sure to give sketch of the landskip of the country natural to that beast in draw bird you be to begin also at the head continue the breast  line from under the throat down to the leg then begin at the pinion for make the wing this be join to the back line the figure will be presently finish the eye leg and tail be to be draw last the feather begin at the head very small must fall backward one way in five rank still incease till finish instect as fly bee wasp grasshopper worm and such like be draw wich great ease provide you for the first time have the original before you eye in draw flower begin from the rose  tust or wart in the middle as in rose or marigold with the yellow tust which be ing make draw line equally divide from thence to the greatest compass or extent of the flower they may be draw either fully open or in the bud the leave may first be draw rudely after ward give they they vein or jaggedness chap x i or draw landskip building all draw consist in nicely measure the distance of each part of you piece by the eye in order to facilitate this you be to imagine in you own mind that the piece you copy be divide into square as for example suppose or imagine perpendicular and a horizontal line cross each other in the center of the pic ture you be to copy then suppose also two such line cross you own copy observe in the original what
