gen tlemen and lady who chuse to divert themselves in the can rious art of draw japan ing painting upon glass var nishing upon metal wood or past board and of take view and prospect justly accord to the rule of perspective the author have take care to prescribe short and easy direction for the speedy attain the know ii the preface ledge of these useful and amusing art without give the student the trouble of consult large vo lume which be generally take from one another right or wrong or of learn several branch of the mathematick as be generally think necessary in order to un derstand perspective science without the knowledge of which it be impossible to make any great improvement in the art of draw ing or painting or even to be judge of good draw or to un¬ derstand whether one be right or wrong in what one would invent or design mus confess owe my know ledge of several valuable receipt to some manuscript of the great mo . boyle which have never be print and have fall into my hand by means of the same no ble lord he relation whom before mention in my art of the preface draw and painting in water colour be likewise oblige to wor thy gentleman who after deli berate study of perspective set I to rights in few hour when be at any loss as for the rest they be obsersation from the ex periment which have make from time to time at large expence and with great industry have be upbraid by some workmen in curiosity for publish ing receipt of value to instruct the gentry in the manner of draw¬ ing and painting and in art of the like kind for say they it be damage to the workmen who get they livelihood by such thing have short answe to this be gument namely that there be none of the receipt which pub lish but what be either my own invention or have buy at good price or else have be pre sent with by people of fashion the preface with they desire to have they make publick and these be such as would never come to the know ledge of tbe workmen if be not the communcate they in this manner by which they have a opportunity of improve they selve as many of tbem have do from thing that have already publish in the same wa so that can say from my own certain knowledge that many of they be oblige to I and instead of com plain ought to thank I if any person should find difficulty in the performance of any article shall be ready to put they to rights for reason able satisfaction the method of learn to draw in perspective chap short rule for draw in perspective which will prove of great use to all de signer when observe the fault daily commit in the design of landscape or draw view and prospect more and more find the necessity of know little perspective to correct and avoid such error for under stand that art will render any one capable of draw any thing with mathematical truth and certainty but conceive that the reason why so many mistake be commonly make in drawing pro ceed from the apprehension that some have of the length of time it will take up to render themselves master of perspective and from be frightned at the difficulty they conceive be in that study particularly imagine that one must be first well grounded in the mathematick this know have discourage many from engage in the rule relate to this art but for they sake undertake in this tract to instruct they in the follow lesson how to lay any plan in perspective and raise pillar or building to due height accord to they proper distance lesson of the plan fig we have square piece of pavement as in figure consist of twenty five piece of marble each foot square it must be mea sured exactly and lay regularly down upon pa¬ per you may likewise for you better obser vation mark every other stone or marble black which will better inform you how every parti cular square will appear when we have true perspective view of they or else you may num ber every one and when the follow lesson be do number those in the perspective plan with the same figure as be mark on the first plan lesson ii of lay figure in perspective it be to be understand in perspective that there be two point to be consider the first we call the point of sight that be what relate to every thing in we view from the place where we stand and it matter little where we stand to take we view for the perspective will still be true accord to the appearance of the plan to we eye if we stand at corner or in the middle or at any point the method shall pre scribe presently will lay pur plan justly before we as it will appear the other point be call she point of distance because it govern the distance and the pro portion of every thing we can truly see of the plan in whatever position we happen to be fig ii at you see the plan of fig this be di vide into square as mention in that figure the three at the bottom mark in both and the square in the plan mark be those which be mark in perspective with the same number now to lay you plan in perspective fix you point of sight as you observe in the figure or more or less to the right or leave as you think proper then draw the line parallel to and at what distance ypu will from the line then raise line on each side from to to form the figure you see as frame to you picture then draw line from the cor ner which be the point of distance to and this line will regulate you work then draw line from the square of you plan to the point of sight as exactly as possible and wherever you line of distance cut those line which be draw from the square of you plan to the point of sight that mark where you square in perspective ought to be then draw line parallel to the line where the line of distance cut and that will give you the true figure of every square so in the perspective plan answer to in the measure plan and answer to the other in the same when you have do this the next rule you be to know be how to raise either pillar tree house or any other body accord to they respective height at different distance and pro portion on the plan you have lay down how to raise pillar or any body of certain proportion in perspective you have now you plan measure out in perspective into square of foot one of these square in this lesson serve for the base or bot tom of pillar foot thick this figure iii be exactly of the same dimension of the plan lay in perspective at figure ii first mark the line in equal proportion by the qame scale of the ground plan figure ii as which be so many foot in height and they stand on the base of the first figure be up rights not in perspective then draw line parallel with from number which give you the front of the body you be to raise and if it be to be only three foot high draw line cross from to the line raise from no and that determine the height which you will then find to be foot wide and three foot high by measure measure then from the top of the line draw line with black lead pencil to the point of sight and raise another line from parallel to the line till it touch the pencil 's line pass from to the point of sight which give you the side appearance of the column or body as you will fee it from the place where you stand the line from point should be draw with pen because it be to remain then with pen cil draw line from to the point of sight which will determine the other line to make the shape of the top df the column and then raise line parallel with with pencil from the point till it touch the tine from to she point of sight draw then parallel line to at and you will have the square of the top of the pillar or column as you can observe it from the place where you stand which suppose to be at you must remember that the line draw from to be only a ima ginary line to be rub out for it can not be see from the place where you stand and there fore must not appear in the draw but you should not leave it out because it shew you where to regulate the top of you column and teach you how to place you column upon it 's base with certainty by this means you may see the front and one side of you column and the line from to must also be rub out because it can 's be see then finish you column only with the line from to from to to from to and from to from it will be draw without any imperfection and appear as follow in figure iv fig iv when this be do you may place another column on any one of the square erect in the same manner observe to fling you shade all on one side and then you can not err but espe cially mind where the dot line be in fi gure iii when you can master these few lesion which you may gain with very little pain you will be capable of do any thing in this way that will be regular and certain and know the fault of the ignorant and unskilful chap ii of painting upon glass painting upon glass be a art which have generally appear so difficult that few have succeed in the attempt and yet there be no representation of any portrait can appear more elegant than in picture do well in this manner for you have all the softness and all the tenderness that can be desire in picture and and it be easy too for any person to work upon for there be no out line to draw nor any shade to make but you put on the colour without the trouble of either the picture which we use on this occasion be those do in mezzo tinto or what we call mezzo tincto print for they shade be rub down with a instrument on the copper plate so that the several line which be force to be draw to represent the shady part of any common print be by this means scumble together and appear as soft and united as in any piece do with indian ink when you be provide with such print as you like cut off the paper of the margin so that none be leave but the print itself then take some of the finest crown glass and have it cut exactly to the size of you print and when you have clean you glass very well lay on one side of it some fine venice turpentine as thin as possible with brush make of hog ' hair and if you perceive the turpentine to lie unequally pass piece of wood make like fiat ruler over it till it lie equal in every part then wet the back of you print with sponge and water and lay the pictur 's side upon the turpentin 's side of the glass take care that every part of it lie close to the glass and that there be no bubble or blister to be see then you may roll it over with wooden roll make like cylinder of two inch diameter to fix it close to the glass and when that be do wet the back of the print again with sponge and water till the paper will rub off with you finger then rub it gently till there remain only the picture itself upon the glass so will you have all the line and shade very visible as if it be fine draw in indian ink then let it remain till the next day to dry for else the colour would not take because they be ground in oil colour for painting on glass with the necessary for such work at most colour shop of note in london we may meet with colour of several sort ground in oil and tie up in little bladder to be fold at three pence groat or six pence piece accord as they be more or less valuable of these provide as follow white flake white white lead yellow english pink yellow oaker dutch pink yellow orpiment red rise pink vermillion red lead indian red lake carmine verditer prussian blue sander blue indigo black lamp black ivory black green verdigrease distill ' verdigrease and yellow oaker mixt verdigrease andenglisti pink mixt verdigrease and dutch pink mixt bly ultramarine blue bise brown spanish brown umber when you be provide with these colour you may mix they one with another to what degree of colour you think proper upon pal let let with smooth knife with tender bend blade add little more of one colour to ano the mixing they well till you have what you want to get the colour out of the bladder prick hole at the bottom of each bladder you de sign to use and press the bladder till you have colour enough upon you pallet for you present use for in day time the colour will dry and ean never be recover provide on this occasion box about two foot and half long about five inch high and sixteen inch wide with partition in it as follow the use of this box which be to keep all you painting thing together and preserve they clean shall here very particularly explain at number must be box of tin no iron to be place in the wooden box be cause it must hold oil of turpentine to clean you pencil when you have do work when you paint you must take care to use on ly one pencil in colour or in other word to have pencil for each colour and as soon as you have do use they for the day clean they from the colour by dip they in to the oil of turpentine and lay the hairy part of the pencil on the tinn 's division be no tween number and number press you finger hard on the hair and draw it four or five time oyer the tin then will the colour which come out of the pencil fall into the tin box number and by that mean the pencil will be clean and the several mixture of colour that fall there with they oil will become good size for gold then lay you pencil with they stick no in the box no and they will be fit for use another time note the pencil should be of two sort that be some of camel ' hair to paint with such as will come to point when the colour be in they and some dry brush of white hair never to be dipp ' in colour but use only to scunjble or join one colour in another when they be just lay on so that they appear soft atod you can not di stinguish where any one leave off abruptly you ought at least to have three dozen of ca¬ mel 's hair pencil of all size and dozen and half of rough brush with stick to each about ten inch or foot long the stick may be buy ready make at the colour shop they be commonly make of cedar or brazil wood but some nice person have they turn ' in ivory at numb you should have case di no vide of wood in several part to keep you dry colour in such as carmine and ultra marine with other that you may keep by you to grind when you want they for sometimes you may have occasion in the country to grind colour that you want the reason of have division make in this box be to keep these colour from mixing with each other and there by spoiling one another for if there be no separate apartment sometimes in hasty take out or put in of these co lour you may disturb the papers they be com monly wrap in so much that some of the co lour will be spill the fine or rich colour such as ultramarine or . carmine may rather be buy in powder than ground in oil for the first be worth near four pound a ounce and she carmine if ' tis good worth about twenty shilling therefore it be better to have these in powder than to have they ground in oil at the colour shop for by degree they will dry though in the bladder and you will have so much loss from they the method to grind these in oil be to put little of either of they upon polish marble and with drop or two of oil mix they well with soft blade knife and lay it on you pal let but of the ultramarine aud carmine very little will serve for the least touch on the light side of you draw will give lustre to you picture and if it be ultramarine it will be last whereas have great deal of reason to suspect that the pruffian blue will not if it be expose to the weather at have observe in some sign painting of two year stand a there find that colour to change into dirty yellow but if we mix the prussian blue with varnish it will hold and last like ultramarine in short the air must be keep from it to pre serve it if we want to grind any other colour coarser than these in they powder we must have mul ler which must be make of one of the hardest stone we can get and finely polish porphyry would be the best make in the shape of sugar loaf if one could get it but for the shape the sugar loaf figure be the easiest fof any one to turn with they hand and every painter know the way marble be good or any stone that will polish nay even glass or crystal or any such like thing but if you hive great quantity of colour to grind you must consider that you must have large quantity of oil but never so much as to overcome the quantity of colour in the grind part you may observe that the colour will frequently turn from under the mul¬ der then with thin knife scrape it up and place it under the muller again till 't be as fine as you desire it then immediately put it into piece of bladder first have che bladder immerge in warm water to soften it tie it up and let it remain to be use as have direct the other number may in it s use be explain ' no thus let that partition be line with tin or iron tinn because this be to enclose the bladder of oil which you should always keep by you as oil of linseed and turpentine nut oyl and burnt oil and in the taking of these in and out the apartment would be greasy and stain the wood whereas the tin will pre serve it from any stain from the oil number be in the middle of the box no and should be make of tinh ' iron like wise to take out and put in at pleasure for 't be to contain all the bladder of oil colour and as some of they will be frequently use the re servoir for they must in time become greasy and over they be to be lay the pallet which every night after you have do you work should be clean of the colour you have put upon it or else cover with its colour in war ter to keep they useful till the next day to keep you pallet clean rub it with coarse lin nen cloath with oil of turpentine and then rub it till 't be dry as one may call it with nut or lin seed oil but take what tare you will of you oil co lour in small quantity when they be expose to the air there will be coat of thick hard scale over they in day or two which indeed one may take off with knife but we lose much of the colour and some of they be very costly when you take off the scaly part the rest of the colour be fit to use and if it be too thick then put drop or two of linseed oil to it and mix it well with you tender knife some people when they use ultramarine and carmine because of they great price only put drop of oil on they pallet and put as much colour to it as they think will be enough only work they together with knife which indeed be more save than to mix it on the stone ii how to use the colour in painting on glass as the line and shade of you picture hap pen to open so you ought to dispose you co lour that be lay on the lighter colour first on the light place of you print and the darker over the shade place and if you have once lay on the brighter colour 't be no great mat ter whether the darker sort be lay little over they for the first colour lay on will hide those you lay on afterwards as for example yellow the lightest yellow may be lay on first and the dutch pink will shade it red the red lead may be lay on first as the bright est red colour and to shade it with lake or car mine will bring you picture to beautiful scar let equal to any tincture of the finest dye of cochineal bly lay on first the blue life and shade it with indigo or else take ultramarine and lay it on in the light and lhade it with indigo green lay on first some verdigrease and then the mixture have mention of that and the dutch pink but you may make this green as yellow as you please by add more dutch pink as you see occasion it be to be note that when any of these co lour be too strong they may be lighten to any degree by mixing white with they upon you pallet or you may darken they by mix ing they with the deeper colour but they must be well mixt with the knife before you use they when you have paint you glass it must stand three of four day before it will be dry enough to put in frame chap chap in os ' the making of crayon for dry colour the use of crayon for dry colour be so necessary in rake of view and prospect and there be so few crayon that be good of the sort that think the way of make they necessary article to be know to every one who be lover of draw and painting it as for white we

make they into crayon memorandum the reason why these crayon be better than commonly those which be buy at the shop be because they be generally make too stiff with gum and so will hardly touch the paper but all these will work freely and express the several colour you desire we must consider that the reason why we make five or six shade of each colour be because in this cafe we can not mix any when we use they whereas in oil painting and painting in water colour we may make what mixture we please in a instant and when we set about any painting or draw in crayon which hap¬ pen to have great variety of colour in it we ought not to be without every sort of colour that can be think on ivbte these colour should be keep in box partition every sort by itself viz . . thtwhite tellow lay the
