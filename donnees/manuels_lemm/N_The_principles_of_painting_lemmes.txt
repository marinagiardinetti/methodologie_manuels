for this reason bis work as well as vandyke maintain to this day a unusual strength and vigour now it may be naturally anferr from the practice of these two painter that as any colour any stroke be to express some draw some tendency towards teint and like ness so any great disturbance or wrong colour too often the case portraiture not only spoil draw but surprisingly alter and foul the teint and make the painting less like and lef durable but to return to vandyke what if we should suppose that the historical management he be bring up to under the excellent ruben loosen he head give he easy

in motion and at reft the one for young people only and the other for any person indif ferently yet allow the mactive to have some motion now if the atti tude be to express who and what the sitter be and bis very temper very nice bistorical point how much do it concern the portraitist to study it and make the distinction aforesaid whereas the posture of most of we portrait be at rest and at best take from the layman but to prove motion and histo rical management in portrait must acquaint the reader that bave see picture draw in italy of a english gentleman where he be repre sent in sit

though bis face be on this account fore shorten lengthwise yet it retain great likenef there be yet bebind favourite historical principle of vandyke and titian which face painter little heed mean the dlaro obscuro com pound itahaan word signify simply a opposition of light and shade but in more refine sense any co lour naturally luminous and light in themselves oppose to other 's to turally more brown and heavy the artifice of the claro obscuro of whatever small import painter may think it in portrait be certainly practicable in family piece because we author tell we that every such picture picture be a history and become group by the meeting of the figure of different sex and age and in different attitude and drapery noso this group must be so manage that the foremost figure must net only as be ing nearest to the eye receive the greatest light but also be improve by drapery of natural light colour and in this white and yellow sattin do wonder and the off figure be more brown and heavily coloured but with discretion so that the whole group may appear to bave one general light oppose one general shade in word this treatise will ap pear as we author would bave it be palace and bulwark for art to wbich both painter and lover of painting may safely retire for instruction and entertainment as to the translation we have endeavour to make it as acceptable to the engish reader as possible by ob serve medium between too wide parapbrase and too literal verfion the properest method for work that treat so learnedly and profoundly oj the art of painting the author 's preface on the idea of painting the prize of race be not to be win if we have not the goal in we eye be the perfect knowledge of any art or science to be acquire without have trie idea of it this idea be we goal or mark and direct we unerringly to the end of we career that be to the pof session of the science we desire but though there be nothing which do not include in itself and discover it be true idea yet we must not from hence infer that this idea be so obvioue as not to be mistaken or that the false idea do not often paf for the true and perfect there be several idea of painting as well as of other art the difficulty lie in discover which of they be the true one for this purpose it be necessary to observe that in painting there be two fort of idea general idea wlich be common to all man and particular idea peculiar to painter the surest way to know infallibly the true idea of thing be to derive it from the very basis of they essence and definition for desinition be invent for no other purpose than prevent equivocation and ambiguity in idea banish those that be false and inform the mind of the true end and principal effect of thing whence it fol low that the more a idea lead we directly and rapidly to the end which its essence point out the more certain we ought to be that such a idea be à true one the essence and definition of painting be cne imitation of visible object by means of form and colour wherefore the more for cibly and faithfully painting imitate nature the more directly and rapidly do it lead we to its end which be to decerve the eye and the surer proof do it give we of its true ide general idea above mention strike and attract every one the ignorant the lover of painting judge and even painter themselves picture that bear this cha racter permit no one to pass by it with in difference but never fail to surprise we and to detain we for while to enjoy the pleasure of we surprize true painting therefore be such as not only surprise but asit be call to we and have so powerful a effect that we can not help come near it as if it have something to tell we and we no sooner approach it but we be entertained not only with sine choice with the novelty of the thing it represent with the history or fable it put we in mind of with ingenious invention and with allegory to give we the pleasure of employ we part either in discover the meaning or criticise the obscurity of they but also with that true and faithful imitat ion which attract we at first sight and afterwards let we into all the particular of the piece and ahich accord ing to aristotle never fail to divert we how horrible soever those natural object may be which it represent the other idea which as we say to painter and to which they ought to be perfectly habituate concern in particulat the whole thebry of painting and should be so much at command that it may seem to cost they no reflection to exé cute they thought so that after have study correct design fine colour and all they dependency they ought to have those idea always present and ready which answer to the several branch of they art on the whole true painting by the force and great truth of its imitation ought as have observe to call the spectator to surprise he and oblige he to approach it as if he intend to converse with the figure in effect when the piece bear the character of truth it seem to have draw we to it for no other purpose than to entertain and instruct we but here we must observe that the zdea of painting in general be as different as the manners of the several school not that painter be without those particular idea which they ought to possef but the use they make of they not be at all time just the habit which this use bring upon they they attachment to one parf more than a other and the affection they preserve for the manner of those master whom they have imitate prejudice they choice and bias they to some favourite branch of the art though they be under the strictest ob ligation to make themselves master of every part of it in order to contribute to the ge¬ neral idea above mention for most painter be always divide in they inclina tion some follow raphael other mi chael angelo other the caracchis and other the scholar of these master some prefer the whole oter the abundance of thought ofher the grace other the ex pression of the passion of the soul and there be some who give themselves wholly up to the heat and transport of they genius thor but little improve either by study or re flection but what can be do with all these vague and uncertain idea tis certainly dangerous to reject they we must therefore resolve to prefer to all other thing that truth which we have suppose in the ge neral idea for to all paint object the appearance of truth be more necessary than the manner of any master whatever becau se truth in painting be the basis of all the part which heighten the excellence of this art as the science and virtue be the foundation of all those accomplishment which can either exal or adorn human nature for which reason we must suppose truth on the one hand and virtue and science on the other to be in perfection when we talk of those finishing or accomplishment of which either painting or human nature be susceptible and which without rest upon such basis can have no good effect in short the spectator be not oblige to seek for truth in painting but truth by its effect must call to the spectator and force he attention tis in vain to adorn stately palace with the greatest rarity if we have forget to make door to it or if the entrance be not proportionable to the beauty of the building so as to raise the passenger 's desire to walk in and gratify he curiosity all visible object enter the understanding by the faculty of see as musical sound do by that of hear ing the eye and ear be the door which admit we to judge of painting and mufick the first care therefore both of the painter and the musician should be to make these entrance free and agreeable by the force of they harmony the one in he colour con duct by the claro obscuro and the other in he accord the spectator be thus at tract by the force of the performance he eye discover in it those particular beauty which be capable of instruct and pleasing the curious find in it what suit he taste and the painter there observe the different branch of he art in order to improve himself by what be good and to reject what ever may be vicious every thing in picture be not equally perfect some paint ing there be which with several fault when minutely consider ' do not fail ne vertheless to catch the eye because of the artist 's excellent management in he colour and the claro obscuro rembrant for instance divert he self one day with draw he maid 's picture in order to set it at he window and deceive passenger he project succeed for the fallacy be not discoverd till some day after and yet as we may justly imagine of rembrant this effect be not ow to the beauty of the design nor to the noble ness of the exprefsion when be in hol land have the curiosity to see this picture and find it to be well pencild and of great force buy it and it have at this time considerable place in my cabinet other painter on the contrary have shew in they work good many per fection in the several part of the art yet have not be so happy as rembrant to gain at first sight such favourable regards say not happy because if they have sometimes succeed ' twas ow to chance dispo sition of object which in the place they fill require a advantageous claro obscuro perfection which can not be deny they but wherein the skill of the painter have very littie share since if it have be the effect of science it would have appear in all he other production thus nothing be more common than to séë painting set off room purely by the rich ness of they bordering whilst the insipidity and coldness of those painting be such that people paf unconcernedly by they without be attract by that truth which call to we now to make this point clearer must explain it by the example of some skilful painter who yet have not be master enough to strike the eye at first sight by faithful imitation and trutk which ought to decelve as even excel nature itself thé most rémarkable examplé can quote be raphael because of he great reputation and because there be never any painter who possess so many part of the art or possess they in so high degree of perfection be very certain by the confession of many that man of knowledge have often seek for raphael work in the midst of they that be in the hall of the vatican where be he best performance and have ask they guide to shew they the work of raphael without give the least indi¬ cation of be strike with they at the first glance of the eye as they expect to be from that painter 's reputation the paint ing of raphael do not answer the idea they have conceive of so great genius because they measure they by that idea which one ought naturally to have of perfect work they could not imagine that the imitation of nature would not in the work of so wonderful a artist appear in all its vigour and all its perfection this shew that without the knowledge of the claro obscuro and of whatever depend on colour the other part of painting lose much of they merit even when they be in that degree of perfection to which raphael carry they shall offer here late instance of the little effect which raphael 's work produce at first sight have it from friend well know for he genius and knowledge and monsieur de valincourt who as it usually happen to person of he part have such a esteem for this famous painter as come up to admiration be some time ago at rome he be very im patient to see raphael 's work the most admire of which be he fresco painting in the hall of the vatican he be accord ingly carry thither but happen with indifference to cross the hall without per ceive that he have before he eye what he so eagerly seek after he conductor thereupon stand he short and say whitber be you go so faft sirè there be wbat you look for and you do not mind my curious friend no sooner perceive the beauty whech he fine genius point out to he in those work but he resolve to repair thither cften fully to gratify he curiolity and to form he taste on what he could fur the discover but what if besides charmn ing with the sight of so many fine thing raphael have at first sight call to he by the effect of colour proper for each object and support by a excellent claro obscuro this gentleman think he should be extremely surprised at the sight of painting that have so great reputation but be not and not be painter he content he self with examine and praising the air of the head the expression the nobleness of the aftitude and the grace of the part he best best understand in other thing he have but little curiosity because they relate to the painter only this story be often revivéd as well by painter who never see any of ra phael ' work as by other curious person ignorant of painting yet it must be acknowledge that some of this artist 's painting be well colour ' but we must not form we judgment of the whole by the few of this kind for it be the general run of he and other painter work that must determine the extent of they capacity some object that this great and perfect imitation be not essential to painting and that if it be the effect would appear in most picture that picture may call and yet not always answer the idea of the per son who come to it and that it be not ne cessary for the figure to seem desirous to enter into conversation with the spectator because he be already prepossess with the notion of its be only painting it be certain that the number of picture which call the spectator be but few but that be not the fault of the art the essential effect of which be to surprise and deceive the eye we must only blame the painter 's nieg ligence or rather impute it to he genius as not be exalt enough or not sufficiently furnish ' with the principle necessary for com ompel as it be those who pass by stop and give attention to he piece but further it arguc more genius to nake good use of light and shade har nony of colour and thay suitableness to éach articular object than to design single igure correctly design which require much time to earn perfectly consist of little more than habit which be often repeat of give neasure and outline but the claro obscuro nd harmony of colour be continual sub ect of reasoning which employ the genius way that be as different as the compo ition they selve moderate genius may hrough perseverance attain correct design ng but the clare obscuro require besides lie rule such compass of genius as may ncorporate with and as it be diffuse tself through all the other part of paint ng tis well know that the work of ti tian and of all the painter of he school have fcarce any other merit than they claro obscuro and colour and yet they bear à great price be in great repute and maintain they post in the cabinet of the curious as first rate picture when speak of design must be un derstood to mean only that material part which by just measurès foris all object in regular manner for be not ignorant that that in design there be genius capable to season all sort of form by the asfistance of taste and elegance yet it be easy to observe that the effect which call to the spectator arise principally from the colour of all the part by which we be to understand the claro obscuro and the general harmony of colour as also such as we call local or colour which faithfully imitate those of any particular object but all this hinder not the other part of art from be necessary to help forward the whole work and from mutually assist each other some to form other to adorn the object paint in order to give they taste and grace that may in strike respectively both lover and painter and in word may please every one thus as it be the duty of painting both to call and please when it have call the spectator it must necessarily entertain he with all the various beauty of which it be capable must now proceed to set the several part of painting in they natural order that may confirm the reader in the idea have be endeavour to establisn and because this idea be found on truth shall begin the follow discourse with treatise on this subject which be the more oblige to do because the subject of trutb and the idea of painting be so nearly ally as to be almost the same thing for all the part of painting be no further valuable than they ear this character of truth after the idea of painting which have endeavour to establisn and after the trea tise upon truth snall speak of the other part of painting and if the grounds go upon be solid they may possibly sereen I well from the false critick as from those who be ignorant of the true principle of the art such principle will endeavour to esta bish as may serve to build rampart and palace for painting where great painter rue critick lover of painting and all per on of good taste may safely retire in vention will furnish the thought of the structure and chuse its painter like situation which though fanciful and sometimes even wild will nevertheless be extremely agree able invention will also prepare the ma¬ erial and disposition compart the room or receive all the solid beauty and orna nent we would place in they after in vention and disposition design and colour and they dependency be ready to perform they part in execute the building co coure will visit every thing and every there distribute its gift accord to the exigence and propriety of the place and pointly with design will chuse the furniture of the palace design also will by way of pre eminence have alone the charge of over see the architecture as colour will have that of chuse the picture and both will co operate to put the finish hand to the structure the situation to make it commodious for painting must be diversify with object produce without art or culture as rock cascade mountain rivulet forest sky and field all in a uncommon manner yet keep within the bound of probability and which will be more particularly handle in my discourse on landskip among other inhabitant of this palace painting will receive poesy with all the mark of distinction fhe deserve where they will live together like two kind sister who ought to love one another without jealousy and without dispute it be with parallel between these two art intend to close this system of painting some person of good sense have blame I for make use of the defect in raphael to confirm my sentiment on the idea of painting raphael who ought not to be mention say they but as the model of all perfection consider the general and esta¬ blish reputation he have acquire they own have reason in the main yet say that ought to chuse some other example and join with people of understanding in create raghael with more complaisance they add that the curious be already set against against I because they have imagine that preferr ' ruben to raphael and that the example make use of to confirm my senti ment would rather irritate than convince they and would likewise with they very much lessen the opinion which the world entertain of my skill in painting can only answer that choose raphael x x as a example that be what often happen at the first sight of he work for no other reason but because he excel more in all the part of he art than any other painter and because should reap more advantage and more certainly establisn my sentiment on the idea of painting if set it in oppo¬ sition to all raphael 's perfection to chuse raphael therefore as a example because he possess more excellency than any other painter and in order to shew that all excel lency lose much of they lustre when they be not accompany with colour which call the curious to admire they can never be think to argue contempt of he my intention be not to write either for the learn in painting or the ignorant but for such as be bear with a inclination to this sine art and may at least have improve it by converse with able judge and learn painter write in word for young pupil who may have set out in right path and for all those who after acquire some tincture of design and colour have impartially impartially examine the best work and be docile enough to embrace those truth which may be hint to they as for half learn painter who have set out in the wrong path and most of the book learn they usually maintain the false idea which they have hastily embraced and though stranger to design or colour or ra phael or ruben will talk of those two painter accord to a antient tradition which though much lessen of late by good reflection have yet leave its imprefsion on the mind of many as for myself can say that have in my travels view ' with great attention the finest picture in europe have study they with fondness and such part as nature have bestow upon I ihave improve and employ this way ladmire every thing that be good in the work of the great master without respect to name or any other com plaisance value the several celebrate sclool ilove raphael titian and ruben and do my utmost endeavour to dive into the rare accomplishment of those great painter but whatever perfection they may have love truth better truth alone be what should be have in view especially by one who write for the publick this be respect to which the publick have right and there fore thought could not excuse myself from pay it of truth in painting man however much give to lie hate nothing so much as lye and the surest way to gain he confidence be to treat he with sincerity tis needless therefore to make a encomium here on truth since every one love it and feel the beauty of it nothing be good nothing please without truth ' tis reason equity good sense and the basis of all perfection tis the aim of the science and all the art whose object be imitation have no other ten dency than to instruct and direct man by faithful imitation of nature wherefore those who either cultivate the science or exercise the art can not say that they en deavour have be crowned with success if after all they pain they have not do cover that truth which they look upon as the reward of they study besides the general truth which ought to appear in all thing there be truth pecu¬ liar to each of the fine art and to each of the science my present design be to do cover what be truth in painting and of what importance it be to the painter to express it well but before we enter on the subject it must be premise with regard to imitation in painting that though the true object be the natural one and the feign object that in the picture the latter be nevertheless call true when it be perfect imitation of the former it be therefore the truth in painting which shall endeavour to do cover in order to shew its worth and nece sity observe in painting three kind of truth viz the simple the ideal and the compound or perfect truth the simple which call the primary truth be plain and faithful imitation of the motion that express nature and of those object which the painter have choose for he copy such as they appear to the eye at first sight so as the carnation may seem to be real flesh and the drapery real stuff in they several variety and each object main tain the true character of its nature and by the force of the claro obsucro and of the union of colour the several paint object may appear to have relief and the whole be harmonious in all natural thing this simple truth discover the way by which the painter may gain he end which be such strong and lively imitation of nature that it may seem possible for the figure to come out of the picture as it be in order to talk with those who look at they but let it be here observe that from this idea of the simple or primary truth abstract all the beauty that may embellish it and which either the painter 's genius or the rule of art may add to it in order to make the whole perfect the ideal truth be choice of various perfection not meet in any single copy but take from several and commonly from those of the antique this kind of truth comprehend a abun dance of thought richnef of invention propriety of attitude a elegance of out line choice of fine expression a hand some cast of drapery and in word every thing that can without alter the primary truth make it more move and more agreeable but as all these perfection can only subsist in idea with regard to paint ing they have need of lawful subject both to preserve and set they off to advan tage and this lawful subject be simple truth in the same manner as moral virtue be only ideal if they have not lawfui subject that be subject properly dispose to receive and support they without which they would be but the shadow of virtue simple truth subsist of itself and give both relisn and spirit to the perfection which attend it and if it do not alone lead to a imitation of perfect nature which depend upon the choice the painter make of he copy it lead at least to a imitation of to ture which in general be the end of paint ing ideal truth of itself must be allow ' to lead into most agreeable path yet it be such as do not carry the painter to the end of he art but leave he short of it and the only affistance he can expect to come to the end of he career must proceed from thé simple truti hence it appear that the simple and ideal truth together make perfect compound and mutually assist each other with this difference that the former overpower and dart its ray through all the perfection that be join to it the third truth as compound of the other two give the last hand to art and the perfect imitation of fine nature it carry so beautiful probability as often appear to be more true than truth itself and the reason be that by the aforesaid conjunction che primary truth seize the spectator salve many negligency and produce it be effect the first without we attend to it this third truth be the mark which hi thert of no man have hit we can only say that those who have come the nearest to it be the most accomplish the simple and ideal truth have be divide accord to the genius and education of the painter who possess they giorgione titian pordenon old palma the bassan and all tie venetian school have no other merit but that of pos sess the primary truth and leonardo do vinci raphael julio romano polydore do caravaggio poussin and some other of the roman school have gain they greatest repu tation by ideal truth especially raphael who besides the beauty of ideal be master of considerable part of the simple truth by which mean he come nearer to that truth which be perfect than any other italian in effect it appear that in order to imitate nature in its variety this painter usually make use of as many different to tural object as he have figure to introduce into he piece and if at the same time he add some thing of he own it be to make he drawing the more regular and more expressive but always preserve truth and the distinguishing character of what he copy though he be not thoroughly master of simple truth in the other part of painting yet he have such taste for truth that in most of the part of the human body which he design after nature he draw they on paper as they really be in order to be testimony of the most simple truth and to be join to the idea he have of the beauty derive from the antique a ad mirable conductl in which no painter have be so successful as rapbael since the re vival of the art now if perfect truth be compose of the simple and ideal painter may be say to excel in proportion to the degree wherein they possess those several truth and to the happy facility they have acquire of join they into one compound atter have settle what truth be in painting it be proper to inquire whether those painter who exaggerate or overdo the out line of they figure in order to seem learn have not abandon truth by exceed the bound of regular simplicity in this point painter use the word charge to signify any thing that exceed now as every thing that exceed be beyond proba bility ' tis certain that whatever may be say to be charge be contrary to the truth which we would establisn et there be charge out line which please because they be above the lowliness of ordinary nature and because they carry with they a air of freedom and certain idea of great taste which deceive most painter who call these excess the grande maniere but those who have true idea of correctness of re gular simplicity and of the elegance of nature will look upon these excess as fuperfluous since they always adulterate the truth yet one can not help praising some overcharge thing in great work when the distance from whence they must be view soften they to the eye or when they be use with such discretion as make the character of truth more apparent some painter there have be who in stead of reasonable moderation in they de sign have affect to express they out line and muscling with greater exactness than the art of painting require they motive be to gain to themselves the reputation of be fkilful in design and anatomy but they motive like they picture have cer tain air of pedantry more capable of lessen the beauty of they work than of increase they reputation it must indeed be grant that the artist ought to understand anatomy and the sharp swell which be its conse quence because anatomy be the basis of de signing and because these swell may lead those to perfection who know how to take and to leave as much of they as be necessary to make exactness and simplicity of design agree with good taste such thing may also be tolerable and often agreeable in mere sketch of picture and the learn painter may profitably make use of they when he begin and dead colour but should cut they off when he would have he work appear in perfection as the architect strike he centre as soon as the arch be set on the whole the antique statue which have pass at all time for the rule of beauty have nothing charge nothing af fect nor be there any thing of this kind in the work of those who have always imi tate they as raphael poussin domini chino and some other not only all affectation be displeasing but nature besides be obscure and overcast by bad habit which painter call manner the better to understand this principle ' tis proper to know that there be two fort of painter some and they be but few paint accord to the principle of art and make truth so obvious in they work as to stop and entertain the spectator other work only practically by a expeditious habit which they have either take up without reason or learn of they master without reflection though these sometimes do well either by chance or by the help of they memory yet they always succeed but in differently when they work on they own bottom for as they but rarely make use of the natural or else confine theiselves to they habit they never express that truth or that probability which be the sole object of true painter and the end of painting for the rest among all the fine art there be certainly none where truth ought to be so conspicuous as in pain the other art do but revive the idea of thing absent whereas this intirely supply they and make they present by the very essence of it which consist not only in pleaf but deceive the eye apelles draw he portrait so true and like both in air and every thing else relate to the face that certain horoscope maker could on sight of they tell the temperament or constitution of the person paint and what would befal he twas this painter 's care therefore rather to observe truth in he portrait than to embellish they with falsity in effect truth have in this case so many charm that it ought to be always preferr ' to borrow ' beauty since without it portrait can only preserve à vague and confufe idea of we friend and not the true character of they person what can be inferr ' from all this rea soning but that there be in painting pri¬ mary a essential truth which lead the painter directly tohis end a animated truth which not only subsist and life of itself but also give life to all the embellisbment of which it be susceptible and which ought to be join with it and that these per fection be but secondary truth which by themselves have no force to move but yet do do honour to the primary truth when add to it now this primary truth in painting be as we have say simple and faithful imitation of the motion which express to ture and of object such as at first sight they present themselves to the eye with all they variety and in theif true character it appear therefore that every painter who not only neglect the primary truth but do not take great pain to make he self thoroughly master of it will only build upon sand and will never paf for genuine imitator of nature and that the whole per fection of painting consist in the three fort of truth we have endeavour to establish rom monsieur du copy of letter guet to à lady of quality who bad send he the precede discourse and have ask bis opinion of it march discourse of truth in painting madam have better inform and pleased I than those other discourse with which you know be so well satisfied it appear to I not only to be summary of the rule but also to discover the foundation and ultimate end of they and have there earn with great pleasure the secret of reconcile two thing which take to be opposite the art of imitate nature and that of go beyond this imitation by fadd to she beauty in order to attain they and of correct she to make she more apparent the simple truth give life and motion and the ideal chuse with art every thing that can either adorn or make it move yet do not chuse but from the simple truth which indeed be barren in some part but upon the whole be rich and fruitful now if the secondary truth do not support the primary but rather overpower it and hind er it from be more apparent than any addition from the secondary art depart in this case from nature take she place instead of represent she disappoint the spectator 's expectation and not he eye and warn he of the snare instead of con ceal it from he if on the other hand the primary truth have all the truth of life and motion and be want in that nobleness exactness and grace which sometimes be only to be find elsewhere if it subsist without any aid from the secondary which be always great and perfect it please no fur the than it be agreeable and finish ' and the copy have nothing that be miss in the original the use we be therefore to make of this secondary truth be to supply every subject with those thing which it have not but inight have and such as nature have distri bute among other and thus to unite those perfection which nature have commonly separate the secondary truth be strictly speak very near as real as the primary for it do not invent it chuse from all part it study whatever may please instruct or animate nothing escape it not even what would seem to have escape it by chance it catch by means of design what do but once appear and enrich itself with thou fand different beauty that it may be always uniform and never fall into repetition tis for this reason methink that the union of these two truth have so surprising a effect for this union produce perfect imitation of what be most ingenious most move and most perfect in nature every thing here be probable because it be true but surprising because it be rare every thing strike because every thing that be capable of strike have be observe yet nothing appear affect or overdone be cause there be nothing here that be wonderful and perfect which have not be copy from nature tis depart from the rule and the end of painting to let any one beauty over power another or to aim at à reputation for any one part and not for the whole de sign skill in anatomy and even the desire to please and be approve should all be subservient to truth true painting in short ought to transport the spectator from the very first moment he see it and not to give he leave till afterwards to think of the painter and admire he art monsieur du pile have very hap pily display the character of titian for the simple truth in its greatest force and that of raphael for ennoble the simple truth with the ideal and know not whe the any more refine or more universal I thod could be find for judge of the merit of the greatest painter than go even beyond they effort and they success and point out the union of the two truth which they have endeavour after but have not attain as the utmost stretch of the art ik now not madam why say so much on this subject if not to let you see how full am of what have be read and what value set on such thing as can help repeat to you though be sensible that in so do spoil and weaken them iam madam with all imaginable respect you most humble and most obedient servant norder to observe some method in treat ing of the several part of painting we may consider it in two light either with regard to the young student or to the perfect artist lf it be consider accord to the method in which it be learn we must begin with design then treat of colour and end with composition be cause ' tis to no purpose to think what we would imitate if we know not how to imitate it and because object can only be represent by design and colour but if we consider this art in its perfection and accord to the order in which it be ex ecute and if besides we suppose the painter to have acquire perfect habit in the several part so as to execute they with facility the first part that offer itself will be invention for before he can represent object he must determine which he would tis in this second light am represent here to consider painting that may give a idea of it suitable to the taste of the greatest number of reader several author who treat of paint ing make use of the word invention to express different thing some would convey such a idea by it as they take to compre hend the whole composition of picture other have ascribe to it fertility of genius newness of thought and the method of express they and of treat the same subject in different way but though these particular be extremely proper for support ing invention for ofnament it and give it heat and life they be neither the ground nor the essence of invention for painter who be not master of all these thing may nevertheless do he part in invention by the justnef of he thought the prudence of he choice and the solidity of he judg ment invention therefore as it be but apart of composition can not give perfect idea of it for composition imply both invention and disposition ' tis one thing to invent ob ject and another to place they rightly shall not stop here to refute the other idea which have be entertained of invention as hope to define it in so true and obvious manner that imagine there will be no diversity of opinion on this subject take invention to be choice of the object that enter into the composition of the subject which the painter would treat of say choice because object ought not to be bring into picture inconsiderately and without contribute to the expression and character of the subject say that these object ought to enter into the compo¬ sition but not wholly compose the picture to the end that invention may not be con found with disposition and may leave it at full liberty to act its part which consist in place the aforesaid object to the best advantage poet as well as orator have they different style to expref themselves in be cording to the several subject they treat of and upon this depend the choice of word of harmony and of the turn which they give to they thought tis the same in painting when the painter have choose he subject he must chuse he figure and they dependency accordingly the painter as well as the poet have he sublime style for thing that be elevate he familiar style for common thing he pastoral style for the country and so forth now though all these various style fall in with all the part of painting they be nevertheless in more particular manner the province of invention but this point would require à treatise of itself invention as it relate to painting may be consider in three respects it be either simply historical or allegorical or mystical painter with reason use the word history to signify the highest kind of paint ing which consist in bring many figure together and ' tis usual to say such painter do bistory such one paint beast such one landstip such one flower and so forth but there be difference between the division of the kind of painting and the division of invention here take the word bistory in large sense and mean by it every thing that can either fix the painter 's idea or inform the spectator say there fore that invention simply historical be such choice of object as simply of themselves represent à subject this kind of invention comprise not only all sort of history whether true or fabulous as relate by author or establish by tradition but also portraiture view of country beast and all the production of art and nature for in painting picture the artist must not only have he pallet and pen cil in readiness but as we have say he must before he begin resolve upon what he would paint though but flower fruit plant or insect for though the artist may confine he genius to such thing they be often capable of yield instruction as they have they particular virtue and propriety those who have write of they and have set off they work with demonstrative figure be call historian and we say the history of plant the history of animal as well as that of alexander the great invention simply historical have therefore its degree and be more or lef valuable accord to the quantity of its matter the nature of its choice and the genius with which it be ma¬ nage allegorical invention be choice cf object that serve to represent mn piece either wholly or partly what in fact they be not such for instance be the painting of apelles represent slander as describe by lucian such also be the moral painting of hercule place between vezus and mi nerva where those pagan deity be only introduce to shew the force of virtue and such be the picture of the school ef athen in chambet of the vatican where several figure of different time country and condition be bring together to re present philosopby the three other picture in the same chamber be draw in the same allegorical manner and if we consider the transaction record in the old testament they will appear to be partly allegorical as well as simply historical because they be the type of what should come to pass under the new llaw these be example of sub ject which be wholly allegorical the work which be but partly alle engage we attention more easily and more agreeably because the spectator ebe assist by thé mixture of figure purely historical distinguishes with pleasure the allegorical figure that be join with they we have a authentick example of this in the bas relief of the antonine column where the sculptor be to express some rain which the christian army obtain by they prayer have introduce among the sol dier rain jupiter have he beard and heir cover with water which fall from thence in abundance now jupiter be not place there as god who make part of the story but as à symbol of rain after the manner of the heathen antient author speak of the painting of they time re late many example in allegory and since the revival of the art painter have make frequent use of they and if some have abuse they 's twas because they know not that allegory be kind of language which ought to be common among several people this happen in the reign of the emperor marcus aurelius who erect the column here mention on which be represent in bas relief the war he wage with the german and sarmatian and in gratitude place on it the statue of antoninus who have adopt he to the empire and be found on receive usage and the knowledge of book and medal and choose rather than consult they to invent parti cular allegory which though ingenious could not be understand by any but themselves mysticae invention respects the chri stian religion its end be to instruct we in some mystery grounded on scripture which mystery be represent to we by several object that concur to point out some truth we mystery and the point of faith which the church have injoin furnish great many example the second council of nice have allow of set before the eye of the faithful the mystery of the trinity painter represent the father under the figure of venerable old man the son in he hu manity as he appear to he disciple after the resurrection and the holy ghest in the form of dove the last judgment the church triumphant matter relate to the law to faith and the sacrament come un der the same denomination among the many example which able painter have leave we shall mention most ingenious one colour ' sketch of which have by I and prize highly the subject be the mystery of the incarnation now have the author of this design be willing to treat the an¬ nunciation historically he might have only draw the virgin mary in plain room without other company than the angel but be be resolve to treat the subject mystically he have place she on kind of throne or half pace where on she knee she receive humbly but with dignity the angel ' em bassy whilst god the father have settle with he son the price of man redemption assist as it be at the performance of the contract the father be seat majestically on the globe of the world encompass by the celestial choir and have at he right and justification and peace which it have be agree to bestow on the whole earth he send he holy spirit to work this great mystery the holy spirit be surround with circle of angel hold each other hand and exult because mankind be to fill up the place of the bad angel several angel terminate this celestial part of the piece have in they hand different attribute which the church ascribe to the holy vir gin to shew that of all mankind she be the worthiest of the grace with which she be fill all this great sight take up the upper part of the piece beneath be the patriarch who long for the come of the messiab the prophet who foretold it the sibyl who speak of it and the little genii reconcile the passage of the sibyl with those of the prophet thus do this picture mystically display the truth and grandeur of its subject have now go through the three way in which we may conceive invention to wit as either simply historical or allego rical or mystical let we now see what they have in common one with another after which we shall speak of the quality peculiar to each of they painter of genius find in all the part of he art ample matter to make it appear but the part that give he most opportunity of shew he sense imagin ation and judgment be without doubt tis by means of invention that painting go hand in hand with poesy it be chiefly invention that gain the esteem of the better fort mean person of judgment who not satisfied with the bare imitation of object would have the choice of they to be just in order to express the subject but this very genius must be cultivate the knowledge that relate to painting because let the imagination be ever so bright it can only bring forth such thing as the understanding be already fill with and the memory supply we with no other idea but those of what we know and have see accordingly the talent of particular man be either sunk in the lowness of com mon object or else rise to the sublime by search for such as be extraordinary for this reason some painter who have cul tivate they part have happily supply want of genius and raise themselves with they subject they subject have be observe to rise and grow greater on they hand without the neceffary part of knowledge one be liable to many mistake but when we be possess of they every thing pre sent itself regularly and come insensibly into order tis nevertheless convenient for young people after have study the essential of they art and before they give publick proof of they ability to exercise they genius on all fort of subject because like new wine which violently ferment that it may be come in time more palatable they at first give themselves wholly up to the impetuosity of they imagination but when they first sally be evaporate the image of they conception without lose they force grow more clear and purify but if they do not trust so much to they own understandings as not to consult they know friend on the kind and measure of they talent they ought to consider they as plant which must be set in particular fort of ground prefer ably to any other in order to yield its fruit in its season in the same manner if the painter can chuse he owa subject he ought to prefer that which best suit the nature and compass of he genius aad afford he mat ter for exercise it in the manner for which he be best furnish to give heat to he imagination imagination he must turn he idea into dif fere not shape he must read he subject se veral time with great attention that lively image of it may be form ' in he mind and that in proportion to the greatness of the matter he may suffer himself to be tran ported even to enthusiasm which be the distinguishing quality both of great painter and great poet as the painter can represent in the same piece no more of nature than what be to be see at one glance of the eye he can not for this reason exhibit in the same piece what pass at different time and if some have take the liberty to do otherwise they be inexcusable for it unlefs they be force to do it by those who employ they or unless they mean to compose mysterious or allegorical subject like the picture of the school of athen but after the subject be well fix it be extremely proper to introduce such circum stance as serve to fortify its character and make it know they must not however be so numerous as to tire the attention but rather so judiciously choose as to give a agreeable exercise to the mind these cir cumstance relate to place time and per son thus whilst the artist be instruct the spectator he ought besides to divert he with variety this variety appear in the sex age country condition atti tude tude expression diversity of animal stuff tree building and every thing that can exercise the mind and properly set off the scene of the picture would not how ever approve of this abundance of object and of this variety how pleasing soever in other respects but so far as it be suitable to the subject or at least have some instructive relation to it for as some subject breathe nothing but joy and tranquillity so there be other which be either mournful or tumultuary some require gravity dignity respect silence and sometimes solitude and consequently admit but of few figure as there be other which be susceptible of great many and of such variety of object as the skill of the painter think proper to introduce for the whole must have ten dency to the hero of the subject and pre serve a unity well express and well con ceive these be the general property of the three kind of invention it remain to con¬ sider what be peculiar to each of they among the property of which in vention simply historical be susceptible observe three fidelity perspicuity or clear ness and good choice have elsewhere obierve that fidelity in history be not the essence of painting but only necessary ap pendage to the art for though the painter be only a historian by accident he be ne vertheless vertheless to blame if he do not acquit himself well in what he have undertake by fidelity mean a exact imitation of thing whether true or fabulous as tran mit to we either by author or by tra dition and it be not to be doubt but the more fidelity such a imitation preserve the greater force do it give to the invention and the greater value to the painting but if the painter have be careful to stamp he subject with some mark of erudition such as may awaken the spectator 's attention without destroy the truth of history if he can blend some poetical passage with those historical fact that admit of it in word if he can treat he subject with that moderate licence which be allow both to painter and poet he will make he inven tion sublime and will gain himself distin guish reputation fidelity therefore be the first property of historical invention the second be perspicuity or clearness so that the spectator if sufficiently acquainted with history may easily discover what par ticular passage the painter would represent whence it follow that all ambiguity must be remove by some peculiar mark of the subject that may distinguish it from any other speak here of subject which be uncommon for these which be generally know and be often repeat have no need of this precaution if the subject be not not enough know or if the painter can not well bring in some object to explain it he ought to make no difficulty of insert motto or inscription of the many ex ample of this kind both antient and mo dern shall chusé only two which be well know one of raphael and the other of hannibal caracche the latter have paint in the farnesian gallery the story of anchise endeavour to give proof of he love to the goddess venus lest anchise should be mistaken for adonis have artfully make use of virgil 's word genus unde latinum which he write beneath the bed on the bottom of the alcove and raphael on he parnassis have place sappho among the poet have writ the name of that learn dame lest sne should be take for one of the mus the third property of historical inven tion be the choice of the subject supposing the painter have the power to chuse for re markable subject furnisn most opportunity of enrich the scene and command attention but if the painter bestow he pencil upon little subject he must endear vour to make it great by the extraordinary manner in which he treat it allegorical invention in like man er have three property the first be that allud to the origin of the italian race it it be intelligible tis great fault to keep the attention long in suspense by means of new invent symbol as ' tis perfection to entertain it for some moment by such alle gorical figure as be know generally re ceive and ingeniously employ obscurity tire the mind but perspicuity make it en¬ joy the discovery with pleasure the second property of allegory be its authority caesar ripa have write volume upon this point which be in the hand of the painter but the best thing in this author be he extract from the antique medal and indeed the best authority for allegory be antiquity because ' tis incontestable the third property of allegory be that it be necessary for as far as history can be explain by fimple object which belong it ' tis needlef to seek for foreign aid which serve rather to embarass than adorn such subject mystical invention as it be intirely devote to religion must be pure and free from any mixture of object draw from fable it must be grounded either on scripture or the ecclesiastical history we have ample matter for this kind of invention in we sa viour ' parable and in the apocalypse obscurity of which we ought to reve rence but be not oblige to imitate the holy spirit which breathe where it please sicut tenebræ ejus ita et lume ejus nake itself intelligible when it please but he painter who can neither penetrate nor iter the spectator 's understanding ought to se he utmost effort to be understand as nothing be more sacred more grand nore permanent than the mystery of we eligion they can 's be treat in style that too majestick all that please do not lway please and the greatest pleasure ommonly end in aversion but that which reate a idea of grandeur and magnificence ndure for ever to conclude in whatever manner the part of invention be discharge it must ap pear to be the effect of a easy genius rather than of laborious reflection and as there be talent for attain facility there be also talent for conceal labour and each have heir merit and they partizans happy be the man on whom nature have bestow genius able to run through the vast race in this part of painting and to chuse he object well in order to make he subject intelligible in order to enrich it and instruct the spectator but still more happy be the artist who after know every thing that contribute to fine invention know himself still better and make proper esti mate of he own ability since it be the glory of painter not so much to undertake great thing as to execute well what he undertake description of the school of athen painting of raphael refer to in the precede discourse of invention this picture usually call the scheol of athen have be variously under stand by those who have describe it and it be surprising that among other who have publisn a explication of it vasari cotemporary of rapbael should have make so great mistake as to neglect con sul he that he might draw from the source itself those instruction he have oc casion for to explain work which have make so much noise throughout all italy this author who first write of it say pat it be the agreement of philosophy and astro logy with divinity and yet there appear no mark of divinity in the whole compo sition the engraver of it have as im properly put a inscription under it take from from the act of st paul to induce we to be¬ fieve that this apostle after have meet with a altar on which be inscrih to the unknown god be here present himself before the judge of the areopagus to give they the knowledge of the god they be ignorant of and to instruct they in the article of the resurrection of the dead about which the epicurean and stoick be then disputing agostino venetiano be yet more grosly mistaken when in he print of five or six of the figure which be towards the right hand in the aforesaid piece he have suppose the philosopher who be write to be st maré and the young man with one knee on the ground to be the angel gabriel holding table on which be engrave the angel 's salutation ave maria as ' tis needless to spend much time here in refute these error which be equally gross shall only describe the four ciel figure which correspond with the four subject paint in the chamber where this stand and which evidently point they out the first represent tbeology with these word scientia divinarum rerum thie knowledge of thing divine the second be philosopby with these word causarum cognitio the know ledge of cause the third be jurisprudence or knowlédge in the law with these word d jus situmi unicuique do right to every one and the fourth reprefent poesy with these word numine afflatur inspire by the deity now in the piece call the school of athen the figure of pbilosophy be place uppermost and therefore it can not be doubt but that this painting represent philosopby as will appear more clearly from the particular description be go to give of it the scene open with building of mag nificent architecture consist of arcade and pilaster and so dispose as to render the prospect of they gradually diminish and the break advantageous and to give grand idea of the subject the place be fill with philosopher mathematician and other who give themselves up to the science and as it be only through course of time that philosophy be come to that degree of per fection in which we see it raphael who have mind to represent this science by a af sembly of philosopher could not effect it by put together only those of one age the painter 's intention be not to compose simple history but a allegory where the diversity of time and country do not hinder the unity of the subject raphael have take this method in draw the three other other picture in the same chamber to wit theology jurisprudence and poesy in the first of which we see the several father of the church in the second the lawyer and in the third the poet of all age from the disposition of the sigure in this piece and from the nature of they seve ral employment we may safely conclude that it must be meet and society of man possess of several part of know ledge such as the philosopher nay we discover among they pythagora socrate plato aristotie and they disciple and mix with they we see person employd in mathematical science in the middle of the piece be place uppermost the two most celebrate philo sopher of antiquity plato and aristotle the former hold under he left arm book the stalian word for the title of which be write timeo plato finest dialogue and as this book treat mystically of natural thing compare to divine this philosopher have he right arm raise and point with it to heaven as the supreme cause of all thing on the leave side of plato be he disciple aristotle holding book on he thigh on which be write the word ethica or the science of manners to which this philosopher chiefly apply himself and he arm be stretch out give he the attitude of peace peace maker and moderator of the pas sion character perfectly agreeable to moral philosophy on each side of these two great philoso phers be they disciple of all age so art fully group and dispose as to set off the two heroes of the piece to great advantage and though the attitude of these disciple be very different yet they all shew great attention to the word of they master behinp plato hearer be socrate turn towards alcibiade who be opposite to he both be in profile the former be know by he bald head and flat nose and the latter be handsome young inan in warrior 's dress with he flaxax hair flow on he shoulder he armour edg with gold ornament and one hand on he side and the other on he sword and as he be both philosopher and warrior he give great attention to the discourse of socrate which the latter enforce with very expressive action he extend both he hand and take with he right the tip of the first singer of the leave to shew that he be explain and illustrate he thought so as to make they thoroughly understand while all he disciple be attend to what he say next to alcibiade be antisthene the currier in whom socrate discover so great propensity to philosophy that he instruct he in the principle of it and antisthe nes nes quit he trade become famous professor of moral philosophy upon which he write thirty three dialogue tis he who be the chief of the cynick sect the painter to vary he figure and give they motion have set behind alcibiade man turn about and hold out he hand to call fater the italian manner and hasten à ser vant who bring book and great roll of papers to which the antient give the name of volume and behind the servant appear the face of another who with he and to he cap seem respectfully to a wer the person who call among aristotle 's disciple raphael have in like manner displayd they attention to they master 's word one among the rest have understand the demonstration of archimed be leave accord to the greek custom the mathematick school to go to that of pbilosopby and meeting with person on the way he inquire of he where the science may be learn and be direct to aristotle and plato hard by this figure be studious young man lean upon the base of pilaster with he leg across and write down on paper what he want to learn while a old man learn on the same base and rest he chin on he hand be seriously weigh what the young man have be rite among other figure that terminate thio side of the picture be democritus wrape up in he cloak he walk in the asfembly after the manner of blind man by the help of he stick for near the end of he life he blinded himself of he ewn accord that he mighe not be disturb in he philosophical contemplation the painter may have re present he in great old age to shew that man should labour even to he grave to and undeceive himself in the group on the right side of the piece and on the first ground ' tis easy to discovet pythagora seat who write the principle of he philosophy take from che harmonick proportion in musick next to he be young man holding table on which be in greeè character the accord and consonance of sing which be read cause diapente diapason diate saron— term well know to able mo fician it be even say that this philo sopher be the author of the demonstration of these consonance of which plato he disciple form the accord and barmonick proportion of the soul pythagora sit profile wise with book in he lap he appear intent upon shew the relation of mufical number to cic de finito bon et mal idem tusc aal gel ex laborum mimis the the science of natural thing near to he be he disciple empedocle epicharme ar¬ chita one sit by he master and bald head write on he knee have he ink horn in one hand and he pen hold up in the other he eye very open and mouth shut to shew he very careful not to let any of he master 's writing be lose behind this philosopher another do ciple with he hand on he breast come forward to lcok into the book he have cap on he chin be shave but he have bold pair of whisker and he cloak be clasp all this decoration probably tend only to shew the variety raphael always aim at in he work behind this group be see the face and hand of another philosopher who some what stoop open he two first finger as if he be reckon after the italian man ner and seem to explain the diapason which be the double consonance describe by pythagora in corner of the piece be person shave with book rest on the pedestal of column in which he be earnestly write this figure be think to be the portrait of some officer in the pope 's palace because he be crowned with oak leave which be the device of pope julius ii to whom as he benefactor and the reviver of the golden age in italy with regard to the fine art raphael dedicated this work hard by and at the extremity of the picture we see a old man with little boy in he arm who in manner suitable to he age reach out he hand to book wherein the old man be write it look as if he have bring the boy thither purely to discover whether he have any inclination for the science intimate that we can not too soon discover and cultivate the talent which nature have give we on the side of this group of figure ap pear young man of noble mien in white cloak fring with gold with he hand on he breast this be believe to be fran cisco maria de la rovere the pope 's nephew and that he be introduce into the piece on account of the love he have for the fine art little more before pythagora an¬ other of he disciple with one foot on stone and he knee raise appear with book in one hand and copy with the other some remarkable passage which he would reconcile with he master 's sentiment this man may well be take for terpander or nicomachus or some other disciple of pythagora who believe that the motion of the star depend on mufical principle more forward we see philosopher by himself lean with he elbow on marble base base have pen in he hand and look stedfastly upon the ground as if he be intent upon the solution of some great diffi iculty he be coarsely clad and he stoeking hang out he heel to shew that philo sopher little regard dress and place all they pleasure in reflection and the improvement of they understanding on the second step appear diogen by himself half naked and with he cloak sling back and by himn be he dish as he badge of distinction he attitude be negli go and become cynick who be so much take up with morality as to despise wordly pomp and grandeur on the left side be see several mathe matician whose science though it consist of what fall under the sense yet have re lation to philosophy which consider thing intellectual the first of these person be archimed under the likeness of the archi tect bramante he stoops and with arm bend downwards be measure with the compass a bexagonal figure compose of two equilateral triangle and seem to demonstrate some property of it to he scholar he have about he four disciple well make who in different action discover eitheir ardent desire to learn or the pleasure they have in conceive what they be teach they be paint youthful be cause it be necessary to learn the mathema tick tick before one could proceed to philosophy the first of they have knee on the ground he body bent and he hand on he thigh and the finger spread he be attentive to the aforesaid demonstrative figure the second disciple who stand behind he rest he hand on he companion back thrust out he head and earnestly observe the motion of the compass the two other disciple next to archimed be advanced very for ward to see commodioussy the foremost have knee on the ground turn about and shew the figure to the person behind he who stoop discover to we by he arm cross and advanced he admiration and the pleasure he sind in instruction vasarz will have this to be the figure of frederick il duke of mantua who be then at rome behinp archimed be two philoso phers one hold the celestial globe and the other the terrestrial the first by he garb seem to have some relation to the chaldaean the inventor of aftronomy and the other who turn he back and have royal crown on he head be presume to be zoroaster king of the bactrians who be great astronomer and great philosopher these two sage be converse with two young man who be at the corner of the picture one of whom be raphael himself in in this learn sublime and judicious manner have raphael choose he subject and thus produce one of the finest invention of the ' kind that ever appear but not con tent to illustrate he subject by the several person who enter into it he be also de sirous that the statue and bas relief which adorn thé architecture should contribute to the richness and expression of he thought accordingly the two statue one on each side the picture be those of apollo and mi nerva the deity who preside over art and science in the bas relief under apollo 's figure be represent the emblém of zraf cible and concupiscible passion tne one by furzous man who outrageoussy insult all he meet with and the other by triton em brace nymph ' on the element which give birth to venus and as vice be only to be subdue by virtue which be its opposite the painter have in the bas relief under mi herva ' figure place virtue sit on the cloud with one hand on she breast the seat of valour and indicate to mortal by the sceptre in she other hand the power of she empire near she be the figure of the lion in the zodiack the emblem of force which in the moral science can only be gain by good habit thus have raphael with beauty of genius delicacy of thought and solidity of judgment set before we the allegorical subyect of philosopby ue of disposition my division of painting ihave assign to composition which be the first part of it two thing to wit invention and disposition and in treat of invention have shew that it consist in find object proper for the subject the painter would be present if they be not well distribute the composition will never give full satisfaction to the unbiass spectator nor have ge neral approbation but however advanta geous the subject be however ingenious the invention however faithful the imitation of the object choose oconomy and good order be what give value to every thing and in the fine art draw attention and fix it till the mind be replenish with whatever in such work can both instruct and please and this aconomy properly call disposition in which be six part viz the distribution of object in general the group the choice of attitude the contrast the the cast of drapery and the effect of the whole together where shall occasionally speak of harmony and enthusiasm these in they order shall examine as succinctly and clearly as possibly can of the distribution of object in general as the subject which painter may treat of be innumerable it be not possible to relate they all here much less to shew they par ticular disposition but good sense and the nature of the matter must in general de termine the artist to assign to he object such place as be proper to make the composition good in compofitzon the painter ought to con trive as much as he possibly can that the spectator may at first sight be strike with the character of the subject or at least may after some moment of reflection take the principal scope of it it will greatly con tribute to this end that he place the hero and the principal figure in the most con spicuous place yet this must be do without affectation and in such man ner as the subject and probability require for oconomy or management depend upon the nature of the subject which may be either pathetick or gay heroick or po pular tender or terrible in short the pic ture must have more or less motion as its subie ct subject be more or less stir or still as the subject point out to the artist the proper ceconomy in the disposition of object so distribution in its turn wonderfully con tribute to the expression of the subject give both force and grace to what be in ven ted prevent confusion in the figure and make every thing in the picture more clear more apparent and more capable to pro duce the effect above mention of call to aud detain the spectator of the group the aforesaid distribution of object do in general respect group and the group proceed from the join of object together now this join or combination may be con sider two way either with regard to design alone or with regard to the claro obscuro both of which concur to hinder the eye from be dissipate and to fix it agreeably the join of object with regard only to design that be without take in the claro obscuro principally respects human figure the action conversation or affinity of which often require that they be near one another but though these circumstance do not always happen where several person meet together yet it be sufficient that the thing be possible and that there be figure enongh enough in the composition of the picture to give the painter a opportunity of displaying he art and pleaf the eye by join the figure together when he think it agreeable and probable tis impossible to enter into such detail as to shew how these different kind of group must be manage the painter must in this case rest upon he own genius and reflec tion nevertheless in order to form just idea and good taste of they he ought to consult the fine group in the picture of the best mafter especially raphael julio romano and polydore who have often com bine several figure in such manner as to discover all the judgment and all the beau tie that can be desire in group but before the artist make this examination he must be apprise that the join or com bination we speak of derive its best principle from the choice of attitude and fine con trast of the choice of attitude the part of painting which fall under the word attitude as it comprehend all the motion of the body and require perfect knowledge of ponderation ought to be though roughly examine in particular treatise that may have relation to design and as it likewise fall within the province of dispo sition with regard to the group we talk of shall only observe upon this occasion that whatever attitude be give to the figure let the subject be what it will this attitude must shew they beautiful part as much as the subject will permit and must besides have such turnaa without depart from probability or from the character of the figure may diffuse beauty over the action in effect there be nothing in imitation ut what be susceptible of some grace either by the choice or by the manner of imitate be graceful exprefsion of the vice as well as of the virtue the outward action of soldier have particular grace which would ill become woman as the action of woman have grace which would not become the soldier in fine the each object and chiefly depend upon its sex age and condition be the foundation of good choice and the source of the grace proper for each figure tis easy therefore to observe that the choice of fine attitude make the greatest part of the beauty of group let we now see what affistance the contrast afford in this point of the contrast if in group the attitude must not be repeat in the same view and if diversity be part of the grace of nature those grace can 's be better discover than in the variety and opposition of motion the word contrast be not much in use except among painter who take it froni the italian it signify a opposition among object with regard to line which either wholly or partly compose they it take in not only the different motion of figure but also the different situation of the member and of all other object which meet together yet in such manner as to appear without affectation and only to give more energy to the expression of the subject now the painter who dispose he object to advantage contrast not only he figure but also inanimate object that by such con trast he may breathe into they kind of life and motion contrast therefore may be def to be such a oppositzon of line that form object as make those object set off one anotber this opposition if well express give life to object command attention and in crease that gracefulness which be necessary in group at least in those that relate to design and the conjunction of attitude we have before observe that the first sort of group as relate to design princi pally belong to human figure but those group which relate to the claro obscuro take in all sort of object they require not only knowledge in the light and shade of of every particular object but also in the effect which those light and shade be can pable of produce by they asfemblage or union and it be this which be properly call the art of the claro obscuro which shall treat of with as much exactness as possible when come to speak of colour of the cast of drapery the chief beauty of drapery lie in proper cast or distribution of the fold and as they be of frequent use in group this subject must need be consider as depend ing partly on disposition therefore refer to what shall say hereafter on the subject of draperiès of the whole together the last point depend on disposition be the whole togetber which be the result of the part that compose the piece but the whole arise from the combination of se veral object must not be like number make up of several unity independent and equal among themselves but like one poeti cal whole where the great have need of the lower people and these have need of the great all the object line colour light and shade of picture be great or small strong or weak only by comparison but let let they nature quality or condition be what they will they have such relation to one another in they combination as no one in particular can supersede for the effect of the whole consist in general subordina tion where the dark heighten the light and the light set off the dark and where the merit of each part be found on mutual dependence so that we may define the whole together to be such general subor dination of object one to another as make they all concur to constitute but one now this subordination by which se veral object concur to make but one be found on two principle viz the satis faction of the eye and the effect of vision and this shall explain the eye have this in common with the other organ of sense that it care not to be obstruct in its office and it must be agree that great many people meet in one place and talk together at the same time and with the same tone of voice so as that no one in particular could be distinguished would give pain to those who hear they it be just so in picture where many object paint with equal force and illuminate by the same light would divide and perplex the sight which be draw to several part at once would be at loss where to fix or else be desirous to take in the whole whole at one view must need do it imper fectly now to hinder the eye from be do sipate we must endeavour to fix it agree ably by combinâtion of light and shade by a union of colour and by opposition wide enough to support the group and give they repose but where the picture have several group one of they must predomi nate in force and colour and besides de tach object must be so united with they ground as to make but one maf that may serve as rèpose to the principal object the satisfaction of the eye be therefore one of the foundation upon which the unity of object in painting depend the other foundation of this same unity be the effect of vision and the manner of its operation now the eye be at liberty to see all the object about it by fix succe sively on each of they but when ' tis once fix ' of all thofe object there be but one which appear in the centre of vision that can be clearly and distinctily see the rest because see by oblique ray become obscure and confused in proportion as they be out of the direct ray this truth appear as oft as we direct we eye to any object suppose my eye for instance at plate direct to the object by the strait line ab tis certain that if do not move my eye and yet would observe the other object which can can only be by oblique line to the right and leave of a shall find that though they be all in the same circular line and at the same distance from my eye yet they decrease both in force and colour in pro portion as they recede from the strait line which be the centre of vision whence it follow that vision prove the uinity of a object in nature now if nature which be wise and which in supply we want accompany those supplies with pleasure thus bring several object into one glance of the eye so as to make they but one sne instruct the painter to take the same method in such mannêr as he art and the natire of the subject will permhit this observation semm to I not unworthy of he notice if he would emhploy liis art for the satisfaction of thé eye after the examiple of nature whom he imitate another experimient may be make by thè convex mirrour which improve upon nature as to the unity of the object in vision all object that afe see there with one glance of the eye make together one whole and whole much more agreeable than that which the fame object would produce in a ordinary glaf or will venture to say even in nature itself suppose this convex mir rour to be of à reasonable size and not one of those which be segment of small circle impair the form of object too much let I observe by the way that glass of this sort which be become pretty rare might be usefully consult for particular object as well as in general for the whole together after all the painter must consult he self in he undertakings for if he work be large he may compose it of several group which may after the first view be capable of fix the eye by the help of well ma¬ nage repose and become in they turn so many centre of vifion thus the judicious painter ought to contrive so that after the first view let he work be ever so large the eye may take it in successively it remain that we now speak of win derful effect which the whole together pro¬ duce and it be that of put all the object into harmony for harmony where ever it appear proceed from arrangement and good order there be harmony in moral as well as in natural philosophy in the con duct of human life as well as in the pro¬ portion of the human body and in short in every thing that consist of part which however different from one another yet agree to make but one whole more or less general now as this order must be sup pose to exist in all part of painting sepa¬ rately we must infer that each part have its particular harmony but it be not enough that each part have its particular arrangement and propriety they must all agree together in in the picture and make but one harmo nious whole in the same manner as it be not enough in concert of musick that each part be hear distinctly and follow the particular arrangement of its note they must all agree together in harmony which unite they and which out of several par ticular whole make but orie whole that be general this be what painting do by the subordination of object group colour and light in the general of picture there be in painting several sort of harmony the sweet and the temperate as usually practise by correggio and guido reni and the strong and great as that of giorgione titian and caravaggio and these may be in different degree accord to place time light and the bour of the day great light in close place produce strong shade the same in a open country require break colour and sweet shadow ing in short the skilful painter know what use he ought to make not only of the season of the year but of the time of the day and of the accident that happen either in the sky or on the earth in order to bring all as we have say into one har monious whole this be the idea have conceive of what be call in painting the whole together and have endeavour to make it under stand as machine whose wheel give each other mutual assistance as body whose member have mutual dependence and in short as a harmonious oconomy which stop and entertain the spectator and invite he to please himself with con template the particular beauty of the picture if we do but little reflect on what have say of disposition we shall find that this part of painting as it include great many other be of very great consequence because it give value to every thing that invention have supply it with and to every thing that be most proper to make a impre sion upon the eye and the mind of the spectator able painter may know by they own experience that in order to succeed in so refiry part they must rise higher than ordinary and as it be be transport out of themselves which give I occasion to say something here of enthusiasm and the sublime of enthusiasm enthusiasm be transport of the mind which make we conceive thing after sublime surprising and probable manner now as he who consider work be raise to that degree of elevation which he find in it so the transport of mind which come up up to enthusiasin be common both to the painter and the spectator yet with this diffèrence that it have cost the painter course of labour and repeat effort to heat he imagination and bring he work to the per fection of enthusiasin whereas the spectator without have the trouble to examine par ticular find himself transport at once without he knowledge and as it be without he consent to that degrae of en thusiasm which the painter inspire though truth always please because tis the basis of all perfcction yet ' tis often insipid when it stand alone but join to enthusiasm it raise the soul to kind of admiration mix with astonishment and ravish the mind with such violence as leave it no time to bethink itself have comprehend the sublime in the definition of enthusiasm because it be the effect and production of it enthusialin com prehend the sublime in the same manner as the trunk contain the branch which it send forth on all side or rather enthu siasm be as it be the sun which by its heat and vivify influence produce ele vate thought and bring they to such state of maturity as we call the sublime but as entbusiasin and the sublinie both tend to elevate the understanding we may con clude they to be of the same nature with this difference that enthusiasm be rapture that carry the soul above the sublime of which it be the source and have its chief effec in the thought and the whole together of work whereas the sublime be perceive equally both in the general and in the par ticular of all the part enthufiasm be side have this peculiarity that its effect be more instantaneous whereas the sublime require at least some moment beforê it can be see in all its force enthusiasm elevate insensibly and transport we as it be from one country to another without we perceive it other wise than by the pleafure it cause in short enthusiasm methink seize we and we seize the sublime tis therefore to this surprifing but just and reasonable pitch that the patinter as well as the poet must raise he work if he would attain to that extraor dinary probability which shake the heart and give both painting and poesy they merit some fiery genius ' have mistaken the sally of they imagination for real enthusiasin though at bottom the abundance and vi vacity of they production be but the dream of sick person some whimsical dream would indeed if little temper give much genius to the composition of picture and agreeably rouse the attention poetick fiction as plutarch say be but the the dream of wake man but we may say likewise that some production be only the dream of man in burn fever which have no connexion and the dan gerous extravagance of which ought to be avoid it be certain that man of fiery genius easily give into enthufiasm because they imagination be almost always upon the stretch but such as burn with gentle fire and have but moderate vivacity join with sound judgment may slide into enthu siasm by degree and even make it more regular by the solidity of they part if they do not so easily and so readily enter into this fury of the painter they suffer it at least to seize they by little and little because they reflection have enable they to see and to feel every thing and because there be not only many degree of enthu fiasm but likewise many way of attain it if painter of this sort have write subject to handle they ought to read it over and over with application and if it be not write it be proper they should chuse from among the quality of the subject such as will best furnisn they with circumstance for set they part at work and keep they in motion and when they have thus warm they imagination by the elevation of they conception they will at length arrive arrive at enthusiasm and fill the spectator with admiration to dispose the mind to enthusiasm ge nerally speak nothing be better than to view the work of great master and to read good author either historian or poet be cause of the elevation of they thought the noblenef of they expression and the power which example have over the human mind longinus in he treatise on the sublime advise those who be to write any thing that require the great and the wonder¬ ful to look upon great author as à taper to enlighten they and to afk themselves — honp would homer bave express this would plato demosthene or thucy dide bave turn it è the painter accord ingly may upon the like occasion afk himself hoie would raphael titian or correggio have concerve design order and paint what be go to repréfent à or else as the same longinus say let we suppose à tribunal of the greatest master before whom we must give a account of we performance what ardor would not the painter feel on the bare thought of see such excellent man who be theobject of he ad miration and confider they as he judge hint be of use to all painter they will inflame those who be bear with chap genius aijd even those to whom nature have not be so liberal will by this means feel at least some degree of heat diffusing itself in they work have endeavour to shew in do course of invention after what manner we must chuse object suitable to the sub ject and have now speak of dispo sition shew the order in which those object must be range so as to compose one ad vantageous whole thus by join toge the invention and disposition have endea vour to give the best idea could of that important part of painting which be call composition answer to some objection among the objection which may be make to what have be observe find two which it be very proper to answer one be against the unity of the object and the other against enthusiasmn with regard to the former it may be urge that the demonstration which have be give of vision to establish the unity of the object intirely destroy it because tis not necessary to confine the eye since in any part of the picture to which it be carry it will naturally fix itself and there by make a unity of object without the aid of the principle of art of disposition to this make two answer first that ' tis not proper to leave the eye at li berty to gaze at random because if it should happen to be detain on any one side of the picture this will frustrate the painter 's in tention who accord to the best ap prove probability must need have place he chief object in the middle and the by object towards the side of the picture and with good reason since upon such dispo sition often depend the knowledge of the whole thought of the picture whence it follow that the eye must be fix and that the painter ought to determine it to settle on that part of he piece which he think most proper for the effect of the whole the second answer be that with respect to the sense all object of pleasure require not only the agreeablenefs they have receive from nature but also the help of art to make they effect more lively by the second objection it may be insi nuat that enthusiasm often carry some genius ' too far and make they infensibly pass over many fault but the answer be easy such transport be not true enthusiasm because it exceed the bound of that exact ness and probability which lay down own indeed that one of the effect of en thusiasm be that it often hide some fault by means of the transport it generally cause but this be no great misfortune for in fact enthusiasm enthusiasm with some fault will always be prefer to correct mediocrity be cause it ravish the soul without give it time to examine any thing or to reflect on particular and yet properly speak this effect proceed not so much from enthusiasm as from we mind which sometimes when they be transport exceed the bound of probability ir it be still object that all say of enthusiasm may be ascribe to the sublime answer that this depend on the idea which every one fix upon these two word and shall at all time be ready to grant that they be much the same notwithstand ing any difference have make between they of of design the word defign as it relate to painting be take in threë diffefent seny first it signify the intire thought of work light shade and sometimes even coloured and in this sense it be not consider as one of the part of painting but only as the idea of the picture whiéh the painter have in he thought secondly it signify the representation of some part of a human figure or of a animal or of piece of drapery all take from the life in order to be put into some part of picture and to stand for a evidence of truth and in this sense it be call study lastly it be take for the boundary or out line of object for the measure and pro portion of exterior form and then ' tis repute one of the part of painting now if design be as it really be the circumscribe of exterior form and if they to such measure and propor tion as be proper for they we may truly say that ' tis fort of creation which begin to fetch as out of notbing the visible pro duct of nature which be the object of painting upon the subject of invention we ob serve that it be the first in the order of execution but it be not the same in the order of study for design must be learsy before every thing as it be the key of the fine art as it give admittance to the other part of painting and be the organ of the thought the instrument of we demonstra tion and the light of ourunderstanding the young painter therefore ought not only to begin with this part but to be thoroughly master of it that he may the more easily be quaint himself with the other part of which fhis be the foundation now if design be the basis of painting it follow that we can not bestow too much pain on make it solid that it may be able to sustain building which consist of so many part as that of painting consider designas consist of several part extremely necessary for every one who desire to be a able artist the chief of which be correctness good taste elegance character variety expreffion and perspective correctness be term com monly use by painter to expref the con dition of design which be faultless in its meafure this correctness depend on the exactness of proportion and the knowledge of anatomy there be à general proportion found on the measure which be most proper to constitute good figure we ought therefore to study those author who treat of pro portzon and have lay down the general measure of human figure such author mean as have thoroughly consult to ture and the sculpture of the antient but as in each species which nature pro duce she be not limit to one fort of ob ject only and as diversity constitute one of she greatest beauty so there be parti cular proportion which principally relate to sex age and condition and which even in these admit of a infinite variety as to particular proportion nature have fur nish as many as there be man in the world but in order to make they just and agreeable we must have recourse to the antique only which be derive originally from nature itself and therefore may be set up as model and will give solid idea of the beautiful variety several able painter have measure the antique statue in all they part and have impart to they pupil they study on this subject but if they remark have not be make either publick or exact enough we have in france more than sufficient number of elegant antique either original or mould copy where every one may find the light and particular necessary for he instruction this however be certain that it be im¬ possible to reap any benefit from the measure of the antique till we have study they with exactness draw after they with at tention and after obstinate practice com mit they to we memory vasari re oort fay of michael angelo that the compass ought to be in the eye not in the hand this fine remark have meet with good reception among all the painter but nei the could he have make it nor they have propagate it if they have not previously sup pose thorough knowledge in the finest proportion but we must not only take from the antique the finest proportion but every thing else that may tend to the sublime and to perfection tis therefore necessary to form as clear a idea of it as possible sup ported by reason for this purpose shall consider the antique in its origin beauty and usefulness of the origin of the antique the word antique originally signify any thing that be antient but we shall here confine it to the work in fculpture make in the age when great man flourish which be that of alexander the great when the fine art and science be in they per fection shall forbear to trouble the reader with the name of the first sculptor who through long fery of time bring sculpture from its cradle to fuch perfection as merit the name of antzque which it now bear the praise which be in those time bestow on fine work increase the num ber of good sculptor and the many statue erect to the honour of fuch person as distinguished themselves by they merit as well as the idol with which they adorn they temple furnish still more matter for great geniuse to work on and to finish they work in emulation of each other it be in those day that polycletus one of the greatest of the antient greeé sculptor refolve to make statue which should have all the proportion of man perfectly werl shape for this purpose he make use of many pattern of nature after he have bring he work to the last perfection it be so rigorously examine by man of skill and there thereupon celebrate with so many encomi um that by common consent this statue be call the rule and become general model to all those who want to perfect themselves in the art and ' tis very pro bable that this experiment have succeed in one sex give birth to several essays not only in the other but even in the differeni age and condition of person if iam not mistaken it be to this poly cletus we may reasonably afcribe those mar velous work which we call antique since they be then bring to the degree of per fection in which we now see they the sculptor of those time continue to give proof of they skill down to the reign of the emperor gallienus about the year when the goth who have no knowledge of the fine art nor any regard for they ravage all greece but since we look upon the proportion of the antique as the model of perfection this naturally lead we to speak of the beauty of the antique some have asfert that the beauty of the human body lie in just agreement of the member with each other so as to make perfect whole other place it in good constitution and vigorous health of body where the motion and purity of the blood diffuse on the skin such colour as be both lively and fresh but accord to general opmnion there be no definition of the beautiful beauty say they be nothing real every one judge of it accord to he own taste and ' tis nothing but what please be it as it will people be very little divide in they sentiment about the beauty of the antique man of understanding and lover of the fine art have always have value for these incomparable work that be not only in we day when they be become fcarce but even in those time when all place be full of they and when as it be they people greece and rome we find in antient author many passage which in order to praise living beauty compare they to statue the sculptor say maximus tyrius by a admirable arti fice chuse out of several body those part wbich seem to they the most beautiful and put all this variety together into one statue but this mixture be make with so much judg ment and propriety that those artist seem to bave no other model than one whole and perfect beauty and we must not think say tne same auchor ever to find natural beauty that can dispute the prize with statue art have also something more perfect than nature ovid in the xiith book of he metamorpbosis descri bing cyllarus the handsomest of the can taur say that so great be the vivacity of he countenance and he neck shoulder hand and breast be so handsome that whatever be have of man might be affirm to be of the same beauty which be observe in the most perfect statue and philostratus speak ing of euphorbus say that he beauty have win the heart of the greek and that it come so near to the beauty of statue that he might be take for apollo and lower mention the beauty of neoptolemus and he likeness to he father achille he inti mate that in beauty he father be as much superior to he as statue be to bandsome man it be not among the greeb alone that statue be erect to man of merit and converted into idol the roman take the same way to reward great action and to honour they god the roman after con quer greece bring away not only they finest statute but also they best workmen these instruct other and have leave to posterity everlast proof of they skill as appear from many admirable statue bust vafe and bas relief and from the fine trajan and antonine column all these antiquity we must look upon as the genuine source to which both painter and sculptor must have recourse in order to diffuse solid beauty over what they own genius may suggest to they modern author entertain the same sentiment of the beauty of the antique snall only quote scaliger be it possible say he to see any thing come up to the per fection of fine statue since art have à liberty of chuse retrench add and direct whereas nature have be always change for the worse ever since the creation of the first man in whom god join the beauty of form to that of innocence of latin ms of ruben concern the imi¬ tation of the a tique statue to some painter the imitation of the antique statue have be extremely use ful and to other per nicious even to the ruin of they art conclude however that in order to attain the hightest perfection in painting it be ne cessary to understand the antique nay to be so thoroughly pos sess of he knowledge that be may diffuse itself everywhere yet it must be judiciously apply and so that it may not in the least smell of the stone for several ignorant painter and even some who be skillful make no distinction between the matter and the form the stone and the figure the necessity of use the block and the art of form it it be certain how ever that as the finest statue be extremely beneficial so the bad be not only useless but even pernicious for beginner learn from then know not what that be crude liny stiff and of harsh anatomy and while they take they selve to be good pro ficient do but dif grace nature since in stead of imitate flesh they only represent marble ting with various colour for there be many thing to be take notice of and avoid which happen even in the best statue without the workman fault especially with regard to the difference of shade where the flesh skin and cartilage by they diaphanous nature soften as it be the harshness of great many out line and wear off those rug break which in statue by the force and depth of they shade make the stone though very opaque appear still more opaque and impenetrable to light than it really be there be besides certain place in the natural which change they figure accord to the various motion of the body and by reason of the flexibility of the skin be sometimes dilate and af other time contract these be avoid by the generality of sculptor yet be some time admit into use by the most excel¬ lean lean and be certainly necessary to painting but must be use with moderation to this we must add that not only the snade but also the light of statue be extremely dif ferent from the natural for the gloss of the stone and sharpness of the light that strike it raise the surface above its pro per pitch or at least fascinate the eye ea quisquis sapien¬ he who have with discernment make the proper distinction in these case can not consider the antique à statue too attentively study they too he carefully for we of this erroneous age be so far degenerate that we can produce no thing like they whetherit be that we grovel genius will not permit we to soar to those height which the antient attain by they heroick sense and superior part or that we be wrape up in the darknef that overclouded we fo thers or that it be the will wiil of god because we have neglect to amend we formet error that we should fall from they into worse or that the world grow old we mind grow with it irrecoverably weak or in fine that to ture herself furnish gi the human body in those early age when itwas nearer its origin and perfection with every thing that could make it perfect mo del but now be decay ' and corrupt by succession of so many age vice and accident have lose its efficacy and only scatter those perfec tion among many which it use formerly to bestow upon one in this manner the human stature may be prove from many author to have gradually decrease for both sacred and profane writer have relate the age of heroes many thing concern giant and cyclope in which account if there be many thing that be fabulous there be certainly some truth the chief reason why man of we age be different from the antient be floth and want of exercise for most man give no other exercise to they body but eat and drink no wonder therefore if we see so many paunch belly weak and pitiful leg and arm that seem to reproach themselves with they idlenef whereas the antient exercise they body every day in the aca demy and other place for that pur pose and exercise they so violently as to sweat and fatigue they perhaps too much see in mer curialis de arte gym how many various exercise they take how difficult and what vigour of constitution they be quire thus all those part of the body which be feed by idle ness be wear away the belly be keep within itsbound and what would have otherwise swell it be converted into flesh and muscle for the arm leg neck shoulder and whatever work in the body be asfist by exercifse and nourisn ' à with juice draw in thus increase exceedingly both in strength and size as appear from the back of porter the arm of prize fighter the leg of dan cer and almost the whole body of waterman thus far ruben and have give he own word for authorize the truth of what have extract from he manuscript which be in my possession in fine the praise of the know the testimony of author and the general esteem of the most famous age which be the strongest voucher for the antique tend all to establish this single reason for the beauty of it towit because it be found on on the imitation of beautiful nature suite to the object which be to be represent the several character observe in the finest antique be those of god a hero and a ordinary person accordingly we see in apollo divinity in hercule extraordinary strength and in antinous human beauty some may say that the taste for a tique which appear to be found on the common consent of know man do however suffer change in the time of the goth answer that the gothick manner be introduce at time when the war have destroy the fine art workmen have no other object to revive they by than the imitation of such natural one as casually offer and as to embellish they they employ they imagination rather in such difficult thing as they believe would gain they repute than in cultivate good taste to which they be utter stranger the goth can not therefore be say to have depart from the antique because they reject but because they be not at all acquainted with it all art begin with the imitation of nature and have be bring to perfection only by good choice this choice which be find in the antique have be make by man of excellent judgment who aim at glory by the way of science and in order to attain it examine the most perfect natural pattern in country productive of of handsome man and at time that abound with great geniuss when the fine art be assiduoussy study thoroughly examine and bring to à degree of perfection which be at this day the object of we astonishi ment what more could be do to give pof terity great idea of the antiqueà a idea not derive from a insipid practice or from a overdoing manner which scholar take from master of narrow mind and middle capacity but spring originally from nature where truth appear in all its purity elegance grace and force with out ever depart from its simplicity it be therefore the interest of all those who design to look upon the naked antique as nature purify and as the most certain rule of perfection but as ' tis in vain to desire to profit by bare sight of fine thing if we do not well conceive they so it be impossible thoroughly to understand the beauty of the antique any more than the truth in nature without the help of anatomy we may indeed by see and design the antique acquire certain greatness of design and in the main get practice tend to good taste and de licacy but these advantage if void of knowledge and principle can only dazzle the spectator by specious shew and by ill place remembrance of thing man may be in rapture on see the sine work of antiquity and yet be far from know the genuine source of those beauty which he admire at least if he be ignorant of that fundamental part of design anatomy ir then anatomy be the basis of design and enable we to discover the beauty of the antique can not but observe that the knowledge of so much of it as the painter and sculptor require be easily attain and that the neglect of this attainment procaed only from its be think to lead towards dryness of design and pedantry of manner but little reflection will make it appear to be far from corrup the solid basis of truth and of correctness of out line purity or spoiling the connexion of the muscle formerly writ under borrow name a abridgment of anatomy for the use of painter and sculptor where the demonstration be very plain shall here give some part of it in order to facilitate this science and the rather because those who have need of it imagine it to be difficult of anatomy anatomy be knowledge of the part of the human boay but that re abregé 's anatomie par tortebat late late only to painter who have need of the bone and the principal muscle that cover they two point which be easily demonstrable nature have furnish we with bone forthe solidity of the body and strength of the member to they she have fix the muscle as exterior agent to draw they whither she please the bone de termine the measure of length and the muscle those of bigness in the part of nature at least ' tis the office of the mus¬ cle to settle the form and exactness of out line indispensably necessary to be well acquainted with the form and joint of the bone because motion often alter they measure and likewise to understand the situation and office of the muscle since the most strike truth in design depend upon they the bone of themselves be motionless and stir only by the help of the muscle the muscle have they origin and insertion by they origin they be fasten to bone which they be never intend to stir and by they insertion to another bone which they draw when they please towards they origin every muscle have its opposite muscle when one act the other yield like well bucket one of which descend as the orher come up the act muscle swell and ontract next to its origin the other that obey dilate and relax the largest bone and which be move with the greatest difficulty be cover with the largest muscle these be often aid by other which be design for the samc office and there by increase the force of motion and make the part more apparent several painter by overswelling the muscling have think to gain the reputation of be skilful in anatomy or at least would shew that they be master of it but they have shew by this means that they little understand it since they seem to be ignorant that there be skin which cover the muscle make they appear more gender and easy and be part of the human body and confequently of anatomy this truth be sufficiently prove by the body of woman and child which be be fully muscle as those of the most robust person the author of the antique figure have not make wrong use of they profound knowledge in this part by make the muscle appear more than be prudent and necessary and they exactness in this respect shew the attention they think due to anatomy in short how be it possible to judge of the truth or falsity of a out line if we know not for certain to what degree the mus cle which make it ought either to swell or relax accord to its office and degree of action we often see as have be say before that for want of this knowledge some person who admire a antique sta tue do it for no other reason than because tis antique and if you afk why the out line of figure of they ovn making be thus or thus they can only answer that they see it so in nature and this be the case of young people and of those who have no morê knowledge than what they have derive from bare practice we often observe in the naked part of antique figure and even in nature itself certain swell the reason of which we can not discover without consider the situ ation and office of the muscle which be the cause of they but the skilful in ana tomy see all in see part and know how to remove from the eye what the skin and fat seem to conceal and what be hide to those who be ignorant of this science have now say enough to fhew that ' tis impossible to be truly fkilful in design without clear and distinct knowledge in anatomy as it relate to painting and scul¬ pture and this may be attain with little trouble if we would not rather produce monster than bestow some attention on so necessary point as for the demonstration refer the reader to my aforesaid abridgment of anatomy of of taste in design the goût or taste be a idea either suit the natural inclination of the painter and form by education every school have its taste in design and since the re establishment of the fine art that of rome have always be think the best as be found on the antique which be most proper for form taste in design as have little before endeavour to of elegance elegance in general be manner either of speak or make thing with good choice politeness and agreeablenefs with good choice in rise aboye what to ture and painter usually produce with po¬ liteness in give such turn to thing as may strike man of delicate taste and with agreebleness in diffusing such general re lish as may please and be within the reach of every one elegance be not always found on correctness as appear appear from the antique and from the work of rapbael tis often see in work either incorrect or otherwise slighted as in correggio where notwith stand he incorrectness in design he ele gance in the taste of it , and in the turn which he have give to he action must need be admire in short correggzo rarely de part from elegance but the elegance which be support by correctness of design as it prefent to we a image of perfection so it answer fully we èxpectation fix we attention and elevate the mind after have strike it with a agreeable astonishment elegance of design may be further define to be manner of embellish ob ject either in form or colour or both without destroy the truth elegance with respect to design ap pear more eminently in the antique than in any of the great painter who have imi tate they among whom by general con send rapbael be the chief of the character be not correctness only that give spirit to paint object but ' tis also the manner in which they be design every kind of object require different mark of distinction stone water trce hair fcather and in short all kind of animal must have they different touching in order to express the spirit of they character and even naked human figure have they particular mark of distinction some to imitate flesh give give in the extremity a inflective stroke which have this spirit other to imitate the antique shew in they extremity the regularity of statue that they may not lose any of they beauty we even observe in the design of the great master that in order to express the passion of the soul they have make certain stroke familiar to they which exhibit they idea in more lively manner than the painting itself the word expression in painting be usually confound with paffion but they difference be that expression be general term signify the representation of a object accord to its character and nature have mind to give it for the benefit of he work and passion in painting be a emo tion of the body attend with certain stroke or line in the face denote a agi¬ tation of the soul thus all paffion be ex pression but all expression be not passion be no object in picture which have not its expression might here treat of the passion of the soul but have find it impossible to give such particular demonstration of they as inight be of much service to painter on the contrary iconceive that if they be fix by certain stroke which the painter should he oblige to make use of as essential rule this this would be deprive the art of that ex cellent variety of expression which have no other principle than diversity of imagiation ne number of which be infinite and pro duction as new as the thought of man be various the same paffion may be finely express several way yield each more or less pleasure in proportion to the painter 's understanding and the spectator 's discern ment in the paffion there be two fort of emotion one lively and violent and the other sweet and moderate quintilian call the former pathetick and the latter moral the pathetick command and the moral per suade the one bring trouble and shake the heart and the other calm the mind and both require much skill to be well express the pathetick be found on the most violent paffion as hatred wrath envy compassion the moral inspire mildnese tenderness and humanity the former pre vail in combat and unforeseen and mo mentary action and the latter in conver sation and both require decorum and propriety in the figure which compose the scene le brun have publissied treatise of the paffion the definition of which he have take mostly from what descarte have writ ten of they but that philosopher treat only only of the emotion of the heart whereas apinter want what appear in the face now even if those emotion of the heart dlid always produce tlie passion accord to the definition ' that be give of they its hard to know how those emotion constitute thé line in the face by which they be re present to the eye besides the defini tion of descarte be not always accommo date to the capacity of painter who be not all philosopher though in other re spect they may not want sense and good natural part it be sufficient for they to know that the paffion be the emotion of the soul which be seize with certain sen timent at the sight of some object without wait for order or the judgment of reason the artist ought to consider this object with attention and endeavour to make it al way present in he mind and to afk himn self what he would naturally do if scize with the same passion nay he should do inore he ought to put himself in the placc heat or cool he imagination to such degrec of liveliness or calmness as that passion re quire after it be thoroughly feel the look ing glass be great help in this matter and person duly inform of the case mighit very well serve for model or figure but it be not enough that the painter himself feel the passion of the soul he must make they feel by other and among the many character by which one particular passion may be exprese he must chuse such as he judge most proper to affect chiefly man of understanding which can not be do in my opinion without exquisite sense and sound judgment for nothing interest the sgectator more in favour of the picture than tlie painter ' hit he taste brun ' demonstration be certainly rned and fine but too general they rtizty ideed be of service to most painter but yet other expression of the passion may be find as beautiful as le brun ' though in this respect he have be very happy general expression be therefore use ful because the particular one proceed from they as the branch of tree shoot from the trunk would therefore advise every painter to study they and to mark on paper with crayon the line or stroke which form they and for this purpose to copy after the antiquc and after nature in order to form such general idea of the principal passion as may suit he genius for we all think differently and we imagination be accord to the nature of we constitution though the pafsion of the soul be most visible in the line of the face they often require the assistance of the other part of the body for when the subject require the expression of some essential part if you touch touch the spectator but faintly you give he coldness that disgust he whereas if you souch he to the quick you give he a infinite pleasure the head contribute more to the ex pression of the paffion than all the other part of the body put together these sepa rately can only shew some few passion but the head shew they all there be some however peculiar to the head as humility when it hang down arrogance when it lift itself up languishiing when it lean on one side obstinacy when with stub bear and rigid air it stand upright fix and stiff between the two shoulder other may be more easily express ' than describe as shame admiration indignation and doubt the head best shew we supplication threat mildness haughtiness love hatred joy sadness humility in short the face discover thing in half speech its redness and paleness as it be speak to we as well as the mixture of both all part of the face contribute towards express the sentiment of the heart but the eye especially which be as cicero say the windon of the soul the paffion they most particularly discover be pleasure languishing scorn severity mildness ad miration and anger to which we might add joy and grief if they do not proceed more particularly from the eye brow and mouth but when those two passion fall in also with the language of the eye the harmony will be wonderful the nose shew no passion in particular but asfist the other part of the body by raise the nostril which be as much a expression of joy as of sadness yet scorn raise the tip and swell the nostril draw the upper lip up to the corner of the mouth the antient make the nose the seat of derision eum subdolae irrisioni dicaverunt say pliny they also place anger there as in persius d disce sed tra cadat naso rugosaque sannad but take the nose to be the seat of anger rather in beast than man and that it be only become in the god pan who partake very much of the nature of the beast to wrinkle up he nose when he be angry as other anial do and as philostratus reprefent he when the nymph tie he and offer he thou sand insult the motion of the lip ought in com mon discourse to be moderate because man rather speak with he tongue than with they and the mouth must not be very open unless to express some violent passion for the hand they obey the head and become its weapon and aid in time of need action be weak and as it be half dead with out they assistance they motion which aré almost infinite create numberless expre fion be it not by they that we desire hope promise call send back be they not the instrument of threaten prayer hor ror and praise do we not by they approve refuse fear afk express we joy and grief we doubt regret pain and admiration in word we may affirm since they be the language of the dumb that they con tribute not little to speak language common to all nation which be that of painting to say how these part must be dispose for express the various pafsion be impo sible nor can any exact rule be give for it both because the tafk would be infinite and because every one must be guide in this by he own genius and the particular bent of he study let it be only remem ber that the action of the figure must be perfectly natural can not but think say quintilian speak of the paffion that this part though so fine and great may pos¬ sibly be attain and that there be road which lead easily to it and it be the study and imitation of nature for the spectator be satisfied when in artificial thing they see nature as she usually appear to they in effect it be not to be doubt but that the emotion of the soul as see in art be never so natural as those in the heat of real passion the best way to express the motion to turally be for the artist to entertain the same sentiment sentiment and to fancy himself in the same circumstance with the person he would represent for nature say horace lay we mind open to all fort of chance some time we have content at other time we be swell with anger sometimes we be intirely weigh down with mortal disquiet and then the motion of the heart swell outwardly by means of the tongue which be its interpreter instead of the tongue let the painter say of the action which be she inter preter  how be it posfible say quintilian to give warmth to any thing if you bave not that warmth in yourselfe we must first be touch ourselves with pafsion before we can affect other with it and hou must we move and affect ourselves continue he since the passion be not in we power à it be thus if imistake not we must form to ourselves the appearance and image of thing absent as if they be really before we eye and he who form and conceive those image with the greatest force will expref the paffion with most advantage and facility but let tne artist take care as we have already say that in these image the motion be natural for some think they give much life to they figure in give they violent and force action which we may rather call contorsion of the body than passion of the soul thus be they at great pain to find out some violent passion where only moderate one be proper app to what be above that great regard must be have to the quality of the person that be pafsion the joy of king must not be like that of footman nor soldier nettle like that of captain and in these distinction consist the true discernment of the paffion every body be sensible that the imi¬ tation of the visible object in nature lie in design and colour have explain my thought of the former in speak of cor rectnef of design found on the beauty of nature and the antique and on the assistance of anatomy have touch on taste diversity elegance character and the expression of the passion accord to the relation which all these bear to design it only remain now to speak of colour and to add what have to say at present to what have formerly write on this head for the rest if have omit any thing that have relation to design have do it because other have treat of those thing with success and because it would be tire some to repeat what they have write un less could better illustrate it drapery diversity of climate change of season and they inconstancy have lay man under the necessity of cloath themselves this necessity have beer accom modate to the rule of decency and de cency have give rise to various ornament invent for enrich dress accord to the taste of different nation and the mode of different time but as the use of stuff have be apply to many other thing besides clothing painter have comprise they all under the word drapery and when they would describe a artist who make proper distribution of the fold they say he know how to cast drapery well now this phrase of casting drapery be the more just as the disposition of the fold ought rather to seem the effect of mere chance than of labour and study as there be skill therefore in the adjustment of the drapery we shall endeavour to shew where it lie and of what consequence it be in painting the art of drapery be chiesly observe in hree thing viz the order of fold the diversity of stuff the variety of colour in stuff of the order of fold the eye must never be in doubt of its object the chief effect of drapery be to make we understand what they cover espe cially the naked part of figure in such manner that the outward character of per son and the exactnessof proportion may appear through they at least in the main and as far as probability and art will permit accordingly after the example of the greatest master the painter before he dispose he drapery ought to draw he figure naked in order to prevent any doubtful meaning in the fold and that the eye may imagine it see what he conceal by the cast of he drapery he must also take care that the drapery sit not too close to the partsof the but that it seem to flow round and body as it be caress they and that the figure be easy and have à free motion let not the drapery which cover those member that be expose to great light be so deeply shade as to seem to pierce they nor let those member be cross by by fold which be too strong lest by the too great darkness of they shade the member look as if they be break but retain small number of fold let the painter nicely distribute among they such degree of light as suit the whole maf of which they be part folp should be great and as few as possible maxim that chiefly contribute • to what be call the grand manner be cause great fold do not so much divide the sight and they rich simplicity be most sus ceptible of great light we must never theless except such drapery as require much plait as it often happen in that of woman and as we see in many a tique for in such case the painter ought to groupe he fold and range they at the side of the member which be thus render more apparent and more pleasing contrast which be so necessary in the motion of figure be as proper in the order of the fold for contrast by break ing the line which would otherwise have too great tendency one way raise in the dra pery as well as in the figure fort of contradiction that seem to animate they the reason be that contrast be à kind of war that put the opposite part in motion accordingly in proper place the fold ought not only to contraste themselves but also the member of the figure when those fold be great and part of large drapery for as to the under drapery which stick more closely to the naked figure they be more apt to take the shape of it than to give it any contrast whatever life the contrast may add to drapery and however necessary it may be to make they pleasing the painter must yet make use of it with great prudence and pre caution for in upright figure it often happen that the contrast can not be practise without depart from probability and in such case the painter who know to turn every thing to he advantage betake he self to other principle fold well imagine give much spirit to any kind of action because they motion imply motion in the act member which seem to draw they forcibly and make they more or less stir as the action be more or less violent folp should be great accord to the quantity and quality of the drapery and when through the slightness of stuff we be oblige to use much fold it must be so group that the claro obscuro may not suffer by it judicious repetition of fold in circular manner be great help to the effect of fore shortenings it ' sometimes proper in certain part to put out some fold and put in other more more suitable to the painter 's intention either for spread of light or for sill up the vacancy of some attitude or for accompany the figure or for make sweet ground to they or for hinder they turning from end too quick and look too harsh and unfinisned rich ornament make part of the beauty of drapery when use with discre tion but such ornament ill become divini tie and be always beneath the state and dignity of heavenly figure whose drapery ought rather to be rich in the greatney and noblenef of the fold than in the quality of the stuff fold make by mere practice and without the help of the natural be usually proper only for single design but in order to perfection the painter should al way consult the stuff themselves because in they the fold be true and the light agreeable to the nature of the stuff would not however blame those who have acquire so great a experience in the to ture of fold and quality of stuff as to be capable by memory to express most of they well to imitate truth justly drapery ought either to be set on layman as big as the life or else upon the life itself but care must be take that such drapery have nothing of the immobility of the layman some painter make use of small lay man on which they set either thin stuff or wet papêr but though ' this method may be useful to able artist and be very good where whole story be to be put together it can 's be so useful for particular drapery because the stuff not have the same weight as in the larger lay can ' shew the fold in they true shape light and fly drapery become only figure in great motion or in the wind but when in close place and free from violent action they drapery must be large and by they contrast and fall of the fold shew grace and majesty tis great fault to make drapery too heavy and cumbersome they ought to be suitable to the figure and ' tis wrong to think as some have do that the larger they be the more they be grand and majestick profusion of stuff on the contrary be a hindrance to the motion of the figure and rather embarass they than make they majestick these think be the principal obser ation relate to the order of fold pro ceed secondly to speak of the diversity of stuff among the many different thing hat please in the composition of picture variety of drapery be not the least consi derable the order and contrast of fold have indeed they share but it be not enough that the stuff themselves be variously cast they must also be of various fort as far as the subject will admit wool line cotton and silk as they be manufacture thousand different way afford the artist large field for choice by which mean he may introduce into he work diversity which be the more necessary as it make he avoid tiresome repetition of fold of the same kind especially when he piece consist of many figure some stuff natu¬ rally make break fold other more soft and round some stuff be rough wring other smooth and glossy some be thin and transparent other more firm and sub stantial and this variety whether di spersed among many figure or bring into one accord to the subject never fail to produce most agreeable sensation the general use of the same kind of stuff in the figure of one picture be fault into which most painter of the roman school have fall and which all those be guilty of who either paint by dint of practice only or reduce the imitation of nature to a habit which they have contract but the in genious painter will seek all opportunity of introduce into he drapery that happy diversity have be mention let he re remember however that itis above all thing indispensable with regard to the difference of age sex and condition the antient sculptor be very fkilful in casting they drapery but as the matter they work ' on be of one colour and the large fold which receive the greatest light would have often appear undistinguishable from the naked paris or at least have divide the eye they be oblige d to fix it upon the naked part of they figure because in this case nothing better could be do for the advantage of they art for this pur pose they make use of wet line or thin stuff which be the usual drapery of they statue this remedy by the good order of they fold be certainly very in genious and afford much light to those who can apprehend the reason of it in could produce many example from anti quity in this point but shall only mention that of the bas relief commonly call the dancing woman the drapery which cover the naked part of those figure and shiew in many seem fold those partss agreeably terminate behind the body the repetition of which would appear fault to a eye which can not consider the fineness and excellence of the work but if we regard the sculptor 's purpose which be to shew the naked partsof those figure with elegance these repetition will be so far from appear fault in sculpture that they will seem to make à kind of hatch shad so dextroussy ma¬ nage as to set off the naked part and to give at the same time repose to the eye thus have the antient sculptor with great skill and genius invent several way to remedy the inconveniences a the matter they workd on whether they proceed fromn the largenef of fold or the variety of the stuff with which they figure be cloath have in all other respects generally speak ing give perfect satisfaction but painter who may use all sort of stuff and by means of colour and light can skilsully imitate truth would be as much to blame if they follow sculptor in the multitude and repetition of they fold as sculptor would be if they imitate painter in the extent of they drapery proceed in the last place to treat of the variety of colour in stuff if order contrast and variety of stuff and fold constitute the elegance of drapery diversity of colour in those stuff contribute extremely to the harmony of the whole together in historical subject the artist who have it generally in have power to imagine they as he please must particularly study the value of he colour when entire they effect when place by one another and they they harmony when broken but these point shall handle in treat of colour and in the mean time only here observe hat the colour of drapery give the painter a opportunity of shew all he skill and address in the claro obscuro titian make use of this artifice in most of he picture because he be thereby at liberty to give he drapery what colour he think most proper either for make he ground or for spread light or for characterize object by comparison but after all the management of dra pery be not so settle but the painter may give scope to he genius in venture on unusual fold which may have they merit there be not any effect in nature where chance shew more variety than in the cast of the drapery and thol art have usually something to correct in they disposition yet chance often furnish with fold more beau tiful and proper than rule could ever have produce in fine art can not foresee every thing art go but little way be yond general thing and leave to man of taste the care of supply every thing else it be the painter 's part to make good choice of the effect which nature present and to use they so as to diffuse over he performance the mark of happy felicity mong the painter who best underftand drapery raphael in my opinion be the best i copy for the order of fold yet would not derogate by this from the merit ef those who withoat depart wholly from raphael 's principle have successfully take greater liberty in the character of they fold and have even accompany those freedom with grandeur and truth the vezetian and flemisp school have excel in shew the variety of stuff and paolo veronese be a inexhaustible source of example for a harmonious variety of colour say little of the other great master in drapery the consideration of whose work will make it evident that the fold require both order and proper choice that thè difference of stuff enrich work and support necessary probability and that variety of colour in drapery may con tribute very much to the effect of the claro obscuro and to the harmony of the whole together in short the work of those ex cellent master will better demonstrate than all can say wherein the knowledge of drapery lie and of what importance it be in painting a abstract of the precede ovser vation relate todrapery by the word drapery in painting be mean all sort of stuff whether for cloath or other use but generally speak speak it relate to cloath in which art consider the order of fold the diversity of stuff the variety of colour in stuff of the order of fold the figure must be design before it be cloath the drapery must not sit too close to the part of the body but flow about they and as it be caress they the member must not seem to be break by fold too strongly shade the fold must be great and few as far as the nature of the stuff will admit the fold must contraste one another and also contraste the member the fold on many occasion give life to the action of figure a great vacancy in drapery must be fill up with well adapt fold master may shew practical fold but for perfection sake we should always consult the life drapery set on little lay may be useful but they be falsifying flyingdrapery be proper only in open place or where the figure be in great motion too much stuff in drapery encumber the figure chance often create such beauty in the casting of drapery as art could not foresee painter be much oblige to the antient sculptor for the art of casting dra pery but the use which either make of they be very different of the diversity of stuff it cause diversity of fold it delight the eye it ought to be generally practise as well in single figure as among many especially to shew the different age sex and condition of figure the roman painter and those who paint practically be usually guilty of re peat the same stuff of the variety of colour in stuff it give picture harmony it characterize the object it shew the claro obscuro raphael be the best copy for the order of fold the venetian and flemisp school be best for the diversity of stuff and paolo veronese for the harmonious variety of they colour of landskip landskip be kind of painting that represent the field and all the ob ect that belong to they among all he pleafure which the different talent of painting afford to those who employ they that of draw landfkip seem to I the most affect and most convenient for by the great variety of which it be suscep tible the painter have more opportunity than in any of the other part to please himself by the choice of he object the solitude of rock freshness of forest clear ness of water and they seem murmur extensiveness of plain and offfkip mix ture of tree firmnef of verdure and ine general scene or opening make the painter imagine himself either hunt of make the air or walk or sit and give himself up to agreeable musings in word he may here dispose of all thing he pléasure whether upon land or in water or in the sky because there be not any any production either of art or nature which may not be bring into such picture thus painting which be kind of creation be more particularly so with regard to landskip anong the many different style of landskip shall confine my self to two the heroick and the pastoral or rural for all other style be but mixture of these the heroick style be composition of object which in they kind draw both from art and nature every thing that be great and extraordinary in either the situation be perfectly agreeable and sur prising the only building be temple yramid antient place of burial altar consecrate to the divinity pleasure house of regular architecture and if nature ap pear not there as we every day casually see ner she be at least represent as we think she ought to be this style be a agreeable illusion and fort of inchantment when handle by man of fine genius and good understanding as poussin be who have so happily express it but if in the course of this style the painter have not talent enough to maintain the sublime he be often in danger of fall into the childish manner the rural style be representation of country rather abandon to the caprice of nature than cultivate we there see nature simple without ornament and with out out artifice but with all those grace with which sne adorn herself much more when leave to herself than when constrain by art in this style situation bear all sort of variety sometimes they be very extensive and open to contain the flock of the shep¬ herd at other very wild for the retreat of solitary person and cover for wild beast it rarely happen that painter have genius extensive enough to embrace all the part of painting there be commonly some one part that pre engage we choice and so fill we mind that we forget the pain that be due to the other part and we seldom fail to see that those whose inclination lead they to the beroick style think they have do all when they have introduce into they composition such noble object as will raise the imagination without ever give themselves the troublé to study the effect of good colour those on the other hand who practise the pastoral apply closely to colour in order to represent truth more lively both these style have they sectary and partisan those who follow the heroick supply by they imagi nation what it want of truth and they look no farther as counterbalance to heroick landfkip think it would be proper to put into the pastoral pastoral besides great character of truth some affect extraordinary but probable effect of nature as be titian ' custom there be a infinity of piece wherein both these style happily meet and whach of the two have the ascendant will appear from what have just be observe of they respective property the chief part of landskip be think they opening or situation accident sky and cloud off skip and mountain verdure or turf rock grounds or land terrace fabriek water fore grounds plant figure and tree of all which in they place of opening or situation the word site or situation signify the view prospect or opening of country it be derive from the italian word fite and we painter have bring it into use esther because they be use toit in italy or because as think they find it to be very expressive situation ought to be well put to gether and so disengaged ' in they make that the conjunction of grounds may not seem to be obstruct though we should ses but part of they situation be various and repre sent accord to the country the painter be think of as either open or close mountainous or watery till and inhabit or wild and lonely or in fine variegate by prudent mixture of some of thefe but if the painter be oblige to imitate nature in flat and regular country he must make it agreeable by good disposition of the claro obscuro and such pleasing colour as may make one soil unite with another tis certain that extraordinary situation be very pleasing and chear the imagination by the novelty and beauty of they make even when the local colour be but mode rately perform because at worst such picture be only look ' on as unfinish ' and want to be complete by some skilful hand in colour whereas common situa tion and object require good colour and absolute finish in order to please it be only by these property that claud lorrain have make amend for he insipid choice in most of he situation but in whatever manner that part be execute on e of the best way to make it valuable and even to multiply and vary it without alter ing its form be properly to imagine some ingenious accident in it of accident accident in painting be a obstruction of the sun 's light by ghe interposition of cloud in such manner that some part of the the earth shall be in light and other in shade which accord to the motion of the cloud succeed each other and pro duce such wonderful effect and change of the claro obscuro as seem to create so many new situation this be daily observe in nature and as this newnef of situation be grounded only on the shape of the cloud and they motion which be very inconstant and unequal it follow that these accident be arbitrary and painter of genius may dispose they to he ovn advantage when he think fit to use they for he be not absolutely oblige todo it and there have be some able land kip painter who have never practise it either thro ' fear or custom as claude lorrain and some other of the sky and cloud thesky in painter term be the ethe real part over we head but more parti cularly the air in which we breathe and that where cloud and storm be ingender its colour be blue grow clearer as it approach the earth because of the interposition of va pour arise between the eye and the hori zon which be penetrate by the light communicate it to object in greater or less degree as they be moreor less remote but we must observe that this light be ing either yellow or reddish in the evening at at fun set these same object partake not only of the light but of the colour thus the yellow light mixing with the blue which the natural colour of the sky alter it and give it à tint more or lef greenish as the yellowness of the light be more or less deep this observation be general and infallible out there be a infinity of particular one which the painter must make upon the na rural with he pencil in he hand when occasion offer for there be very fine and singular effect appear in the sky which it be difficult to make one conceive by phy sical reason who can tell for example why we see in the bright part of some cloud fine red when the source of the right which play upon they be most lively and distinguishing yellow who can account for the different red see in different cloud at the very moment that these red receive the light but in one place for these colour and surprising appearance seem to hlave no relation to the rainbow phaeno menon for which the philosopher pretend so give solid reason these effact be all see in the evening when the weather be incline to change either before storm or after it when it be not quite go but have leave some remains of it to draw we attention the property of cloud be to be thin and iry both in shape ande colour they shape though ' infinite must be study and choose after nature at such time as they appear fine to make they look thin we ought to make they grounds unite thinly with they especially near they extremity as if they be transparent and if we would have they thick they reflection must be so manage as without destroy they thin ness they may seem to wind and unite if necessary with the cloud that be next to they little cloud often discover little manner and seldom have good effect unless when be near each other they seem all together to make but one object in short the character of the sky be to be luminous and as it be even the source of light every thing that be upon the earth muft yield to it in brightnef lf however there be any thing that come near it in light it must be water and polisn 's be es which be susceptible of luminous reflexion but whilst the painter make the sky luminous he must not represent it always shine throughout on the contrary he must contrive he light so that the greatest part of it may fall only upon one place and to make it more apparent he must take as much care as possible to put it in opposition to some terrestrial object that may render it more lively by its dark colour as tree tower or some other building that be little high this principal light might also be heighten by certain disposition of cloud have suppose light or light ingeniously enclose between cloud whose sweet ob curity spread itself by little and little on all hand we have great many example of this in the flemisp school which best understand landskip as paul bril brugel saveri and the sadeler and merian 's print give clear idea of it and wonder fully awaken the genius of those who have the principle of the claro obscuro of off skip and mountain off skip have near affinity with the sky it be the sky which determine ei the the force or faintness of they they be darkest when the sky be most load and brightest when it be most clear they sometimes intermix they shape and light cloud paf between the mountain whose op rise and appear above they mountain hat be high and cover with snow be very proper to produce extraordinary effect on the off skip which be advantageous to the painter and pleasing to the spectator the disposition of off ikip be arbitrary et they only agree with the whole together of the picture and the nature of the country we would represent they be usually blue because of the interposition of air between they and the eye but they lose this colour by degree as they come nearer the eye and so take that which be natural to the object in distancing mountain we must ob to join they insensibly by the round which the reflection make probable and must among other thing avoid cer tajn edginess in they extremity which make tham appear in slice as if cut with scifsor and stick upon the cloth have must further observe that the air at the foot of mountain be charge with vapour be more susceptible of light than at they top in this case suppose the main light to be set reasonably high and to enlighten the mountain equally or that the cloud deprive they of the light of the sun but if we suppose the main light to be very low and to strike the mountain then they top will be strongly enlighten as well as every thing else in the same de gree of light though the form of thing diminish in bigness and colour lose they strength in proportion as they recede from the first plan of the picture to the most remote off skip as we observe in nature and common practice yet this do not exclude the use of the accident these contribute greatly to hie wonderful in landfkip when they be properly introduce and when the artist have of just idea of they good effect of verdure or turf call turf the greennef with which the herb colour the ground this be do several way and the diversity pro ceed not only from the nature of plant which for the most part have they particular verdure but also from the change of season and the colour of the earth when the herb be but thin sow by this variety painter may chuse or unite in the same tract of land several sort of green inter mix and blend together which be often of great service to those who know how to use they because this diversity of green as it be often find in nature give cha racter of truth to those part where it be properly use there be wonderful ex ample of this part of landskip in the view of mechlin by ruben of rock though rock have all sort of shape and participate of all colour yet there be in they diversity certain character which canriot be well express without have re course to nature some aré in bank and set off with bed of shrub other in huge block either project or fall back other consist of large break part conti guous to each other and other in short of a enormous size all in one stone either naturally as free stone or else through the injuria of tiine which in the course of many age have wear away they mark of separation but whatever they form be they be usually set out with cleft break hollow bush moss and the stain of time and these par ticalar well manage create certain idea of truth rock be of themselves gloomy and only proper for solitude but where accom pany with bush they inspire fresh air and when they have water either pro ceed from or wash they they give a infinite pleasure and seem to have soul which aniniate they and make they so ciable of grounds or land groundor land in painter term be certain distinct piece of land which be neither too woody nor hilly grounds con tribute more than any thing to the gra dation and distancing of landskip because they follow one another either in shape or in the claro obscuro or in they variety of colour or by some insensible conjunction of one to another multiplicity of grofnd though it be often contrary to grand manner do not quite quite destroy it for besides the extent of country which it exhibit tis susceptible of the accident we have mention and which with good management have fine effect there be one nicety to be observe in grounds which be that in order to cha racterize they well care must be take that the tree in they have different verdure and different colour from those grounds and difference withal must not be too apparent of terrace terrace in painting be piece of ground either quite naked or have very little herbage like great road and place often frequent they be of use chefly in the foreground of picture where they ought to be very spacious and open accidental verdure and also with some stone which be place with judgment give ter race greatter air of probability of building painter mean by building any structure hey generally represent but chiefly such as be of regular architecture or at least be most conspicuous thus build not so proper name for the house of country people or the cottage of shepherd which be introduce into the rural taste as for regular and showy edifice which be always bring into the heroick building in general be great orna ment in landskip even when they be gothick or appear partly inhabit and partly ruinous they raise the imagination by the use they be think to be design for as appear from antient tower which seem to have be the habitation of fairy and be now retreat for shepherd and owl poussin have very elegantly handle the roman manner of architecture in he work as bourdon have do the gothick which however gotbick ' fail not to give à fub lime air to he landfkip little bernard have introduce into he sacred story what may call babylonian manner which ex traordinary as it be have its grandeur and mag nificence would not quite reject such piece of architecture they raise the ima¬ gination and be persuade they would fucceed in the heroick style if they be place among half distant object and if we know how to use they properly of water muchof the spirit of landskip be ow to the water which be introduce in it they appear in diver manners sometimes impetuous impetuous as when storm make they overflow they bank at other time re bounding as by the fall of rock at other time through unusual pressure gufh out and divide into a infinity of silver stream whose motion and murmure agreeably de ceive both the eye and ear at other time calm and purl in sandy bed at other time so still and stand as to become à faithful look glass which double all the object that be opposite to it and in this state they have more life than in the most violent agitation consult bourdon ' work or at least he print on this subject he be one of those who have treat of water with the greatest spirit and best genius water be not proper for every situ ation but to express they well the artist ought to be perfect master of the exactness of watry reflexion because they only make paint water appear as real for practice alone without exactness destroy the effect and abate of the pleasure of the eye the rule for these reflexion be very easy and therefore the painter be the ley pardonable for neglect it but it must be observe that though water be as look glass yet it do not faith fully represent object but when ' tis still for if it be in any motion either in natural course or by the driving of the wind its surface become aneven receive on its surge surge such light and shade as mixing with the appearance of the object con find both they shape and colour of the foreground of picture it be the part of the foreground to usher the eye into the piece great care must be take that the eye meet with good re ception sometimes by the opening of fine terrace whose design and workmanship may be equally curious at other time by variety of well distinguisned plant and those fometime flower at other time by figure in lively taste or other object either admirable for they novelty or intro duce as by chance in word the artist can not too much study he foreground object since they at tract the eye impress the first character of truth and greatly contribute to make the artifice of picture successful and to anti cipate we esteem for the whole work be sensible that there be very fine landfkip with foreground appear to be well choose and carry great idea but which be nevertheless very slightly fi nisn own indeed that this slightness ought to be pardon when it be ingenious when it suit with the nature of the ground and bear the character of truth but it must be own likewise that this effect be very oflandskip rare and that it be to be fear lest this slight working should give some idea of poverty or of too great negligence so that in whatever manner the foreground of picture be dispose would have the artist prescribe it as law to himself to finish they with skill and accurate workmanship of plant plant be not always necessary in foreground because as we have observe there be several way of make those grounds agreeable but if we resolve to draw plant there we ought to paint they exactly after the life or at least among such as we paint practically there ought to be some more finisn than the rest and whose kind may be distinguished by the difference of design and colour to the end that by probable supposition they may give the other character of truth what have be say here of plant may be apply to the branch and bark of tree of figure in compose landskip the artist may have intend to give it character agreeable to the subject he have choose and which he figure ought to represent he may also and it commonly happen have only think of of he figure after finish he landskip the truth be the figure in most landskip be make rather to accompany than to suit they know there be landskip so dispose and situate as to require only pass fi¬ gure which several good master each in he style have introduce as pouffin in the heroick and fouguzer in the rural with all possible probability and grace know also that resz figure have be make to appear inwardly active and these two different way of treat figure be not to be blame because they act equally though in dif ferent manner it be rather inaction that ought to be blame in figure for in this condition which rob they of all connexion with the landskip they appear to be paste on but without obstruct the painter liberty in this respect be persuade that the best way to make figure valuable be to make they so to agree with the character of the landskip that it may seem to have be make purely for the figure would not have they either insipid or indifferent but to represent some little subject to awaken the spectator 's attention or else to give the picture name of distinction among the curious great care must be take to proportion the size of the figure to the bigness of the tree and other object of the landskip if they be too large the picture will discover little manner and if too small they will have the air of pygmy which will destroy the worth of they and make the landskip look enormous there be however greater inconvenience in make figure too large than too small becausé the latter at least give a air of greatness to all the rest but we landskip figure be generally small they must be touch ' with spirit and such lively colour as will attract and yet preserve pro bability and general union the artist must in fine remember that as the figure chiefly give life to landskip they must be disperse as conveniently as possible of tree always think that the beauty of tree be one of the greatest ornament of landskip because of the variety of they kind and they freshness but chiefly they lightness which make they seem as be expose to the air to be always in motion though diversity be pleasing in all the object of landskip ' tis chiefly in tree that it shew its greatest beauty landskip consider both they kind and they form they kind require the painter 's particular study and attention in order to distinguisn they from each other for we must be able at first sight to discover which be oak elm fir sy camore camore poplar willow pine and other such tree which by specifick colour or touch be distinguishable from all other kind this study be too large to be require in all its extent and indeed few painter have attain such competent exactness in it as they art require but it be evident that those who come nearest to perfection in it will make they work infinitely pleasing and gain great name besides the variety which be find in each kind of tree there be in all tree ge¬ neral variety this be observe in the dif ferent manners in which they branch be dispose by sport of nature which take delight in make some very vigorous and thick other more dry and thin some more green other more red or yellow the ex cellence of practice lie in the mixture of these variety but if the artist can distin guisn the sort but indifferently he ought at least to vary they make and colour be cause repetition in landskip be as tiresome to the eye as monotony in discourse be to the ear the variety of they make be so great that the painter would be inexcusable not to put it in practice upon occasion especially when he find it necessary so awaken the spectator 's attention for among tree we discover the young and the old the open and close taper and squat bend up ward ward and downwards stoop and shoot ng in short the variety be rather to be conceive than express for instance the character of young tree be to have long slender branch few in number but well set out bough well divide and the foliage vigorous and well shape whereas in old tree the branch be short stocky thick and numerous the tuft blunt and the foliage unequal and ill shape but little observation and genius will make we perfectly sensible of these particular in the various make of tree there must also be distribution of branch that have just relation to and probable connexion with the bough or tuft so as mutually to asfist each other in give the tree a appearance of thickness and of truth but whatever they nature or manners of branch be let it be remembre that the handling must be lively and thin in order to preserve the spirit of they character tree likewise vary in they bark which be commonly grey but this grey which in thick air and low and marshy place look blackisn appear lighter in clear air and it often happen in dry place that the bark gather thin moss which make it look quite yellow so that to make the bark of tree apparent the painter may suppose it to be light upon dark ground and dark on light one tre the observation of the different bark merit particular attention for it will appear that in hard wood age chap they and there by give they fort of embroidery and that in proportion as they grow old these chap grow more deep any other accident in bark may arise either from moisture or driness or green moffe or white stain of several tree the bark of white wood will also af ford much matter for practice if they di versity be duly study and this con sideration lead I to say something of the study of landfkip which will do accord¬ ing to my own notion of it without pre tend to prescribe my sentiment to other of the study of landstip the study of landskip may be consider either with respect to beginner or to those who have make some advance in it beginner will find in practice that the chief trouble of landfkip lie in handle tree and it be not only in practice methink but also in speculation that tree be the most difficult part of landfkip as they be its greatest ornament but it be only pro¬ pose here to give beginner a idea of tree in general and to shiew they how to express they well it would be needless to point out to they the common effect of tree and and plant because they be obvious to every one yet there be some thing which though not unknown deserve we reflection we know for instance that all trfe require alr osme more some less as the chief cause of they vegetation and production and for this season all tree except the cypress and osme other of the same kind separate in they growth from one another and from other strange body as much as possible and they branch and foliage do the same wherefore to give they that air and thin ness which be they principal character the branch bough and foliage must appear to fly from each other to proceed ffom op posite part and be well divide and all he without order as if chancé aid to ture in the fanciful diversity but to say particularly how these trunk branch and foliage ought to be distribute would be needless and only description of the work of great master little re flection on nature will be of more service than all can say on this head by great master mean such as have publish print for those will give better idea to young copyist than even the painting themselves among the many great master of all school prefer titian 's wooden print where the tree be well shape and those which cornelius cort and agostino carracche have engrave engrave and say again that beginner can do no better than contract above all thing a habit of imitate the touch of these great master and of consider at the same time the perspective of the branch and foliage and observe how they appear either when rise and see from below or when sink and see from above or when front and view from point or when they appear in profile and in word when set in the various view which nature prefent they in without alter they character arter have study and copy with the pen or crayon first the print and then the design of titian and carracche the stu dent should imitate with the pencil those touch which they have most distinctly specifech ifschejrppijtingeschnshf piespped but since they be icaree other fhouig be get which have good character for they touch as those of fouquier who be most excellent model paul bril breugel and bourdon be also very good they touch be neat lively and thin after have duly weigh the nature of tree they spread and order and the disposition of they branch the artist must up the spirit of they throughout either by make they apparent and distinct in the fore fore grounds or obscure and confuse in proportion to they distance after have thus gain some know ledge in good manner it will next be pro per to study after nature and to chuse and rectify it accord to the idea which the aforesaid great master have of it as to perfection iit can only he expect from long practise and perseverance this I think be what concern those who have a inclination for landfkip would take the proper method for begin it well as for those who have make some ada vance in this part of painting it be pro per they should collect the necessary ma¬ terial for they further improvement and study those object at least which they shall have most frequent occasion to represent painter usually comprise under the word study any thing whatever which they either design or paint separately after the life whether figure head foot hand drapery animal mountain tree plant flower fruit or whatever may confirm they in the just imitation of nature the draw of these thing say be what they call study whether they be for instructiop in design or only to affure they of the truth and to perfect they work be it as ijt will this word study be the more properly use by painter as in the diversity of nature they be daily make new discovery and confirm themselves in what they al ready know as the landskip painter need only study such object as be to be meet with in the country would recommend to he some order that he drawing may be always at hand when he want they could wish for instance that he copy after nature on in general and the different effect of each kind in particular with they trunk foliage and colour would have he also take the same method with some sort of plant because they variety be great ornament to terrace on fore grounds woulp have he likewise stady the effect of the sky in the several time of the day and season of the year in the various disposition of cloud both in serene thun dering and stormy weather and in the off skip the several fort of rock water and other principal object these drawing which may be make at time should be collect together and all that relate to one matter be put into book to which the artist may have recourse at any time for what he want now if the fine effect of nature whe the in shape or colour whether for a intire picture or part of one be the artist 's study and if the difficulty lie in chuse those those effect well he must for this purpose be bear with good sense good taste and fine genius and this genius must be culti vate by the observation which ought to be make on the work of the best master how they choose nature and how while they correct she accord to they art they preserve she character with these advantage derive from nature and per fect by art the painter can 's fail to make good choice and by distinguishing be tween the good and the bad must need find great instruction even from the most common thing to improve themselves in this kind of study painter have take several method and ibelieve it will not be here imper tinent to mention those have see practise and of which myself have some experi ence there be some artist who have de sign after nature and in the open field and have there quite finish those part which they have choose but without add any colour to they other have draw in oil colour in middle tint on strong paper and find this method convenient because the colour sink they could put colour on colour though ' different from each other for this purpose they take with they flat box which commodioussy hold they pallet pen cil oil and colour this method which indeed require several implement be doubt less the best for draw nature more par ticularly and with greater exactness espe cially if after the work be dry and varnisn ' the artist return to the place where he draw and retouch the principal thing after nature other have only draw the out lina of object and slightly wasn they in colour near the life for tlie ease of they memory other have attentively observe such partâ às they have mind to retain and content themselves with commit they to theif memory which upon occasion give thei à faithful account of they other have make dra wing in pastil and wash togenner other with more curiofity and patience have go several time to the place which be to they taste the first time they only make choice of the part and dfew they correctly and the other tijn be as apent in observe the variety of colour and its alteration through change of light now these several method be very good and each may be practise as best fuit the student and he temper bijt they fequire the necessary ofpainting as cédouis pencil pastil and leisure nature how ever at certain timb prefent extraordinary but transient beautia and such as ccan be of no service to the artift who have nôt as buch time as be necessary to imitate what she act mire mire the best way think to make advantage of such momentary co asion be this the painter be provide with of paper and black lead pencil let he quickly but slightly design what he see extraordinary and to remember the colour let he mark the princi pal part with character which he may explain at the bottom of the paper as far as be necessary for himself to understand they cloud for instance may be markd another cloud light à mountain terrace and so on and have re peat these letter at the bottom of the paper let he write against each that ' tis of such or such colour or for greater bre vity only blue red violet grey or any other shorter abbreviation after this he must go to painting as soon as possiblé otherwise most of what he have observe will in little time slip out of he memory this method be the morg useful as it mot only prevent we lose a infinity of sud den and transitory beauty but also hélps by means of the aforesaid mark and cha racter to perfect the other method have mention ir it be afkd which be the properest time for these study answer that to ture should be study at all time becausg she be to be represent at all season but autumn autumn yield the most plentiful harvest for she fine effect the mildness of that season the beauty of the sky the richness of the earth and the variety of object be power ful inducement with the painter to make the proper inquiry for improve he genius and perfect he art but as we can not see nor observe every thing ' tis very commendable to make use of other mens study and to look upon they as if they be we own raphael send some young man intogreece to design such thing as he think would be of service to he and accordingly make use of they to as good purpose as if he himself have de sign they on the spot for this raphael be so far from deserve censure that he ought on the contrary to be commend as a example that painter ought to leave no way untried for improve in they pro fession the landskip painter may accord ingly make use of the work of all those who have excel in any kind in order to acquire good manner like the bee which gather they variety of honey from flower general general remark on landseip the general rule of painting be the basis of all the several kind of it we must refer the landskip painter to they or rather suppose he to be well acquainted with they we shall here only make some general remark on this kind of painting landskip suppose the knowledge and practice of the principal rule in ber spective in order to maintain probability the nigher the leave of tree be to the earth the larger they be and the greener as be aptest to receive in abundance the sap which nourish they and the upper branch begin first to take the redness or yellowness which colour they in autumn but ' tis otherwise in plant for they stock renew all the year round and they leave succeed one another at considerable distance of time insomuch that nature employ in produce new leave to adorn the stock as it rise do by de gree desert the under one which have first perform they office be the first that die but this effect be more visible in some than other the under part of all leave be of brighter green than the upper and almost of landskip always incline to the silverisn and those which be wind shake be know from other by that colour but if we view they from beneath when penetrate by the sun 's ray they discover such fine and lively green as be far beyond all comparison there be five principal thing which give spirit to landskip to wit figure ani¬ mal water wind shake tree and thin ness of pencil to which add smoke when there 's occasion to introduce it when one colour predominate throughout landskip as one green in spring or one red in autumn the piece wili look either as of one colour or else as unfinisn ' have see many of bourdon ' landskip which by handle the corn one way throughout have lose much of they beauty though the situation and water be very pleasant the ingeni we painter must endeavour to correct and as they say redeem the harsh unsightly colour of winter and spring by means of figure water and building for summer and autumn subject be of themselves can pable of great variety titian and carrucche be che beft model for inspiring good itaste and lead the painter into good track with regard to form and colour he must wse all do effort to gain juft idea of the principle which which thof great man have leave we in they work and to have he imagination sill with they if he would advance by degree towards that perfection which the artist should always have in view the landskip of these two master each we great many thing of waich do course can give we no exact idea nor any general priaciple which way for example can the measure of tree in general be deter mine as we determine thofe of the human body the tree have no settle proportion most of its beauty lie in the contraft of its branch a unequal distributaon of bough and in short kind of whimfical variety vykich nature delight a and of whieh the painter become judge when he have though roughly relish the work of the twa master aforesaid but must say in ti tion praise that the path he strike out be the surest because he have enactly iitate nature in its variety with a exquifite taste and fine colour whereas carragche though a able artist have not mare ghan other be stroe from manner in he landfkip one of the gneatest perfection iof landfkip in che variety it represent às imitation of each particular cha racter as its greateft fault licentious gractice wbick bring we zo do tthing by roee among those thing which be paint practically we ought to intermix some do after nature to induce the spectator to be lieve that all be so as there be style of think so there be also style of execution have handle the two relate to think to wit the heroick and pastoral and find that there be two also with regard to execution to wit the firm style and the polish these two concern the pencil and the more or less ingenious way of conduct it the firm style give life to work and excuse for bad choice and the polish finish and brightens every thing it leave no employ ment for the spectator 's imagination which please itself in discover and finish thing which it afcribe to the artist though in fact they proceed only from itself the polish style degenerate into the soft and dull if not support by good open ing or situation but when those two cha racter meet the picture be fine ii have thus take survey of the principal part of landskip have speak of the study proper for it and make some general remark on this kind of painting question not but several reader that this work may be make less defective wish I to say something of the practice and use of colour but as every man have he own particular particular practice and the use of colour comprehend part of the secret in painting we must expect minute account of they only from tne friendship and conversation of the ablest painter and join they opinion to we own experience portraiture if painting be a imitation of nature ' tis doubly so in portrait which not only represent man in general but such a one as may be distinguished from all other and as the greatest perfection of portrait be extreme likeness so the greatest of its fault be to resemble person for whom it be not make since there be not in the world two person quite like one another but before we proceed to the particular which let we into the knowledge of this imitation tis necessary for shortening this discourse to take view of some general proposition which be preparatory to what be go to say and will make amend for what shall omit imitation be the essence of painting and good choice be to this essence what the vargue be to man they raise the value of it for this reason ' tis extremely the painter interest to chuse none but good head or favourable moment for draw they they and such position as may supply the want of fine natural ii there be view of the natural more or less advantageous all depend upon turn ing it well and take it in the favourable moment iii there be not à single person in the world who have not peculiar character both in body and face iv sinple and genuine nature be more pro¬ per for imitation and be better choice than nature much form and embellish too artificially to adorn nature too much be do it violence and the action which attend it can never be free when its ornament be not easy in short in proportion as we adorn nature we make it degenerate from itself and bring it down to art vi some means be more advantageous than other to come to the same end vii we must not only imitate what we do see in nature but also what we may possibly see that be advantageous in art viii viii thing be valuable by comparison and it be only by this we be enable to make right judgment of they ix painter easily accustom themselves to they own tint and the manner of they master and after this habit be root in they they view nature not as she really be but as they be use to paint she tisvery difficult to make picture thè figure of which be as big as the life to have its effect near as at distance learn picture please the ignorant only when it be at some distance but judge will admire its artifice near and it be effect at distance xi knowledge make work pleasant and easy the traveller who know he road come to he journey 's end with more speed and certainty than he who inquire and grope it out xii tis proper before we begin work to meditate upon it and to make nice co lourd sketch of it for we own satisfaction and a help to the memory we can not too much reflect on these proposition and it be necessary to be so well ' acquainted with they that they may present present themselves to we mind of they own accord without we be at the trou ble to recal they to we memory when we be at work there be four thing necessary to make portrait perfect air colour attitude and dress of air the air respects the line of the face the head attire and the size the line of the face depend upon exacta ness of draught and agreement of the part which all together must represent the phy siognomy of the person paint in such mannet that the picture of he body may seem to be also that of he mind it be not exactness of design in portrait that give spirit and true air so much as the agreement of the part at the very moment when the disposition and temperament of the sitter be to be hit off we see several por trait which though correctly design have cold languishing and stupid air whilst other lef correct in design strike we however at first sight with the sitter 's character few painter have be careful enough to put the part well together sometimes the mouth be smile and the eye be sad at other time the eye be chearful and the cheek lank by which mean they work have have false air and look unnatural we ought therefore to mind that when the sitter put on fmiling air the eye close the corner of the mouth draw up towards the nostril the cheek swell and the eye brow widen but in melancholy air these part have contrary effect the eyebrow be raise give grave and noble air but if arch ' a air of astc nishment of all the part of the face that which contribute most to likeness be the nose ' tis therefore of great moment to set and draw it well though the hair of the head seem to be part of the dress which be capable of various form without alter the air of the face yet the head attire which one have be most accustom to create such like ness that we scarce know familiar be quaintance on he put on periwig some what different from that which he use to wear tis necessary therefore as far as possible to take the air of the head orna ment and make it accompany and set off that of the face if there be no reason to the contrary as to the stature it contribute so much to likenef that we very often know people without see they face ' tis therefore ex tremely proper to draw the size after the sitter himself and in such a attitude as we think think fit which be vandyke method here let we remark that in sit the person appear to be of lef free make through the heave of he shoulder where fore to adjust he size ' tis proper to make he stand for small time sway in the posture we would give he and then make we observation but here occur difficulty which shall endeavour to examine whetber ' tis proper in portraiture to cor rect the defect of nature likeness be the essence of por traiture it would seem that we ought to mitate defect as well as beauty since by he means thé imitation will be more com plete it would be even hard to prove the contrary to one who would undertake the defence of this position but lady and gentleman do not much approve of those painter who entertain such sentiment and put they in practice have know lady rankly own that they have no value for painter who make strong likeness and hat they have rather they picture have much ess resemblance and more beauty it be certain that some complaisance in this respect be due to they and question not out they picture may be make to resemble without displeasing they for the effectual likeness be just agreement of the part that be paint with those of nature so that we may be at no loss to know the air of the face and the temper of the person whose picture be before we this be lay down say that all deformity when the air and temper may be discover without they ought to be either correct or omit in women and young mens portrait nose somewhat awry may be help ' or shrivel neck or high shoulder adapt to good air without go from one extreme to another but this must be do with great discretion for by endeavour to correct nature too much we insensibly fall into method of give general air to all we por trait just as by confine ourselves too much to the defect and littleness of nature we be in danger of fall into the low and tasteless manner but in the face of heroes and man of rank distinguished either by dignity vir tue or great quality we can not be too exact whether the part be beautiful op not for portrait of such person be to be stand monument to posterity in which case every thing in picture be precious that be faithful but after whatever manner the painter acquit himself in this point let he never forget good air nor grace and that there be in the natural advantageous mo ment for hit they off of colour colour in portraiture be a effusion of nature discover the true temper of person and the temper be essential to likeness it ought to be handle as exactly as the design this part be the more valuable as ' tis rare and difficult to hit great many painter have come to à likeness by stroke and outline but certainly they be few who have shew in colour the temper of person two point be necessary in colour exactness of tint and the art of set they off the former be acquire by prac tice in examine and compare the co lour we see in life with those by which we would imitate it and the art of these tint consist in know what one colour will produce when set by another and in make good what either distance or time may abate of the glow and freshness of the colour painter who do nothing more than what he see will never arrive at perfect imitation for though he work may seem on the easel to be good to he it may not appear so to other and perhaps even to himself at distance tint which near appear disjoin and of one colour may look of another at distance and to be confound in the maf it belong to if you would have you work there fore to produce good effect in the place where ' tis to hang both the colour and light must be little load but learnedly and with discretion in this point consult titian ruben vandyke and rembrant ' method for indeed they art be win derful the tint usually require three time of observation the first be at the person ' first sit down when he have more spirit and colour than ordinary and this be to be note in the first hour of he sitting the second be when be compose he look be as usual which be to be observe in the second hour and the third be when through tiresomeness by sit in one posture he colour alter to what weariness usually create on which account ' tis beft to keep to the sitter 's usual tint little im prove he may also rise and take some turn about the room to gain frefh spirit and shake off or prevent tiresomeness in drapery all fort of colour do not suit all sort of person in mens porkxait we need only observe great truth and great force but in women there must also be charm whatever beauty they have must appear in fine light and they blemish must by some means or other be sosten for this reason white lively and bright tint tint ought never to be set off by fine yel low which would make it look like plaster out rather by colour inelining to green blue or grey or such other as by they opposition may make the tint appear more fleshy than usual in fair woman vandyke often make fillemot colourd curtain for he ground but that colour be soft and brown brown woman on the other hand who have yellow enough in they tint to support the character of fleshiness may very well have yellowish drapery in order to bring down the yellow of they tint and make they look the fresher and near very high colourd and lively carnation line do wonder in grounds two thing be observable the tone and the colour the colour be to be consider in the same manner as those of drapery with respect to the head the tone rnust be al way different from the mass it support and of which it be the ground that the object come upon it may not seem transparent but solid and raise the colour of the hair of the head usually de termine the tone of the ground and when the former be bright che nut we be often embarass unless help ' by means of curtain or some accident of the claro obscuro suppose to be behind or unless the ground be fky we must further observe that where ground be neither curtain nor landfkip or such like but be plain and like wall it ought to be very much party colour ' with al most imperceptible patch or stain for besides its be so in nature the picture will look the more grand of attitude or posture attitude ought to suit the age and quality of person and they temper in old man and woman they should be grave majestick and sometimes bold and gene rally in woman they ought to have noble simplicity and modest chearfulness for modesty ought to be the character of will man charm infinitely beyond coquetry and indeed coquet themselves care not to be paint such attitude be of two kind one in motion the other at rest those at rest may suit every person but those in motion be proper for young people only and be hard to be express because great part of the hair and drapery must be move by the air motion in painting be never better express than by such agitation the attitude at rest must not appear so much at rest as ' to seem to represent a inactive per son and one who sit for no other purpose but to be copy and though the figure that that be represent be at rest yet the painter if he think fit may giveit fly drapery provide the scene or ground be not cham per or close place it be above all thing necessary that the figure which be not employ should ap pear to satisfy the spectator 's curiosity and for this purpose shew themselves in such a action as suit they temper and condition be if they would inform he what they really be anc as most people pretend to sincerity honesty and greatness of mind we must avoid in attitude all manner of affectation every thing there must appear easy and natural and discover more or less spirit nobleness and majesty in proportion to the person character and dignity in short the portrait in this fort of attitude must seem to speak to we of themselves and be it be to say to we stop take notice of I am that invincible king surround with majesty be that valiant com¬ nander who strike terror every be or who by my good conduct have have such glo rious success iam that great minister who know all the spring of politick that magistrate of consummate wisdom and robity iam that man of letter who be absorb in the science be that wise and sedate person whom the love of philosopby be raise above desire and ambition — that pious learn and vigilant pre late late tam that protector of the fine art and lover of virtue d be that famous artisan wbo be so singular in he profession and in woman the language ought to be tam the wise princess whose grand air inspire respect and confidence be that bigh spirite lady wbose noble manners command esteem — iam that virtuous be courteous and modest lady that chearful lady who delight in smile and joy and so of other in word the attitude be the language of portrait and the skilful painter ought to give great attention to they but the best attitude in my opinion be such as induce the spectator to think that the sitter take favourable opportunity of be see to advantage and without affectation there be only one thing to be observe with regard to women portrait in whatever attitude they be place which be that they sway in such manner as to give they face but little shade and that we carefully examine whether the lady appear most beautiful in smile or in ferious air and conduct ourselves accordingly let we now proceed to the next article of dress by the word dress understand the drapery which eloathe person paint and the the manner in which it be fitted every person must be cloath accord to he quality and in painting it be only the dress that can make distinction of person but besides keep to the rank and quality of the person who be draw he drapery must also be well choose and well cast very rich cloath seldom become man and much lace be beneath they gravity woman ought to be adorn in negligent manner but without depart from they dignity and nobleness and when man and woman insist on other management the artist must seek he pleasure in imitate what they would have do variety of stuff give work the character of truth but imaginary drapery destroy it at this time most portrait be draper in very odd manner but whether this be proper we shall here endeavour to examine the partisan for this new kind of dra pery alledge that the french mode be very changeable portfait become ridiculous in five or six year after they be drawit whereas the dress that be make after the painter 's fancy always stand that will meas habit have ridiculous sleeve which keep they arm lock up in manner that be very stiff and neither favourable to nature nor painting and that the custom which have prevail by little and litile of paint ing ing drapery in this manner ought to be no more follow in this particular than in any other other on the contrary maintain that mode be essential to portraiture and be not only of service to the person paint but also monument of the time that portrait as they be part of history ought to be faithful in every respect which say they be so true that we should at this day be very sorry to see in medal bas relief and ather antiquity the roman cloath in different habit from those they wear and that it would appear ridiculous to see they portrait in greeé dress as ours be often so by be in roman at least we should be lead by this means into a error as to mode grow ridiculous in six year they answer that we must not impute it to the mode since ' twas once think handsome but rather to the understanding which be apt to judge of thing not by they relation to the time when they exift but by they agree ment with the present they add that although this aversion to mode may be ex cusable in real dref ' tis nevertheless in painting weakness which the understand ing take in at the eye and that it ought rather to be a useful diversion and pleasing instruction to see that at such time people wear broad band at other ruff bonnet hang sleeve cap short hair slafh doublet doublet scallop ' point band and the like which mode inform we of the time when those person flourisn ' as the person shew be the time when those mode prevail they alledge also the authority of antient painter of repute as titian raphael paol veronese tintoret fe carracchis van dyke and in short all portraitist before this shifting of mode come into use which the woman have introduce into france within these twenty or thirty year now to give some decision between these two party the truth appear to I to be this that ' tis more difficult to give modish habit some agreeable air in painting than to cloathe portrait handsomely when the painter be leave to he own liberty think also that modisn habit might sometimes be proper for family portrait and sometimes the drapery of some virtue or attribute or pagan divinity of practice in portraiture can not but think that every man have peculiar cast of mind have also peculiar manner of pursue he end and that one may have the same success by make different way it be also my opinion that every man ought in this respect to fol¬ low the bent of he own genius and take he road he find the shortest and most con venient venient shall therefore say nothing particular upon this subject but only observe in ge neral that portraiture require three different sitting and operation to zoit dead colour ing second colour and retouch or finish before the painter dead colour he must attentively consider what aspect will best suit the sitter by put he in dif ferent position if we have not any settle design before we and when we have de termine this ' tis of the laft consequence to put the part well together by compare always one part with another for not only the portrait acquire greater likeness when well design but ' tis troublesome to make alteration at the second sitting when the artist must only think of painting that be of dispose and uniting he colour experience tell we that the dead¬ colour ought to be clean because of the slope and transparency of the colour espe cially in the shade and when the part be well put together and become clammy they must be judicioussy sweeten and melt into each other yet without take away the air of the picture that the painter may have the pleasure of finish it in propor tion as he draw but if fiery genius ' do not like this method of scumble let they only mark the part slightly and so far as be necessary for give a air in dead colour ' tis proper to put in rather too little than too much hair about the forehead that in finish we may be at liberty to place it where we please and to paint it with all possible softness and de dicacy if on the contrary vou sketch upon the forehead lock whjch may appear to be of good taste and become the work you may be puzzle in finish it and not find the life exactly in the same po sition as you would paint it but this ob servation be not mean for man of fkill and consummate experience who have nature in they head and make she submit to they idea the business of the second sitting be to put the colour well in they place and to paint they in manner that be suitable to the sitter and to the effect we propose but before they be make clammy we ought to examine afresn whether the part be rightly place and here and there to give some touch towards likeness that when we be assure of it the work may go on with greater satisfaction if the painter under stand what he be about and the portrait be justly design he ought as much as pos sible to work quick the sitter will be bet ter pleased and the work will by this means have the more spirit and life but this readiness be only the effect of long study and experience for we may well be allow considerable considerable time to find out road that be easy and such as we must often travel before we retouch or finish ' tis pro per to terminate the hair that on finish the carnation we may be abler to judge of the effect of the whole head if at the second sitting we can not do all we intend which often happen the third make up the loss and give both spirit physiognomy and character if we would paint portrait at once we must load the colour but neither sweeten nor drive norvery much oil it and if we dip the pencil in varnisn as the work ad vance this will readily enable we to put colour on colour and to mix they without drive the use and sight of good picture give greater light into thing than word can ex press what hit one artist 's understanding and temper may be disagreeable to another ' and almost all painter have take different way though they principle be often the same the famous jabac man well know to all the lover of the fine art and friend of vandyke who thrice draw he picture tell I that as he once observe to he how little time he bestow on he portrait vandyke vandyke answer that at first he workd bard and take great pain to acquire à re putation and also to geta swift hand against the time he should work for bis kitchen van¬ dyke 's custom as jabac tell I be this he appoint both the day and hour for the person 's sitfing and work ' not above in hour on any portrait éither in rub ing in or finish so that as soon as ais clock inform he that the hour be ut he rise up and make bow to the sitter to signify that he have do enough for that day and then appoint another hour some other day whereupon he ser want come to clean he pencil and bring fresh pallet whilst he be re ceive another sitter whose day and hour he have before appoint by this method he work ' on several picture the same day with extraordinary expedition after have lightly dead colourd the face he put the sitter into somé attitude which he have before contrive and on grey paper with white and black crayon he design in quarter of a hour he shape and drapery which he dispose in grand manner and a exquisite tasté after this jabac 's observation have accord to english tra lition be make to vandyke by other and he answer han be that he at first work for reputation but nou er bis kitchen if both report be true vandyke seem have have very early view of he kitchen he give the draw to the skilful people he have about he to paint after the sitter 's own cloath which at vandyke 's request be send to he for that purpose when he disciple have do what they could to these drapery he lightly go over they again and so in little time by he great knowledge display the art and truth which we at this day admire in they as for hand he have in he house people of both sex whom he pay and who serve as model mention this conduct of vandyke rather to gratify the reader 's curiosity than to excite he imitation he may chuse as much of it as he please and suit he own genius and leave the rest for my part dislike no part of it except that of sit only one hour which think too little must observe by the way that there be nothing so rare as fine hand either in design or colour tis therefore convenient to cultivate if we can friendship with some woman who will take pleasure in ferve for copy the way to win they be to praise they beauty exceedingly but if a opportunity serve of copy handa after vandyke it must not be let slip for he draw they with surprising delicacy and a admirable colour be of great service to copy after the manners which come nearest to nature as be those those of titian and vandyke we must at such time believe they to be nature itself and at some distance consider they as such and say to ourselves what colour and shall use for such partè and then come near the picture we ought to examine whether we be right or not and to make fix rule of what we have do cover and do not practisé before with thout uncertainty but to return to por believe tis proper before we begin colour to catch the very first moment which be commonly the most agreeable and most advantageous and to keep they in we memory for use when we be finish ing for the sitter grow tired with be in long in the first same place lose those spirit which at he first sitting down give beauty to the part and convey ' to the tint more lively blood and fresher colour in short we must join to truth probable and advan tageous possibility which far from abating liken serve rather to set it off for this end we ought to begin with observe the ground of tint as well what it be in light as in shade for the shade be only beautiful as they be proportion to the light we must say observe if the tint be very lively whether it partake of yel lowness and where that yellowness be place because usually towards the end of the sitting fatigue diffuse general yellowness which make we forget what part be of this colour and what be not unless we have take due notice of it before for this reason at the second sitting the colour must be every where readily clappd in and such as appear at the first sitting down for these be always the finest the surest way to judge of colour be by comparison and to know tint nothing than to compare it with line place next it or else place next to the natural object if there be occasion say this only to those who have little practise nature the portrait be now suppofe to be as much finish ' as you be able nothing re main but at some reasonable distance to view both the picture and sitter together in order to determine with certainty whether there be any thing still want to perfect the work of political conduct in portraiture but it be not enough that all these precaution be take for make the por trait perfect other must also be take for make it think so in france let portrait be ever so wonderful if it have not stand the criticism of the woin and have they approbation ' tis think to be paltry and eontinue in oblivion for the complai¬ sance sance that be shew they make the man echo back what they have determine in france the lady command and decide like fovereign and the trifle which be to they taste be destructive to the great man ner in painting they would even pervert titian and vandyke if they be still live and oblige to work for they in order therefore to avoid the vexation which such inconsiderate judgment may occasion ' tis necessary to use some political conduct with regard to person and time the artist must never shew he work in dead colour to any but painter who be he friend in order to have they opinion upon it nor indeed be it proper to shew any thing finish ' unless it be fram ' and ver nish ' nor must we in the sitter ' presencc afk the opinion of people who be stranger to the art because see he in one view and the picture in another they will advise the mend what they take to be amiss itwill be a vain for the artist to offer he reafon for as people seldom care to retract and by that mean to own that they may be mistaken they will never be favourable tis best there fore not to give they any handle for de cision or if they will offer they opinion of they own accord let some artifice be employ to elude long tiresome and uselef reasoning make they believe for instance instance that the picture be not quite finisn ' or tell they they be partly in the right and that you be go to retouch it or any thing of this kind that may be able to silence they immediately you know what vafari relate of michael angelo on the like occa sion the pope have be at michael a gelo 's work shop to see marble figure he have carve for he and have no skill himself he softly afk ' he groom of the chamber how he likd it he answerd that the nose be too large  whereupon the pope raise he voice say as of he own accord the nose be too large michael angelo who perceive what have pass tell the pope that bis criticism be just and that he would go and mend the fault in he presence accordingly with he mallet in one hand and chisel and some marble dust in the other he put himself into work posture before the statue and after have knock upon he chisel without touch the marble and let the dust fall by degree out of he hand he turn about and say to the pope d ad esso santissimo padre che gliene pare what do you holiness think of it now of michel angelo say the pope gli avete dato la vita ol now my dear sir you have make the figure alive apelles would afk nobody 's opinion but as pliny say keep behind the cloth and find shoemaker 's criticism on the sandal strap of figure to be reasonable he mend it which elate the poor mechanick so much that he begin to joke the artist for something in the thigh which be not to he like this oblige apelles to tell he scornfully that shoemaker judgment should not exceed the fandal thus when those who pretend to judge shall justly find fault in you work tis wisdom to profit by it without hearken ing to they too mucl or encourage they criticisi because they will abuse you do cility and you praising they for the good hint they may give will provoke they to offer bad one but in this the painter must employ both art and good breeding by make proper distinction between the per son who talk and give they opinion of he work of colour formerly publisn dialogue on colour where endeavourd to shew its value and rank in painting but what now write be handle by way of principle think colour ought to be treat in the same manner that this part of painting which be so necessary to all the rest might join with they in make one whole and that the reader might the more easily judge of it there be several people who speak of painting uie the word colour and colour ei ng indifferently to signify the same thing and though ' these two part be distinguishable enough yet it may not be improper to ex plain what we mean by each of they colour be what make object percep tible to sight and colour be one of the essential part of painting by which the artist imi tate the appéarance of colour in all natural object and give to artificial object the colour that be most proper to deceive the this part include the knowledge of particular colour they sympathy and anti pathy they manner of working and the knowledge of the claro obscuro and as think this branch of art have be very little if at all understand by great many of the ablest painter of the two last century think myself oblige to give here as true a idea of it as can in order to shew its merit some also confound the simple or capital colour with the local though they difference be great for the simple colour be that which do not by itself represent object as pure white without mixture or pure black or pure yellow or pure red blue green or other colour first put on the pallet to make mixture for faithful imitation of a object whereas the local colour by its agreement with the place it possess and by the assistance of some other colour represent single object as car nation line stuff or any object distinct from other and it be call local because the place it fill require that particular co lour in order to give the greater character of truth to the several colour about it but to proceed the painter ought to consider that as there be two fort of object the natural or that which be true and the artificial or that which be paint so there be two sort of colour the natural and the arti ficial ficial the natural colour be that which make all the object in nature visible to we and the artificial be judicious mixture of the simple colour on the pallet in order to imitate those of natural object the painter must therefore have per fect knowledge of these two sort of co lour of the natural in order to know which of they he ought to imitate and of the artificial in order to compose tint proper for represent perfectly the natural colour he must know besides that the natural colour be of three fort the true colour of the object the reflect co lour the colour of the light as to arti ficial colour he ought also to know they value force and sweetness both separately and by comparison that he may either ex aggerate by some colour or attenuate by other as he subject require for this purpose it must be consider that picture be flat superficy that some time after the colour be lay they lose they freshness and that the distance of the picture take from it much of its brightness and vigour and therefore that ' tis impo sible to make up these three deficiency without the artifice which colour teach and which be its chief object know painter ought not to be flave to nature but à judge and judicious imitator imitator of she let picture but have its effect and agreeably deceive the eye and ' tis all that can be expect in this point but this can never be attain if the painter neglect colour as it be certain that the whole can not be perfect if any part be want and that he be not a able painter who be ignorant of some of the part of he art so would as much blame painter for neglect colour as for ill design or ill dispose he figure there be however no part of paint ing where nature be always proper to be imitate that be such nature as offer it self by chance though she be mistress of art yet she seldom shew we the best road she only hinder we from go astray the painter must chuse she accord ing to the rule of art and if he do not find she to be such as he look for he must correct what offer to he as he wha design do not imitate all he ' see in defective copy but change the fault into the just proportion so the artist must not imitate all the colour which indifferently present themselves to the eye but chuse the most proper for he purpose add other if he think fit in order to fetch out the effect and beauty of he work he object must not only be each of they fine to tural and true but there must be also a union of the whole together sometimes he must must lessen the vivacity of the life at other time he must exaggerate or improve upon the brightnef and force of the colour he meet with that he may thus express with greater spirit and truth the character of he object without alter it there be none but great painter and those be but few who have arrive at this art and this learn exaggeration or improvement be so far from weaken the truth of imitation that it give more truth to what the artist imitate after nature let I here apprise the reader that speak in general of painting design or colour always suppose they to be in they perfection those who object to colour say that have must need afcribe to design correctness of proportion a elegance of out line and delicacy of expression and that the roman school which be rapbael ' have al way endeavour principally after these three point as the first and most perfect intention of nature and make little account of coloür ing wherefore the artist say they ought to look upon design as he principal object and upon colour as only accessary answer that the original intention of nature be not less visible in colour than in design that indeed these three quality ascribe to design enhance its van lue but on the other hand that the artist must must have begin he study with acquire they and must be suppose to be perfect master of they and yet they alone do not constitute the painter they only begin he and wait for they perfection from co louring with regard to the whole com position god in the creation of body have furnish he creature with ample matter for praising he and discover he to be they author and have stamp visible colour on they he have give room to painter to imitate he omnipotency and to produce as it be out of nothing second nature which exist only in they idea in fact all thing on earth would be in con fusion and body only perceptible by touch if diversity of colour do not distinguisn they the painter therefore who be per fect imitator of nature and suppose to be good designer ought to make colour he chief object since he only consider to ture as she be imitable and she be only imitable by he as she be visible and she be only visible as she be coloured for this reason we may consider colour as the difference in painting and design as its kind * just as reason be the difference of man because it constitute he be di stinguish he from other creature and allud to the logical term genus and differentia set set he above they for since the idea of thing ought to serve only for bring they out of confusion tis necessary to con ceive they by something which ' each have in particular and which can not agree with any thing else if we consider the painter by he invention we rank he among the poet if by perspective as some say he be not distinguishable from the mathematician and if by the proportion and measure of body we confound he with the sculptor and geometer so though ' the perfect idea of the painter depend on design and colour jointly yet he must form special idea of he art only by colour fince by this difference which make he perfect imi tator of nature we distinguisn he from such as have only design for they object and whose art can not come up to this perfect imitation which painting lead to and we can only be understand to mean painter among the art which have design in we may reckon common with painting sculpture architecture and engrave which be thus define painting be a art which on flat superficy imitate all visible object tis of many kind and usually divide into mosaick fresco distemper oil crayon miniature and enamel sculpture be a art which by means of design and solid matter imitate the palpable palpable object of nature tis usually divide into whole relief and bas relief architectureis a art that by de sign and suitable proportion imitate and erect all sort of edifice tis usually di vide into civil and militaky engrave be a art that by means of design and incision into a hard matter imitate the light and shade of visible ob ject and be divide into wood engrave etch and black manner the black manner which be of late invention be so call because instead of pre æ this be it feem but late invention in france and we author very backward in do justice to english production of that kind we think ourselves oblige to give the reader fmall sketch of what we call mezzotint this invention be ow to prince rupert who after king charle il ' restoration make several print in that manner the prince lay he grounds on the plate with chanell ' roller as the french do theirs by close and cross hatching perhaps the only difference between they method and ours he succesz give occasion to one sherwin to make some attempt in the same way but he lay he grounds with a half round file weighted with a heavy piece of lead the prince on sight of sherwin ' print think he ser vants have divulge he seeret send for he who satis fv he highness to the contrary by shew hiin he of he roller file the prince thereupon give he one to sherwin sueceed isaat becket and william faithorn and prepare the plate by polish it ground be lay upon it of close engrave crofsing every way uniformly so as on take proof it shall appear very strong and in tirely black the black grave therefore be that where instead of graver to form the stroke and shade they use burnisher to fetch the object out of darknese and give they by dagree they proper light the cutting of precious stone the reader may ascribe either to sculpture or engrave yet people usually say grave stone and ' tis and after they be van somer lens smith williams and symon old and young faber george whité among these smith and white seem to be the most excellent the former be still live and he collection of print mostlv after sir godfrey kneller 's painting perhaps the finest in europe and he duke schomberg ' head and the holy family after picture of carlo maratti be think to be he best performance white die middle aged few year ago and though he print be but few they be observe to have fine paint like expression for he be painter and bestow much time on he plate not to be find any where else he best print be jobn baptist monoyer the flower painter ' head both prince rupert ' and sherwin 's grounding tool have be lay aside some year and the grounds be now lay with a hand tool some what like shoemaker ' cutting board knife the edge whereof have fort of fine crenel raise thick imperceptible stip or ground on the plate and be the invention of one edial smith by trade who afterwards become mezzo tinto printer very probable that the workmen employ in this be both sculptor and engraver without my be at the trouble to define all these division ' tis easy to observe that design which be they rind that be common to they all be determine by particular difference which constitute what be essential to each of these art the end of the painter and the sculptor be indeed imitation but they attain it by different method the sculptor by solid matter imitate the real quantity of object and the painter with colour shew ing the apparent quantity and quality of all thing visible so that he be not only oblige to please but even deceive the eye by what he represent to this ' tis usually object that design be the foundation and support of colour that though colour depend upon it yet it no wise depend on colour and therefore the former be more necessary more noble and more considerable than the latter but not conclude any thing in favour of design to the prejudice of colour on the con trary we may infer from thence that mere design alone be not as it be suppose to be the foundation of colour nor have prior existence to it in any other sense but this that it must receive its perfection with re gard to painting from colour and there be no doubt but the thing which receive must have prior existence to that which be to be receive tis the same with all kind of matter which must be dispose before they can be ceive the perfection of substantial form the human body for instance must be intirely form and organize before it re ceive the soul this be god 's method with the first man he take earth and after have give it the necessary disposition he create the soul which he infuse into it for perfect it into man this body as to its existence have no dependence on the soul because it be prior to the soul and yet no one will affirm that the body be the more noble and more considerable part of the man nature always make she begin ning by means of thing less perfect and art in imitation of she take the same method the painter first rub in he subject by means of design and afterwards finish it by the help of colour which by give truth to the object design give they at the same time all the perfection that painting be can pable of as forbe more or less necessary to make whole part that be essential be equally necessary as he be not man who have not soul join to he body so that be not painting painting whère colour be not join to but if we consider design by itself and as ' tis instrumental in most part of art we might for its utility prize it more than colour as we prefer large diamond be fore plant though the meanest plant be in itself more noble and valuable than all the precious stone in the world every one pursue he own profit and consider thing in this view ' tis no wonder if design come more often into play and be consequently more profitable by its mathematical demonstration and also by the very draught themselves which however slight let we into the thought of the work propose should be more esteem but if you set colour aside there will be nothing in design but what may be perform in sculpture which if compare with piece of painting must need be imperfect for want of colour and this consideration set the painter above the sculptor since ob ject skilfully paint have more perfect resemblance to the true one yet we can not help allow that design perfect as we suppose and as we see it in the antique have several mark of elevation which have divide the curious in they choice of picture for enrich they cabinet in effect accord to the subject and figure which the ancient sculptor have mind to represent represent we discover in they sculpture the terrible or the gracious the simple or the ideal of great character but always sublime and probable on this account we be much in doubt about the preference which ought to be give to picture whether we ought to prefer such as be better design than coloured of those which be better coloured than design but from what we have say of colour with respect to painting it appear that we must not prefer the former if the design in the latter be not too bad and the reason be that there be design in other thing as well as in picture 's tis to be find in good print siatue and bas relief but finc colour be only to be see in very few picture be to make cabinet of picture should fill it with all such as have any kind of beauty but should prefer titian ' to all other for the reason have give and indeed the price which he work bear among the curious sufficiently justify my opinion it must be grant that some person value design because of the esteem the world have for it in general and of the great number of people who for its utility have get manual habit of it and love it much to solve this difficulty we must inquire what be understand by the word design in painting this word have but two signi cation first it mean the thought of picture picture which the painter put either on paper or cloth in order to judge of what he be contrive and in this manner we may design not only fketch but work well connect as to light and shade or even small picture well coloured this be ruben 's method in almost all he design and the most part of titian ' which be almost all do with the gen have be perform in the same manner secondly we call design the just measure proportion and outline suppose to be in visible ob ject which have no other existence than in the extremity of those body do actu ally reside in the mind and if painter have make they apparent by circumscribe line and out of absolute necessity it be for the information of they pupil and for they own practice in order to acquire with ease a extreme correctness and yet it may be say that the use of these line be like that of centre for a arch in archi tecture where after the stone work be set the centre be strike in the same manner after the pajnter have form he figure he line be of no further use and must no longer appear and it be in this sense that design should be understand to be one of the essential part of painting but when we give light and shade to outline we can not do it without white and black two of the capital colour in painting and whose management come under colour yet have meet with several painter who would never allow that design contain only the proportion and outline of visible object they say that this part be one of the sort of design have desine viz the thought of grand picture before it be exe cute whether that think be only slight sketch or be express in clare obscuro and by all the colour proper for the great work of which this design be the specimen believe the best answer to this will be to say that in such case design would no longer be part of painting but the whole of it since it would contain not only light and shade but also colour and even in vention and then we must be always think ing of new term and afk these gentleman by what name they would call that part of design which furnish the object that com pose a history and what name must be give to that other part of design which do pose the colour light and ' shade ' hence without further trouble ' tis easy to con ceive that ' tis no matter how we call thing provide we understand and agree upon they name and as new term would be troublesome to the memory ' think it better to retain the old but let we not here paf over in silence the pre eminency of design the chief of which which be these viz first it alone with out colour produce many useful thing for which reason great many people be content to have some fkill in design without troubling themselves about colour se condly it give à taste for the knowledge of art and enable we to make some judgment of they and for this reason design be lookd upon as à necessary part of young gentlemens education who have commonly they master for draw as well as for writing lastiy as this part comprehend many other particular thing as the know ledge of the muscle perspective position of the attitude and the expression of the passion of the soul it might therefore be consider rather as a intire whole than as separate part it can not indeed be deny that these pre eminency in design be real and ex tremely useful but then we here consider design only as it relate to painting and in this light all its part require colour in order to make perfect picture for this reason we here consider design with all the part it comprehend not as distinct part itself nor yet as a intire whole but only as the foundatian and beginning of painting we have before say that the claro ob scuro which be nothing but the knowledge of light and shade be comprise in co louring yet there be several painter who will not allow it they alledge that the only reason which be assign for it be that in nature light and the claro obscuro aré inseparable and add that the same may be sald of design because without light the eye can not perceive nor know in nature the outline and proportion of figure to this we may answer that in this case the hand might do the office of the eye and after feel solid body might determine whether it be round or square or what its form be whence it follow that without light the outline and prod portion of figure may be know be upon this subject can not for bear relate à late story of blind sculptor who make portrait in wax and very like he live in the last century and the story à be tell I by man of probity who be acquainted with he in italy and be wit¬ neis to what be go to relate the blind man this person tell I be of cambassi in tuscany he be well make and something more than fifty year of age have great deal of wit and good fense and delighted in talk and tell thing agreeably one day meet he in the palace of justiniani where he have be copy à statue of minerva take occasion to afk he whether he do not see little because he copy so justly cant see at ill say he my eye be at my finger end but then say how be it possible that bilind as you be you can do such sine thing à he reply —ifeel my original texamine the dimension and the risings and cavity these endeavour to keep in my memory then feel my wax and compare one with the the by move my hand backward and forward several time finish my work in the best manner can in short he do not appear to have any light since the duke of bracciano to prove he oblige he to make he head in very dark cellar and it be find to be very like but though this piece be ad mired by all who see it they fail not to object to the sculptor that the duke 's beard be great help towards likeness and that he could not have hit it so easily have the duke be beardless well then say the blind man give I another whereupon they propose to he to make the head of one of the duchess 's maid he accordingly under take it and make it very like have also see busto of charle king of england and one of pope urban viii of this man do both after the marble finely finish ' and very like the greatest trouble he find as he confess ' be in make hair because of its pliablenef to the finger but without go farther we have at paris busto by this hand of the late ex cellent cellent monsieur hesselin master of the trea sury chamber who be so well pleased with it and think the work so wonderful that he desire the author of it to sit for he picture that he might takeit into france as memorial of he my curiosity induce I to see this picture and after have view the face perceive that the painter have set a eye on the tip of each of he finger to shiew that those he have elsewhere be use less to he have the more willingly re late this story as think it worthy of the reader 's curiosity and very proper to de monstrate the proposition before we to wif that the knowledge of the claro obscuro be comprehend in colour it be certain that no one can fail even in great darkness to perceive the contour of man or statue and to judge of the risings and cavity by feel about whereas it be impossible to see any colour or to make any judgment of it without the help of light we perceive by the story of this blind man that he art which lay all in design afford he a opportunity to gratify he knowledge and also some consolation for the loss of so precious sense as light and that if he have be painter he would have be deprive of this consolation for co lour and light be the object only of sight but but design as have observe be also the object of feeling might also mention more recent ex ample of blindness in the late sieur buret one of the ablest sculptor of the academy who accord to thé testimony of person of credit lose he sight by the small pox at twenty five year of age which however leave he the pleasure and consolation of di verting himself by work like the blind man of cambassi it be in this place we ought to treat of the claro obscuro as a essential part of co louring but as the treatise on this subject be of some length we shall set it after the pre send discourse on colour and refer the reader to it the rather that he may have more distinct idea of the knowledge of light and shade the agreement and opposition of colour be as necessary as union and the cromatick in mufick this agreement and opposition proceed from two cause to wit from they apparent and original quality and from they mixture they apparent qua lity proceed from they participation with the air and earth the aereal colour pre serve lightness which make they look lovely as white fine ycllow blue lake green and such like of which may be make a infinity of colour that will always sympathize the earthy on the other hand have have heaviness which by mixture de stroy the sweetnef and lightnef of the aereal tis difficult to aslign the true phyfical reason why colour be aereal or terrestrial yet we may conclude that luminous colour be sweet and airy and perfectly agree when mix together it be certain how¬ ever that some beautiful sweet and lu minous colour instead of agree destroy each other in the mixture as fine ultra marine mix with white or fine yellow or fine vermilion and though these colour set single one by another have great bright ness yet when mix they make a earthy colour as ugly as possible whence we may infer that one of the best way to prove the sympathy or anti pathy of any two colour set together be to raise third out of they mixture for if this third colour shew by its foulness that the two constituent colour be destroy we may conclude that these two colour haye a antipathy to each other if on the con trary that mixture make mellow sweet and agreeable tint which resemble they original quality ' tis a infallible proof of they harmony the body of colour be also another principle by which we may judge of they agreement or repugnancy for some have so much body that they can not bear any other colour without take away almost entirely its natural quality as red oker um ¬ ber indigo and other proportionably but even if neither art nor reason re quire harmony of colour yet nature herself shew it to we and oblige even those to mitate it who copy she but servilely for whether we consider the light as direct in open day or reflect in the shade it can not communicate itself without communi cate also its colour which be sometimes of one kind sometimes of another we have a experiment of this in the light of the sun which at noon be very different in quality from what it be in the evening or morning and the moon have also particular colour as well as the light of fire or of flam beau before we quit this article of the har mony of colour it must be observe that glaze be mighty help to the sweetnef of colour so necessary for express truth few people understand it because this know edge be generally the effect of long expe ience accompany with good judgment dappy be the man who when he view he work of great master can penetrate into the secret of they art in this par ticular the lover of painting who be not artist must also be inform that glaze make by colour transparent and dia phanous phanous as have but little body which be thinly scumble with fitch pencil over colour that be more stare in order to bring they down and sweeten they into a harmony with those about they have now speak of the union of colour we must in the next place add word or two of they opposition colour be opposite either through they natural quality when pure and simple or else in light and shade when they make part of chie claro obscuro this opposition in quality be call an tipathy it appear among such colour as predominate and destroy by mixture as ultramarine and vermilion and the con trariety in the claro obscuro be nothing but simple opposition of light with shade with out any destruction for though nothing feem more opposite than white and black for ex ample the one represent light and the other the privation of light yet be mix they maintain kind of friendship which can not be destroy they make sweet grey that partake of both colour and what shall appear black by the oppo sition of pure white will seem white when set next to a intense black the same way of reasoning hold good as to all other colour where more or lesa light alter nothing of they quality it be certain that this union and oppo sition be evident in some colour but thie difficulty of give reason for it oblige I to refer the painter to he own experience and to the solid reflection which he may make in the finest piece of this kind which be very scarce and few for in near three hundred year that painting have be revive we can hardly reckon six good colourist whereas we may count at least thirty good designer the reason be that design have its rule found on the proportion on ana tomy and continual experience of the same thing whereas colour have not any rule that be yet well know and the ex periment that be make as they differ every day because of the different subject that be handle have not be able to give any fix rule on this head for which reason be persuade that titian gain more help from he long and studious experience join to the great solidity of he judgment than from any demonstrative rule he have fix ed in he mind but can not say the same of ruben who must always yield to titian as to the local colour though as to the principle of harmony he have discover such solid one that he be sure of pro ducing good effect and good whole if my remark on titian and ruben be just those who desire to be good colourist can not take better method than to study the the work of those two great master as publick book of instruction it will be proper carefully to examine they work by copy they for some time the better to apprehend they and to make all the re inark that appear necessary for establish principle but it must be grant that all sort of man be not capable of understand ing book so as to profit by they for in order to this end the mind must be so turn as to remark nothing but what be remark able and to penetrate the very cause of the effect which be admire in fine pro duction some painter have copy titian ' work for long time examine they with care and on the whole make all the reflection they could upon they and yet have miss ' the mark for want of attend to the pro per object for this reason they copy though very much labour and as they think extremely exact have fall very far short of the management in the original other of more skill and deeper reflection have procure copy of these picture to pleasure themselves with look at they and also to profit by they this be very commendable but if they would themselves copy they or at least the finest part of they they would understand they more thoroughly and profit much better than by bare look the truth be these original and and all such other as be finely light and coloured be scarce and it be difficult to borrow they for any time yet love be in genious and find no difficulty insuperable in short would we gain the good grace of painting the safest way be to labour hard nd make the necessary reflection and then we shall infallibly gain knowledge and faci lity lf for this purpose we can 's procure good original fine copy must serve where we may chuse they best part only if we think fit we should also often visit the cabinet of particular person and those of the king and of the duke of orlean ss often as possible the luxemburg gallery be one of ruben 's finest performance and ruben have more than all other painter make the way to colour easy and clear the work mention be the help hand which may save the artist from the shipwreck to which he may have innocently expose himself have always value this work of ruben as one of the finest performance in europe if in several part we set aside he taste of its design which be not the sub ect at present before we be sensible that many differ from my opinion of this great man ' work and that of very considerable number of painter and curious man who have with all they might oppose my opi ion when ibrought to light if may so say the merit of this great man who be fore be consider as painter but little above the common level of these people say some yet remain who without distin guish the different part of painting especially colour of which we be now speak value nothing but the roman man¬ ner the taste of poussin and the school of the carracchis they object among other thing that ruben 's work appear to have little truth on near examination that the colour and light be load and that in the main they be but daub and very different from what we commonly observe in nature it be true they be but daub but it be to be wish that the picture that be now paint be all daub in the same manner painting in general be but daub ing its effence lie in deceive and the greatest deceiver be the best painter nature in herself be unseemly and he who copy she servilely and without artifice will al way produce something poor and of mean taste what be call load in colour and light can only proceed from pro find knowledge in the value of colour and from a admirable industry which make the paint object appear more true if may say so than the real one in this sense it may be asfert that in ruben 's piece art be above nature and nature only copy copy of that great master ' work and of what import be it after all if thing on examination be not perfectly just if they appear so they answer the end of painting which be not so much to convince the understanding as to deceive the eye this artifice will always appear wonder ful in great work for when the picture be distance accord to its bignef it be this artifice which support the character both of the particular object and of the whole together but without it the work in pro portion as we remove from it will appear to remove from truth and look as insipid as a ordinary painting tis in such great work that ruben be observe to have so happily succeed in this learn and appa rent load by those especially who be can pable of give attention and of examine it for to other nothing can be greater mystery of all the scholar of this excellent man vandyke be hé who profit most by he master 's instruction and in speak of ruben one must need pay particular re gard to this illustrious disciple since if he have not so much genius as he master for grand composition he surpass he in certain finess of the art and ' tis evident that in general he portrait have delicacy and freedom of penciling beyond any thing else in that way have now faithfully give my thought on colour and its dependency tis necessary to answer those person who think that it be impossible to be master of design and colour at the same time they strongest reason be that in addicting ourselves to colour we neglect design the charm of the one make we forget the necessity of the other to this it be easy to answer that if it be of we must not impute it to colour but to the mind as be too narrow to attend to two thing at once but it be not such narrow capacity that painting take up with she only favourite be such mind as can embrace many object or be so well turn and conduct themselves in such manner that they never apply but to such thing as by degree must increase they knowledge they new study do not make they forget the old on the contrary the former strengthen the latter they use all they éfforts to poffess every study as the necessary means to arrive at they end this be raphael ' character the order and perspi cuity with which he conceive thing never let he forget any thing he daily improve in knowledge and strengthen he new discovery by such as he have formerly make after the knowledge of colour we be lead to treat of they use management and and operation three point in the use of which the painter 's greatest satisfaction consist seneca speak of the agreeableness of painting say that it yteld more plea sure in the execution than when tis finish be intirely of the same sentiment be cause in the course of the work we handle the principle and secret of the art to we own like we command they as it be and every one make they obey accord to he capacity and genius whereas when the work be finish it command the painter and oblige he to be satisfied with it be the performance what it will here follow some maxim concern the use of colour pliny say that the antient paint with four colour only and out of they make all they tint but it be probable they be anly for grounds to prepare they for receive such other colour as give the work its freshinef vigour and spirit we must learn to view nature so ad vantage in order to reprefent she well there be two manners of colour she one depend on the habit which young beginner form to themselves and the other comprehending the true knowledge of co lour and they value when they come toge the and the proper temperament of they mixture for imitate the various colour in nature the memory of man be often limit to few idea which he be therefore oblige to repeat the way for the artist to avoid tiresome repetition be to have recourse to that inexhaustible fountain nature itself nay it be proper to anticipate he occasion in this respect by painting after extraordi¬ nary natural object he various study in all the branch of the art and painting they on oil paper that they may be of use to he when he want they the harmony of nature in she colour arise from object participate of one a other by reflexion for there be no light which do not strike some body nor be there any enlighten body which do not reflect its light and colour at the same time in proportion to the force of the light and accord to the variety of the colour this participation of reflexion in light and co lour constitute that union of nature and that harmony which the painter ought to imitate hence it follow that white and black be seldom good in reflexion variety of tint very near of the same tone employd in the same figure and often upon the same part with moderation contri bute much to harmony the turti of the part and the outline which insensibly melt into they grounds and and artfully disappear bind the object and keep they in union especially as they seem to conduct the eye beyond what it see and persuade it that it see what it really do not see mean continuity which they extremity conceal any loading or overcharge in colour whether to cover ground or give distance to work or make good the injury of time ought to be so discretely manage as not to destroy the character of a object we must avoid as much as possible the repetition of the same colour in picture but ' tis commendable to approach it by the principle of union and elegance fine instance of this we see in the marriage of cana by paul veronese where several white and yellow meet harmonioussy the eye grow tired with view the same object it love well imagine va riety repetition be surfeit in all thing in painting as in any thing else thing become valuable only by comparison practice and experience make we learn in this point colour which either by mixture lose strength or become harmonious with other be call break colour they fort be infinite and paul veronese for he happy success in this may be good copy in order to succeed in it he affect to make choice of light colour which he make more apparent by still lighter grounds he taste be chiefly for wring stuff of sweet colour these he purchase at great expence to paint after be wonderful that before and even in raphael 's time painter be so jealous of they outline that they take no care to melt they into they grounds it be really pro¬ bable that they be not acquainted with the passage of antient author in praise of melt one object into another for they only observe regularity and preciseness in they outline so true it be that there be time and country where people blindly follow the prevail practice and where the skilful draw in they pupil to they own habit and be look upon by they as infallible hence it appear that it be great happiness for those who design to be painter to fall into the hand of able master but what com monly happen be this art the student have make sufficient progress in design and resolve to follow painting he put himself under master whose sentiment he follow and whose work he copy by this mean he eye and understanding be so accustom to these work that for all the rest of he life he see nature coloured in he master 's manner and yet which be very extraordinary suppose both master and pupil to see nature very ill mean of contrary colour to what she really eally have and shew they any picture of titian or other good colourist they will nevertheless admire those picture but still retain the tint and colour they have be always use to so prevalent be habit and so hard to quit what can we conclude from hence but either that habit have debauch the painter eye or he have be negligent in correct it thorough change be certainly very rare for habit have make a alteration in the organ 's tis hard to quit à manner we have be always use to and find easy in practice for one which will cost much trouble let the pupil examine himself on this point and without lose courage and after have discover the right way let he use all endeavour to follow it after what have say on the practice of painting imust own that have pass many thing over in silence which relate to this subject but as what have here com municate only learn by examine with great attention the work of the great painter especially those of titian and ruben and as the student himself must draw from the same source therefore refer he thither to ruben in the first place be cause he principle be more apparent and easy to the apprehension and then to titian who leem to have polisn he picture picture mean to have make truth and exactnef more apparent in he local colour at reasonable distance but yield to ruben for grand composition and the art of shew at greater distance the har mony of he whole together of of the claro obscuro the knowledge of light and shade which painting require be one of the most important and most essential branch of the art we only see by means of light and light draw and attract the eye with more or less strength as it strike the ob ject of nature for this reasor the painter who be the imitator of these object ought to know and chuse the advantageous effect of light that he may not lose the pain he may have take in other thing to be a able artist this part of painting include two thing the incidence of particular light and shade and the knowledge of general light and shade which we ufually call the claro obscuro and though accord to the force of the word these two thing seem to be the same yet they be very different because of the idea we be use to entertain of they the incidence of light consist in know ¬ ing the shadow which bedy place on certain certain plane and expose to give light ought to make upon that plane know¬ ledge easily attain from the book of perspective by the incidence of light we therefore understand the light and shade proper to particular object and by the word claro obscuro be mean the art of advantageoussy distribute the light and shade which ought to appear in picture as well for the repose and satisfaction of the eye as for the effect of the whole together the incidence of light be demonstrate by the line which be suppose to be draw from the source of that light to the body enlighten and this the painter must strictly observe whereas the claro obscuro depend absolutely on the painter 's imagina tion who as he invent the object may dispose they to receive such light and shade 's as he propose in he picture and in troduce such accident and colour as be most for he advantage in short as parti cular light and shade be comprise in ge neral one we much consider the claro obscuro as one whole and the incidence of particular light as part which the claro obscuro presuppose but in order to understand thoroughly the meaning of this word we must know that claro imply not only any thing ex pose to direct light but also all such co lour as be luminous in they nature and obscuro obscuro not only all the shadow directly cause by the incidence and privation of light but likewise all the colour which be naturally browii such as even when they be expose to light maintain a obscurity and be capable of group with the shade of other object of this kind for instance be deep velvet brown stuff black horse polish armour and the like which preserve they natural or apparent obscurity in any light whatever it must be further observe that the claro obscure which contain and sup pose the incidence of light and shade as the whole include part respects that part in particular manner for the incidence of light and snade tend only to point out precisely the part enlighten and shade but the claro obscuro add to this precifenefs the art of give object more relief truth and apparency as have elsewhere de monstrate but more plainly to discover the difference between the claro obscuro and the incidence of light the former be the art of distri but advantageoussy the light and shade both in particular object and generally throughout the picture but it more par ticularly imply the great light and great shade which be collect with a industry that conceal the artifice and in this sense the painter use it for set object object in fine light and repose the sight from distance to distance by a artful distribution of object colour and accident and these be the three way which lead tothe claro obscuro as we shall further illustrate the distribution of object the distribution of object form the mass of the claro obscuro when by a industrious management we so dispose tham that all they light be together on one side and they darkness on the other and that this collection of light and shade hinder the eye from wander titian call it the bunch of grape because the grape be separate would have each its light and shade equally and thus divide the sight into many ray would cause confufion but when collect into one bunch and become thus but one mass of light and one of shade the eye embrace they as single object this in ¬ stance must not be understand literally either as to the order or the form of bunch of grape but only as a obvious comparison to shew conjunction of light and also of shade the body of colour the distribution of colour contribute to the mass of light and to those of shade shade whilst direct light be of no other assistance in this respect than as it make the object visible this depend on the painter 's management who be at liberty to introduce figure cloath in brown which shall remain dark notwithstanding any light it may be strike with and the effect will be the greater as the artifice will not appear the same management and effect may be under stand of all other colour accord to the degree of they tone and the painter 's oc casion for they accident the distribution of accident may be of service in the effect of the claro obscuro whether in light or in shade some light and shade be accidental accidental light be what be but accessory to picture or proceed from some accident as the light of window or flambeau or other luminous cause which be nevertheless inferior to the original light accidental shade be for example those of the cloud in landskip or of some other body suppose to be out of the picture and give advantageous shade but in the case of these sly shadow we must take care that the sup pose cause of they be probable these seem to I to be the three way of practise the claro obseuro but all li have have say will be to little purpose unless make the student sensible of the necessity of the claro obscuro both in the theory and practice of painting but of the many reason for this nece sity shall chuse to mention four which seem to I to be the most important the first be take from the necessity of make choice in painting the second proceed from the nature of mhe claro obscuro the third from the advantage which the claro obscuro yield to the other part of painting and the fourth be dravn from the general constitution of all being the first proof take from the necessity ef make à choice in painting the painter seldom find satisfaction in casual nature as be generally short of what he aim at he must by the help of art make as good choice of she as possi ble in all she visible effect in order to bring she to some perfection now light and shade be the visible effect of nature as well as the outline of a human body the attitude the fold of drapery or any thing else that come into composition all these require choice and therefore light do the same now the choice of light be nothing nothing but the artifice of the claro obscuro wherefore the artifice of the claro obscuro be absolutely necessary in painting the second proof take from the nature of the claro obscuro the sense in general have a aversion for every thing that disturb they attention the eye be not satisfied with bare see it must also embrace its object with satisfaction and the painter must remove every thing that would make it uneasy now the eye will certainly be displease when direct itself to its object ' tis obstruct by other near it whose light and shade be as apparent as that object itself and ' tis as certain that the knowledge of the claro obscuro alone can give to the fight peaceable enjoyment of this object for as we have say before it be the claro obscuro which prevent multiplicity of angles and hinder the eye from wander ing by means of the group of light and shade of which it give the knowledge wherefore the claro obscuro be of the greazest consequence in painting the third proof draw from the adcantage aehich the claro obscuro yield to the other part of painting figure ought to be well set and distunce they drapery well cast and the passion passion of the soul finely express in word each object should be characterize by just and elegant design and by true and natural local colour but it be as necessary to support all these part and give they good light in order to make they the more capable of attract the eye and of agree ably deceive it by means of the force and repose which the knowledge of general light give to picture this shew what ad vantage the part of painting receive from the claro obscuro and consequently establisn the necessity of it the fourth proof draw from the general constitution of all thing it be certain that all being tend to unity either by relation or composition or har mony and this as well in thing human as divine in religion as politick in art as to ture in the facultie of the soul as the or gan of the body god be one by the ex cellence of he nature the world be one morality bring every thing within the com pass of religion which be one as politick make every thing subservient to the govern ment of state all nature preserve in all she production a unity result from the many member in animal and part in plant and art assign various precept for make one only work the several con dition dition of man fit they for commerce and society as the several wheel of machine act for principal motion the faculty of the soul be at one time take up with one thing only in order to act well and the organ of the body can not satisfactorily en joy more than one object at time for if you set many before they at once they will not fix upon any and this multiplicity will divide they and intirely take away the liberty of they function if in publick assembly two or three person speak at once in the same tone and with the same force the ear instead of receive what be say will be stun with confuse noise in the same manner if we present to the sight many object distinct and equally apparent tis certain that the eye not be able to collect all those object at once will through they division have some pain in come to determination thus as in picture there ought to be a unity of subject for the eye of the understanding so there ought to be a unity of object for those of the body this unity be only to be procure by the know ledge of the claro obscuro and without it we can not view a object with any ease or satisfaction when ispeak of the unity of object in picture must be understand to mean such distance as tlie eye can reasonably take in without he distract by many distinct ob ject as usually fall out in small number of figure picture may be large and full enough of work to contain three group of claro obscuro and then thelight and shade of each group be sufficiently spread draw and fix the eye for some time give it leave however to paf from one group to another and yet these group of object and of the claro obscuro in the same picture tend so much to unity that one of they ought to predominate for this reason the painter be oblige to bring into this group the prin cipal figure of he subject as much as pos sible this subordination of group create further unity which we call the aehole together but care must be take that these group neither range too much nor look starch nor confuse nor be alike in shape for ' tis indifferent to the eye whether the mass of the claro obscuro be of convex or concave or any other figure we must only observe that though in great work the mass of light and shade necessa rily assist each other yet the mass of shade must not so forcibly contribute to the repose of the eye as to leave it in state of inaction with regard to the light masf the painter should in this point imitate the orator who when he would fix the attention of he audience upon certain particular passage which he would illustrate and enforce be gin with something of less consequence and and after have fix the object in the mind of he hearer he refresh they with speak ing of something more temperate but with out ever suffer they attention to flag in the same manner the painter make luis light to shine and support they by mass of brown which repose the eye withoirt hinder its be entertained by object less apparent we may even sometimes introduce single object but it must be do with prudence and they must be brown in the light inass and light in the brown either sor break through too great silence in picture or for loosen some figure or for take away affectation from the work in word the whole should so appear as if every thing fall out by chance but must own that every painter have not the gift of thus conccale the artifice of the claro obscuro and execute it with in¬ dustry it require as much reflection and delicacy as it start new difficulty in every new subject the geniuse proper for it be such as pierce through every thing and know how to acquit themselves happily of what they undertake we might here add as afurther proof ofthe force and necessity of the claro obscuro the praise which painter themselves always be stow on the work where that artifice appcar and also on the author of they in effect whoever will reflect on the advantage which all the part of painting receive from the claro obscuro must own that any picture be it ever so correct and ever so faithful in design and local colour ing be without that artifice dull and taste ley whereas another painting where the de sign and the local colour be but tolerable if support by the say artifice will not suffer the spectator to pass unconcernedly by it will even call to he and detain he for some time whether he have taste for painting or not what then would be the effect if the claro obscuro be support by fine performance in other part and the work be view by good judge or skil ful lover of painting think it would not be improper to give here the principal explication of the effect of the claro obscuro to let the reader at once into what have be say upon this subject fig plate ii prove the unity of a object as it have be treat in the discourse of disposition we see there also de monstration of object enter the picture in perspective both diminisn equally in foree as they recede from the centre of vi sion they only difference be that the latter decrease in magnitude accord to the rule of perspective as they go off from the say centre and the former which only extend to to the right and leave of that centre grow fainter by distance without lose they form or bigness fig ii of plate il sliew how to handle at particular object in order to give it relief which be to use in the fore part the most lively light and strongest shade always pre serve the reflact light near the turn on the side of the shade fig iii of plate ii prove the necessity of group for the satisfaction of the eye this be titian ' great rule and ought still to be the rule of those who would observe in they painting that unity of object which with skilful colour constitute all the har nony of the art fig iv of plate ii shew the necessity of preserve unity of object in make group accord to the bignef of the picture and the number of its figure for as we have say we must to please the eye six it by predominant group which by means of the repose cause by à spread of rights and shade do not hinder the effect of other group or subordinate object for of the object be disperse the eye be at os which to fix upon and be in the same ease with the ear when many person be speak at the same time much more might be say on the subject of light and shade which indeed be of reat extent but content myself with give give accord to my notion a idea of the claro obscuro and shew the several method of practise it together with its absolute necessity in painting those who would know more of it may consult my commentary on du fresnoy poem begin ning at the verse and continue for seven or eight leave follow sculptor as well as painter when they have occasion may practise the claro obscuro by the disposition of they figure or by the place where they work be to stand the cavalier bernini have leave posterity some illustrious instance of this in some church of rome where he have dispose the sculpture to the light of the window or else have pierce the window for a advantageous opening when he have leave in order to let in such light as might produce a extra ordinary cifect and awaken the spectator 's attention but the skilful sculptor may go yet further by add to the claro obscuro the local colour if he understand they of this we have two wonderful example at mon le hay in the grenelleestreet in the suburb of st germain they be in two case one be the defcent from the crof and the omet the adoration of the shepberd these two subject be so profoundly and beautifully handle that believe the pub lick will be pleased with they description and though have draw it with all possible exactness exactness yet question not but the curious will find it far short of the sublime which the abbot zumbe the author of those work have attain in all the part of he art it would here be proper to say something of the life of that illustrious man but have think it would be more so to reserve it for second edition which be go to be publish of my life of the painter wherefore ifhall here only give the descri ption of these sculpture which have subjoin to the end of this work that the order of my present discourse might not be interrupt which ought to be observe in the study of painting most of the fkilful painter have take great pain and spend many year in the search of knowledge which they might have attain in little time have they hit at first upon the right path this truth of which all age have be convinced by experience principally concern youth and it be youth especially who while they be greedily pursue knowledge have need of light to conduct they orderly to the point they aim at painting may be consider as fine parterre genius as the ground or soil principle as the seed and good understanding as the gardener who prepare the earth for receive the seed in they season and raise all fort of flower both for profit and delight tis tis certain that the genius which give birth to the fine art can not lead they to perfection without culture that cultuze be impracticable without the direction of the judgment and that judgment be of no use unlefs grounded on true principle we must herefore suppose genius in all we under takings which would otherwise be lame and imperfect it must be own that all age be not equally rich in produce real geniuse and that art grow weak for want of skilful man but this ought not to dis¬ courage such as endeavour to be as good as they can the earth yield accord to its strength and the seed sow genius in the same manner by cultivate will always produce something more or less in pro portion to its elevation and extent thus genius have its degree and nature have fix one for some thing and other for other as may be observable not only in the several profession but even in the several part of the same art or science in painting for nstance one may have genius for por traiture or landskip for beast or flower but as all these part meet in genius proper for history it be certain that such genius ought to preside over all the kind of paint ing and the rather because if it should succeed better than other this be the com mon effect of its be more employd in this part of painting and because feel talent talent for history it have embraced this part with pleasure and have more frequent oc this be say without derogate from those geniuse which after be inlarge enough to succeed in history have apply they selve either occasionally or through taste to one part of painting rather than another for painting ought to be consider as long pilgrimage where in the course of the journey we discover several thing capable of divert the mind agreeably for while we consider the several part of the art and stop in the way to it as traveller bate at a inn but if we make we abode at that inn because we find beauty there agreeable to we taste or suit we interest and therefore be satisfied to view at distance or rather to hear talk of we journey 's end we must never expect to finisn we pilgrimage and come up to the perfection of painting this be certainly the case of those who intend to be painter and yet pass thro ' thé part of the art be stop by the charm of some of they without consider that perfect painting arise only from the perfection and union of they all what be therefore of the greatest importance be the cultivation of that genius which ought to preside over all the part of painting history demand it be whole appli cation and attachment and forbid it to en¬ gige in any dispute that may delay its pro gress gress or in any affair that may divert or en cumber it but pupil 's disposition for instruction may possibly cause a aversion in master through fear of lose in small time the fruit of he long experience for by impart he light he may be either equal or surpass by he pupil to this answer that to bury one 's knowledge in this manner be neither natural christian like nor politick tis not natural because nature 's property be to beget she like nor christian like since ' tis the part of charity to instruct the ignorant mean such as have talent to learn and ' tis impolitick because the master 's reputation spread and be pre serve by that of he disciple who transmit to posterity the glory of they instructor if among the fkilful painter some of the youngest plead interest against commu nicate they light and secret and it be think sufficient reason yet we can not ex cuse the more advanced in age nor those whose reputation be fix because far from run any risque they good intention will be à fatisfaction to themselves and procure they the praise of other for what do fuch master they only find method for remove difficulty shortening time and put they disciple in way to perfect they taste and genius be aware that able painter mean in general may have take different method of study and therefore must lead they do ciple by different road though all tend to the same point know also that there be some who after have study without order and spend many year in the search of good method have not find it till very late and who after be better in struct and have disabuse themselves would be very capable of point out to youth the best method of study but my surprize at the many year usually afsign for this study oblige I here to give my thought upon the subject and upon the order could wish be observe in it shall not determine at what age one ought to begin study because in all pro fesfion genius and application be half the work yet such as propose to be painter can not set about design too soon for as they genius come to shew itself by practice they may be suffer to go on if they have any or if they have none may be employd about thing for which they may seem to be better turn but if they inclination for painting continue care must be take during they first exercise in design to put they in method of read and write to advantage in order to prevent the general indifference people have for read for want of its be familiar to they in they youth youth and as painter stand in great need of the help arise from thence the first look put into the student 's hand should be such as be agreeable and fitting he age to give he taste for read and afterwards i proportion as the mind form itself no thing will better teach he to think well than good book but at what age soever one begin painting every student advance more or less in proportion to he genius some be draw by they genius and follow it other be drag by force there be but sew of these last these make great progref in little time and no age be set for they but as we be lay down plan for study think the student should begin very young accord to the usual custom of pupil pliny tell we that when alexander be great asfign to painting the first rank mong the liberal art he at the same time order that young people of condition should before all thing learn to design alexander in so do could have no other view than form the taste of he principal subject by that disposition to painting which design give the mind in effect the first fruit of design be the exactness create in the eye of the designer and its first use be to make general di¬ stinction in the character of object and then then to imprint on the mind the principle of what be good in the fine art and at last the taste be form by progref in these principle the designer thus become more capable of judge of the work both of art and nature alexander who do not propose to make all those person of condition painter command they however to begin de signing betime that they might thus be qualify all they life time to judge of any object that offer paointer and sculptor have the greater reason to observe this law in they early youth as it not only enable they to give they opinion on the work of other but also to compose work of they own of which other be to judge the first thing which ought to be con sider in the pursuit of a art which we propose to follow all we life be to make proper distribution of we time and to allow each study as much of it as it require in we younger year for instance when rea son be weak and reflection unseasonable we ought to make advantage of the softness of the brain and purity of the organ which be then capable of any impression or habit we would have they take ie this be so there be but two exercife proper for the student in he early year the one be to accustom he eye to exactuef in faith faithfully set down on paper the di mension of the object he copie and the other to use he hand to the crayon and pen till he have get necessary facility in design for exactness of eye and facility of hand be the two inlet to design tis therefore of the last consequence to young people in order to begin painting well and to make speedy progress in it not to discontinue these two exercise till they be perfect in they / now if this point be of great importance to the student 't be more so to a academy for if they will but attend to ehri own sup port and advancement theyb must look upon it as necessary to admit no scholar who have not before sufficiently practise draw after design and paster that be who have not acquire a exactness of eye and facility of hand in use the crayon and that in the judgment of the officer in exercise my reason be that when scholar be receive too young and ignorant in to the academy school they waste great deal of time there without maing any remarkable progress in they pretend study and yet after some year rely more upon the time they have spend than the progress they have madethey rashly set up as competitor for the prize of which they be wholly unworthy afterwards it happen in consequence of this this that those who pretend to the prize of painting be chip of the same block of ignorance yield the same fruit either bad or insipid the young student ought in the next place to learn geometry because as he be now advanced so far as to reflect and reason upon all the part of painting with which it be necessary to be thoroughly acquainted and as geornetry teach to reason and to infer one thing from another it will stand he in stead of logick and clear he out of all he doubt and perplexity then as perspective presuppose geome try as the foundation of it it be natural to place it next and to apply to it with the greater attention as nothing can be do in painting without it by this time the student may be suppose to have get a habit of copying with ease all sort of design and of design all sort of picture and yet this habit must not be con sider otherwise than as disposition ne cessary for attain design in this view the young student must con sider the imitation of fine nature as he chief aim and be acquainted with the exterior character of all the form she produce and begin with she master piece man he must understand anatomy and human proportion because these two part be the basis of design anatomy establisn the solidity solidity of the body and the proportion form its beauty the proportion derive from anatomy the truth of they outline and anatomy owe to the proportion tge exact regularity of nature in she first intention / in fine both these part mutually assist to make design solid and perfectly correct though those two part seem to be link together yet it be best to begin with anatomy as be the offspring of nature whereas proprtion be the product of art and if pro portion arise from good choice goo choice owe its origin to nature in the study of the proportion the general one must in the first place be well understand mean such as generally suit each part so as to make finish whole thus we must know how a head foot or hand ought to be make and in short the whole body in order to form perfect man but nature be various in she production we must observe what she produce that be finest in the different character of man arise from the diversity of they age country and profession nature indeed afford such variety as be infinit but as she rich have they allay 't be best at first to hase recourse to the antique for a exquisite choice in all the age and condition of life the antique figure not only contain every thing that be most most beautiful in the proportion but be in thémselves the very source of grace ele gance and expression and the study of they be the more necessary as ' tis the path that lead to beautiful truth and this we must pursue without regard to the time it may take for since the antique be the rule of beauty we must persist in design after it till we have form just and strong idea of it that may help we to view nature in the best manner and to bring she back to she first intention from which she often depart as the finest pattern we have for this conduct be the work of rapbael ' tis pro per to copy they at the same time that they may serve to guide we in the happy mixture he have make of the antique with nature here by the bye we must observe that in the antique there be general taste diffuse over all the work of those time and particular one characterize each figure accord to its agé and quality and this must be the subject of the student 's care ful reflection accord to the compass of he improvement and penetration have spend the necessary time in the aforesaid study we must now consider they as step by whièh the understanding rise to the knowledge of the natural object both such as it be and such as it ought to be by these first study we discern the defect of of we copy and how far ' tis short of per féction and we idea inform as what must be add to or take from the life to make as perfect as we think it ought to be tis here therefore we ought to place the study of the model which with con rast and ponderation complete the study of ithe attitude as in setting model ' tis necessary to find in attitude that have natural contrast and shew its finest part it be also necessary to five it relief and roundness but as the relief and roundnef of one particular object be not sufficient in company of figure and as to please the eye and for the effect of the of light and shade which be call the claro obscuro it follow that this study particular attention and ought to be the more thoroughly master as the claro obscuro be one of the principal grounds of painting as its effect call to the spectator be it support the composition of picture and as without it any pain bestow on particular object would be lose labour after this part of painting be well un understand it be proper in order to root it deep in the mind to view attentively the rpint of those master who best understand ilght and shade and to go to the bottom of this knowledge in order to confirm the student in that of the claro obscuro he must also have general acquaintance with the print and design of the great master to shew he how they manage both in composition and simple figure goop print as well as good drawing be also proper to warm the genius and ex cite it to produce the like we be make sensible of the character of each object by its different draw and handling and have copy after good master we perceive that those fine touch and handling be the soul of design these we must imprint in we mind in order to gain more disposition and facility to observe in nature the man ner of express the character of object the student must use all he endeavour to feed he eye with the sight of these fine thing but to rivet they in he memory and understanding it will be convenient to copy and make extract of they finest part such as he most want or he genius chiefly lead he to tis in such case that intelligent and sincere friend who often know we weakness and the bent of we genius bet ter than ourselves may asfist we with they counsel and knowledge if consult thus far painting and sculpture have go hand in hand ' for suppose the sculptor to be use to design on paper as desire the painter for he own profit to learn earn to model each of they must now take path of he own in order to arrive happily at he end which be the imitation of nature the sculptor must give relief to he matter and the painter use he colour on flat superficy but my present design be chiefly to direct the painter in order to bring he to the end of he career the method have thus far point out only relate to the study of design what have yet to say relate chiefly to colour several painter think that the study of design imply that of colour because say they several good designer have too ong enjoy the pleafure and charm of design have so fill they mind with it that they leave no room for colour or have make too great progress in design they soon grow tired of colour which be uneasy to they for which reason they return to the pleasure they find in they abit of design for ' tis pleasure to do what we can easily do these reflection be certainly not groundless but to comply in some mea sure with the weakness of man who do almost every thing by habit think that the student should in the course of design ¬ ng sometimes handle the pencil and colour to make this part through early custom pleasure to he but if we go to the bot tom of these inconveniences they will not appear appear to proceed from not colour early but from begin ill imean either copy ' ing at first after bad thing or be tutor by master who have not the principle of colour we naturally quit bad manner of de signing as may be observe in those who design for they become more correct by practice and by change of object and model but it be very rare to exchange bad manner in colour for à better say that it be not impossible but very rare raphael michael angelo leonardo do vinci juliò romano and other great master of those time follow the school and the practice of the place where they be educated and spend they whole life withoût truly understanding good colour even in we own time voet ' disciple though numerous and man of good sense have not be able whatever they could do to shalce off they master ' bad manner we have further instance of youngpainters who by begin to copy picture of trivial colour have retain that manner in every thing they co lour make it as glaf through which they see nature coloured like they painting from hence we may infer that young man who begin with copy a ill coloured picture swallow ' poison with which he himself will taint all he future perform but solid judgment and goodeducation can surmount difficulty and correct bad taste where the understanding be docile there be no reason ' therefore why we may not place here the study of colour leave every student at liberty to refresh himself sometimes by interrupt the order of study iam go to lay down the student 's first care must be to begin with copy what he find best coloured most finish and most freely pencile in the work of the great master among whom titian ruben and vandyke be of the aarst rank vandyke chiefly with regard to be ginner because he good colour be join with freedom of penciling as colour be not farther valuable than it perfectly imitate nature the student after have obtain some habit from the best picture must also copy after nature herself examine and compare it with the work of the great master this practice will accustom he taste to a idea of truthi and he eye t see truth without any cloud or obstruction after have thus acquire good habit and put he taste in condition to fear nothing he may copy picture of all manners if he find any thing in they to entertain the activity of he genius but like the bee which gather they honey from several good flower he should chiefly copy excellent excellent piece such as be best for form good manner he should do the same in the fine production of nature whether figure beast or landfkip of which he may make collection as well for common use in the way of he business as to keep up he taste or to feed he curiosity be come to this pitch and so fur nish the young painter may fly with he obn wing and by read or reflect raise he thought and exercise he imagin ation in compose variety of subject adorning they with such choice of beauty as nature afford in abundance but let he remember above all thing never to set about picture till he have first make slight sketch of it in colour where he may give loose to he genius and be gulate the motion of it afterwards in the object and in the effect of the whole toge the this sketch must be make as quickly as possible after he have fix he thought that the fire of he imagination may not have time to evaporate and be only loose sketch as we suppose it he may afterwards alter add or diminish either in composition or colour as he think fit anp now have bring thing to he mind he must before he begin to dead colour the great picture consult every thing he have by he that be most beautiful either in nature or the antique and proper for he subject subject and draw exactly after each of they in they proper place to save hmself the trouble and vexation of alteration and do ing one thing twice in this point ranhael go further he method be to paste as many papers together as make the size of be picture and after have correctly de sign and put all thing a they place he transfer this cartoon to the ground he intend to paint on yet if after all those precaution it should still be necessary for the effect of the picture to make some alteration it will be prudent not to neglect they the trouble will not be great and there will besides be no room to reproach ourselves with any neglect the artist be now suppose to have bring he work to good forwardness he must consider what place it be to be hang in and at what distance from the eye and to regulate the force of he colour and touch accordingly of all geniuse ibelieve there be not any which take greater liberty than that for painting nor any which suffer the bridle more impatiently nay question not but several painter besides some extraordinary geniuse have without any order of study attain to considerable reputation though indeed not without lose much time for want of some method but as in ma¬ chine chine the bad disposition of the wheel retard the motion so the part of painting disorderly study confuse the understand ing and memory and make thing difficult either to be understand or remembre wherefore the best way be to put we study into some order not inconsistent with dissertation whether poesy be preferable to painting tis not my design to majntain that painting excel poesy never doubt out these two art go hand in hand and equally deserve the same honour have speak of they accordingly when occasion offer and in this have only follow the sentiment of the most celebrate author but as people do not always agree even in find there point that be most receive be some person of great distinction who have express they displeasure at my class poetry with painting however much do pose may be to agree with they will examine this with all the application can for if imust at length come into they senti nent they will not disapprove of my de serring to do it till have disabuse my elf
