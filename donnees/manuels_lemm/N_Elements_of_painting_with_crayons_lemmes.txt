element of with crayon by john russell in tenui laborvirgil london printedfor wilkie in stpaui churchyard a walter at charecross mdcclxxii to he grace the duke of chando my lord he excellence at which the polite art have arrive in every nation where they be know have be ow in great measure to the encouragement and protection shew to they by illustrious personage on this account my lord presume to solicit you grace s patronage age forthe follow little treatise on the art of painting with crayon sensible that you grace s know benevolence can not be displease that endeavour to render myself serviceable to other the honour you do I in the early part of my life when you condescend io wishi would direct my study to the art of painting have ever be hold in remembrance zand it will afford I great satisfaction to know that you grace accept this address as a humble tribute of my gratitude and to believe that be with the highest respect the elegant art of which painting be one of the most considerable have ever be hold in the highest estimation by the great and illustrious of all age not solely for private amusement but for they beneficial influence in society in promote benevolence and inspiring delicacy of feeling titis will not appear paradoxical if we observe that they be evidently contrive to afford innocent pleasure disregarding the inferior sense in this light they may be consider as rational science and when cultivate to a eminent degree of refinement they do honour to mankind every attempt to encourage and improve the elegant art deserve great commendation since there be too much reason for believe that the interest of humanity be not so strongly guard or so firmly secure as easily to relinquish those succours or forego those afsistance which they administer to they since painting be a art in which truth of qut line be no less necessary that justness of colour apprehend few hint relative to the former will not seven at this period be deem superfluous or unnecessary for should these element fall into the hand of the accomplish artist to whose judgment submit they with the highest diffidence flatter myself shall meet with favour and indulgence since intend this work principally for the use of those who be just enter into the world of imitationto such hope to make a offering worthy they acceptance should inclination lead they to the study of painting with cravon by exhibit the material use in this art with the Ithods of make and prepare they for the execution of design with respect to crayon painting the present age have produce a uncommon instance of excellence in one of we own countryman mean the late mofrancis core whose method propose to explain in the follow page with all possible perspicuity for it seem to be universally allow by all good judge that as crayon painter this celebrate artist excel most of he cotemporary reader will doubtless excuse this tribute of gratitude to ° in what high estimation be the picture of rosalba heldp how happy do connoisseur think themselves when they possess any of she worksl if the crayon picture leave by mocote be not hold in equal estimation posterity will not do justice to he merit the memory of a excellent master who for some year direct my study aud use he endeavour to communicate that knowledge to I which have most eminently distinguished and raise he to the notice and esteem not only of the first artist in the britisb nation but to the favour of we illustrious monarch who in the commencement of a auspicious reign and even in that early period of life when pleasure generally be the sole pursuit shew a elegant taste for the fine art and have since be gracioussy pleased to protect and encourage the cultivation of they by the establifhment of royal academy which from its first institution have be conduct with such pro priety and unremit attention as to do honour to its profefsor and add dignity to the character of englishman the hope of render some service to the art of painting with crayon of suggest some hint which may pos¬ sibly give rise to further inquiry respect this pleasing study and of explain its principle for the benefit of such as in this age of dissipation may prefer the silent amusement of beautiful art to the delusive enchantment in the gay circle of unrestrained pleasure have induce I to this undertake and should it instruct or even encourage single student shall not think my labour ill bestow but happy shall be if my observation should in the least degree awaken the attention of the curious to those new source of beauty and elegance which may yet lie conceal for if they be find to be just those who be master of the subject may be tempte to improve and extend they be this as it may my aim by this publication be to be useful to those who want experience and therefore have not doubt but shall stand excuse from any imputation of vanity with those who do not require such assistance to the former lwish success and would soften the censure of the latter by remind they in the word of tbere be labour in the most trifling tbing element of painting witr crayonsection concern taste there be no disputing about tafte because its principle be not absolute and therefore they can not be define the opinion of man concern as they face they disposition or the different climate in which they live nature it be true be in every particular consistent with herself we be frame with mind capable of have the highest relisn for the elegant art and consequently nature have frame we with a uniformity of taste to furnish proper object for that high relish without which the the art could never have arrive at any degree of perfection and this be sufficient to convince we that they be not yet bring to perfection some object indeed of the fine art make such lively impression of beauty grandeur and harmony of proportion as to command kind of general taste but instance of this sort be very uncommon taste depend more on experience than on nature this be point which merit peculiar attention because it open to we fure method of improve we taste in the elegant art and be powerful incitement toward the cultivation and improvement of they study which can not fail to embellish manners and sweeten society azz therefore that can be say concern taste be that there be certain principle that constitute the sensitive part of we nature and which be common to all preserve kind of uniformity with respect to the emotion and feeling of different individual the same object make upon every one the same impression or at least the same in kind if not in degree this be the only way of accounting for uniformity of taste in the polite art and this in other word may justly be term the common sense of mankind which be the only true standard of taste all other be equivocal or uncertain and consequently will never be sufficiently general to become standard of taste but the principle that constitute the sensitive part of we nature nature will undoubtedly lead we to method of ascertaining the common sense of mankind or standard of taste with great exactness and accuracy these will determine almost generally what be either elegant or beautiful and hence when we idea be regulate and direct by these principle we may be say to have form good taste and be enable to discern what be natural and proper and what be not so true it be that inattention the force of example prejudice or passion may introduce bad taste and banish good one in painting heavy composition incorrect draw and bad colour may prevail notwithstanding the influence of those principle that constitute the sensitive part of we nature instance of so defective taste will however be very rare and when they happen they will seldom prejudice any but the possessor because they can carry but little authority with they to impose on other after all the remedy against form bad taste be to study the work of man of good taste this will enlarge the mind and by observation establish the student in good taste of he own element of section ii of drawin draw may be justly term the foundation of painting this should be the first object of the student s attention the more perfectly this be attain the greater be the certainty of acquire excellence genius be the gift of nature but genius without cultivation can never arrive at the summit of perfection the material necessary for draw be portcrayon à leather stump some stain paper charcoal black white and red chalk with drawboard of about two foot square soue artist reject the use of drawing or print for the student s imitation ee it be say they servile method of ci proceeding because it cramp the idea and hence ge« nius suffer too great confinement notwithstanding this the usual practice be to copy after print and drawing at first and imagine experience have determine the advantage accrue from this method to set the drawing in particular of the most eminent artist before young beginner at he first commencement must be highly beneficial cial as it most undoubtedly will prevent rudeness and inaccuracy against which the most exact can not be too much guard how much more then ought the young student to observe this caution some geniuse require restriction and when this happen to be the case the place of accurate work before they must hold they in kind of subjection from which alone correctness be to be expect exact copy be absolutely to be require at first this will imperceptibly produce habit of correctness till by degree the student will make himself master of those grand essential to perfection truth boldness and freedom truth will be acquire by this accustom correctnefs boldness and freedom will follow after as the certain consequence and on these the excellence of the performance must dependcopy the drawing of good master have also another considerable advantage viz teach good method of execution by which many laborious and fruitdess effort will be prevent crayon painter fhould pay particular attention to the draw on stain paper with black or red and white chalk as this kind of draw have bold effect be ally to the manner of use the crayon and impart knowledge of what be usually term the middie teint indeed in almost every respect this method be attend with considerable advantage but the young student should always have it in remembrance that he chief aim ought to be the making of correct draw and of attain truth of outline since this be more essentially necessary than smartness of touch or pleasing executionwhen he have make some considerable progress with the chalk he may then attempt the round or plaister figure but here as in every other case care fhould be observe in make choice of good subject for nothing be so prejudicial or dangerous as to copy from imperfect subject on which account he should be direct in he choice by the opinion of the most experience artist who all recommend the study of the antique and other approve plaister figure previous to the draw after living model which will furnish the student with great knowledge and correctness as have be before observe and without which there be great danger of acquire extravagant and pernicious have bit which be easily attain without great care but they be not so easily difmiss when acquire to draw from living figure without have first study the antique be no less absurd than to attempt to understand the classick without previous knowledge of the rule of grammar the human figure and especially the face be the most difficult study but thorough knowledge of this particular will give facility of execution in every thing else when the student have make himself master of good degree of exactness by copying after print or drawing let let he be provide with some good head cast after the antique one in which the feature be strongly mark and boldly determine such as the hercule jupiter or wiobe as he will find the strength of either of these more easy of imitation than the refinement and delicacy of the antinous or venus of medicis though the latter after time will be he favourite and most valuable study apter the choice of subject the next consideration will be to place it in proper light and shadowlf the window be too near the ground the effect can not be pleasing because the shadow will be distract into too many part in this case the lower part of the window should be darkened with sometbing that will quite obstruct the light about the height of six foot which will throw the shade into very agreeable mafse on the subject for imitation which be thus place have the drawboard partly rest in thod let the student carefully observe the particular turn and action of the head hou much the forehead be inclined over the right or leave shoulder and how much over the back or breast then with the charcoal let he lightly draw the general shape of the head after which the centerline of the face from the middle of the forchead to the middle of the chin and then the cross line which determine the situation of the eye nose mouth and root of the hair all this be the foundation on which the student may give the particular shape to each feature and he must remember that good proportion face be divide into three equal part the first contain the forehead the second the nose the hair to the crown of the head be just the height of the forehead the nose be the centre most artist begin they particular shape with that feature and from thence proceed to the eye and mouth but let the student fketch the outline very light that any mistake may the more easily be alter he greatest attention must be pay to the producing he draw correct and the line of the feature parallel to one another and each at proper distance if the student fail here all he labour in the finish will be to no purpose but when the line be properly draw the broad shadowe may be lay in with soft chalk disregarding the lesser part till afterwards sweeten with the leather stump then the demy shade and the heighten with white be add with which the whole be to be compleate preserve a intermediate space of the stain paper which as middle teint inust be leave between the white and black otherwise the use of draw on teint paper be effectually destroy and the production will have heavy unpleasing effect and be entirely destitute of that greatness and breadth which distinguishes the production of master from the effort of inferior ability when the student have make himself master of the knowledge of the face he may proceed to the whole figure studie with much assiduity the cast after the antique those almost perfect standard of grace majesty and beauty rule it be say be the fetter of genius but great man very judicioussy observe lately that ee they be fetter only to man of no genius which be undoubtedly true for when they be properly use by man of ability they rather assist genius than impede it on this accounti have give the measure of fine proportionhuman figure with which it be necessary the student should make himself acquainted previous to he study after the life and for this reason place this particular before what propose to say on that important part of study ten of which from the lowest hair on the forehead to the bottom of the chin be the beft proportion height the face be divide into three equal part ist the forehead ad the nose and the mouth and chinfrom the chin to the collarbone be twice the length of the nose from the collarbone to the lowest part of the breast the length of the whole facefrom the bottom of the breast to the navel one face and half nosefrom the navel to the secret one facefrom the secret to the kneepan two facefrom the kneepan to the ancle two face from the ancle to the sole of the foot nose and a half —when the arm be extend horizontally they length from the extremity of the longest finger on one hand to the other should measure the same as the height of the figure from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot from the shoulder to the elbow the length of two face from the root of the little finger to the elbow two face —from the box of the shoulderblade to the pit of the collar one face the foot be the sixth part of man s height and the hand should measure as much in length as the facethe thumb be the third part of face in lengththe shoulder that the face be most turn over be raise higher than the otherthe shoulder bear heavy burthen will be raise considerably higher than the other the hip on which the body chiefly rest will be raise higher than the other the knowledge of anatomy as far as relate to the structure of the bone and disposition of the muscle with they various motion will enable the student to draw the human figure in great perfection this may be acquire by study some good treatise on the subject and by drawing the bone and muscle in different view the attending some dissection if he have a opportunity willimprove the student much sooner than any other method possibly can le brun s lecture on the passion of the soul read before the academy in france will impart great knowledge in the expression of the muscle of the face which should be strictly attend to and also the knowledge of light and shadow as this in particular will instruct he how to preserve harmony in he picture and proper expression of the different projection these thing be acquire genius will improve by study and perfection and fame reward the labour of close application when the student draw from living model great care be require to place the figure in proper action after which particular attention should be pay to the general sway of the figure be careful to preserve what be term the centre of gravity which be that line always perpendicular from the pit between the collarbone to the heel of the foot on which the figure reststthe first sketch must be touch very lightly in square manner describe the large form by which the action of the figure be express the second time of draw over the qutline notice should be take of those lesser part which in the former slight sketch be neglect in each sketch the student must begin at the head which must be carefully place in itproper inclination or else however in other respects justly draurn the figure will have a ungraceful appearance it must be remark that all graceful figure stand on one foot only when the outline be correct and in good proportion the principal difficulty be overcome the next step be to proceed to the shadow which must be make broad and firm and not distract into too many part which would perplex the student as all the inferior distinction in the several degree of shadow ought to be second consideration and be therefore to be avoid when the whole care should be to preserve the masf of light and shade broad and masterly care should be observe where the principal mass of light fall as in every wellset figure there will be principal mass of light to preserve it broad and not too much divide consider the whole together before the part in particular ir shadow be produce by any muscle near the grand body of light it will at the first view be apt to mislead the student and incline he to think it much darker than it really be but if compare with the principal shadow the true degree may be ascertain sometimes on the rise of musele or the projection of bone the light may catch near the maf of shadow which if not draw tender will have a unpleasing harsh effect which can only be regulate by compare it with the strongeft light this method of compare one degree of light and shadow with another will be the only certain rule of preserve the tone and consistency of the whole together as the compare of length and breadth with each other be the only rule to produce the just form of figure while the figure be rest the student will have a opportunity of place he draw at distance by which mean the eye will more easily discover how much he have err from this rule which he may soften with line rag or rub out with bread at pleasure be it can not be suppose the figure can for any length of time have the same mnscle of he body in continual action the opportunity should be embraced while they be most properly exert to draw each limb and describe each particular muscle the great variety of which will give liberty to the student to exercise he genius in produce he draw in a elegant tafte section iii of the application of the crayon witi some previous disposition whether the painter work with oilcolour watercolour or crayon the grand object of he pursuit be still the same just imitation of nature but cach species have its peculiar rule and method—painting with crayon require in many respects treatment different from painting in oilcolour because all colour use dry be in they nature of much warmer complection than when wet with oil for this reason in order to produce rich picture much greater portion of what painter term cool teint must be apply in crayon painting than would be judicious to use in oil without any danger of mistake it be to be suppose the not be acquainted with this observation be one great cause why so many oilpainter have no better success when they attempt crayon painting on the contrary crayon painter be so muchuse to those teint which be of cold nature when use wet be apt to introduce they too much when they paint with oil which be seldom productive of good effect shall now endeavour to give the student some direction towards the attainment of excellence in this art the student must provide himself with some strong blue paper the thicker the better if the grain be not too course and knotty though it be almost impossible to get any intirely free from knot the knot should be level with penknife or razor otherwise they will prove exceedingly troublesome after this be do the paper must be paste very smooth on line cloth previously strain on deal frame the size accord to the artist s pleasure on this the picture be to be execute but it be most eligible not to paste the paper on till the whole subject be first deadcoloured the method of do this be very easy by lay the paper with the deadcolour on its face upon fmooth board or table when by means of brush the backside of the paper must be cover with paste the frame with the strain cloth must then be lay on the paste side of the paper after which turn the paint side uppermost and lay piece of clean paper upon it to prevent smear it this be do it may be stroke gently over with the hand by which mean all the air between the cloth and the paper will be force out when the paste be perfectly dry the student may proceed with the painting the advantage arise from pasting the paper on the frame accord to this method after the picture be begin be very great as the crayon will adhere much better than any other way which will enable the student to finisn the picture with firmer body of colour and greater lustre the late mocote find out this method by accident and esteem it valuable acquisition and remember on particular occasion he bemove sine crayon picture of rosalbaand place it on another strain dloth without the least injury by soak the canva with wet fponge till the paste between the cloth and paper be sufficiently wet so admit of separation when painter want to make very correct copy of picture they generally make use of tiffany or black gauze strain tight on frame which they lay flat on the subject to be imitate and with piece of sketch chalk trace all the qutline on the tiffany they then lay the canva to be paint on flat upon the floor place the tiffany with the chalk line upon it and with a handkerchief brush the whole over this present the exact qutline of the picture on the canva the crayon painter may also make use of this method when the subject of he imitation be in oil but in copy crayon picture he must have recourse to the follow method on account of the glass tie picture be place upon the easel let the outline be draw on the glass with small camel s hair pencil dip in lake ground thin with oil which muft be do with great exactness after this be accomplish take sheet of paper of the same size and place it on the glass glass stroke over all the line with the hand by which mean the colour will adhere to the paper which must he pierce with pinhole pretty close to each other the paper intend to be use for the painting must next be lay upon table and the pierce paper place upon it then with some finepound charcoal tie up in piece of lawn rub over the pierce line which will give a exact qutline but great care must be take not to brush this off till the whole be drayn over with sketch chalk which be composition make of whiting and tobaccopipe clay roll like the crayoi and point at each end when the student paint immediately from the life it will be most prudent to make correct draw of the qutline on another paper the size of the picture hé be go to paint which he may trace by the precede method because erroneous stroke of the sketch chalk which be not to be avoid without great expertness will prevent the crayon from adhere to the paper ow to oertain greasy quality in the composition tiie student will find the sitting posture with the box of crayon in he lap the moft convenient method for he to paint the part of the picture he be immediately painting should be rather belo whis face for if it be place toohigh the arm will be fatigue let the window of the room where he paint be darken at least to the height of six foot light may fall with every advantage on the face avoid too much shadow which seldom have good effect in portrait painting efpecially if the face he paint from have any degree of delicacy berore he begin to paint let he be attentive to he fubject and appropriate the action or attitude proper to the age of the subject lfa child let it be childish if young lady express more vivacity than in the majestic beauty of middleaged woman who also should not be express with the same gravity as person far advanced in year let the embellishment of the picture and introduction of bird animal be regulate by the rule of propriety and consistency tre feature of the face be correctly draw with chalk let the student take crayon of pure carmine and carefully draw the nostril and edge of the nose next the shadow then with the faintest carmine teint lay in the highest light upon the nose and forehead which must be execute broad he be then to proceed gradually with the second teint and the succeed one till he arrive at the shadow which must be cover brilliant enrich with much lake carmine and deep green this Ithod will at first offensively strike the eye from its crude appearance appearance but in the finish it will be good foundaeasily sully when too bright than when the first colouring be dull to raise the picture into brilliant state the several pearly teint discernable in sine complection must be imitate with blue verditer and white which answer to the ultramarine teint ufe in oil but if the part of the face where these teint appear be in shadow the crayon compose of black and white must be substitute in they place though all the face when first coloured should be lay in as brilliant as possible yet each part should be keep in its proper tone by which mean the rotundity of the face will be preserve ler the student be careful when he begin the eye to draw they with crayon inclined to the carmine teint brilliant and at first not load with colour but execute lightly no notice be to be take of the pupil yet the student must let the light of the eye incline very much to the blue cast cautioussy avoid stare white appearance which when once introduce be seldom overcome preserve broad shadow throw on its upper part by the eyelash black and heavy teint be also to be avoid in the eyebrow it be therefore best to execute they like broad glow shadow at first on which in the finishing the hair of the brow be to be paint by which Ithod of proceed the former teint will shew themselves through and produce the most pleasing effect the student should begin the lip with pure carmine and lake and in the shadow use some carmine and black the strong vermillion teint should be lay on afterwards he must beware of execute they with stiff harsh line gently intermix each with the neighbour colour make the shadow beneath broad and enrich with brilliant crayon he must form the corner of the mouth with carmine brown oker and green varioussy intermix lf the hair be dark he should preserve much of the lake and deep carmine teint therein this may be easily overpower by the warmer hair teint which as observe in painting the eyebrow will produce richer effect when the picture be finish on the contrary if this method be unknown or neglect poverty of colour will be docernable apter the student have cover over or as artist term it have deadcoloured the head he be to sweeten the whole together by rub it over with he finger begin at the strongest light upon the forehead pass he finger very lightly and uniting it with the next teint which he must continue till the whole be sweeten together often wipe he finger on towel to prevent the colour be sully he must be cautious not to smooth or sweeten he picture too often because it will give rise to thin and fcanty effect and have more the appearance of drawing than solid painting as nothing but body of rich co lour can constitute rich effect to avoid this as student find it necessary to sweeten with the finger he must continually replenisn the picture with when the head be bring to some degre ss let the background be lay in which mus different manner cover it as thin as possible and rubbin it into the paper with leatherstump near the paper should be almost free from colour for great service to the head and by its thinness give botl and solid appearance in the background also rayon but that have whiting in its composition should be chiefly such as be the most brilliant and the least adulterate the ground be paint thin next the hair will give the student a opportunity of painting the edge of the hair over in light and free manner when he give the fi nishing touch the student have proceed thus far the face hair and background be entirely cover he must carefully view the whole at some distance remark in what respect it be out of keep that be what part be too light and what what too dark be particularly attentive to the white or chalky appearance which must be subdue with lake and carmine the above method be properly put into execution will produce the appearance of painting principally compose of three colour viz carmine black and white which be the best preparation painter can make for the next step be to compleat the background and the hair as the dust in painting these will fall on the face and would much injure it if that be compleate first from thence proceed to the forehead finish downward till the whole picture be compleate in painting over the forehead the last time begin the highest light with the most faint vermillion teint in the same place where the faint carmine be first lay keep it broad in the same manner in the next shade succeed the lightest the student must work in some light blue teint compose of verditer and white intermix with they some of the deeper vermillion teint sweeten they together with great cautione insensibly melt they into one aother increase the proportion of each colour as he judgement shall direct some brilliant yellow may also be ued but sparingly and towards the root of the hair strong ver° this direction be for the finest complection but the student must vary he colour accord to he subject diter teint intermix with green will be of singular service cool crayon compose of black and white should succeed these and melt into the hair beneath the eye the sweet pearly teint be to be preserve compose of verditer and white and under the nose and on the temple the same may be use beneath the lip teint of this kind also be proper mixing they with the light green and some vermillion in finish the cheek let the pure lake clear they the lake may be intermix the bright vermillion and last of all if the subject should require it few touch of the orangecoloured crayon but with extreme caution after this sweeten that part with the finger as little as possible for fear of produce heavy disagreeable effect on the cheek as the beauty of crayon picture consist in one colour shew itself through or rather between another this the student can not too often remark it be the only method of imitate beautiful complection the eye be the most difficult feature to execute in crayon as every part must be express with the utmost nicety to appear finish at the same that the painter must preserve its breadth and solidity while he be particulariz the part to accomplish this it will be good general rule for the student to use he crayon in sweeten as much and he finger as little as possible when he want point to touch small part with he may break off little of he grayon against the box which will produce corner fit to work with in the minutest part if the eyelash be dark he must use some of the carmine and brown oker and the crayon of carmine and black and with these he may also touch the lris of the eye if brown or hazel make broad shadow cause by the eyelasn red teint of vermillion carmine and lake will execute the corner of the eye properly but if the eyelid be too red they will have disagreeable fore appearance the pupil of the eye must be make of pure lampblack becatch very strong but it miust not be make too sudden but be gently diffuse round the pupil till it be lose in shade when the eyeball be sufficiently prepare the fhine speck must be make with pure white crayon which should be first break to point and then lay on firm but as it be possible they may be defective in neatness they should be correct with pin take off the redundant part by which mean they may be form as neat as can be require the difficulty with respect to the nose be to preserve the line properly determine and at the same time so artfully blend into the cheek as to express itprojection and yet no real line to be perceptible upon close exami¬ nation in some circumstance it should be quite blend with the cheek which appear behind it and determined entirely with slight touch of red chalk the shadow cause by the nose be generally the darkest in the whole face partake of no reflection from itsurround ing part carmine and brown oker carmine and black and such brilliant crayon will compose it best tie student have before prepare the lip with the strongest lake and carmine must with these colour make they compleatly correct and when finish introduce the strong vermillion but with great caution as they be extremely predominant this if properly touch will give the lip a appearance equal if not superior to those execute in oil notwithstanding the seem superiority the latter have by means of glazeof which the former be intirely destitute when the student paint the neck he should avoid express the muscle too strong in the stem nor should the bone appear too evident on the chest as both have a unpleasing effect denote violent agitation of the body circumstance seldom necessary to express in portrait painting the method with which painter in oil express transparency in the lip be by painting they first with light vermillion teint and when dry touch they over with pure lake the most necessary part to be express and which should ever be observe even in the most delicate subject be strong mark just above the place where the collar bone unite and if the head be much throw over the shoulder some notice should be take of the large muscle that rife from behind the ear and be insert into the pit between the collar bone all inferior muscle should be in general quite avoid the student will find this caution necessary as most subject especially thin person have the muscle of the neck much more evident than would be ju dicious to imitate as few neck be too long it may be necessary to give some addition to the stem fault on the other side be quite unpardonable nothing be more ungraceful than short neck in colour the neck let the student preserve the stem of pearly hue and the light not so strong as on the chest if any part of the breast appear its transparency must also be express by pearly teint but the upper part of the chest should be coloured with beautiful vermillion delicately blend with the other section iv of drapery dainting the drapery be commonly think to be very inferior branch of the art this be most certainly mistake very great painter be afk what part of the picture he think most difficult to execute answer the drapery whether we allow this to be absolutely true or not we may venture to affirm that it be very difficult part to execute with taste merely to give the effect of silk sittin or cloth be not the point this the servile copyist by the mere dint of labour may effect and may even deceive thevulgar eye so that the imitation may be take for reality but to make the fold give grace and dignity to the the figure to cloath it uninfluenced by prejudice fafhion or caprice so as to bear the test of age require the fullest exertion of true genius and the study of manlise but it be not my design to say much on this copious subject therefore shall dismiss it with sew observation concern the colour and execution dark blue purple black pink and all kind of red drapery also should be first ting with carmine which will render the colour much more brilliant than any other method over this should be lay on the paper the middle teint medium between the light and dark teint of which the drapery be to be paint except the dark massfe of shadow which should be lay on at first as deep as possi¬ ble these sweeten with the finger be destitute of the smaller fold will exhibit masterly breadth which the lesser fold when add ought by no means to destroy with the light and dark teint the smaller part be next to be make with freedom execute as much with the grayon and as little with the finger as possible in each fold touch the last stroke with the crayon which stroke the finger must never touch in the case of reffection the simple touch of the crayon will be too harsh therefore finger will be necessary afterwards as reflect light be always more gentle than those which be direct with respect to reflection in general they must always partake of the same colour as the object reflect but in the case of single figure it may be useful to make some particular observation in blue drapery let the reflection be of greenisn cast in green drapery make they of yellow teint in yellow of a orange in orange reflect reddish cast in all red something of they own nature but inclined to the yellow black should have reddisni ressection the reflection of reddish teint will also present purple to the best advantage of whatever colour the drapery be the reflection on the face must partake thereof otherwise the picture like painting on glass will have but gaudy effect line lace fur should be touch spiritedly with the crayon finger very little except the latter and the last touch even of this like all other part should be execute by the crayon without sweeten with the finger have content myself with treat on the first principle only because many judicious writer on the subject of painting whose work notwithstanding merit the highest attention have not be so explicit on this head as seem to be necessary the method have recommend have be practise by the most celebrate crayon painter whose work have be hold in public estimation but the know¬ ledge of and ability to execute each separate part with brilliancy and truth will be find very insufficient to constitute compleat painter without he judgement enable he to unite they with each other by correctness of drawing propriety of light and shadow and harmony of colouring in order to accomplisn this the student should carefully avoid finish one part in particular till he have properly consider the connection it be to have with the rest the neglect of this be the principal reason why the performance of indifferent painter be so destitute of what term breadth so conspicuoussy beautiful in the work of great master it must be grant that this observation relate more particularly to large composition where diversity of figure require such judicious disposition that each may assist in the combination of kind of universal harmony yet even in portrait painting the student should be particularly attentive to observe this idea of breadth if he be desirous of acquire that importance and dignity which constitute excellence in painting painting with crayon op the material —he perfection of the grayon consist in great measure in they softnef for it be impossible to execute brilliant picture with they if they be otherwise on which account great care should be observe in the prepare they to prevent they be hard in all composition flakewhite and whitelead should be wholly reject because the slightest touch with either of these will unavoidably turn black the usual objection to crayon painting be that they be subject to change but whenever this happen it be intirely ow to a injudicious use of the abovemention white which will stand only in oil to obviate the bad effect arise from the use of such crayon let the student make use of common whiting prepare in the follow manner tax large vessel of water put the whiting into it and mix they well together let this stand about half minute then pour off the top into another vessel and throw the gritty sediment away let what be prepare rest about minute minute and then pour it off as before which will purisy the whiting and render it free from all dirt and grittiness when this be do let the whiting settlé and then pour the water from it after which lay it on the chalk to dry and keep it for use either for white crayon or the purpose of prepare teint with other colour for with this all other teint may be safely prepare if the student chuse to make crayon of the whiting immediately after it be wash it be not necessary to dry it on the chalk for it may be mix instantly with any other colour which will save confiderable trouble colour of heavy or gritty nature especially blue verditer must be purify by washing after this method the student must be provide with large flexible palletknife large stone and muller to levigate the colour two or three large piece of chalk to absorb the moisture from the colour after they be levigate piece of flat glass to prevent the moisture from be absorb too much till the colour be roll into form and vessel for water spirit as neceffity and convenience shall direct red carmine and eake it be rather difficult to procure either good carmine or good lake good carmine be inclined to the vermillion teint and good lake to the carmine teint the carmine crayon be prepare in the follow manner as they texture be inclinable to hardness instead of grinding and roll they take sufficient quantity of carmine lay it upon the grindstone mix it with levigate knife with spirit of wine till it become smooth and even the chalkstone be ready lay the colour upon it to absorb the spirit but be careful that it be lay on in proper shape for painting if it be levigate too thin the waste of colour by they adhere to the palletknise but practise will render the proper degree of consistency farmiliar the simple colour be prepare the next step be to compose the different teint by mixture with whiting the proportion to be observe consist of twenty gradation to one which may be clearly understand by the follow direction take some of the simple colour and levigate it with spirit of wine add about one part of wash whiting to three part of carmine of which when properly incorporate make two parcel the next gradation should be compose of equal quantity of carmine and whiting of which four crayon may be make the third composition should have one fourth carmine and three fourth whiting of this make six crayon which will be good proportion with the rest the last teint should be make of whiting very faintly ting with carmine of which make about eight crayon which will compleat the abovemention proportion as these compound teint be levigate they be to be lay immediately upon the chalk that the moisture may be absorb to the proper degree of dryness for form into crayon which may be know by its lose the greater part of its adhesive quality when take into the hand lf the consistency be find to be right it may be then lay upon the glass which have no pore will prevent the moisture from become too dry before it be convenient to form it into crayon otherwise the crayon would be full of crack and very brittle which will be great inconvenience when they be use in painting lake be colour very apt to be hard to prevent which the student must observe the follow particular painting with cravon take about half the quantity of lake intend for the crayon and grind it very sine with spirit of wine let it dry and then pulverize it which be easily do if the lake be good then take the other half and grind it with spirit after which mix it with the pulverize lake and lay it out directy in crayon on the chalk this colour will not bear roll the simple colour be thus prepare proceed with the compound crayon as direct before and in the same degree of gradation as the carmine teint vermillion the best be inclined to the carmine teint nothing be require to prepare this colour more than to mix it on the stone with soft water or spirit after which it may be roll into crayon the different teint be produce by mixture of the simple colour with whiting accord to the proportion already give bly prussian blue be colour very apt to bind and be render soft with more difficulty than carmine and lake the same method of preparation be to be follow with this as direct with respect respect to lake only it be necessary to grind larger quantity of the pure colour as it be chiesly use for painting dra¬ pery the different teint may be make accord to necessity or the fancy of the painter blue verditer be colour naturally gritty and therefore it be necessary to washi it well its particle be so coarse as to require some bind matter to unite they otherwise the crayon will never adhere together to accomplish this take quantity sufficient to form two or three crayon to which add piece of slack plaister of paris about the size of pea mix these well together and form the crayon upon the chalk this blue be extremely brilliant and will be of great use in heighten drapery the teint must be form with whiting as direct in the former instance and be highly serviceable for painting flesh to produce those pearly teint so beautiful in crayon picture it be not necessary to mix the compound with spirit as clear water will be sufficient green green brilliant green be produce with great difficulty in switzerland they have à method of make they far supe¬ rior to ours we usually take yellow oker and after grinding it with spirit mix it with the powder of prussian blue then temper it with à knife and lay the crayon on the chalk without roll they instead of this some use oker and prussian blue the crayon make of the two last may be roll various teint may be produce by these colour accord to fancy or necessity some to partake more of the blue and other of the yellow yellowyellow be the most useful and the most brilliant levigate with spirit of wine and compose the different teint as before direct yellow oker and naple yellow ground with spirit will make useful crayon mobonhote in hayse court soho be the original importer of these crayon from lausanne in swilzerland the student may find it very useful to supply deficiencies of this nature with they as the ingredient which compose these brilliant crayon be not to be meet with in england orange orange be produce with king yellow and vermillion ground together with spirit and the teint form as in other case but no great quantity of they be require brown cullenearth be fine dark brown after six or eight of the simplecrayon be prepare several rich compound teint may be produce from it by mixture with carmine in various degree black carmine and this colout mix together make useful teint for painting hair several gradation may be produce from each of these by mixture with whiting roman or brown oker be a excellent colour either simple or compound with carmine whiting ting in several degree with either of these will prove very serviceable in painting umber may be treat in just the same manner only it be necessary to levigate it with spirit of wine purple purple prussian blue ground with spirit and mix with pulverize lake will produce good purple carmine thus mix with prussian blue will produce purple something different from the former various teint may be make from either of these compound by mixture with whiting black lampblack be the only black that can be use with safety as all other be subject to mildew but as good lampblack be very scarce the student will perhaps find it most expedient to make it himself the process of which be as follow provide tin cone fix it over lamp at such height that the flame may just reach the cone for the soot to gathe within it when sufficient quantity be collect take it out and burn all the grease from it in crucible it must then be ground with spirit and lay on the chalk to absorb the moisture various grey teint may be form from this by mixture with whiting as mention in former instance vermillion tion of great use and teint make from this with whiting will be find to be very serviceable carmine and black be another good compound of which five or six gradation should be make some partake more of the black and other have the carmine most predomi¬ nant besides several teint by mixture with whiting vermillion and black be also very useful compound from which several different teint should be make prussian elue and black be another good compound and will be find of singular service in painting drapery it be impofsible to lay down rule for the form every teint necessary in compose set of crayon there be many accidental composition entirely dependant on fancy and opinionthe student should make it rule to save the leaving of he colour for of these he may form various teint which will oecasionally be useful section section vi of roll tbe crayon and dispose they por painting the different composition of colour must be cut into proper magnitude after they be prepare in order to be roll into pastil for the convenience of use they each crayon should be form in the left hand with the ball of the right first form cylindrically and then ta pered at each endlf the composition be too dry dip the finger in water if too wet the composition must be lay upon the chalk again to absorb more of the moisture the crayon should be roll as quick as possible and when finish must be lay upon the chalk again to absorb all remain moisture after the gradation of teint from one colour be form the stone should be wellscrape and cleanse with water before it be use for another colour when the set of crayon be compleate accord to the rule prescribe they should be arrange in class for the convenience of painting with they some thin drawer divide into number of partition be the most covenient method of dispose they properly the crayon should be deposit accord to the several gradation of light the bottom of the partition must be cover with bran as bed bed for the colour because it not only preserve they clean but prevent they break the box make use of when the student paint should be about foot square with nine partition in the upper corner on the left hand supposing the box to be in the lap when he paint let he place the black and grey crayon those be the most seldom use in the second partition the bly in the third the green and brown in the first partition on the left hand of the second row the carmine lake vermillion and all deep red the yellow and orange in the middle and the pearly teint next and as these last be of very delicate nature they must be keep very clean that the gradation of colour may be easily dotinguish in the lowest row let the first partition contain piece of fine line rag to wipe the crayon with while they be use the second all the pure lake and vermillion teint and the other partition may contain those teint which from they complex nature can not be class with any of the former
