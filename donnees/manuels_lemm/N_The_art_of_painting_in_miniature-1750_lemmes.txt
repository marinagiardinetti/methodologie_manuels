the tyro only and novice in the art and fuch a can not eafily be provide with mafter to qualify they for this charming employment and it be certain there be thoufand of perfon in great bri sian as well as in other nation who have greater paffion for this art than they have opportunity to cultivate the country afford but few painter whofe instruction be of any va lae and good piece of this kind be very fare among we while great number of both sex of fortune and leifure who with genius for painting be devote to countrylife languith away many heavy hour for want of some intelligence in this

begin at the very element or of mimature and omit not the the prefa the leave matter or circumftance that be requifite to full and perfect elacidation of the art shall only add that the french be charm ' with the work as foon as it be publifh ' and make such demand for it that it quickly run through fc veral edition and pread among they neighbour on the continent have be tranflate with great success into they respective tongue ol aint in min aiure not here to celebrate the praile of painting many learn nch who have to happily treat of the dignity excellence of this charming art have fave I the labour fince what they have faid of painting in general be alfo true of miniature in particular will only add in few word the peculiaricy which diftinguish it from every other specy of painting it be more delicate it require nearer view it be not eafily do but in littl it be wring only upon velum or paper and the colour be dilut only with gumwater to fucceed in this art man should be perfectly skilled in the art of design or draw but as moft people who affect the one know little or nothing of the other and would have the pleafure of painting without give themfelves the trouble of learn to defign which be indeed a art that be not acquire without grear deal of time and continual application invention have be find we to supply the place of it by means of which man defign or draw without know how to design ii the firft be calk that be if you have mind to do print or design in miiature the backfide of it or another paper mult be blacken ' with smallcoal and then rubb ' very hard with the finger wrape in linnen cloth afferward the cloth muft be lightly draw over the side of blacken ' that no black grain may remain upon it to foil the velom you would paint upon and the print or draught muft be faften upon the velom with four pin to keep ir from shifce and if it be anothe paper that be blacken ' it muft be put between the velom and the print or draught with the blacken ' side upon the velom then with blunced pin or necdle you muft pat over the principal line of stroke of the print or draught the coniour the plan of the drapery and ovef every thing elfe that mutt be diftinsuithed preft to hard that the stroke may be fairly mark upon the velom un derneath iii copyine by square be another convenient method for fuch as be but litrle skilld in the art of defign and would copy picture or other thing that can not be calk the mechod be this the piece mult be divide into many equal part by lirtle square mark out with charcoal if the piece be clearand whicith and the black can be fairly feen upon it or with white chalk if it be too brown and dusky after which as many square of equal drmention mult be make on whire paper upon which the piece muft be defign becaufe if this be do immediately upon velom as one be apt to mifcarry in the firff accempt the velom may be foil with falfe touch but when it be nearly do upon paper it mult be calk upon the velom in the manner before defcribe when the original and the paperare thus order ' obferve what be in each square of the piece to be difign as head a arm hand and to forch and place it in the corresponding part of the paper and thus find where to place all the part of the picc you have nothing to do but to form they well and to jon they together by this nicthod you may reduce or cularge b piece to what compat joupleafe make the square of you paper greater or letter than thofe of the orrginal but they mutt always be of a equal number iv to copy picture or other thing in the jame size and proportion another method be to make ule of varnith ' paper or of the skin of hog bladder very trantparent fuch as be to be have at the goldbeater talc or kinglat will likewife do a well lay any one of thofe thing upon we piece and thro it you will fee all the stroke and touch which be tobe draw upon it with crayon or pencil then take it off and fattening it under paper or velom fet up both againtt the light in the manner of windew and with crayon or filver needle markout upon the paper or velom yon have put uppermoft all the line and touch you shall fee draw upon the varnish paper blad der talc or ifinglat you have make ule of and which will plainly appear thro this window after this manner make ufe of the window or of glat expote to the light you may copy all sort of print defign and other piece on paper or velom lay ing and faften they under the paper of velom upon which you would draw they and be very good and very eaty con trivance for do piece of the jame size and proportion i you have mind to make pieceslook another way there be nothing to be do but to turn they lay the print or draw side upon the class and faften the paper or velom upon the back of it remembr to let you light fall on the lek side good method likewife to take true copy of picture in oil be to give touch of the pencil upon all the principal stroke with lake temper with oil and to clap upon the whole paper of the fame size then paft the hand over it the touch of the lake will stick and leave the defign of you piece expreff upon the paper which may be calk like other thing but you muft remember to take off with the crum of bread what remain of the lake upon the picture before it be dry you may likewife make ule of pounce make of powder 's charcoal put in linnen rag with which the piece you would copy muft be rubb ' after you have prick ' all the principal stroke or touch and faften whice paper or velom underneath bur furer and cafier hlelp than all thefe for one who know nothing of de fign be mathematical compal it make of can piece of wood in form of ruler half quarter of a inch thick half a inch broad and foot long of or more accord as you have blind ro draw piece of greater of leffer size to faciluare the conftruction of this infirument here exhibt figure of it with a explanation of the manner in which it be to be uye liitle beard be to be of fir and cover ' with linnen or any other cloth becaute the piece you copy and the velom of paper you copy upon muft be fix upon it upon this board muft the compal allo be fix with large pin by the end of the firtt foor deep enough to keep it clofe but not to deep as to hunder it from turn eafily when you have mind to reduce thing place you origihal on the side of the foorc and the havelom or paper you would draw upon on the side of the foor remove the velom or draw it nearer accord as you intend to reduce or enlarge in order to enlarge piece you have oth to do but to change the place of you original and you copy place the latt roward and the other on the sitle of and in both one and the other method crayon or leaden needle mult be put in the foor under which the velom lie and pin little blunt in that over the original with which all the trace be to be follow conduct the pin with one hand and with the other preffing genely upon the crajon or needle that mark the han the cravon or needle velon bear fufficiently upon the velom you have occafion to rouch it by this inftrument you may alfo draw in equal dimenfion but in order to this the compat mult be fix in another manner upon the board for if it be to be faften upon it by the middle at and you original and you copy muft be fix ' on each side of this middle foot at equal dillance or from corner to corner that to when the piece be large one may likewife draw feveral copy at once of equal and different dimention vi these be all the heip can give to fuch as be not mafter of design for thofe that be they have nothing to do with they b therefore you piece be mark we upon the velom you mult pat with pencil of very clear carmine ever all the prace to the end they may not be efface a you work then clean you velom with the crum of bread thar no black may re inain ipon it vii voux velom muft be paft upon little plare of brat or wood of the size you weal make you piece to keep it frin and ight but this paft muft be on the edge of you velomonly and behind the plate for which purpole you velom muft exceed yeu plate above a inch on every side for the part you paint upon mult never be paft becaufe it would not only give it a ill look but you could not take it off if you would cur off the litle shag and lock of the velom and wer ting the fair side with linnen cloth dipt in water clap the other upon the plate with clean paper between they so much as hang over muft be paft upon the back of the plare draw it equally on all side and hard enough to ftretch it well viil the chief colour make ufe of for painting in ministure be carmine and

and wektminfter the seven traufparent colour which be use where writingis see thre the colour lake bine vellow liquid grassgreen darkgreen purple colour brown ix as i as all colour take from earth and other heavy matter be always too coarle be they never to well ground especially for delicare work becaule of certain sand remain in they the finell part may be draw out by dilut they with the finger in cup of warer when they be well steep let they fettle while then pour out the cleareft which will be at top into another veffel this will be the finelt and mult be let dry and when tis ufe muft be dilure with gumwater as shall fhew hereaffer this be very good contrivance especially for flakewhite in which there be chalky matter which like the coarfe and heavy paris in other colour fink to the bottom of the cup it be itsep ' in ir you mix little of the gall of a ox carp or a eel particularly of the laft in green black gray yellow and brown colour it will not only take away they greaty

kl some colour be make clearer by fire as tellow ooaker brown red uliramarine and umber allother be darken ' by it but if you heat the faid colour with sharp fire they change for the brown red

harder to work with in miniature when tis purge after this bianner x ii all thefe colour be diluce in little cup of ivory make on purpofe or in seafhell with water in which gumarabic and sugar candy be put for inhance in glat of water put piece of gum as big as walnut and half char quantity of sugar candy this laft hinder the colour from fcal when thy be lay on which they generally do when they want it of the velom be greaty this gumwater muft be keep in neat bortle cork and never mult you take any gour of it with pencil that have colour it but with cuill or fome fuch thing some of this water be put in the shell with the colour you would temper and dilure with the finger till it be very fine if it be too hard you muft let it fokten in the shell with the faid water before you dilute it afferward let it dry and do thus with every colour except lillygreen sapgreen and gamboge which mutt be temper ' with fair water only bur clira marine lake and biftre be to be more gumin than other colour if you make ufe of seashell you muft let they kleep two or three day beforehand in water then cleanfe they in boiling hor water mix ' with vinegar in order to carry off certain salt which otherwife rick to they and spoil the colour that be put to they kiil to know whether colour be fufficiently gumime you have nothing to do but to give stroke of the pencil upon you iland when they be dilure which dry immediately if they chap and fcale there be too much gum if they rub out by paft the finger over they there be too little it may be feen likewife when the colour be lay on the velom by paff the finger over they if they flick to it like powder it be sign there be not gum enough and more muft be put in the water with which you temper they take care though you do not put too much for that make the colour extreamly hard and dry it may be know likewife by they glewiness and brightness the more they be gumined the darker they paint and when you have mind to give greater strength to colour than it have of ittelf you have nothing to do but to give it great deal of gum kiv provide yourfelf with a lvory pallet very finooth as biga you hand on one side of which the colour for the carnation of naked part of picture be to be range in the follow manner in the middle put great deal of white pretty largely pread becaute it be the colour moff make ufe of and upon the edge from the

or other thing place near the white the colour you would make em of in order to work as fhall thew hereafier x v the uufe of good pincil be great matter in order to make good choice wer they little and if the hlair keep clofe together as you turn they upon the finger and make but one point they be good but if they clole not together but make feveral point and some be longer than other they be good for nothing not for dot in particular and leave of all for carnation whenthey be too tharp pointred with only fouror five ilair longer than the reft yet clof all together they be notwithllanding good but they muft be blunt with pair of scizzar take care fat the same time you do not clip away too much tis proper to have two or three for of they the largeft for lay the grounds and deadcolour and the fnallet for smissing to bring the hair of you pencil tojoin clofe together and make good point you mult ofen put the pencil juft between you lip when you be be work moiftening and preft it clofe with the tongue even when there be colour upon it for if there be roo much some of it be take off by this means and enough lek for give fine and equal touch yow need not apprehend this will do you any harm none of the colour for miniature except orpiment which be poifon when they be prepare have either ill tafte or ill quality this expedient muft especially be ufe for det and for simmsh particularly the naked part of picture that the touck may be neat and fair and not too much charge with colour as for drapery and other thing as well in deadcolour as in finish be fufficient in order to make the flair of you pencil join well and to unload it when it have too much colour to draw ir upon the edge of the shell or upon the paper you mult put upon you workcoreff you hland ofl give fome stroke upon it before you work upon you piece x vi to work well in mmimature you mult do it in room that have but one window and fix yourfelf very near it with table and desk almoft ashigh as the win dow place you felf in fuch manner that the light may always come in on the left side and never forward of on the right x vil when you would lay colour on all part equally firong as for ground you mult make you mixture in shell and = put in enough for the thing you defign for if there be not enough tis great chance but the colouryon mix afterward be too dark or too light xviil arter have speak of velom pencil and colour let we now thew how they be to be employ in the firft place then when you would paint piece be it carnation drapery or any thing elfe you muft begin by deadcolour that be to lay by lay you colour on with liberal stroke of the pencil in the fmoothelt man she you can as the painter do in oil not give it all the force it be to have for fi mish mean make the light littie brighter and the shade let dark than they ought to be becaufe in dot upon they as you muft do after dead colour the colour be always fortify and would at latt be too dark kik there be feveral way of dofting and every painter have he own some make they dot perfectly round other make they little longith other baich by little stroke that cross each other every way till the work appear as if it have be wring with der this laft mcthod be the belt the boldell and the foonelt do wherefore advife fuch as would paint in minialure to ule it and to mure theyfelve from the firft to dot in the plump and the soft way that be to fay where the dot be loft in manner in the ground upon which you work and only to much appear as be fufficient to make the work feem dotted the bard and the dry way be quite the reverfe and always to be avoid this be dene by dot with colour much dar ker than you ground and when the pencil be nct moiften denough with the colour which make the work feem rough and uncvell xl srupy likewife carefully to less and drow you colcur one in another to that if may not appear where they disjoin and to this end fokten or allay you touch with colour that partake of borh in fuch fort

arr ome general instructive dsci for the art of draw he ingenious author of the preceed little but valuable treatife have lay down feveral rule for delincating or copy picture or print by fuch as could not draw know very well that the performance of the former would be very deficient withour the practice of the latter and he recommend it as the furelt way to excel in that charming art of painting in miniature of which he have to freely and in genuoully give tuch fulland plain inftruction it be to be admire that moft perfon from they infancy have fondness for picture and child love to buty themfelves with draw colour and handling pencil but this fondnel for the generaliry wear off by degree and be by moft quire neglect the chief reafon of which as prefume be the trouble and pain they apprehend will attend the acquifition thereof it be certain that every one be not endue with difpofition or natural inclination to that ingenious art hor can it be artain ' by labour and pain without genius but such as find they felve dispote should by all means come to refolution to attempt the practice thereof parent therefore would do well to watch and obferve diligently the inclination of they child and find that by inflind they thew natural genim and capacity for ingenuity when of they own accord they will take delight in draw fhadowing and finithing any thing they attempt to copy and feem to take pride in they performance they should by all means be encourage and be instruct by good mafter in the beft manner in the fundamental rule and precept requitite to be know in the progress and practice of either draw defign or paumt it frequently happen that bright genius a artiff bear have no opportunity to receive the infiruction of malter or be by diftance in the country deprive of the converfation with artifl and ingenious practicioner he only way be then to furnith hunself with fuch book that may guide he in he purfut after thar knowledge he of fondly arn at and for th benefit of fuch thefe leffon be inten ded not doubre they will meet with the tame encouragement and reception by the ingenious as the preceed work viz the art of painting in mimature have do to which fourth ediion have add thefe infiructive leffon for the art of draw as brietly plain and ealy as poffible ii uch as intend to make themfelves compleat in the art of draw should firft learn the principle of geomerry and perspettive and there by inform they mind of true symetry and proportion this be subject to be mer with in book write by skiifal arcift for that purpofe shall for brevity sake ouut enlarge upon it the common rule for beginner be commonl to draw the particular member of the body of man and firtt of all the pace or head be attempt by draw a oval or the shape of a egg with the feveral dimention of the cross by which learner may underfland the better to express the turning and motion of the pace in the different attaud hereafter exemplify this oval for the hlead or face belong the eye eycbrow nofe mouth and ear and to place they in they proper situation the cross be draw for that purpofe after you have form a oval drawa perpendicular down the middle this cross again in the middle with diametrical line which you divide in five equal fart each be the breadch of one eye this be call the ocularline on which you place the ly and be with the perpendicuar which gee from the top of the forehead through the middle of the nofe mourh and chin call the crof upon which the ly nofe mouth and ear be to be place in they proper situation as je may obferve in fig but for the better apprehention of fuch as be unacquainted with the ule of the crot in the oral or with the many varration of the fame as in turning and motion of the head a experment have be find to make the ute of the crot more plain and incelligib which be this have piece of weed turn in the shape of a egg as in fig then draw line from point to point lengthways through the bidft of the esg as in fig divide this in two equal part by cut right angle as you fee fis have draw the eye nofe mouth in they proper place you may by the pofition of the ess see the decliof inclination of face and accord to the pofition of fig you will see it front turn the egg or oval alittle from the leave to the right the ftraight perpendicular of the crot will change and prelent itfelf in a arch as in figbecording to which you project the nofe beyond the round of the oval and place the reft of the member of the face in they proper lie as in fig the same be obferve in turn the figure of the oral the contrary way as in fig again the oral incline downward the crot will appear as in fig and the face look down as in fiz the oval be turn backward the crot will change again as in fiz and face draw accord to thole line will appear like fig after this manner you may form variety of face except thofe which be fideway which be commonly draw by means of perpendicular as you fee in fis be upon which you place the forehead nofe mouch and chin ler they be in what difpofition they will see fig be the neceffary rule for deligning or draw face which if well obferve and practife will in lictle time furnith learner with lively idea to jraw face with good judgment and give they mafterly stroke and tonch of which otherwife by meerly draw or copy after print he would have be unacquaintiii ed with ving advanced and mount the firlt scep and the young praditioner be well grounded in draw the oval and face he may then exercile humfeif to copp with great care and diligence after good draught and print the former be the molt proper for fuch as incend to exer cife the art of painting and the larter for such as propofe to practice erch of grave begin with fuch as be caff andge forward to fuch as be more dit ficult and have arrive to some perfection this he may adventure to copy affer panring and to contract large picture inro acall obferve due proportion and by diligent practice he will accuftom hefelf to quet

painting and shall be more fully treat of in its proper place the beft patternsto draw or copy after be life afelf or all natural thing here a arrift have large field to range in and he need never be idle but may always find innumerable subject to improve he talent which can not be better do than by diligence and application iv come to the practice of the artof draw itfelf and firft of draw after draught print or picture you muft frlt of all oblerve to fix you principal in proper light to as to fee in diffind and plain place it at proper diltance accor ding to the largeness of the picture or draught you defign to copy put it rraight before you and not flat for then you would fee in forethorten the paper vou draw upon fix five or fix double on board hold that on you knee with which you elevate it as high as you would have it thus you will the beccer compare you draught with the principal before you which otherwife in cafe you draught lay far you could not do to well thus be fix for to begin you piece guet firft the middle of the picture or whatever you intend to copy after and make mark with you coal in the middle on you paper from this mark on will guet at the proper diftance of the figure difpert in the piece if there be more than one and by take heed of the cantal stroke with free and flight touch you will foon fee whether the poficion of you figure be jult leave the

this purpofe they hang lamp at convenient hleight well pro vide with oil and diver wick and to prevent the light pread itfelf too much but remain more conflant they put some oil paper through which the light cannot fhine behind it and thereby it pread the fronger upon the model they copy set yourfelf from the figure you be to draw three time as far as it be high in such manner that you eye may in rraight line behold the model hanging plumbline before it and have draw erpendicular line on you paper jou obferve what come either on the one side or other to you view and then make rough skerch of the pofition of the figure what in the beft manner you be able have here faid of draw after plaifier of paris by the lamp be not to be obferve in general for as it caft flrong and hard shade they be judge not to nacural and sweet as those cauf by the light of day and be therefore not approve of by the generality of experiencd arcift and in cafe they do draw by the lamp they put frame with oil

by what mean by mmeans of the general for the general lump feen by you even when he eack be turn upon yeu will make you prefently know hum ei now come to fay fomech concern the nature and virtue of light and shade there be no thing in nature which can be diftinguished by we in leffer or further diftance from we nor can it be without expreft by the art of draw this knowledge for without dark and light nothing refemble what it ought to do for it be that which give be and re prefentation to all thing to prove this draw counterfeit upon white paper with black chalk when finith it be like the perfon and judge to be well draw here it may be ask whar correfpondence have black chalk wherewith you make you shade and the white paper by which the light be reprefent with the original that be lifer to which lantver it be not the black chalk nor the whice paper nor any fingle stroke draw but it be the effect of the light and shade in they proper place that reprefent life itfelf to we for it be im poffible that either round circle or spot of flat colour should reprefent globe except the roundness be give it by light and shadow x ii oung pratitioner or learner should by all means ufe themfelves to the beft manner of draw that to finith they work plain finooch near and eaty to blend the shade and light to as to be loft the one in the other this they mult endeavour by indefaigable pain and although in the beginning it will feem difficul and they performance difpleat yet let not this difcourage they from purfue they aun for none be bear mafter and he that never do do ill can not expect ever to do well one day bring on another and with it fome amendment till you arrive to perfection which will be reward for all the labour and pain you have take in the acquifition of this charming art xiii picture or draw that want perspective be look upon as irrational and dead wherefore shall inform le practitioner what it be and how to attain the knowledge of that science of neceflary in delign and painting perspective be that which caulesall thing contain in draught or picture to come forward or fink backward and caufe they from the firft to the laft to fland in they due

every arch or pillar have the one after the other as allo the fland of people in they proper and fingular place of likewife in draught or picture by the diminution of light and dark the diftance mult be obferve agreeable to the appropriat declination and every draught or picture whether after narure or plaifter of paris you mull well obferve what appeareth forward or backward and how one thing follow another this be one of the moft difficult siudy belong to the art of draw and painting wherefore practitioner ought to inform humfelf in time either by the inttruction of mafter or by reading of book of perspective xiv go through the principal property belong to the art of draw it will now be requifite to fum up what have be faid for make you work compleat and perfect in you rough skeich obferve to bring in good spirit free and pleat to the firtl view corre the firft rough draught in the draw it over again and accultom yourfelf in reprefent the shadow and touch with the coal in order to be certain in the pofition of you fisure hlave compleate you delign as far relatresto the ufe of charcoal then draw with either you pen or pencil with diligo care the outline endeavour to keep of bring in all the beauty comelinets and gentiliry of the figure take particular care and diligence to oblerve and keep the bending and motion of the body and the eaty displaying of the fold ing of garment in they comelinel and genteel difpofition for it ofcen happen that by small bend whole part of figure be entirely spoild this be fault youth be much addict to by obferve thofe finall bending too much which they commonly make toobig and there by der prive piece of that beauty which with precaution they might have preferve and this put I in mind to caution young practnioner not to rely to much on the particular but the general as have obferve already in the ath article for in be too attentive in finifh and obferving the little and infignificant part you lofe that which ought to make the moft shew of amafterly performance therefore let you chicfell care be to obferve and finith the general part to perfection for the small or particular one may be put in afterwards with more eafe this be a article highly necelfary for young practitioner to be instruct in but to the shame of they teacher moft of they be keep ignorant in this particular thus some painter will take abundance of pain to draw face near at iland with all it be deformity if it have any as pit of the small pox scar spot and the like when otherwife at convenient diftance they might have the general with the particular in more agreeable appearance than it then reprefent wfelf and that with less pain and trouble but this be the cafe with many pretender in the arr of painting that they can not draw portraiture to be any thing like except they bring in all the mlark wrinkle c you draw withred or black chalk take hlee you stroke be not hard or too charp especially in the light part in the frong witch man b fhady part you may carry bold drike always obferve that in the fhadow ing of you piece the stroke lofe and vanwith away to that one might judge as if you have finith you piece without drawing the circumference of we line for thus it will be agreeable to nature where no stroke can be feen this you may obferve in picture as well as in good print of drawing it will happen that in draw between whice and whire and againtt the light stroke or outline muft be draw for to expret the draught and diftinguith ir from the ground especially when draw on white paper but this you should endeavour to thun as much as poftible and not do it except necefficy compel you to it and you have no other means leave to avord it but as can nor here fpeak of all the caufe incident to this cafe will only exemplify one for the better apprehention of young practicioner by the two face in the oppofite print the face as you plainly perceive be draw compleat with a outline stroke and the face bonly reprefent the shadow that be underneath the nofe mouth esc the queltion be whether a error be commit in the face which might by the weline of the face be amend for my part fay no but on the contrary ob ferve in the face ba fingular curioficy and beauty where whice againtt whice make termination without circumferent stroke apprehend well this example you will improve if in you drawing and gam thereby fingular and accomplifh manrer what have faid on this hlead be to be obferve with due caution for as rough sketch only confift in circumferent line or stroke neverthelel dexterity give it fingular beauty you may by this rule ap prehend how to work on coloured paper where by the heightnings you may do much and fave many stroke you be oblige to express on white paper x v now come to the finifh part here you muft not childifhly or apithly imi late stroke for stroke but obferve the in rent of the mafter in he expreftion dif pofition shade and light in he figure if you draw face after picture of after life obferve the paftion and phi ognomy thereof take norice by what stroke touch turning shade or otherwife fuch face be make to look forrowful or merry cry of laugh old or young wild or modeft foul or clean homely or beautiful and by oblerving this you will not only follow the same stroke touch and shade as near to expret the fame action and paltion but alfo you will retain the fame in you mind and underfland it with well grounded knowledge when you begin to finith you draught take hfe you make not the shade at firft to hard or deep as they mutt be when finifh you may eafily bring they to be darker but not to to make they lighter acquire good judgment in difpoling you shade to that they may fling thing either backward or forward for wharever you draw with let it be redlead indian ink black chalk cec vo mult expret one extream dark or light and therefore accuttom yourfelf from you beginning to draw to fhadow very light and fweet fame and even and bring in the perspective of dark nets as much as poffible and by obferve this you will find yourfelf feldom deceive but gain honour and applaute by you per formance be careful to keep you draught in one even and equal condition to that it may not appear as if compote of dark and light spot but let the light and shade correspond and agree together the leffer dark with the faime and the faint with fronger light otherwife you work will prefenrly incline to hardness and ftiffnet which if you examine life you will never meet with there whey you draw on coloured paper after print or draught obferve the even likeness of dark and light keep the oreat part of light and shadow and the intermixt part in the jame manner that the greater may always have the predominancy over the lef shall conclude with advife
