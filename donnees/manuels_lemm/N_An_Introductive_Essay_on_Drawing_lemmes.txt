accordingly fheir slave be forbid the study of it none but person of distinction be honour th so great privilege and prince themselves not only patronizit but think thz practice of it a addition to they glory the roman in imitation of they have the like veneration for it and they emperor consul and other of superior rank employgreat part of they be in that delightful study and strove with laudable dable emulation to excell and this art retainits excellency as long as the empire flourishied but when that decay and fall prey to the qutrage of several tyrannic prince the art languishand could no longer boast she imperial patron and professor but though too long obscurthe cloud once more removthe art reard up she droop head and throthe industry and application of some curious man and the encouragement they meet with from those in power regainnew vigour and shone again in she sirst lustre nor be it without just ground that this artwas hold in such high repute she beauty be and ever will be entertaining to the curious and nothing more illustrate the glory of nation than she production by the labour of she professor the egyptien greck and roman expressthe action of they he ro and transmit they fame to latest posterity nor have this art be less advantageous to religion than the state tne heathen of old be canious in tne practice of it and make it branch of they divinie worship and the christians particuiarly those of the romish persuasion still keep up a equal veneration for it the mystery of they most holy religion and the triumph of they saint and martyr be represent in all they chaiacter by the aplest artist and whose work be to this day the object of publick adoration subject of this nature when they be thus artfully exprèssand shine in picture make more decp and last impression en the mind than all the charm of eloquence itself but as the foliow essay be principally designfor the instruction and improvement of youth shall not enlarge on tne history and progress of this art what little have offer hope will be sufficient to induce they to the study and practice of it to set value on it suitable of its nature and excellence and regard it as a accomplishment as useful at least and ornamental as any other genteel acquisition and as there can be no art without its precept any more than house without door for a en irance into it and as youth should be lead gently by the hand and they learning be make pleasure not pain shall lay down in as clear familiar and instructive manner as can some general rule for they future observance as well with respect to drawing they colour or outline which be they first operation as light and shadow which beautisy those first design and make they strike the eye with wonder and delight by proper application to which with the assistance of a industrious hand hope the young practitioner in ashort time may be enable to judge with knowledge and pur sue he labour with pleasure and success instruction in general the first thing requisite be happy genius which be the influence of the star and the peculiar gift of heaven how to improve it many book can teach we how to obtain it none and without it all agree nothing material can be do and to which you must be oblig for the greatest beautie of you art it be a unhappy loss of time for youth to endeavour to gain that which he have deny he as the frait of the earth have not they proper relish nor flower they innate beauty and fragrant smell when transplant into foreign soil and rearby a artificial heat before they due season so it be in vain that the young studient toil and sweat in the fursuit of this art if the totural bent of lus inclination be direct another way he therefore that would be proficient in this art and be blest with genius for it fhould study the theory first before he meddle with the actice to act otherwise would be preposterous and irratio nal it would be like he ventr out upon the wide ocean without helm or compass to direct he when once the theory of he art be become familiar to he when once he know what course to steer there be no danger in the pursuit of he voyage andi he safe arrival at the wishfor port the precept you must get habit of imitation by frequene tryal which if it be do with pen take care to avoid scratch and make thin and lean stroke but rather broad one draw from above downwards but some of the hagch must be sharp fome broad some unequal some equal accord to the shade hold the pen or pencil somewhat long and not so upright as be usual in writing as if you lay it strait forward and when you draw with chalk use you selfto turn they in you hand which will hinder they grow blunt so soon as otherwise they will begin with eye nose mouth and ear in thé drawinig of face form the circle or oval of the face then make stroke down where the middle or tip of the nose and mouth should be place which stroke must be make strait down in full face but arch or oval in a oblique or sideface for demonstration take a egg or lvory box in that shape mark the line with ink and it will ex plain this rule in all its foreshortnings thoughthis be the general rule of proportion yet hature often vary which render the object to be imitate more remarkable and casy as to the various passion expressin face need not treat of they it be already so well per formby the chevelier le brun when you be in drawyou oval and can divide the to all position you must proceed to hand and foot arm and leg seperatély before you attempt whole figure for more easy method should advise you to hang small thread and plummet before the figure you draw by then make perpendicular line on you paper by this means you will more easily set you figure upright or discover the bend or the sway and action of it how every part answer each other in perpendicular line next hold ruler or pencil parallel to the several part of you figure thereby you will find how the shoulder hip knee and muscle answer each other in parallel in order to draw the form of any beast begin at the forehead with you coal first lightly draw dovnward to the nose mouth upper and nether chop end the line at the throat then viewing it again where you begin from the forehead over the head ear and neck continue till you have give the full compass of the buttock then mark cut the leg and foot view it again touch out the breast with the eminency thereof lastly finisn the tail paw tongue beard and tooth in bird begin also the draught at the head and beware of make it too big then the breast line from under the throat down to the leg there stay and begin at the pinion to make the wing which be join to the backline will be presently finisn the eye leg and tail must be draw last always let in bird as in beast the farthest leg be shortest infect as fly bee wasp grasffiopper worm and such like be easily draw but nature be the best pattern to draw flower begin fromthe rose tuft ox wart in the middle as in rose or marygold which be make draw line equally divide from thence to the greatest compass or extent of the flower they may be draw either fully open or in the burdbut must be sketchgently cut the ebafe rudely give they afterwards they vein or jag gedness nature alone and not the manner of any other master must be the pupilfaithful guide she image he must for ever retain in he mind and draw from ghence all the beauty that be to enter into he fu ture work fortis impossible to express that with the hand which never enterinto the imagination nature augment the force and vigour of the genius and she it be alone from whom art derive she ultimate perfection by the means of sure experience whilst he contemplate on these truth and make necessary reflection on they let the labour of he hand attend and accompany the study of he brain let the one second and support the otheryet let not too eager pursuit and application and overassiduous care blunt he genius and abate hij vigour however let he not indulge himself so far as to pass over one day without some ractice by sketching and draw something no matter what let he as he walk along the street observê the air of head or the different posture of animal and they expression which the less they seem to be regard be always the most free and least any occurrence should slip he memory let he enter into memorandumbook which he should have always ready in he pocket every thing he judge worthy of he netice whether ohject on the earth in the air or upon the water whilst the idea be fresh in he imagination thus initiate let he be very curious in tlie choice of he master he who begin well have already perform dhalf he work be a excellent italian proverb there be nothing more pernicious to youth who be yet in the element of draw than to en gige himself under the discipline of a igncrant master or to foilow bad origmal and copy from book that be already publish which be the draw work of pupil in order to learn they which be daily sell at most print shop and be very pernicious they will deprave he taste by a infinite number of mistake of which they mean performance be full and there by make he imbibe the poison which infect he all he future day never begin to draw till you have well consideraf you design and settle you qutline nor till you have present in you mind perfect idea of you work be ever consult the best artist he who be indolent in he study and incurious in he fnquiry who form no scruple about what he undertake it contents himself with he own mean performance and blind and selfconceit imagine all thing mighty easy demonstrate he be only pretender not workman and that the art be beyond he weak capacizy to attain but when once youth be duly conscious of the many difficulty that attend he in the execution of he work every reflection that arise inspire he with new vigour to overcome they and ey industry and applicatien he make every day some progress and improvement whenever therefore young gentleman you own observation cr the advice of superior artist point out any error in you operation be open to conviction act impartially to yourselves and correct it without delay lest by exposing you work to publick view you betray ycur weakness and want of judgment flatter not yourselves that you can regain the credit which you once have lose by future amendment draw like writing be of long duration not like the sound of a instrument which if die in its biin be hear no more and soon forget but whatever mistake of this kind be once publisnto the world they be past recall and be the everlast olject of contempt and ridicule nog be it sufficient excuse that necessity conpellyoû to hasten you production or that you have not time to be correct nature be suffice with litttle and bare subsistance with credit be much more valuable than treasure with ignominy and disdain let you thought be bend upon acquireing glorious name which can never die but with the werld and make that the noble recompence of all you labour be very careful how you form judgment ofyou own performance ner depend too far ontheapprobation of you friend friend be we second selve and apt to be too partial foe be the most sincere do not arrogantly difdain to learn the opinion of every individual person that observe you workfor even those who have little or no judgment in the art of draw may distinguisn the defect of nature and by parity of reason may form just idea of the blemish of the art be very careful not to be overseen in proportioning the circumstance of you brawing for though the practice be too common it be shamefully ridiculous sometimes you shall seehogse so very smail and the doorso very low that they scarce reach theknee of they inhabitant though they be supposede néarer the eye of the spectator than the persongawho beto ènter into they city and town sometime yoù will find so little and low that cne of the figure behind might stride over they with ease but such and the like absurdity ought carefully to be avoid let nat one side of you draw be void whilst the ogher be sitted to the border but dispose matter so that both side may appear equal but not uni form as reverse whether there aremany figura in it or but sew avoid draw such view as be unnatural as aslo forcaction andmotion shew no part which be eitier immodest or disagreeable to the sight avoid likewise object which be full of hol iow break in piece or in parcel then all those thing which be inhuman and shocking to the eye as also all representation which be obscene lasciviwe unseemly fantastic poor and wretch in fhort all thing which corrupt they natural form by confusion of they fart which be entangle in each other for the eye lookdown with horrour on those tning which ttie hand will not condescend to touch have no manner of relish for gothic ornament since they be in effect so many monster which barbarous nation have produc consider the place where you lay the scene of you picture the manner of all the person s action a it they law custom and dress and every thing in short that properly belong to they in all you operation follow the order of toture carefully avoid draw cloud towards the bottom of you piece and water in the uppermost part of it never place stone column on foundation of wood but observe decorûm it be say of xenophon that nothing please man so much as decency and order and it be rule lay dovn in horace which be equally just in draw ¬ ing as in poetry set all thing in they own peculiar place and know that order be the greatest grace this good oeconomy or distinction of figure in they proper place produce the same effect in relation to the eye as concert of musick to the ear observe therefore in thedisposition of you work that the spectator at the first glance of the eye may conceive the principal paffioit intend to inspire if the subject you have choose be that of joy it be nècessary that every thing which enter into you picture should contribute to that passion if that of sorrow let every thing in it haven s sereke of distress take care to avoid introduce figure that be foreign to you subject for such may be callpléafantly enough figure to be let horace it be true have give poet and painéer permission to dare every thing but yet he licenee neither of they to transgress the know law eof nature for he add immediately after but let the bound of lieente be fix not thing of disagreeing nature mix not sweet with sowr nor bird with serpent joynnor the fierce lyon with the fearful hind use therefore you licence with become boldness but let they be ingenious and not im¬ moderate and extravagant lastly never trust too far to the strength of you memory anid the conception of nature imprint on ycur mind the memory be too weak too niarrow to retain all the various object of we sight the best and furest method be to have nature herself as often as possible you can for you model of light and shadow have thus lead the young practitioner thrcugh the first rudiment of draw he outline shall now proceed to what principarly aimat in this efsay to instruct he in the dispo¬ sition of the light and shadow of he figure becording to they respective situation which be eloathing the design or drawing dress they up and make they appear more lively than what they be do nothing rashly weigh well and consider what you be about some faais require à fainter other stronger light and some shadow must be deeper than other be curious in you observation of they quantity and mixture as to the contour or outline take notice where they be the direct the shadow how much light center in the line where they be broad and strong and where faint and lan guid never let you light and shadow terminate apruptlybut fall gradually one within another till at last like cloud of smoke they lose themselves insensibly if you habituate yourselves to be thus curious and exact practice will soon render ycu expeditious when youdraw after nature or the life consider how large or small the object be which you propose to imitate remove yourself from it three time it be magnitude have you eye in level with it and be very curious as you draw every individual stroke to remark what shadow s part of you statue nudity or any other object you be imitate meet under perpendicular or principal line as to the position of you model high light equally diffusand not too strong and glaring be the best object so disposshew all they beauty and the minutest part appear to advantage the light thus fall from above do not strike upon or inlighten all the part but some be shelterby the relievo of other the eyebrow defend thehollow of the eye the nose some part of the mouth and the chin obscure the throat you must likewise observe that the shadow of object be not always single feside the strong and eprincipal shade there be many other which be almost imperceptibly throw over like thin cloud uponit but experience will convince you of the truth and ferspective of the reason of it for all spherical body receive as many varicus light and snadow as there be various body that furround they the picture of fine lady hang up at the entrance of dark room will strike the eye with surprising delight by the awer of light and shadow if it be artfully dispose that be if the shadow s side of the face appear obscurby the gloominess of the place towards which it be situate the illuminside be still heighten by the bright ness of the air which expand itself over the wholg whereby the shadow on that side become aé least very faint if not wholly imperceptible this artful increase of light and shadow give any figure fine relievo and make it shine with more than cormon lustre in draw à face therefore never let the muscle be too bold orclose too abruptly all on sudden but let you light be sweet die away as it be and inseniably loose themselves in soft delightful shadow on you due care in this particular all the charm and grace of face principally depend always choose if convenience will permit of it north light for you constant situation astismuch steadier than any other if you chamber fhould be open to the south it wiil be very proper and convenient to fik a oilpaper sash before it for by that medium the ray of the sun which will strike upon it all day will be more moderate equally diffuse itself and be constant without any visable variation when you be draw from the life let youi light come from such a altitude as that the shadow of body project on the plane may be equal and in proportion to they height in the representation of body give they al way such light as be most proper ard convenient to they suppose situation if in the field and open air the sun be obscurby the cloud and not visible they should be surround with a al most universal light but if the sun be conspicuous or fhine out in its full lustre then the shadow musk be very strong and dark in relation to those fart which receive the light and the extremity of all those shadow as well those which be borrow as tlaose that be criginal must be very bold if the object you have choose for you repre sentation be suppose in room little though not very much illuminand you survey it from with out and stand on level with the light that strike upon it the shadow of that figure must necessarily be very soft and look beauteous to the eye for notwithstanding the softnef of the shadous the figure will feem as if embossand come boldly out particular light youil find more advantageous to figure than universal one and make they appear with the greatest relievo the reason of this be particular light produce reflex which loosen as it be the figure from the ground these re flex be create by the light of figure or some thing light behind they and reverberate or dart back upon the shadow of those which be di rectly overagainst they and giye they glimmer ing light but figure if suppose in dack and obscure place though expose to particular light receive no reffex no part of it be see but what be illuminate this indeed be seldom or never use but in nightpiece where the light must be very particular and exceed faint the qutline or contour of figure however discover more art and contrivance than the light and shadow which be but the third part of draw ing and in colour it be cail cromatique for in vention be the first part and the outline be the next which be the composition and disposition of the work to put all thing in beautiful order and harmony without which you be but copier for invention require the greatest strength of ima gination and shadow the extent for the mem ber be all limit to certain and peculiar motion whereas the projection of shadow the quality and degradation of light be boundless and un circumscribed when you draw after any figure andsind you self at loss to limit the exact eound of you sha dow dow always leave they unfinishby this artful negligence you discover you own mdesty and at the same time you strict regard to the imitation of nature all allow that the air be clearer more subtle and transparent the farther it be removfrom the earth upon which account the upper part of object that appear above we and be see at some considerable distance be more visible and conspicuous than those that be under for the visual ray whereby we discern the latter journey through long track of grof and dense air but the ray by which we view the former though they begin in thick and foggy air onthe side of the eye yet on the side of the object they terminate in much clearer and more subtle air the further they remove from the eye they become finer and finer in draw landskip therefore you must always make you mountain less clear at the bottom than the top and the same rule must be observas to church and other high building the greater distance they be suppoto be at the clearer always miust they top appear and the loftier they be they form must in proportion be more conspicuqus and distinct object that be nearest the eye and place in the front of the picture must be more finisn and more bold than those suppose to be at some die stance from we as to reflex of light on clear and transparent bedy whose surface be moderately dense and posiffiray of light that thus strike upon these body reverberate or rebound like tennisbail and reflect upon the first body that stand in its way the surface of dense body be surround with light and shadow whose quality be widely distant there arè twe sort or kind of light namely primative and and derivitive primitive light be that which be innate in any body and not borrow of aany other derivitive light be light reflect that which be not inherent in body and be borrow of another the light of the sun be a original light he shine with he proper ray the moon be a opaque body of herself and all she light be borrow she silver beam all sne can boast of she receive from that superior luminary but to proceed there can be no reflex of light en that side of body whereon it be shadow that be to say from that side turntowards any opaque place or body as grove tree herb or plant for though every bough and every leaf admit of light yet the vast number of bough and leave constitute dark body through which the ray of light can never enter the reflex of light be brighter or less appa¬ rent accord as the ground on which they be discernbe more or less obscure when the ground be more dark than the reflex the former serve as foil to the latter and the reflex will appear strong and apparent on the other hand when the ground be brighter than the reflex it must naturally appear more gloomy by the lustre that surround it and by which mean it can scarcely be discernbut that which be visible on the darkest ground must appear the boldest and most plain on the other hand that on the brightest ground must be least di stinct and most obscure this arise from the contrast between thing of different degree of darkness the least obscure setting aff the other with superior lustre and the brighter render the other still more obscure and less ob vious to the sight as any two thing of unequal whiteness when play by way of contrast one against the other the superior whitenéss reflect foil on the other beyond its native darkness for light be of communicative nature diffuse itself on every thing not hide from it particuiarly on every thing that be plain and smooth but where there happen the least elevation shadow be produce which exhibit the figure of the illuminate part on the plan light though quite contrary to shadow be yet what give it it be be as the body or object be what give its form or figure in effect it must be hold for certain maxim that shadow always retain the same point of sight as the object small light illumine body occasion the shadow on the unenlightened side to be large and they extremity to be very bold on the other hand large light make the shadow on the same side of the body less distinct and mere minute in they limitation when little but strong light be inclose in another more extensive yet still more weak as the sun in the air the most feeble in that case will have the effect of shadow on the bodic which be enlighten by it in any draw therefore where multitude of frigure be introduce either man or beast you must observe to make those appear the most obscure that be lowest and farthest involved in the croud figure that be expoto a universal light appear more beautiful and strike the eye more agrceably than those that be illuminonly with particular light and the reason be because large and strong light surround the relievoe of body so that the figure enlighten thereby appear with force and freedom and preserve themselves at great distance whereas those that be more confine and only enlighten by small contract light receive very large as well as very deep shadow you must never admit two equal light in the same picture and let the light strike forcibly on the middle or front of you drawing and lastly when you draw you figure avoid strong shadow on the middle of the limb but place those shadow round abcut they thereby to heighten the part and take such advantageous light as be large that after great shadow may succeed as for sattin and silk and all other shine stuff they have certain bright reflexion with sudden light and exceed bright glance especially where the light fall broad then the reflexion be less bright as the garment fall more inward from the light the like be see in armour and braf pot or any glitter metal you may fee à sudden brightnef in the middle or centre of the light which cause the shine nature of all such thing as thefe direction if carefully follow will be sufficient presume to answer the end propose in prefixing this snert essay shall freely submit the follow exemplification of they to the censure or approbation of the publick
