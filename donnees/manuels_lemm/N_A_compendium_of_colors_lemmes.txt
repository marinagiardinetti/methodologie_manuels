inircdugtion he urility of the follow compendium will appear to all who consider the variety of substance which be employ in compose many color and other material use in the art it be to be refrett that some professor be not more intimately acquainted with this part of science but to the student for whose service this compilation be chieffy intend such information be evidently of great retvantage a injudicious mixture of pignent contrary in they nature and property produce very doagreeable consequence be universally agree as indeed might naturally be expect from the various dissimilar origin of the ingredient of which some eat production of the animal other of the regetable kingdom fossil afford some and mine fal other beside this they have undergone variwe mode of preparation for use for some can not be use without calcination other will hot bear the fire some constantly retain they proper hue other though brilliant at first after while become totally corrupt and by they corruption they injure or destroy they companion which might otherwise have stand well it appear evident therefore that knowledge of the origin of any pisment may conduce much to beneficial association of it with other no doubt many other substance beside those in common use might be of great service if they probe more sausfactorily understand or if better method of manage they be discover which can only be the result of experiment moreover we know that foreign country afford variety of material different from we own which be use by the artist of those country it would be des sirable acquisition as well to the study of natural history in general as to the art if gentleman who have opportunity would inform themselves on such subject of they origin they manner of tieatment and they mode of preparation for use of they han ture and they effect and if they could import samples for examination by we own artist not only those artist but perhaps by some happy docovery the nation might become oblige to they ry laudable endeavour we own kingdom and its dependency afford variety of substance which we now receive from foreigner it would be well worth while for examine we nlative production with reference to theirt fure the utility not to mention the pleasure arise from investigation of every part of the work of nature it i submit to gentleman and to artist who reside part of the kingdom that such intelligence of british production might be very acceptable to ariist in other part of the kingdom whose situation detain they from such knowledge and in particular it be submit to artist that as the perfection of art be only to be attain by liberal communication of improvement which becur to individual by such generous behaviour and by such only can the art attain that excellence which be the earnest desire of every genuine artist such information would be valuable to the public since there by many expensive material might be su= persed by other equally serviceable at much less price or improvement on those now disregard might render they object of greater attention whereby not unfrequently we manufacture as well as the art might derive great advantage in some degree on this principle few article not in general use be admit into this collection for though they own service be but small they may afford hint to aid the discovery of other more

inferior to ultramafine blue it be discover by accident about the beginning of this century chemist of berlin have successively throw upon the ground several liquor from he laborttory be surprised to see it suddenly stain with most bedutiful color recollect the liquor he have throw on each other he make sinilar mixture in vessel and produce the same color he do hot publish he process but prepare and sell he thie which be substitute for ultramarine the account of it be first publish in the berlin memoir but without description of its process in paper of dr. woodwards communicate to the royal society there be give short way ofmake prussian blue which be find to answer perfectly well and occasion several experiment whereby be discover the nature of the substance iuse in that preparation the method be this four ounce of bullock s blood dry and four ounce of sait of tartar prepared from four ounce of crude taftar and as much hitre be calcine together two hour after which black spungy substance remain in the crucible weigh four ounce solutioh of which be make itn boiling water and afterwards filtered leave remainder which when dry werghe hine dram a ounce of english vitriol be dissolve in six ounce of rain water and eight ounce of crude allum be also dissolve in two quart of water these be mix hot with the blood become green but on add two or threey ounce of spirit of salt they become of fine blue vol ii edit subside and leave the water clear the pro duet be a ounce of very fine color fit for the palette the experiment make by mixing in different manners and proportion the several liquer of which this color be prepare all produce blue but in different degree some be deeper other paler in one experiment the allum be wholly leave out and very pale blue be produce in another the allum and vitriol be use in equal quantity then the blue be extremely deep in all receipt give for make prussian blue the liquor be order to be mix together boiling hot except the spirit of salt and the color be most readily and beautifully make this way method of make prussian blue in perfectioh have be purchase as very valuable secret its process be very extraordinary and could scarce be derive priori from any reasoning about the nature of color it be allow to be a excellent blue pigment in point of color but its durability be justly suspect it should not therefore be use in work of consequence the goodness of prussian blue must be distinguish by be brightness deepness and coolness four different process give for make the finest sort of prussian blue with quick lime be give in the hist of the acad of science at parss for the year take of ox blood dry and reduce into kind of small scale a equal quantity of quicklime newly bake of red tartar and of saltpetre pulverise the whole grossly and put it into crucible place in the midst of great furiace and give it gradual fire after four hour when the matter be reduce into kind of paste which emit no more smoke and be equally red throw it by spoonful into two pail of boiling water and have fillrate the lixivium mix it with solution of of allum and of green vitriol this operation will yreld but secuta but its beauty will make sufficient amend for the small quantity as it will surpass in this respect all prussian bly prepare by other Ithods it have also as good a effect as the finest ultramarine and have besides the advantage of resist the impression of the air process il take of dry ox sblood a equal quantity of quicklime of red tartar and nitre let they be calcine and lixiviate as in the former process pour the lixivium into selltion of of allum and of green vitriol this operation will yield more of the blue secula than the other but the color will be less beautiful process iii take of dry ox blood of quicklime of red tartar of saltpetre proceed as before this operation will produce most beautiful blue but the quantity will be only about and dram process iv take of dry ox blood of quicklime of red tartar and ilb of nitre calcine and lixrviate as before pour the warm lixivium into selution of of allum and iltgret vitriol the secula precipitate in this waywis be as beautiful as those of the first

cure during the summer month this flower have two bly in it pale color in the large outer leave and deeper blue in the middle of the flower these produce much the best color this may be observe by rub the leave while fresh on piece of writing paper so as to express the juice which will yield a excellent color that by the experience of two or three year have not be find to fade sufficient quantity of these middle leave be procure let the juice be press from they to which little allum be add will give last transparent blue scarcely inferier in brightness to ltramarine be very probable that if the chife of these fower be cure in the same manner as saffron they would produce much greater body of color from which tincture might be draw with more case than when press fresh from the field mo . boyle also recompmend another fine blve produce from the blue leave of rue beaten in stone mortar with wooden pestle and then put into water for fourteen day or more wash they every day until they be rotten these beaten up at last water and all until they become pulf and then dry in the sun will make fine blue for shad blue transparent for wash map cc take half pound of the best french verdigris add six ounce of red argil let they soak together about six and thirty hour in about two quart and half of fair water then boil they till the ingredient be dissolve let the liquor sertle and pour it off united with the tincture of avignonberry it make a excellent green and will keep well to secure which you may add little spirit of wine it be necessary to caution we friend against morsttening the

depend principally on the mixture of the component color and on the adaptation of the vehicle by which they be hold incorporate this be evident if we consider with respect to the brilliancy or the truth of the tone of color that it depend on the admission of more or less of any certain pigment and that all compound color by possess too much of any one color which enter into they composition may prove when use unfriendly to they neighbour that the vehicle of importance appear from the consideration that scarce any two earth be equally tenacious whence it follow that as some naturally of loose

be perhaps proper to remark that although sofi crayon be preferable generally yet crayon may be soft even for large work and that for smaller work they may be never the worse if little firmer yet preserve the utmost distance from bardness soft crayon may however be use in large performance but those which be too hard to give they color freely or without wet be to be reject as totally useless

part of deeper tint than the rest occasion by the settle of greater quantity of color in some place than in other or sometimes if one part of the space be dry before the rest by second coat of color pass over it begin the boundary of you space first that you may not exceed they be careful that no two limit which touch each other be of the same color since the prime intent of this business be distinction distribute yourcolor if practicable so as to produce pleasing effect in the whole after the various division be faintly wash the boundary line should be very neatly color with much stronger color of the same kind color print in this business regard should always be have first to the paper on which the print be print if it sink it may require the assistance of roch alum or other strengthener the body of printing ink which remain on the surface of the paper should proportion in many case the strength and consistence of the color to be use accord to the effect require if it be intend only to stan the print the effect of the en grave will be useful as form shadow and as keep the draw .. if it be propose to color the print highly as advancing towards picture the engrave although it must be attend to as the regulator and guide of form and of effect yet may be conceal by surface of color ouit white color wherever you can do without it in the light or part approach to light let the thipness of color supersede the admission of white omit black color on the same principle if you can not do entirely without it take especial care to use as little as possible that it be not heavy in the broad light rather mingle color of nearly similar tone to produce the effect require than admit white the same principle adopt in the shade take great care that the outline of all object be mellow sweeten and soften and hnerther sudden nor rug nor cut to the eye sometimes print may be wash and afterwards finish with body color to good effect farmony and tenderness of color

sometimes they be more perfectly ourline and wash with indian ink then the color be add afterwards to finish the whole drawing do in color only seldom look well be usually deficient in effect and repose for be it always remember glaring color be purtful the best way for slight drawing be to procure a effect with the indian ink and then brilliancy and variety of tone ecc with color flesh color should be very tenderâ€”the less the hish be load with color the better in general the light require more finish than the shade in which breadth of pencil have usually a excellent effect warmth be

so much color on it as be sufficient to give fine and equal touch none of the color use in miniature painting be porsonous of prejudicial except kingyellow and orpiient which be seldom or never use this method be particularly use for dot and finish the naked part of picture that the touch may be neat and not too much charge with color as for drapery and other large mass it to draw the pencil

graceful manner without stoop or crampness which be very detrimental to health sketch the outline of the picture with thin carmine this be finish proceed to dead color make the shadow tender that they may afterwards be heighten by dot and bring to proper color and spirit there be several method of dot and every painter have that peculiar to himself some make they dot perfectly round other make they

of the general effect of it depend on the addition of accessary which be to complete its these if well dispose and apply suite to the main subject not only embellish that subject but confirm and invigorate its effect by impart splendor and brilliancy throughout the wholewhereas if unsuitable and unfit they enfeeble what have be already well do and spoil that which in itself have spirit â€”in short for these also consult nature craygndrawings the follow article will furnish much information in the manner of use crayon which may with propriety be adopt in drawing intend afterwards to be finish with chalk to that article therefore we refer as illustrate the present the procedure in this instance be by prepare the mass of light and shade with crayon either lightly touch with the finger or more accurately define with stump accord to the size of the subject the draw be thus insert in proper color the chalk chiefly red and black be very neatly stip into every speck or interstice agreeably to the color of the part use red chalk where the flesh incline to red and black chalk in the shalow or in the part incline to blne ec in work some subject it be good way to scrape little powder off each crayon that may be requisite and to lay the several listle heap of color in order on white paper then the outline be dreviously draw with small roll of paper carefully make rub in the color and finish with chalk stump make of kidleather glove if not soil in that part serve very well roll up tightly will answer the purpose yet better some use stub camelhair pencil several crayon make of earth when thoroughly dry then gradually warm or rather hear and dip into linseed oil till saturate may be shar= pene to very fine point and the line draw by they will not be injure without violence perhaps by judicious experiment complete set might be cempose of of crayon the perfection of crayon consist much in they be kindly temper for it be impossible to execute brilliant pieture with they if they be not on which account great care should be use in form they to prevent they be hard we have already forbid white lead in they composition because it will certainly turn black which white chalk tobaccopipe clay or whiting well wash will to do whether painter work with oil color water color or crayon the grand object of he pursuit be still the same just imitation of nature but each species have its peculiar rule and method painting with crayon require in many respects treatment different from painting in oil because color use dry be generally warmer than when wet with oil the proper paper for crayon be strong daper it either brown or blue the thicker the better if not t coarse and knotty the knot should be level with pen knife or by hard rub then past the paper very smooth on line cloth previously strain but some artist reckon it most eligible to delay pasting the paper till the subject be deadcolor .. the method of do this be by lay the paper thus deadcolor on its face on smooth table and pasting the back of the paper the frame with the strain cloth must then be lay on the paste side of the paper after which turn the paint side uppermost and lay piece of clean paper on it to prevent injury this do it may be stroke gently with the hand by which mean the air between the cloth and the paper will be force out with box of crayon in the lap be the sit most convenient posture to paint in the box make use of when the student paint should be about foot square have nine partition in it in the upper corner on the left hand suppose the box in the lap place the black and grey crayon those be the most seldom use in the second partition the bly in the third the green and brown in the first partition on the left hand of the second row the carmine lake vermilion and all deep red the yellow and orange in the middle and the pearl tint next as these last be of very delicate nature they must be keep very clean that the gradation of color may be easily distin guish in the lowest row let the first partition piece of fine line rag to wipe the crayon with while they be use the second all the pure lake and vermition tint and the other partition may contain those tint which from they complex nature can not be class with any of the former that part of the picture which be immediately painting should be rather below the face of the for if it be place too high he arm will be fatigue the window of the paintingroom should be darken at least to the height of six foot from the ground as before direct for miniature and the subject to be paint should be situate in such manner that the light may fall with every advantage progress progress of portrait sie feature of the face be correctly draw with chalk take crayon of pure carmine and carefully draw the nostril and edge of the nose hicxt the shadow then with the faintest carmine tint broadly lay in the highest light upon the nose and the forehead proceed gradually with secondr tint and the succeed to the shadow which must be cover brilliant enrich with lake carmine and deep green this method will at first offensively strike the eye from its crude appearance but will be good foundation to produce pleasingieffect in finish color be much more easily sully when too bright than raise to brilliancy the pearly tint of fine complexion must be imitate with blue verditer and white but if the part of face where those tint appear be in shadow crayon compose of black and white must be substitute though all the face should be lay in as brilliant as possible yet each part should be keep in its proper relation of tone and of color to the other touch in the eye with crayon inclined to the carmine tint brilliant not load with color but lightly incline the light of the eyevery much to blue cast cautiously avoid stare white preseive broad shadow occasion by the eyelash avoid heavy tint in the eyebrow treat they like broad glow shadow on which afterwards the hair of the brow be to be paint by which method the former tint will shew through and produce pleasing effect begin begin the lip with carmine and lake the streng vermilion tint should be insery afterwards mark the corner of the mouth with carmine brown ochre green intermix if the hair be dark preserve much of lake and deep carmine therein this may be easily overpower by the warmer hair hat which will produce rich effect when finish have deadcofor the head sweeten the whole together by rub it over with the finger pass very lightly begin at the strongest light on the forehead uniting it with the next tint and so off till the whole be sweeten together ofien wipe prevent sully the color be caus the finger frous not to shnoothen or sweeten picture too ofteny because it will produce rather the appearance of draw than of painting to avoid this replenish the picture with crayon wherever and as often as necessary when the head be somewhat advanced let the background be lay in which must be treat in different manner cover it as thin as possible near the face the paper should be almost free from colot for this will do the head great service by its thinness in the background no crayon that have whiting in its composition should be use but chieffy such as be least adulterate the ground be thin next the hair will give a opportunity of painting the edge of the hair in light manner when finish the face hair and background be cover carefully view the whole at some distance remark what for what part be too light and what too dark be particularly atteative to white or chalky appear ance which must be subdire with lake and cakminne the next step be to complete the background and the hair because the dust in painting these will fall on the face and would much injure it if that be complete first from thence proceed to the forehead finish downward till the whole picture be cemplete in painting the forehead the last time begin with the faintest vermilion tint in the same place where the faint carmine be first lay keep it broach in the next shade work in some light blue tint in = fermixe with they somewhat deeper vermition tint melt they into one anether some light yellow may also be use but sparingly toward the root of the hair strong verditer tint intermise with green will be of use pearly tint compese of verditer and white be to be preserve beneath the eye under the nose and on the temple be = heath the lip tint of this kind be proper mixing they with the light green and vermition in finish the check let lake clear they from any dust contract from the other crayon then with the lake intermix bright vermilion and last of all if the subject should require few touch of orangeeolor crayon but with extreme caution after this sweeten that part with the finger as little as pessible for fear of produce heavy effect .the beauty of crayon picture consist ipn one color shew itself through or rather between another beautiful this be the only method of imitate complexion to advantage the vol ii edit eye be the most difficult feature to execute in crayon as every part must be express with the utmost nicety to appear finish at the same time that painter must preserve its breadth while partncularising the part to accomplish this it good general rule to use the crayon in sweeten as much and the finger as little as possible . when point to touch small part with be want break off little of crayon against the box which will produce corner to dark eyelash use some of the carmine and brown ochre and the crayon of carmine and black and with these touch the irn of the eye if brown or hazel red tint of vermition carsine and lake will execute the corner of the eye properly but if the eyelid be too red they will have disagreeable appearance the pupil of the eye must be of lampblack between this and the lower part of the irn the light will catch very strong yet it must not be make sudden but be gently diffuse round the pupil till lose in shade when the cyeball be sufficiently prepare the shine speck must be make with pure white crayon first break to point and then lay on firm but if defective in neatness it may be correct with pin by take off the redundant part the difficulty with respect to the nose be to preserve the line properly determine at the same time so artfully blend into the check as to express its projection and yet no real line to be perceptible on close examination in some circumstance it should be quite blend with the check which appear behind it and determine entirely with slight touch of red chalk the shadow cause by the nose the darkest in the face partake of no reflection from surround part carmine and brown ochre carmine and black and such brilliant will compose it best prepare the lip with strong lake and carmine with these color make they completely correct and when finish introduce vermilion but with great caution as they be extremely predominant in color the neck preserve the stem of pearly hue and the light not so strong as on the chest if any part of the breast appear its transparency must be express by pearly tint but the upper part of the chest should be color with beautiful vermis lion delicately blend it be evident that the forego principle be applicable only to the finest complexion it would be absurd to treat the portrait of seaofficer with transparent bly and pearly tint variation of color accord to the subject be indispensable but such variety be not difficult to whoever reflect on what have be already hint crayon usually appear to greatest advantage in the tender blending of they tint in female countenance the warmer and bolder color succeed best in oil we have be particular in notice the place of the color because the same rule apply in many other subject and be draw from nature itself p draperl a crayon dark blue purple black pink and all kind of red draperre should be first ting with carmine which will render the color more brilliant than any other method over this should be lay the middle iiht except the mass of dark shadow which may be lay on deep with the light and dark fint the smaller part be to be make with freedom execute as much with the crayon and as little with the finger as possible in each fold touch the last stroke with the crayon which stroke the finger must never touch in reflexion the simple touch of the crayon will be harsh therefore finger will be necessary with respect to reflexion in general they must always of the same color as the object reflect but in the case of single figure of whatever color the drapery be the reflexion on the face must partake thereof otherwise the picture like painting on glass will have but gaudy effect line lace fur should be touch spiritedly with the crayon finger very little except the latter and the last touch even of this should be execute by the crayon without sweeten with the finger the coat of crayon should be but thin on the shadow but in the light body of color will contribute to force and to durability paintinc on glass or bacepainting this manner of painting be execute with great facility it give all the softness that can be desire and be easy to work there be no outline to draw nor shadow to insert but the color be put on without the trouble of either the print for this purpose be do in mezzotinto but many of those wellfinish engrave in the manner of chalk be very proper fory

sparingly time will deprive it of its beauty unless it he well secure by varnishâ€”it be bad driey tellow ochre the best stone ochre be very difficult to procure genuine but the want of it may be supply by sienna earth and nottingham white which will produce pretty much the same tint or rather brighter with this advantage that it be deeper in its tone with less of the lead in it the great body of the lead support the siennd earth which alone be semitransparent red ochre be valuable color when prime and genuine for though cheap it be often to be have only of a inferior quality the best be that which be very hard and stony difficult to grind more difficult to procure in perfection this with little deep lake be not inferior to the best indian red in many effect that may be produce by it it be friendly mixing color of great useâ€”should be ground with put ail though lipnseed oil be commonly use for it light rep be fine light ochre burnt this mix very agreeably with white and produce flesh color of great use fine red lead by a improve method of pusify it be render very bright and stand well of of vermilton the true native cinnabar be by some artist reckone the best it will not

may be produce with this and good lake but they can not equal the brightness of this by any mixture wharever indran red be strong pleasant working color but will not glaze well and when mix with white falls little into the leadch tone it be ground and use as lake mixture of red ochre and lake be occasionally substitute for indian red nevertheless this be useful and powerful colorâ€”indeed it be often rather too powerful and especially while wet in which state it differ from itself when dry experience alone can justly foresee its true effect lake be tender sympathising decpre but of no strong

valuable from it be great depth of tone it have great body and will stand well be produce by fire .put some good asphalrum into a iron ladle set it over very slow and feeble fire take care it do not boil over keep it there till it will boil no more but be become nearly cinder when cold put to it the proportion of half a ounce of sugar of lead to half pound of the calx grind it in the strongest drying oil it will work free and dry well nv this operation be call burn of asphaltum asphaltum thus burnt i use in some composition of etch groundttde cround brown pink be fine glaze color but of no strong body in the flesh it should never join or mix with the light because this color and white be enemy and mix to warm dirty hue for which reason they joining should be blend with cold middle tint in glaze of shadow it should be lay before the other color that be to enrich it it be one of the finish color and therefore should never be use alone in the first painting it be strengthen with burnt umber and weaken with terra verte ground with linseed oil and use with drying oil better color in the opinion of some artist and more certain may be make from antwerp brown and patent yellow umeer burnt or unburnt be especially useful in deadcolor it form outline ec well or wash in subject xc to advantage burnt umber be very quick drierâ€”is fine warm brown and good work strong color it be of great use in the hair and mix finely with the warm shade it be highly commend by some artist and highly blame by other as sullyingcolor ultramarine be the finest blue know in the world it stand even in the fire it be tender glaze beautifully and never glaresâ€”it be retire color from its great value should be use with the purest oil prusstan blue be fine blue and kind work color but apt to be cold and rarely or never stand well it should be ground in nut oil as grosser oil injure ir should only be ground as want lampelack be troublesome color and should be burnt in a iron box till red hot be greasy color and when mix with the strongest drying oil still require the assistance of little sugar of lead to force it to dry ivory black be far preferable to lampblack as it mix much berter with other color it be good shade for deep blue ivory black and little indian red make good general shadow colot it be eround with linseed oil and require the assistance drying oil black be in its nature cold and tes tiring color except where by the force of contrast if come forward in which case it have great power to set palette quantity of color be squeeze out of its blad ler on the centre of the pallette work it into proper form with the addition of what oil be requi= sitel by the palletteknife and transplace it into its station on the upper part of the pallette begin with the lighter color place next the hand from these original compose row of secondary tint by mixing they together in such proportion as appear most likely to suit the subject to be treat third row still nearer to the subject may easily be form from the former to be somewhat more particular we suppose the original color place in they order on the upper part of the pallette to compose second row of color take for example lake and naple yellow to these we imagine white to be add this compos sition we place in the second row and so of the rest if we wish for lighter tint of the same color this produce by a addition of white or perhape we want red somewhat different varying to light red of to vermition these united form compound admit lower on the pallette or the secondary color instead of red require yellow or different kind of yellow or in short any other coler which ay be departure from the first mixture this combination be term break the color it be use be prevent glare and rawness and its judicious exercise be principal take of masterly hand nature never present pure unmized strong color of any cast but every color have a inclination to of tinge of some other blue sky seem at first a exception yet it be not so in fact nor the color of the sed nor the green of field for a inhumerable variety of light reflex exc be perpejually play upon it and there by diversify debase and confusing the original color even drapery vary in the color of they light and shade the yellow light of the sun the red light of fire white light cc alter they appearance and the deprivation of light in the shade as the part be more or less retire be too obvious to need explanation yet even shadow be alter by reflexion from they neighbour it be evident from this mode of reasoning that to set pallette well require no meak skill and perhaps if those who consider it as labour lose be to bestow more attention on it they picture would not fare the worse for it we shall therefore give variety of mode as practise by the best master method of set the pallette as use by chevalier menss and other the principal light of fiesh be compose of white and naple yellow or light ochre or brown ochre accord to the complexion of the person of these form the first and second tint white light red with little yellow the same little dark for middle tint white black and yellow temper with bittle red . the same little darker for shadorw tellow black with little red in three degree of strength in all these shadow tint little asphaltum may be use in order to give transparency and a harmony for warm tint naple yellow and lake lake and vermilion lake and light red lake and terra de sienna burnt little asphaltum must be use in all these warm tint likewise make two other tint compose of black and white only â€”and two other tint of purplish hue which be compose by mixing little vermis lion with the black and white another method of set the pallette light fellow ochre and white ditto the same little darker ditto light red little yellow ochre and white light light the same little darker for very fine complexion add little vermilion in the tint no and ditto vermilion and white be also necessary in the check cc demitint the same as no with peach black second tint fellow and black in the dead little red third tint terra de siennd burnt yellow and black reffexion to no add yellow ochre and brown ochre dirto to no add lake and burnt ochre black lake burnt ochre and terrd de sienna in set pallette it be good to observe to lay those color near each other which harmonize for example first white then naple yellow next light yellow dark yellow light red vermillion terra de sicnnd burnt lake blue umber light and burnt and black also observe in mixing the tint on the pallette to place they under in like harmony beginning with the lightest of each and so place those of the next degree of strength one beside the other of the principal tint for painting flesh make by mikture frgm the principae color light red tinr of lightr and white it be the best condition of all color for general ground for flesh with this color and the shadetent we should make out the flesh like claro obscure or vol ii edit we should also remember that this color will grow darker because it be naturally too strong for the white therefore we should temper it ii eh by mixing some vermilion and white with it in pro portion to the fairness of the complexion and though thus mix it may yet be call the light red tint to avoid confound the vermition tint with it vermilion tint vermilion and white mix ed to middle tint it be the most brilliant light red agree best with the white light red and yellow tint carmine tint be carmine and white mix to middle tint it be the most beautiful red for the cheek and lip it be finish color and should never be use in the first painting rose tint make of the red shade and white mix to middle degree or lighter it be one of the cleanest and most delicate tint use in flesh for up the heavy dirty color and therefore clear in changing will sympathize and mix kindly tellow tint be often make of naple yellow and white or of light ochre and whice which be good work color remember the ochre be too strong for the white therefore it require little allowance in use it it follow the light red tint and should always be lay before the bly if we lay too much of it we may recover the ground it be lay on with the light red tint blue tint ultramarine and white it be pleasant work color with it we should blend the gradation it follow the yellow and with they miake green and with the red it produce purple no color be so proper for blend down or softening the light into keep lead tint ivory black and fine white mix to middle degree it be fine retire color be of great use in the gradation and in the eye green tint be make of prussian blue light ochre and white this color will dirty the light and should be lay sparingly in the middle tint it most use in the red shadow where they be too strong it be of dirty anripathize nature shade tiwr be make of lake indian red black and whire mix to murrey color of middle int this be the best color for the general ground of shadow therefore call the shadefint it mix with the light and produce pleasant clean color little inclined to the reddish pearl as the four color of its composition be of sympathising tiature this mixture will be the same and therefore may be easily change by the addition of other color red shade be lake and very little indian red it be good work color and good glazer it strengthen the shadow on the shadetint and receive when it be wet the green and blue tint agreeably it be good ground for all darkshadow warm shade be make of lake and brown pink mix to middle degree it be fine color for strengthen the shadow on the shadetint when they be wet or dry we must take care that it do not touch the light because they will mix with it to dirry snuffcolor and therefore should be soften with tender cold tint be dark dark shade be make of ivory black and little indian red only this color mix very kindly with the red shade and sympathize agreeably with the middle tint in the deadcolor it be glaze color for the eyebrow and darkest shadow it be a excellent shadowcolor and one of the finest working color first painting the color and tint necessary for the first painting of flesh fine white light ochreâ€”and its two tint light redâ€”and its two tint vermilionâ€”and its tint tipt make of lake vermilion and white rose tint blve tint lead tint green tint halfshade tintâ€”made of indian red and white shade tint red shade warm shade finish pallette for fine complexion re quire more viz carmine and its tint lake brown pihik ivory black and prussian blue the first lay of color consist of two partsâ€”one the shadow only the other the light the use of the shadow be to make out the draw very correctly with the shadetint as if it be to be do with this color only and remember to drive the color or lay it sparingly the light lay in with the lightr tint in different degree as in nature these two color united produce clean tender middle int to go over the darkest shadow with the red of warm shade will finish the first lay the warm shade if lay on the shadetint improve it to warther hue but if lay insread of the shadetint it will dirty and spoil the color it mix with if the red shade be lay first instead of the shadetint the shadow would appear too red and bloody the shade and light red tint be so friendly and delicate in they nature that they will not dirty each other though we be continually change they to finish the first painting improve the red and yellow to the complexion and after they the bly that the bly on the red make purple and the yellow green the same method be to be understand of the shadow but be sure to leave they clean and not too dark therefore allowance should be make in they grounds with the light red because glaze will make they darker acloth of dark or bad hue require strong body of color all over the shadow such as will not sink into the ground but appear warm and little lighter than the life that it may be of the same forwardness to finish as if it have be on light oround for the business of deadcolor be that we leave i always in proper order for finish the grounds of shadow in the deadcolor should be such as will support the character of the finish color clean and little lighter than the finish color because the finish of shadow consist in great degree of glaze all shadow and color that be to be glaze should be do with color of clean solid body because the glaring be then more lasting and have better effect the light red and white improve be proper for the first lay or ground which should be always do with full pencil of suff color brighter than the life because it will sink little in drying the greater the body and quantity of color and the stiffer it be lay the less it will sink every color in diy will sink and partake in proportion to its body of the color it be lay on all the light of the flesh if not lay on light ground must consequently change little from the life supposing there be no allowance make the shadetint for the shadow should verge upon the rise tint in proportion as the complexion delicate it be think the great master of color seldom sweeten or soften the color but in uniting the first lay be very careful in preserve the brightness of they color and therefore do not work they below the complexion the first painting should be leave bright and bold and the less the color be break the better we should forbear use any color that will prejudice they and the content to add what be want in the next painting painting the second painting begin with lay on very small quantity of poppy oil then wipe it almost all off with dry piece of silk hankerchief leave only moisture remain from it the first lay of the second painting be scumble the light and glaze the shadow then finish the complexion with the virgin tint and improve the likeness as far as we can without daub scumble be go over the light where they be to be change with the light red unts or some other of they own color such as will always clear and improve the complexion with short stiff pencil scumble only such part as require it the light red tint improve be good color for scumble and improve the complexion in gene = ral where the shadow and draw be to be correct employ the shade tint drive the color very stiff and bare the easier to retouch and change it with the finish unts part of the shadow should be glaze with some of the transparent shadow color such as will improve they and come near to the life take care not to lay on too much for fear of lose the hue of the first painting the ground of which should always appear through the glaze in umting the light and shade they should not mix dead and meally the more the light mix with the shade the more meally those shade will appear go over the complexion with the virgin tint to improve the color to the utmost both in the light and shadow this should be do in the same manner as we lay they in the latter part of the first painting with the red yellow and bly blend they with delicate light touch of the tender middle tint without softening we should leave the tint and they grounds clean and disimct and be content to leave off while the work be safe and unsullied leave what be require farther to the conclusion for in attempt the finish touch before the color be dry we lose the spirit and the draw and dirty wherever we touch painting of finesh it be now suppose the complexion want little more than few light touch therefore there will be no occasion for ofling before we begin .. we begin with correct all the glazing hrst where the glaze serve as ground or under part then we determine what should be do next before we do it that we may make the alteration with one stroke of the pencil there by preserve both the glazin and the tint but if we can not lay such va= riety of unts and finish color as we intend it be better to leave off while the work be safe and in good order because those few touch which would the beauty of the color may easily be if we have patience to stay till the color be dry and then add those finishing with free light stroke of the pencil it be much easier to soffen over sfrong tint when they be dry than when they be wet because we ay add the very color that be want without endangering the part that be dry if any of the color of the pallette want to be change to the life when we be painting it be better to do it with the knife on the pallette than with the pencil of backgroundss the principal color necessary for painting back grounds in portraiture as wall building or the like be white black indian red light and brown ochre prussian blue and burnt umber from which the eight principal tinis be make as follow peael be make of black white and little indian red lead of black and white mixt to dark lead color teleow of brown ochre and white olive of lightochre prussian blue and white flesh of indian red and white mixt to middle tint murrey of indian red white and little black mixt to kind of purple of middle tint stone of whice umber black and indianre darkshade of black and indian red only here the lead tint serve for the bly the fiesh tint mix agreeably with the lead the murrey i good blend color and of use where the olive be too strong the umber white and dark shade produce variety of stone color the dark shade and umber use plentifully with drying oil make warm shadow color these color may be lay ii edit with drying oil because they mix and set the better with the softener begin from the shadow side of the head and paint the light first then the gradation and shaiir dow with large stuffish tool sparingly with the dark shade and white little change with such color as will give it the hue require but very nedr in regard to tone and strength leave they like ne dark and warm shadow should be lay before the color that join they with the dark shade and umber because if those color be lay on first they would interrupt and spoil the transparency which be they greatest beauty the more the first lay be drive the easier and better we may change it with the finish tint therefore we may lay they with the greater body as we heighten and finish the light we do it with warmer color accompany with tender cold tint the lightest part of the ground be always hearest to the shadow side of the head and this part govern all the rest it should be paint with variety of light warm clear color which gradate and lose they strength imperceptibly we must take care not to cover too much of the first lay but consider it as the principal color when the light be well adapt to support the head it be easy to introduce whatever kind of shadow we find most proper then soften and blend the whole the tint will sink and lose little of they strength and beauty in drying grounds wall cc may be finish at once painting or at terwards glaze with little of the dark shade and dryingoil drive very bare and they hue improve with few light touch of the color that be want the dark shadow may also be strengthen and improve by glaze after the subject be nearly finished for fear of make they too strong curtain should be deadcolor when we paint the ground with clean color of hue near to the intend curtain such will support the finish color with tender sort of keep in regard to they tone in the light but much softer in the shadow mixing and break the whole with the color of the ground as fresnoy say body that be back in the ground should be paint with color to those of the ground itsen if we can not set the fold the first painting we should leave the mass of light and shadow in regard to the keeping of the picture broad and well united together such may appear easy to finish on the color of the landscape th backgrounds should be break and soften with those of the part which join they hereby bring they into keep so that the part do not stare nor cut at they extremity the sky should be break with the lead and the hesh tint the murrey tint be of great use in the grounds of distant object the umber and dark shade in the near grounds the green should be more beautiful than we intend they because they will and grow darker after all be paint we should go over the whole very lightly with the softener siar ic be painting deapery the rightmethod of painting drapery in general be to make out the whole with three coloy oply the light the middle rint and the shade tint the middle unt should be very near to the general hue of the drapery and the shade tint dark enough for the general hus of the shadow the light should rather incline to warmish hue middle tint should be make of friendly working color such as will mix of clean tender cool hue and the shade tint should be make of the same color as the middle tint only with less light with these three color we should make out the whole like I before we add any of the reflexion of finish int the refiexion of drapery cc be generally pro duction of they own and lighter than the shadow on which they be find be produce by light they will have light warm color mix with the local color that receive they here it will be ne= cessary to observe the general method in manage the color of the first lay and those of the reffexiopn and finish tint in the first lay the high light should be lay with plenty of suff color then shape and soften into chgracter with the middle tint very correctly where the gradation of the light be slow as in the part it be proper to lay the middle tint first at they eatremity with tool that will drive the colery and leave it sparing because the light will mix and hie the better upon it next make out all the shadow with the shade tint drive bare after this the middle tint which fill up and serve as kind of second light and gradation should be mannage very nicely to produce character without touch any of the high light which finish the irst lay reflexion and finish tint be in general anti pathy to the first lay they will without great care dirty the color on which they be lay and therefore should he lay with delicate light touch without softening if overdone it may be recover with the proper color of the part either directly or when dry the color of the cloth be very improper for the ground of drapery we should change it with those color which be most likely to improve and to support the finish coler this method will preserve they in they greatest lustre in dead coloring the light and shade need only hint at the shape and rounding of the figure but if we have design to work from it will be proper to make all the large and principal part in they place with clean color lighter than the intend drapery though in general of the same hue while the shadow be no darker than middle tint these should be mix and break in tender manner then soften with large tool that nothing rough or uneven be leave to interrupt or burt the character of the finish color instance instance of particular kind of drapery sattin all white should be paint on white grounds lay with good body of color by reason this color sink more into the ground than any other there be four degress of color in the first lay to white sattin the fine white for the light the first tint make of fine white and very little ivory black mix to a exact middle degree between the white and the middle tint this color follow the white and with this we should give the light character take care that this tint appear distinctly between the white and the middle tint the middle tint should be make of white black and little indian red mixt to beautnful clear color of pearly huc remember to allow for the red hue change little toward lead color if there be occasion to make any part of the middle int lighter we should do it with the first tint only this color should also be lay sparingly before the white in the light that happen in the middle tint and shadow on which we should lay the white with one light rouch not cover all the part make with the first tint but preserve softening edge or bor der between the white and the middle tint the shade tint should be make of the same color as the middle tint but with less white so that it be dark sough for the shadow in general with which we should make out the shadow into character in the reflexion and finish tint of white sattin brown ochre mix with the color of the light be useful color in general for all reflexion pro duce from they own color accidental reflexion be make with the color of the part from whence they be produce and the local color that receive they two reflect tint be want for drapery in ge= neral one lighter than the middle tint the other darker these may be change on the pallette with the first and the middle tint as occasion require or be lightly break on the part that receive they but this last method be not so safe as the other the tint for blend the dark shadow to the mellow tender hue be make with the shade tint and little brown ochre lay on very sparingly with soft light touch for fear of make they heavy if it be overdo we may recover it with the color it be lay pon we often see little blue use in the first tint of white satfin when warm or dirty color be mix with clean light one they will form dirty color it be the want of the red hue which make white sittin often appear like pewter blue sattin blue sattin be make of prussian blue and fine white the best ground for blue be white for the light and black and white for the shadow the first lay of color for blue be divide into three degree the the middle tint of beautiful arure coler for the light about middle degree be ween that and white the shade tint dark enough for the shadow in general the broad should be lard with plenty of color and shape to character with the middle tint before we lay on any other color the less the color be mike the better they will appear and stand for the light of blue should be manage with as much care as those of white sattin next follow the rest ofthe middle unt and then the shadow the more we drive the shade tint the better it will receive the refiexion and finish tint the shadow should be strengthen and blend with ivery black and some of they own color mixt into tender mellow hue the reflexion be make as those of white sattin with ochre and some of the light which should be jane at ence the shadow when dry may be imdrove with the color they be make of the prussian blue best to be use be that which look the most beaunful before it be ground the soorner it after it be ground the better velvet may be paint at once the method be to make out the first lay with the middle tint and shade tint on which place the high light with light touch and finish the shadow as those of sattin but the nearest imitation of velvet be procure by glazing have first prepare ground or dead color with such color as will when dry bear out and support the glaze color the glaze color be of fine transparent quality use smply with oil only that whatever ground it be lay on the whole may he applar distinctly through it .. the best ground for blue be make with white and ivory black the white for the high light which with the middle tint shade unt make out the first lay like mezzotinto the middle unt should be lighter in propore to the graze because that will make it darker it be often necessary to cover all but the high light glaze lay with less quantity than if it be to be do once only if any of it touch the light should wipe it off with clean rag the very high light should be improve and make of fine and leave to dry glaze color be prussian blue ground very fine with nut oil and should be lay with large stitlisn fool that will drive the color as occasion require on the last glaze strengthen and finish the shadow we observe in this instance that glaze the middle tint which be make of black and white will not produce color so blue as if it have be prepared with prussian blue and white yet this color will preserve the beauty of the light in they perfection by reason of its tender obscure hue when the blueness of the other would diminish they this method of glaze blue be the general rule for all glaze the greatest fault in colof drapery of any kind painting the shadow part with strong slarin tndliy color which destroy the beauty of the light this be not only the reverse of art but of nature whose beauty of color be always diminish in proportion to the light for this reason we should blend and soften the vol ii edit shadow with such friendly colof as will agree with they local character and the requisite degree obscurity graze blue the ught may be glaze with owri ultramarine though the other part be do with prussian blue hereby save great quantity of that valuable color though this general method of painting sattun to make the first lay of color with three degree produce two they they of tint yet in use more for the mixing of two different color on the make another of middle tint between they so do the light and middle fint and the middle and ngi shade tint the first mixture answer to the first tint l white sattin and the last be sort of gradation or half shade if the light and middle tint mix to beautiful clean color of middle hue between both there will be no occasion for color to go between they as in the blue sattin but if in mixing they produce tint incline to dirty warm hue then there must be another make of sympathizing nature to be between they to preserve the beauty of the light be necessary to understand these principle of the first lay of color as comprehending the general rule of color and that on which the practice of excellent color depend scareef and crimson light vellow red make of light ochre lightr and white be the proper ground for scarlet the be indian red and in the darkest part with very little black the secopnd painting should be lighter than we the finish color to be in proportion to the glaze which will make it darker high light be vermition for cloth and ver milion and white for gartin and relvet the middle be vermition with very litile lake or indian red the shade tint be indian red and lake with litile black in the darkest shadow the difference between scarlet and crimson be that the high light crmson be whiter and the middle tint be make darker they reflexion be make with light red and vermition the high light should be lay and mannage in the same manner as those of the blue for fear of dirty they and sometimes they require to be touch over second time before we glaze they the more the color of the second paintingare drive the easier and better they may be manage to character but the high light should have good body of color and be leave with delicate light touch after it be well dry we should finish by glaze the whole with fine lake and improve the reflexion and shadow scarler require but very thin glaze it be better to glaze crimson twice over than to lay much at once painting pine colep be two different method of painting pink be glaze the other by body of color one dy at one painting the same grounds do for both which should be whitish color incline to yellow for the light and indian red lake and white for the shadow the second painting for the glaze be do with the same color and litile vermilion for the re flexion and vermition and white for the high light when dry glaze it with fine lake then break and soften the shadow into character and harmony directly the other method be to make the high light with carmine and white the middle tint with lake white and little carmine and shadow with lake and indian red with little vermition for the reflexion but the shadow require to be break with some tender obscure tint vellow the ground for yellow should be yellowish white for the light and mixture of the ochre for the shadow there be the same number of tent in the yellow as in the white sattin the method of use they be the same the light be make with king yellow ground with clean good drying oil the first tint i light ochre change with little of the pearl tint make of the dark shade and white which should be lay and manage as the first tint in white sattin the middle tint be mixture of the light and brown ochre soften with the pearl fint the shade tint be make with brown pink and brown ochre these belong to the first lay the reflexion be light ochre sometimes in the warmest part mix with little light red the shadow be strengthen with brown pink and burnt miiiber .. the proper ground for green be light yellow make of light ochre little white and prusblue for the light and the ochre brown pink and prussian blue for the shadow the finest green for drapery be make of kingyellow prussian blue and brown pink the high light be king yellow and very little prussian the middle tint have more prussian blue the shade tint be make with some of the middle tint brown pink and more prussian blue but the darkest shadow be brown pink and little prussian blue the light and middle unt should be manage in the same manner as those of the blue sattin the shade tint should be keep entirely from the light because the brown pink that be in it will in mixing dirty they as the black do those of the bly they dry little darker than they appear when wet the king yellow should be ground with good drying oil for the longer it be in drying the more it will change and grow darker and the soopner it be use ho pat better it will stand it be proper to have two the ggi of king yenow one very light for the higa sare agon ths light of velvet crangeable color silk lave changeable color have four principal tint viz the high light middle tuit shade unt and reffect ol hndly a be edtint the art lie in find the exact color of the mid dle tint because it have more of the general hue of the silk than any of the other the shade tint be of the same hue with the middle tint though dark enough for the shadow the high light often very different from the middle tint should be of clean friendly working color that will in mixing with it produce tint of clean sympathizing hus the method of painting silk be to make out the fold with the chade unt and then fill they up in the light with the middle tint this first lay should be do to

color for the principal thing in they be to leave the light clean and brilliantbut in black it be to keep the sbadow clear and transpatherefore we should begin with the shade int and glaze over all the shadow with it nisi in the darkest shadow with black and litile of the shade tint very correctly after that fill up the whole breadth of light with the middle tint only allwhich should be do exactly to the character the drapery and then finish with the high light here observe that the ground be red will beap out and support the red which be use in the finish color the lake in the light take off the cold huc if the shade tint be of any other color than transparent warm hie the shadow would consequently be black and heavy because no other equally with lake and brown pink can pre be want in the serve the warm briflancy of the black black be of cold heav d always too strong for any other color thereit require a allowaice in use it there will be few reflexion in sattin which should be add as those of other color they should be make of strong color such as burnt umber or brown ochre with little of the shade tint though these grounds mention for drapery be necessary for the principal and nearest figure in picture for portrait or the like yet figure place deeper in the picture and such as be behind the or front figure should always be fainter in the tint of they grounds in proportion to they local finish color and they just effect color use in painting line be the same as those in white sattin except the first tint which be make of white and ultramarine ash instead of the black mixt to very light blucish tint in the dead color care should be take that the grounds be lay white and broad in the light the shadow be compose of black white and little indian red like the middle fint of white sattin these should be leave very light and clean to support the finish color in the second painting the light be glaze with stiff pencil and fine white only drive bare with oil little oil the shadow scumble with pop pp and some of the color they be make of the middle tint of white sattifi be the best color for the general int of the shadow wich this and white in different degree make out all the part to they character with free light touch without softening then with large long point pencil and fine white lay the high light very nicely at touch after this the fine light blucish tint mix light be lay in the tender gradation very sparingly and lightly without fill they up the first lay should be leave clear and distinct the more it appear the better it be the overmix and jumble all the color together which spoil the beauty of the character therefore it be better to let it dry before we add the reflexion and finish tint this inethod of let the beautiful cledr color dry before we add the warm reflect and har monize tint prevent they from mixing with and dirty each other the principal blend color use in the reflexion be the yellow tint green unt and rose tint which last be make of lake indian red and whice the dead color should be as white as we intend the finish color to be by reason they will sink little in proportion to the color of the cloth

the art in dead color be to find the two color which serve for the ground of the shadow in general the sky except and the method of use they with the lighr the first of which be the dark shade with litile lake in it the other be burnt umber these should be change little to the naiural hue of the object and then lay and drive with drying oil in the same manner as we shade with indian ink which scumble kind of glaze and as such they should be leave otherwise they will be dark and heavy and would be epurely spoiled for the finish glaz = ing both these color mix and sympathize agreeably with the light but should be lay before they when the landscape be design begin with the sky which should be lay with good body of color and leave with faint resemblance of the prin= cipal cloud more in

some of they light in different degree and lay so as best to find and shew they principal parr advancing into the middle group we introduce by degree the burnt umber in the shade all the grounds of the tree be lay or rub in enough only to suggest a idea of they shape and shadow faintly the grounds of they shadow must be clean and lighter than they finishing color such as will support they character and seem easy to finish on in painting the light it be better to incline more to the middle unt than to the high light and to leave they with sufficient body of clean color which will receive and preserve the finish color the better which may be do with few tint second painting begin with the sky lay in the azure and color of the horizon then soften they after that lay in the general unt of the cloud and finish on it with the high light and the other tint that be want light tender touch then soften the whole very lightly the finish of the sky should be do at once painting because the tender character of the cloud will not match so well when dry as when the whole be wet the stiffer the azure and color of the horizon be lay the better the cloud may be paint upon they the greatest distance be chiefly make with the color of the sky as they grow nearer and darker flaze and scumble the part very thin with such glaze shadow color as come nearest to the general hue of the group the object be in so that the first painting or dead color should be see through it be on this add the finish color `` if this plaze ground be properly adapt to the object and place it will be easy to find the color which be want for the light and for the finish that we may not spoil the glaze we should be very exact in make those color on the pallette and in lay they with light free touch here it may be proper to say samething of the most useful glaze color lake terravert prussian blue and brown pink be the four principal the more they be manage like indian ink and the more distinctly they be leave the better they transparent beauty will stand and appear after these burnt umber be good glaze warm brown use in the break grounds and hearest part but the most agreeable color for the darkest shadow be the dark shade improve with lake drive with drying oil it mix harmonniously with the light the shadow the trunk and the body of tree and the building the ground of the object should be make out with such glaze shadow color as seem nearest to the natural hue of the object in that situation and as the principal glaze colot themselves be often too strong and glaring they should be little soften ed by such color as be near to themselves and the object thus if in the distance the terravert and azure which be they principal glaze color may pe improve and make lighter with some of the sky fhee and as the distance come nearer with the purple as we get more into the middle group the terravert and prussian blue may be varied with some of the green tint make without white for white be the destruction of all glaze color as we approych the first group there be less occasion for change they but the foreground and its object require all the strength and force of glaze which the coley be capable of produce after this glaze ground we should follow with strengthen the same in the shadow and darkest place in such manner as will seem easy to finish the color that come next for finish be in the degree of middle tint these should be carefully lant over the greatest breadth of light in such manner as not to spoil and cover too much of the glaze with good body of color as stiff as the pencil can agreeably manage to character the coler of the unt should be clean and buannfal finmsh all the second painting downward from the sky through the middle group at the firsi group all object should appear perfectly finish then under or distant part should be finish before any of the other which be nearer down to the last and hearest object of the pieture where it happen that painting one tree over another do not please forbear the second until the firstis dry thin near atfat tree of different color will dobsucr af we let the under part dry before we add the finish color the thirs anb last faintinc ifoil be necessary lay the least quantity that can be with stump tool or pencil proportion to the place that be to be oil then wipe the place that be dile with silk handkerchief leave no more oil than be proper for the purpose when finish any object we should use great variety of tint all nearly the same color but most of all when finish tree as this give richness to the color and contribute to produce harmony as the green will fade and grow darker it be necesary to improve and in some degree to force they by make a allowance in use they so much the lighter the same reasonn apply to the glaze which if over load will be dull and heavy and consequently will grow darker the method for painting near tree be to make the first lay very ear to nature though not quice so hark and to follow it with strengthen the shadow then the middle tint and last of all lay the high light and finish color but all this can not be do as it should be at once painting the best way be to do no more than the first lay with the faint shadow and leave it to dry then improve the uddle tint and shadow and let they dry the conclusion be add all the light and finish ing color in the bestmanner this method of leave the first and second part to dry separately not only make the whole easier and thore agreeable but leave the color in the greater perfection because because most of the work may be do with scum bling and glaze and some part without oil the light also may be lay with better body of color which will not be mix and spoiled with the wet ground what be say of tree answer to all kind of shrub and bush the figure in landscape be the last work of the picture those in the foreground should be do before those in the distance the shadow of the figure should be of the same hue or color with those of the group or place wherein they be picture be generally intend to be view at distance the artist should frequently consider he performance at or near similar situation since whatever lose its effect at that distance however execute be labour lose the shadow if large may approximate nearly to the same tone accord to they situation and may he thin of color but the light should be distinct bold spirite and will not suffer even if load with color on the contrary it will contribute to durability to use only one fint to one color promote cleanhess and freshness of the color too much mixing and injure they teint different from what be on the pallette be want while at work on preture it be better to the color proper to compose it on the pai lette with the knife than with pencil there be in somie person strange predifection for smgoth picture in oil this however be far from be ii edit meritorious unless picture be very small but in larger piece bold and free pencil shew to advantage especially in the light in the smart touch and firm marking and draw in general color look more brilliant while wet with oil than when they be dry little observation will accustom the student to this circumstance it be usually the too great quantity of oil especially of the grosser kind which occasion the decay of the color and it be observable that pic ture generally begin to fade in the darker part and in the glazing where the color be thin the light ingiitaining themselves long after those color be obliterate color can not have worse property than that of tardy dryer as it hold what dust unavoidably fall on it and consequently sully the beauty of the fint some artist aware of the bad quality of the oil in use make too free with turpentine to work thin but this not only leave the picture dead but carry off part of the force in evaporation to know when a oil pieture be dry breathe firmly upon it if it take the breath it be safe be proper to let the first coat of color be thoroughly dry before second be apply this should be carefully attend to in winter the pencil when do with should be clean by spirit or oil of turpentine or if mean to be lay by for time they may be wash with soap the pallette should be constantly clean cleaning of picture water be the first material and of the most general use in cleaning picture this will remove many kind of glutinous body and foulness such as sugar honey glue and many other and it will also take off any varnish of guim arabic glair of egg or isinglass and be therefore the greatest instrument in this work it may be use without any caution with respect to the color as it will not in the least affect the oil which hold they together olive oil or butter though not generally apply to this purpose through a ignorance of they efficacy will remove many of those spot or foulness which resist even soap as they will dissolve or corride pitch rosin and similar body and they may be use very freely not have the least effect on the oil of the painting nor the dangerous effect of spirit of wine and oil of turpentine wood ash or what will better answer the purpose when use in proper proportion pearl ash be melt in water make proper dissolvent for most kind of matter which foul painting but they must be use with great discretion as they will touch of corrode the oil of the painting if there be no varnishing guin or resin over it by very little rubbing the use of they or scope be however in many case unavoidable and in general they be the only thing employ for this purpose spirit of wine as it will dissolve all the gum and gum resin except guin arabic be very necessary for for the taking off from picture varnish compose of such substance but it corrode also the oil of painting and soften they in such manner as to render all rub dangerous while they be under its influence oil of turpentine will dissolve likewise some of the gum use for varnish but spirit of wine will in general much better answer the purpose there be however sometimes spot of foulness which will give way to the spirit of turpentine but resist most other substance use for this purpose it may therefore be try where every thing else appear to fail but even then very sparingly and with great caution as it will very soon act even on the dry off of the painting essence of lemon be of the same dangerous tenr dency with oil of turpentine but be much stronger dissolvent and should therefore only be use in the most desperate case where spot seem indelible by all other method spirit of lavender and rosemary and other essenrial oil have the same dissolve quality as essence of lemon but they be in general dearer and some of they too powerful to be trust near the color when painting appear to have be varnish with those substance that will not dissolve in water which be seldom do by painter who be acquaintr ed with the present practice as they destroy the more delicate tint and touch of the painting they be however very easily and safely remove by the follow method of place place you picture or painting in a horizontal situation and moisten or rather ffood by means of sponge the surface of it with very strong rectify spirit of wine but all rub beyond what be necessary must be avoid keep the painting moist by add fresh quantity of the spirit for some minute then flood the surface copiously with cold water with which the spirit and such part of the varnish as it have dissolve may be wash off but in this state of it all frietion and the slightest violence to the surface of the painting would be very detrimental when the painting be dry this operation may be repeat at discretion until the whole of the varnish be take off to prepare the pearl and wood ash ley use in gleaning picture let a ounce be dissolve in of water to be stir frequently for half day then to be decant from the settling this mixture be say to epliven the brazil wwash to make stronger ley of the same let two pound of woodash and three quart of water be manage as just direct and evaporate or even boil to one quart or less quantity as you find it acrid to you taste strong ley be make by pour hot water on quantity of ash and when it have filter through they collect it for use .these ley be to be use warm with sponge and with the caution just direct when thick spot be nnot easily remove strong soaplather may the of use not suffer it to touch any other part of the pieture but the spot it be to be engage with for for use spirit of wine and other dissolvent the picture be to be lay on table and flood with the liquor or well dab with sponge so as to keep the picture very morst add fresh ley as want then with cold water wash off the whole all dissolvent must be wash off with plenty of water and should it be necessary to use any of they again take care that the painting be quite dry this must be attend to at every repetition all spot ec of dirt be attach to picture either before it be varnish or during its be varnish in which case they dry with the varnish of after the varnish be dry if the latter plenty of warm water generally succeed but if it be damage while varnishing or before that operation the coat of varnish must be remove then the spot clean and the whole picture be revaynish it appear from this observation that it be of consequence to set picture while drying in place free from dust cc since whatever dry with the color can not be remove it sometimes happen that picture grow dull and obscure and it may be necessary to revarnish it this may be very safely do after inspect whether the first varnish be clean transper picture the art of remove painting in oil from the cloths on which they be originally do and tranferr they to new one be of great use the Ithod be as follow let the decay picture be cleanse of all grease that may be on its surface by rub it very gently with crum of stale bread and then wipe it with very fine soft line cloth it must then be lay the face downwards on smooth table cover with fan paper or india paper and the cloth on the back must be well soak with boiling water till perfectly soft and pliable turn the pieture face upwards and have stretch it evenly on the table pin it down with nail at the edge have melt quantity of glue and strain it through flannel cloth spread part of it on line cloth of the size of the painting when this be set lay another coat over it when this be become siff spread some of the glue moderately heat over the face of the picture and lay over it in the evenest manner possible the line cloth already prepare and nail it down to the picture and table then expose the whole to the heat of the sun in place secure from gain till the glue be perfectly dry and hard when this be the case remove the picture and line cloth from the table turn the pieture with the face downwards and let it be stretch and nail to the table as before then raise round its edge border of wvae as in biting of copperplate into which pourd corrod fluid as oil of vitriol aquafortis of spirit of sali but the last be to be prefer dilute either of these with water to such degree that they may destroy the thread of the original canva or cloth of the picture without discolor it when the corrod ffuid have answer this pur= pose draim it off and wash away the remain paiv by quantity of fresh water the thread of the cloth must be then carefully pick out till the whole be take away the reverse surface of the painting be thus wholly freed from the old cloth must be well wash with water and leave to dry .. in the mcan time prepare new piece of canva of the size of the painting and have spread some hot glue purify as before and melt with little brandy or spirit of wine over the reverse of the painting lay the new canva evenly upon it while the glue be hot and compress they together with thick plare of lead or flat piece of polish mar = ble when the glue be set remove these weight let the cloth remain till the glue be become perfectly dry and hard then the whole must be turn the other side upwards and the border of wax be re place the line cloth on the face of the painting must be destroy by means of the corrod fluid because the face of the painting be defend only by the coat of glue which cement the line cloth to it the painting must then be freed from the glue by wash it with hot water the painting may afterwards be varnish and if the operation be well conduct it will be transfer to the new cloth in perfect state when the painting be originally of wood the surface of it must be cover with line cloth canment to it by means of glue as glready direct proper table be then provide and overspread with blanket of thiner wooll cloth lay on in several double the painting must be lay upon it the face downwards and fix sready the board or wood on which it be do must then be plane away till the shell remain as thin as it can be make without damage the paint under it the process be the saime as already give for the front when picture be by accident tear or otherwise injure it be repair by place the separate part as nearly in they first state as possible then attachihig by strong glue piece of cloth of proper shape and size to which the thread of the tear part firrmly adhere retain they situation the place in the preture where the rent be must then be very exactly color as before so as effectually to conceal the damage when fresh cloth be apply behind picture cover the back throughout and to strengthen the canva it be term lining picture and very much contribute to its preservation espeea if the canva be ancient or thin in its supstance ii edit encaustic or painting in wak miss greenland method of make composition for painting in imitation of the ancrent crecian manner put into glaze earthen vessel of of gum arabic and so of cold spring water when the gum be dissolve stir in of gum mastich which have be first wash dry pick and beaten fine which be very soon do set the earthen vessel contain the gum water and gum mastich over moderate fire continually stir and beat they hard with spoon in order to dissolve the gum mastich when sufficiently boil it will no longer appear transparent and will be stiff like paste so soon as this be the case and that the gum water and mastich be quite boiling without take they off the fire add of white wax break into small piece stir and beat the different ingredient together till the wax be perfectly melt and have bail then take the composition off the fire as boilingitlongerthan necessary would only harden the wax and prevent its mixing so well afterwards with water the composition be take off the fire and in the glaze earthen vessel it should be beaten hard and while hot but not boiling mix with it by degree of cold spring water then strain the composition as some dirt will boil out of the gum mastich and put it into bottle composition if properly make should be like cream and the color when mix with it as smooth as if with oil the method of use it be mixing the color with ir as with oil then paint with fair water the color may be use by put little fair water over they but it be less trouble to put some water when the color be observe to be grow dry in painting with this composition the color blend without difficulty when wet and even when dry the tint may easily be united by means of brush and very small quantity of fair water when the painting be finish put some white wax into glaze earthen vessel over slow fire and when mely but not boiling with hard brush cover the painting with the wax and when cold take moderately hot iron such as be use for ironing line and draw it lightly over the wax when the picture be nearly cold rub it with fine line cloth to make it entirely smooth and when quite cold rub it again to make it shine painting might be execute in this manner upon wood or plaster of paris without require any other preparation than mixing some fine plaster of paris in powder with cold water to the thickness of cream then put it on lookglass and when dry take it off and there will be very smooth surface for painting upon painting may also be do in the same manner with only gum water and gum mastich prepare the same way as the mastich and wax but instead of put of mastick and when boiling add of wax mix of gum mastich with the sum water before it be put on the fire and when sufficiently boil and beaten and be little cold stir in of cold spring water and afterwards strain it it would be equally practicable painting with wax alone dissolve in sum water in the follow mmanner weigh of cold spring water and of put they into glaze earthen vessel guin arabic and when the gum be dissolve add of white wax put the earthen vessel with the guin water and wax upon slow fire and stir they till the wax be dissolve and have boil few minute then take they off the fire and throw they into bason as remain in the hot earthen vessel the wax might become rather hard beat the gum water and wax till quite cold .. as there be but small propor tion of water in comparison with the gun and wax it would be necessary in mixing this composition with the color to put also some fair water it should be observe that the water use by miss reenland in these preparation come from chalk fock and be remarkably soft possibly any other water might answer equally well nother recipe by miss creenlawd for the incient grecian method of painting in war take a ounce of white wax and the same weight of gum mastich in lachryme tear that as it come from the tree which must be reduce to fine powder put the wax in glaze earthen vessel over very slow fire and when it be quite dissolve strew in the mastich little at time stir the wax continually until the whole quantity be perfectly melt and incorporate then throw the past into cold water and when it be hard take it out of the water wipe it dry and beat it in one of mo . wedgwood mortar observe to pound it at first in line cloth to absorb some drop of water that will remain in the paste and would prevent the possibility of reduce it to powder which must be so fine as to pass through thick gaure it should be pound in cold place and but little at tine as after long bear the friction will in degree soften the wax and gum and instead of they become powder they will return to paste make some strong gum arabic water and when you paint take litrle of the powder some color and mix they together with the gum water light color require but small quantity of the powder but more of it must be put in proportion to the body of darkness of the color and to black there should be almost as much of the powder as color have mix the color and no mare than can be use before they grow dry paint with fair water as be practise in painting with water color ground on the wood be first paint of some proper color prepare in the same manner as for the picture walnuttree and oak be the sort of wood commonly make use of in italy for this purpose the painting should be highly finish otherwise when varnish the tint wilf not appear united when the painting be quite dry with rather hard prush pass it one way varnish it with white wax which be put into a earthen vessel and keep melt over very slow fire till the picture be var ish take great care the wax do not boil afterwards hold the picture before fire near ehough to melt the wax but not make it run and when the varnish be entirely cold and hard rub it gently with line cloth should the varnish blister warm the picture again very slowly and the pubble will subside when the picture be dirty it need only be wash with cold water extract from maty s review for april febbroni who be in england some winter ago have discover new method of encaustic painting of which he write I the follow lewis of gurtenbrunn the friend of meng and who may be call he successor have lately execute picture accord to my manner it be thalia do upon wood prepare with wax and be remarkable for the vivacity and splendour of the color believe have already mention to you in what this new method consist you melt or rather dissolve some good white wax in naphtha petroler without color till such time as the mixture have acquire by cool the appearance and consstence of a oil beginning to freeze by the cold you mix you color with this and then keep they in small tin box you dilute they more or less with the same naphtha accord as they dry or as you wish to use they this painting allow time enough to give all the finish you desire and if you wish to work in hurry you may dry it as fast as you please by exposing it to heat when the picture be finish it be of that fine tone which be preferable to every varnish or if you choose varnish you need only warm the pieture and all the naphtha will evaporate when this be do you must wast till the picture cool when you must polish it by running it over neatly with cloth as the ancient use to do if you wish to have it still brighter you must melt white wax on the fire without suffer itto boil mix little naphtha with this and draw layer of it over the picture already heat by means of brazier which you hold under if the picture i small or before it if it be large the color at first appear spoiled but you restore they to they first beaury if when the layer of be be cool you polish it by rub with cloth it be then that the color take the high tone of oil if you fear the effect of fire for you picture you be to make soap of wax which be to be do by boiling white wax in water in which you have dissolve twentieth part of the weight of the wax of marine alkali or sel de souda very pure rub you picture with this soap and when it be dry polish it as above if you do not choose either of these method give you painting its usual varnish of sandarac and spirit of turpentine this method have be find prefer able to all those that have be try and superior to oil for the beauty of the colour there be hanp fine colour which canhot be use in oil which may be make use of with great success in this method the haphtha entirely evaporate one may be assure that this be the true tmethod of painting in wak there be likewise much to hope for the duration of picture paitite in this manher as wax be much less liable to alteration than oil and do not so essily part its phlogiston this extract see to suggestd there probable plah of attain the ancient secret than that of count caylus of mo . muntz whose rule be to saturate . cloth with wax then to paint on it with water colour or crayoh and fix the colour by gradually advafice the pieture to the fire till the wax be melt have absorb they then equally gradually withdraw the piece the thought be ingenious but should seem to be more troublesome than that of nir lewis as above after all it may justly be doubt whether some bitumen of still more exalt and spirituous nature be not the vehicle which compound those colour whose brilliancy have remain from the remotest age that the ancient be well acquainted with bitumelin ical production we be well assure and possibly the east may possess some spring of spring of supefior or more preservative quality might not the ingredient they use in embalm afford hint naphtha petroler be bituminous kind of oity out of certain rock in the territory of modend there be three sort more or less pure and colourless it be use medicinally and consider as good for sprain bruise ec this at least be the sort sometimes import into england it be very spirituous and volatile etch this be one branch of the art of engrave and possess some quality in which it be superior to other be execute with the utmost ease and ffeedom and when well manage express many ubject with great truth and character the first preparation for etch be to lay ground vide ground over the plate which operation be thus perform at the most convenient part of the plate as well for hold it as for the work which be to be execute on it be tightly fix handvice then the plate be heat till the copper shew small change of color or till the back part of the plate be spit upon reject the spittle the ball of ground which isty in thin cover of silk be now pass gently over the plate so as to distribure the ground evenly to all part the heat of the plate melt it through the silk then with the dabber which be nothing more than small quantity of cotton tie in silk the ground be beat of dab to perfect thinness and evenness in this part of the business much address be require since if the ground when finish be thicker in some place than in other it will deceive vol ii edit point employ upon it the ground be then smoke till thoroughly black for the clearer docern the stroke of the etch wax taper twist together four or five or more time be the most convenient candle to smoke with but any will serve for this purpose the plate must be perfectly clean and free from grease as greasy spot cc prevent the ground from hold in those part to clean the plate scrape little whiting on it and wipe it off with clean rag which will carry the grease with it while the plate be cool after the ground be lay scrape some feed chalk on the back of you print trace or draw and rub it in all over with clean rag then place the rede side on the plate make it fast at each corner with soft wax lay the etchboard under you hand to prevent bruss the ground and with blunt etchneedle trace lightly the cutline and the breadth of the shadow till the mark of they appear on the ground which you must take care not to penetrate by trace too heavily it will be proper at interval to lift up corner of and to examine whether every part be the trace perfectly trace before you take it off as it will be extremely difficult to lay the paper down again exactly in its former position if once remove have complete the trace the offtrack or draw trace be remove and the subject be ready for etch the practice of etch be easily attain by profigient in design since it be little more than draw in stroke with point on the plate what be otherwiss draw with pen pencil ec on paper the etchboard by some term bridge be thin piece of board generally of mahogany of proper length and width raise by small support at each end to convenient height for the hand to rest oh it the point or needle be almost similar to sew needle but be stronger and be insert into handle four or five inch long for the convenience of be properly hold the best way to begin subject be by form the outline very carefully then insert the shadow begin first in the darkest place line draw in etch may be cross by other if want two line draw by the side of each other closely will unite into one under the operation of bite whereby this line will become of great breadth and color this mode be very usefulfor dark foregrounds in landscape and have good effect in architecture but the use of etch in historical subject to prepare the figure to be afterwards treat by the graver the characteristy of etch be certain roughness compare with performance of the graver which do not suit glossy and shrning object but which apply with good effect to coarser part such as in landscape the bark of tree the broken and looser touch of fore grounds in architecture it represent very happily the ravage of time in old building moulder wall exc another characferistic of etch be its freedom for which reason it suit well the leave of tree light cloud ec and beside these property it be of great service where true even and uniform color be want as it be not only much quicker but also more certain than simple grave in general hence it suit the blue part of sky the even teint of new archi fecture backgrounds to portrait which be conduct by parallelruler it be evident from the service require that the point to be use must vary in they fineness some line be make broad other very thin to whet point with perfect truth free from angular projec tion require time patience and practice the plate be etch the next process be to excavate the line draw by subject they to the action of aquafortis which operation be term bite direction for biting first examine you work carefully to see that nothing be omit or any thing redundant if any scratch appear on the ground or any mistake be commit in the etch they be to be stop out which be do by cover they with mixture of lampblack and varnish lay on with pencil which when dry will resist the aquafortis but it to soimetime best to stop out these as they occur in the course of the work for by this means they will beless liable to escape notice among the mulaplicity other line and part and when the varnish be dry you may etch over it if necessary the next thing to surround the work with rim or border of soft wax about half a ich high form the wax into spout at one corner by which to pour off the aquafortis and that it may not jun out at any other part take care to press the wax close and firm to the plate have pour the mixture of aquafortis on the plate let it continue short time corrod the line draw wipe off the bubble as they rise with feather which may remain on the plate during the biting after proper time pour off the aquafortis and wash the plate carefully with fair water pouring it on and off then let the plate dry and by scrape off part of the ground from the faintest part of the work try if it be sufficiently bitten if not stop out the part you have try with lampback and varnish and when that be dry pour on the aqua fortis again for further operation when the faint part of you work be bitten enough stop they out with the varnish erc and proceed to bite the stronger part stop they out as occasion require till the whole work be suf ficiently bitten then warm the plate and take off the soft wax after which heat the plate till the ground be melt pour on it little oil and wipe the whole off with line rag when the ground be take off rub the work well with the oil rubber and wipe the plate clean then proceed to finish with the raver what part of the subject require that process the wax for the border be make by mixing with pound pound of beewax one quarter or one third of pound of burgundy pitch to soften it as for any color add to it it be useless because after little while the wax become black ii be to be observe that in biting plate much attention be require if plate be underbitten .. if the part have not attain they proper color and force there be usually no remedy but by follow every line with the graver in order to blacken it on the other hand if very much overbitten plate can not be render neat and delicate let never so much time and skill be waste on it if bitten but little above the color want few stroke of the burnisher will lower it at pleasure if the air rise from the copper and form bubble kiss very much ipn bite it may be suspect that the aquafortis be too strong or act too suddenly on the copper which for tender work be injurious of engrave stroke the tool necessary for engrave be a oiltubber burnisher scraper and oilstone also needle or point also graver compass sandbag pa tallel ruler eic graver be of different shape square and loseveral of each should be provide the square be use in cut the broad stroke the lozenge for the fainter and more delicate part graver should be in length five inch and half of thereabouts the handle include the sandbag be use to lay the plate on for the conveniency of turn it about to follow wind line the oilstone must be of the turkey sort and while in use must never be keep without oil great care be require to whet gravernicely particularly the belly lay the two lower angles of the graver flat upon the stone and rub they steadily till they be polish like irror and till the belly rise gradually so that when you lay the graver edge on the plate you may just perceive the light under the point otherwise it will dig into the copper and it will be impossible to execute work with freedom when the belly be whet to whet the face place the flat part of the handle in the hollow of you hand with the belly of the graver upwards on moderate slope and rub the face on the stone till it have a exceed sharp point which you may try upon you thumbpail for temper the graver if too hard vide graver cut off that part of the handle which be on line with the belly of the graver to make that side flat hold the handle in the hollow of the hand and extend the forefinger toward the point rest it on the back of the graver that you may guide the tool with more ease take care that you finger do not interpose between the plate and the graver but let the whole machine slide as it be along the plate and trust to the resistance of the copper for its stegdiness delicacy of feeling be prme quality in good chgraver let the table or board you work at be firm and steady for strait stroke let the plate lie flat on the table for circular or crook stroke place the plate on the sandbag and hold the graver firm nove you hand or the plate or both as you see or rather feel convenient learn to carry you hand with such dexterity that you may end you stroke as finely as you begin it and if you have occasion to make one part deeper of blacker than another do it by reenter that stroke in the course of the work scrape off the barb or roughness which arise with the scraper but be careful in do this not to scratch the plate never scrape directly acress line but always at a easy angle along the course of the stroke mistake or scratch in the plate may be rub out with the burnisher if of no great depth and the part afterwards clear with the scraper polish it again at last lightly with the burnisher when you wish to examine what work you have do rub it with the oilrubber which by fill the stroke with black will shew they when the plate be wipe to advantage too much oilrub injure the finer work as do very materially too mruch scrape engrave in stroke or hatch as it be the most ancient so it be the most noble manner of engrave it require most skill afford most scope for judgment and genius as well as for manual dexterity be accordingly more difficult to execute in masterly and superior manhner it be evident that any line draw may be cross by another line or any number of line by second number of line but it be equally evident that not every such crossing can be graceful if it follow too nearly the course of the original line it will form by its intersection number of ared of too sharp and disagreeable lozenge shape if the first line be cross at right angles the area form will be so many square which by possess kind of hardness in they appearance apply only to certain subject the medium admit a infinity of degree if we examine any clarge wellexecute print we observe in some place single line or stroke of considerable length accord to the draw line cross at a agreeable lozenge line cross at right angles where kind of obscurity be want

the flesh long dot for the same purbose long dot cross each other thin line cross line of dot very thin line make by the dry point in the light cc and many other contrivance for produce variety these apply vol ii edit accord to the indication of the design or the taste and skill of the artist impart to capital print richness and character which no other maner of engrave can boast of and which be yet farthe angment by judicious introduction and mixture of etch engrave and dry point line the dry point be so term because use without ground consequently not bitten the burr or rise from the copper by the use of it be very strong and must be scrape off carefully the whole point and handle be stronger than a etch point to sustain greater pressure when in use it appear from this mode of reasoning that to attain considerable excellence in this style of engrave i easy matter and indeed of the many who be bring up to it few arrive at superior hohpour of if they obtain skill in one branch etch for in stance they fail in other yet as much of the progress even of the best of plate be little more than mechanisim and patience ability of all degree be useful in the course of long work it be proper to cautionthose inclined to attempt any of the branch of engrave against cramp posture or lean the stomach against the table or poring with they eye too close to the plate while at work in very delicately finish work the artist always have recourse to magnifying glass but as we reader certainly will not undertake such work we proceed to another species of engrave inngrave engrrve in chalk he manner of engrave have lately highly excite the public attention and indeed have deserve it by the beauty of many specimen which it have produce the process for prepare the plate lay the ground trace be the same as before the principle adopt in the etch differ only in that instead of fine the draw shadow eec be insert in dot as freely as may be yet carefully the biting be the same with this difference that whereas in bite line no two should be suffer to unite unless previously intend and prepare for that purpose in biting chalk provide they do not by they union form hard spot or too considerable black this accident be not of equal consequence if the subject be large in small subject the more delicate and important part should not be color in the etch but wholly insert with the graver be less hazardous and much more beclirate the plate bitten and the ground remove the effect of the subject represent remain to be work up with the graver for small subject or such as be to be neatly finish this be the only tool to be depend on the best manner of prepare the graver for firm work be by change its situation in the handle so that the belly part of it which be lowermost become uppermost then by turn = ing the handle in the hand the point act on the copper from greater elevation which for strong dot be preferable as only dot not stroke be require the tool be in this position manageable with much greater facility and speed the remain part of the progress of plate consist only in cover the copper with dot in man= she lighter or heavier proportionate to the color and to the draw require when one cover of dot be scrape off another must be insert and so on by this repetition proper grain of dot and the general mass of shade be procure .. this pro cess be tedious but in return it require no great skill in the operator little practice and proper attention attain the whole mystery in larger subject or those which be to be slighted some person use tool of various sort such as wheel with single or double row of tooth or cradle resemble mezzotinto grounding tool but make with tooth or other construct to they mind but these tool though more expeditious than the graver only be seldom so accurate of so pleasing in the effect they produce these kind of tool and variety of other amounting in the whole when set be perfect to nnear forty have be very much use in france where the manner of engrave in chalk be first practise they very frequently produce a effect more closely resemble a original draw in chalk than english performance finish selely with the graver but on the other hand the neatness and accuracy as well as certain mellowness of style which distinguish english production be not only ohly vastly superior to those of the french artist be universally esteem so throughout europe the chief merit of plate engrave in chalk be insert by the artist who finish the subject care and attention be requisite and good habit of design . indispensable every requisite in the manual practice be easily acquire the french have very well imitate drawing on paper by use two plate one of which print the blackchalk effect the other the whitechalk on the same idea chalk plate print in black on blue paper may afterwards be touch with whitechalk to very pleasing effect of rebit when the part of subject which be intend to be dark have fail of they propose effect they may be rebitten by the follow process which apply to all kind of erch and be among the secret of the superior engraver at convenient part of the plate be properly heat for the purpose melt quantity of ground then with dabber carefully by degree transplace as much of the ground thus melt as be necessary to the part propose by beat it gently so that the surface only the copper may be cover and the hollow or excavate line of the work may remain free and clean when this ground be cold it may be rebitten with aquafortis as before it be frequently better not to smoke it lest the heat of the taper should should melt the ground into the work in which case wherever the ground cover the plate the aqua=fortis could not act rebit be sometimes use both to stroke and dote to strengthen part which have not acquire all the color it should have even after it have be lay in with the graver to clean stroke erc engrave use little spirit of turpentine and rub the plate with crumb of bread if the dirt be of long standing soap lee pour on the plate while warming be very effectual but as this be corrosive liquor it must be immediately wash off the plate by plenty of cold water and it too stong for mezzotinto plate especially unless it be very carefully use of meztotinto I be say to have be first invent by prince rupert about the year who take the hint from see soldier file he rusty musket and mo . evelyn in he ilistory of chalcography give we head perform by that prince in this way but mo le blond be say to have introduce it most successfully into practice the prince lay he grounds on the plate with chan ruler but one sher win about the same fune lay he grounds with halfround file which be press down with heavy piece of lead both these grounding tool have be lay aside for many year and handtool call cradle resemble shoethoemaker ecutboard knife with fine cre = on the edge be introduce by one ediar smith by trade who afterwards become mezzoiinto printer as it be much easier to scrape off or to burnishaway the part of dark ground corresponding with the outline of any design sketch upon it than to form shade upon light ground by a infinite number of hatch stroke and point which must all terminate with exactness on the outline as well as differ in they force and mapnner the method of as it be call in mezzotinto become consequently much more easy and expeditious than any other manner of engravin the instrument use in this kind of engrave be cradle scrafer and burnisher the scraper for delicate york be much like surgeon lancet in shape and in fineness but other be much stronger for greater speed and riddance to lay ground the cradle be to be pass for= ward uniformly in the same direction be keep steady as possible and press upon with modetate force tillthe instrument have pass over the whole surface of the plate this first course of grounding must be cross at right angles on the same principle new line must then be draw diagonally and the cradle pass along they as before when the first diagonal operation be perform these line must then be cross at right angles the plate have undergone the action of the cradle according to this disposition second course of cradl must be commence and the same must be repeat regularly change the direction of the line make by the tool when the whole of this opera tion be finish it be cail one turn but in order to produce very dark and uniform ground the plate must undergo the repetition of all these operation many time ing the plate be prepare with ground the skeich must be trace on it by means of the paper rub on the backside with chalk as mention before it be also proper to overtrace the line and draw afterwards with black lead or rather which i much better with indian ink to secure the outline the scrape be perform by partuse away the grain of the ground in various degreess so that none preserve its original state ex cept the touch of strong shadow the general manner of proceeding be like draw with white upon black paper the mass of light be first begin and those part which lighten upwards but be in shade below the reflection be then touch after which the plate be blacken with printer blackingball make of feel in order to view the effect the whole be then gradually bring to effect by scrape over the part till they be sufficiently lighten observe always to begin with the strongest light it be easy to scrape more off any part if it be too dark but if part be too much scrape away it be troublesome for it must undergo the action of small cradl tool proportion to the size of the part and the additional ground thus procure be not always correct march to the original ground which have have a unpleasant effect unless very skilfully indrage I plate be therefore prove long before they approach toward finish if the subject be in any degree intricate or considerable of aaua tinta this manner of produce on copper the effect of draw wash in bistre or indian ink be altogethe modern invention it be attempt in by mo . sandey and mr. dalton but it then fail of that success it have since meet with first person whose production be not only imitation of drawing but be capable of print any considerable number of copy be mon le prince of paris whose early performance appear in he mode usage de russic mon le prince by degree improve he discovery till at length it be think by the honourable mo . greville brother to the earl of warwick secret worth purchase at the expence of thirty guinea this gentleman communicate the process to mo . sandby whose attention and genius carry it to great excellence since its importation into engÂ¬ land it have be the subject of repeat and continue investigation and as it be impossible to prevent the inquisitive essays of many ingenious engrd ver who think this article worth they acquisiso it have happen that more way than one of produce this effect have be discover each person think he own method the best and all vol ii edit stadiously conceal they principle we may there fore claim the ment of be the first in england at least who communicate the secret to the public we shall report several mode of procedure first way we shall mention of produce on copper the effect of tint drawing be by grinding quantity of sulphur in oil and with this mixture painting the plate then by place the plate over gentle fire the vitriolic acid contain in the sulphur be set at liberty and act as corrosive on the copper form color lighter or deeper in roportion to the heat of the fire the time of its exposure to it and to the strength of the acid employ in the mixture second way of produce the same effect on the wellknow different affection of the same menstruum to different metal and pro ceed thus saturate quantity of aqua=fortis of due strength with shred of silver this liquor pour on copper will quit the silver it contain in order to act on the copper by which it be more attract the silver will precipitate in the form of subtle powder and thereby occasion irregularity on the surface of the plate which will hold the ink when print of these manners of procedure the first be very offensive in its process the fume of the composition be highly disagreeable the second be chieffy applicable to very slender part and to add color to place which be not of importance sufficient to require fresh ground or much trouble such as leave of tree light fiy cloud erc as it do not much force without great good fortune or very close attention third way proceed on the principle that minute interstice alternately black and white will when view at little distance produce the effect of all black accord to the tone to which they be adapt therefore whatever will so fix irself to the plate as to prevent the action of aquafortis where it in contact and yet will pertit the aquafortis to corrode all around it will produce alternarely black and white this be first attempt with rosin finely pulverize but that be apt if too fine or t much warm to form coat or superficy over considerable part of the copper thereby resist the menstruum on all side sal ammoniac pulverize with the rosin and antimately mix with it be find to preserve interstice but this apply only occasionally there be several guin which possess nearly similar property but the follow appear superior to all other and be except the change of gum juntper for guin copal the method follow by mion he prince grind sufficient quantity of gum copal divide it by sift into three or four parcel at pleasure accord to the fineness of each parcel the first or finest powder serve for the lighter part of the subjeet to be treat such as distance sky erc.. the second or grain powder for middle tint the coarser grain of powder for foregrounds and other very dark place where strong biting be require by the subject to accomplish this separation the siey milst vary in fineness sift on the plate suffic crent quantity of the finer powder the plate will now appear of a uniform tender white unless closely examine when the interstice between the particle of gum will be very discernible heat the plate very gently only till the sum change from it be white color and be so far melt as to fix on the plate from which it be scarcely to be distinguished by ii color when cold the plate be ready for receive the aquafortis stop out the light cc as in common biting when the biting be over which do not last long minute perhaps to the fine powder wash the plate with water as before direct for bite and examine the effect produce and the state of the ground if some part only be do stop they out and proceed to bite the other part if the whole be do of which this ground be capable clean the plate by heating it and apply little oil to remove the gum easily if necessary those part which be of the just color require must then be secure by stop they out the second powder must next be treay as the first have be and the coarser powder or rathergrains of gum must be treat in the same manner to procure the bolder strength but these may endure proportionately stronger bite it be necessary to have more powder than one because the hold the powder or grain have of the copper will permit only certain degree of action in the aquafortis the grosser the grain the stronger hold they take of the copper they will bear more heat to fix they and will suffer more copper to be cofaway from around they but then they would make very stare white be not ground previously lay by the other or if they be misplace on subject they would greaily disfigure it sometimes finer tint may be lay over coarser to good advantage sometimes larger grain of white may be procure by melt the finer powder more than usual which by spread each particle of gum make each grain cover greater surface which it protect from the action of the aquafortis it require some patience and facility with the pencil to prepare the plate by stop out which operation be not only to be attend to at first to preserve the white but may be repeat at any time provide the grain of powder attach to the plate appear able to sustain the biting necessary to produce the color propose every manner of engrave by aqua tinta have much of uncertainty connect with it and require to only good judgment but great attention and some perhaps good deal of good luck to succeed happily if therefore any mode of practise it could be reduce to certainty of produce the effect require and could be so conduct as to be under command it would be fortunate discovery the first difficulty in aqua tinta be to get the ground perfectly even and uniform to accomplish this we have two object in view the first be to compose ground which shall be properly divide into material which may produce grain to resist the aquafortis material which will produce interstice to admit the aquafortis the best way at present know be to bruise grind break and sift together repeatedly till the com pound powder appear of one uniform color the gum copal with proportionate quantity of asphaltum which will make powder of pretty nearly equal fineness now the gum copal will be fix on the plate by be melt by means of so gentle degree of heat as will not affectthe asphaltum this powder then be loose admit the aquafortis to surround the grain of gum .. other powder may be discover to answer the same purpose and indeed whatever be near the specific gravity of the guin nay succeed in practice the second object we have in view to lay the grounds perfectly uniform and evenly distribute over the surface of the copper it be true that steady hand may sift powder through fine sieve very evenly if the eye follow it closely and this tnethod be not to be despised but almost every body must have observe that powder of all kind be precipitate when at rest in water very evenly and uniformly if then quantity of water have proper proportion of powder diffuse in it be pour on plate the water may be drain from it by proper inclination of it while the powder remain behind when the water have entirely quit the plate the ground thus obtain may be set by be warm as before menstruum in which the grain of gum be dissolve and intimately mix may be yet better tum or rosin dissolve in spirit of wine the liquer be be pour on the plate the spirit will evaporate and the rosin become dry will form itself into grain which be fix on the plate allow interstice for the action of the aquafortis as the time necessary for put border of wax round plate be more than be engage in the biting of light ground some artist make use of trough properly paint and secure from the action of the aquafortis into which when fill with aquafortis and after have stop out all that be to be leave white on the plate not forget the margin they plange the plate and suffer it to remain there only so long as they judge necessary to produce the color want if upon examination the plate be not bitten enough they plunge it again till they be satisfied do this they do to every ground till the plate of these mode of practise aqua tinta sup= pose good deal of trouble in stop out the part which be to be leave white there have be therefore other method suggest which for some subject and wer better first lay ground of gum copal grain all over the surface of the copper when this be cool and ready for use paint with the shadow composition mention below in the same manner and with the same freedom as with indian ink the shadow of the subject if it be landscape the foliage of the tree ecc let it be thoroughly dry then with large soft camel hair pencil cover over the whole with the asphaltum varnish and when that be thos roughly dry plunge the plate into water in short space space of tithe the water penetrate through this vainish will dissolve the sugar or the treacle which form its composition and that rise will part from the copper and bring with it all that cover it leave the copal ground unaffected by the warer and still adhere firmly to the plate this bite before the asphaltum varnish be make by dissolve four ounce of asphaltum in about eight ounce of spirit of turpentine use very gentle heat pour off the liquid and add more of either ingredient as the varnish may be think too thick or too thin the shadow compositton be make by tak ing any quantity of treacle and grind it into paste with whiten or by taking of coarse sugar about two ounce of whiten about one ounce and grind they with sufficient quantity of water to form paste proper for use by the pencil if any hard edge occur in aqua tinta they may be soften by the burnisher or the burnisher may insert light or slight touch of draw exc occa sionally to advantage the aquafortis use in this method of engrave should not be too strong because as its operation always rapid if too strong it will break up the ground and do other mischief before it can be prevent it be not bad way to try the strength of it before it be use on separate piece of copper very great disadvantage attend retint of any part be the nicety require to match color in fact it be hardly possibly to lay two grounds so precrsely alike as be requisite for that purpose nav it befrequently happen that second ground obliterate or at least damage the first over which it be lay aqua tinta be method of engrave if it may deserve that title so very rapid that it will produce on large plate in one week the effect of month labour at some other kind of engrave it be in ge neral however but shallow on the copper yet when well manage be sufficiently last its merit consist much in very even colour smooth and free from blemish it apply well to architecture to landscape and to backgrounds though do not think much use can ever be make of the invention yet think proper to insert here the mode of etch upon glass or rather the discovery of solvent which act upon glass as aquafortis do upon copper the acid for this purpose be procure from sparry fluor or derbyshire blue john powder and by means of concentrate vitriolic acid submit to distillation by gentle heat what come over and unite with proper quantity of water in the receiver which be of lead as well as the retort be the acid it must also be keep in leaden vessel this will corrode line ec draw upon glass through varnish explanation of the method of printing in coloun the plate be warm in the usual manner the colour be apply by means of stump camelhair pencil to the different part as the subject suggest it be then wipe with coarse gauze canva vol ii edit other be improper after this it be wipe clean with the hand as in common practice and be again warm be pass through the press the color be mix with burnt linseed oil and those generally use by painter be proper the little finger generally supply the place of pencil this art succeed best in chalk engraving the print if touch up with colour after they be print will approach very beautifully toward the effect of picture of cut in wood this business be properly neither scuipture nor engrave but be apply to many of the purpose of engrave it claim affinity to that art the smoothest grain wood be the best such as peartree or beech but above all box the surface be prepare by smoothening thin coat of white lead temper with water be pass over it the outline of the design be trace with black lead pencil or ink and the design be lay on the block then wet and carefully rub on the back till the line trace be transfer to the white lead which shew they plainly the blank part be then cut away with sharp knife small chissel or graver as require this kind of work differ from engraving on copper in that the part of the copper which be out out hold the ink and form the impresion in this the part which remain be prominent perform the same business the block be print as letterpress this kind of work have be make to produce a effect resemble wash drawing by use several block correspondent to the several color of the design the ink be accurately mix to the color want be apply all over the surface of the block and the darker color print after the lighter aqua tinta have superseded the use of this method but one similar to it be practise at paris only use copper plate instead of wooden block and print the separate part of the design in they proper color by which they be very prettily tint in delicate work or part expressive of distance to slope away the surface of the wood gently in those part produce good effect because in the printing they less hold the ink and less ink be pull off they by the paper consequently they appear fainter . of modelling this be one branch of the art of the sculptor and in many case very important one be to all work of considerable size a indispensable requisite previous to cut the marble be also the usual mode in which young sculptor study the principle of they profession academy figure ecc the tool for this purpose be usually slender stick of wood make by the artist himself and therefore of shape at he pleasure but whatever other implement may occasionally be employ the thumb and finger generally perform the major part the clay to be use should be fine soft free from stone dirt cc and be carefully examine before it be use in london this kind of clay be procure from about vauxhall to model bas relief on strong board of sufficient size sketch the dimension of the subject intend then place the clay which be morst and ad hesive lay greater quantity on the part which be to be raise to give they thickness and following the course of the draw proper to the subject to model figure it be sometimes requisite to in sert little stick into the limb and other part which will not support themselves without prop but this require care it be liberty very allowable in modell to support the figure with bed of clay in convenient place where they do not injure the composition since these kind of model be to be considered as little more than sketch or preparatory study the model be quit if not finish it must be keep cool and morst by be cover with wet cloth if model be intend to be preserve it must be set by to dry very thoroughly then take to where it must be gradually harden and bake there be many risk attend this process if the clay be not dry within however it may appear without sudden heat will spoil it or if there bemain any stone conceal in it when the heat of the fire reach that stone it will explode and crack the piccc if the colour of the clay use be not approve of it may be paint in distemper after be burnt oil color have glossiness be seldom employ to prepare for large piece of sculpture .the model be finish as above the size of the figure intend and then mold in separate part in which when reunite be cast plasterfigure which be repair cut scrape erc with great accuracy this figure be now the standard from which copy in marble be to be take the original part of the business be over to model in wax .the process be much the same as with clay to temper the wax some add to pound of wax half pound of colophony some add turpentine melt the whole with olive oil some insert little vermilion or other color to give it tint wax will readily take every color add to it and be accordingly sometimes use to imitate life in which procedure cleanness of tint must be carefully attend fin sculpture mo . bacon have communicate to the public in the cyclopedia some remark on that profession in which he excel to offer it to we reader require we presume no apology they be as follow be probable that sculpture be more ancient than painting and if we examine the style of ancient painting there be reason to conclude that sculpture stand first in the public esteem as the ancient paint er have evidently imutate the statuarle even to they disadvantage since they work have not that freedom of style more especially with respect to they composition and drapery which the pencil might easily acquire to greater degree than that of the chissel but as this be universally the case it can not be attribute to any thing else besides the higher estunation of the work on which they form themselyes which be the most difficult art have be question often agitate painting have the greatest number of requisite but at the same time she expedient be the most numerous and therefore we may venture to affirm that whenever sculpture please equally with painting the sculptor be certainly the greatest artist sculpture have indeed the honour of give law to all the school of design both ancient and modern with respect to purity of form the reason perhaps that be divest of those meretricious ornament by which painting be enable to seduce its admirer it be happily force to seck sculpture dictionary ait titat eganit geet tt the es tht for its effect in the higher excellency of the art hence elevation in the idea as well as purity and grandeur in the form be find in greater perfection in sculpture than in painting besides what = ever may be the original principle which direct we feeling in the approbation of intrinsic beauty they be without doubt very much under the infiuence of association custom and habit will necessarily give false bias to we judgment it be therefore totural and in some measure reasonable that those art which be temporaneous should adapt theyselve to the change of fashion cc but sculpture by its durability and consequent application to work of perpetuity be oblige to acquire and maintain the essential principle of beauty and grandeur that its effect on the mind may be preserve through the various change of mental taste it be conceive that it will scarcely admit of question whether the ancient or modern have most excel in this art the palm have be universally adjudge to the former to determine in what proportion they be superior be too difficult a attempt wherever there real superiority in any art or science it will in time be discover but the world ever fond of excess never stop at the point of true judgment but dress out its favourite object with the ornament of fancy so that every blemish become beauty this it have do by ancient sculpture to such de = gree as not to form it be julgment of that by any rule but to form a opinion of rule by the example as long as this be the case modern art can never have fair comparison with the ancient this partiality to the ancient be so strong as to prevent almost all dis= crimination and be the sole reason why many alique that now stand as pattern of beauty in the judgment of most connorsseur be not discover to be copy this be not more important than it be easy to be perceive by judicious eye for whereever there be grandeur or elegance to a eminent degree in the idea and general composition of statue and when the execution of the part call by aftist the treat of the part betrays want of faste and feeling there be the greatest reason to conclude that the statue be copy though we be ever so certain of its antiquity and surely if evidence of picture be copy proportionably diminish value the same rule of judgment may may be no less properly apply to statue modern and ancient art can never therefore be fairly compare till both be make to submit to the determination of reason and nature it may be observe that the anciept have chiefly confine themselves to the sublime and beaunful and whenever pathetic subject have come before they they have sacrifice expression to beauty the famous groupe of niobe be one instance of this kind and therefore however great we partiality to the ancient may be none can hesitate to affirm that whenever the modern shall unite great expression with great beauty they wrest the palm out of they hand in sculpture the first thing do be out of great block of marble to see another of the size require which be perform with smooth steel see without tooth casting water and sand thereon from time to tie then by take off what be superfiuous with steel point and heavy hammer of soft iron it be bring near the measure require and still nearer with finer point they then use flat cutting instrument have notch in its edge of tooth and then chissel to take off the scratch the other have leave till at length take rasp of different degree of fineness they gradually bring the work into condition for polish to polish or make the part smooth and sleek they rub they with pumicestone and smalt then with tripoli and when still greater lustre be require they use burnt straw to proceed the more regularly on the head of the model some place a immoveable circle divide into degree with moveable ruler or index fastened in the centre of the circle and divide likewise into equal part from the end of the ruler hang thread with plummet which serve to take all the point to be transfer thenteito the block of marble from whose top hang another plummet like that of the model but other excellent sculptor disapprove of this method urging that the smallest motion of the model change they measure for which reason they rather choose to take all they measure with the compass though reckone more tedious in large figure the first part of the business be labour and not skill it be commit to underorkmen and indeed the whole of this part of the profession be to copy the model the mdster seldom trouble himself to work at it at least till the close of the process in dd tol ii edit imitate bas reliet if it be subject which admit of be lay flat they endeavour to bring the copy to cast the same shadow as the original sculpture have be in england rather monume = tal art than as it be in many other country de= corative profession of late we have have many elegant chimneypiece of sculpture but very few large figure except fortomb we best specimen in public be the statue of phrenzy and melancholy on the pier before bethlehem hospital which deserve to be rank among the first performance in this art they be execute in the reign of charle ii by garrtel cieeer father of the poetlaureat there be also most elegant statue of king edward vi in bronze which stand in one of the court of st . thomas hospital in southwark by scheemaker and one of sir isaac newton at cambridge roueillyac westminsterâ€”abbey be the most famous repository of sculpture in england and it contain many fine specimen but the fighre lose much of they effect by be crowded together without order whereby one groupe injure another st . paul cathedral have lately receive further embellishment by sculpture and more be intend it afford many noble opportunity and situation for capital groupe in all part but especially in the circumference beneath the dome follow color be nerwly discover and make public have be ount in they proper place be give they here for the satisfaction of we reader brunswick green .â€” this be very valuable and newly discover color and be prepare by two brother of the name of gravenhorst at brunswick hithereto it have be keep secret but it be conjec= ture to be precipitate of copper which have be dissolve in tartar and water by coetion and which evaporation of the lixivium be deposit in the form of cupreous tartar similar color be sell by mmessrs brandran and co. in siselane london which possess many if not all the rare quality of that prepare at brunswick earth white . â€”many ingenious man have employ they talent in discover more wholesome and cheaper pigment than white lead and perhaps the finer and whiter sort of earth might be usefully substitute the terra goltber gensis be of white color which be dug up in several part of germany more particularly at golt berg whence its name and strigaw and at lignitz in silesia at this time it be procure in the neighbourhood of ifasselt in the bishoprick of liege in the circle of westphalia where it be usually seal with the impression of a eagt and the word goltbergensisoftobaccopipe clay there be also several sort that appear convertible into pig= ment especially one of this class which be find near lymington in hampshire which be not at present but the earth term melimim turn to much use melinum have ever be famous in the annal of painting be the principal white of the painter of antiquity it be still find in the same place from whence the painter of old have it viz the island of wilo call melo by the greek whence its hname and be common in all the adjacent island it be not quite so bright white as white lead but as it never turn yellow as white lead do it be far preferable to that article in the course of time besides as most of the discolor substance of earth may be attribute to iron if it be treat with marine acid the brightest might be improve orange lake .â€” this may be prepare by boil ing four ounce of the best spanish annotto and one pound of pearl ash for the space of half a hour in one gallon of water strain the tincture and mis it gradually with solution of pound and half of alum in six quart of water desist when no ebullition ensiue treat the sediment as be usual in comthon lake and dry it in square bit or roll cc patent vellow .â€” this color for which the ingenious mo . turner have patent be prepare by triturate red lead and common salt together in mortar and then exposing they in crucible make of tobaccopipe clay to certain heat the sait be decompose the marine acid uniting with the cal of lead form the patent yellow and the basis of the salt which must be carefully wash out be the mineral alkali of so much consequence in the soap glass and other manufactory sugar of lead . â€”lead and its calce may be dissolve by the acctous acid and will afford cryss tallizable salt call sugar of lead from its extreime sweetness this like all the preparation of fead deadly porson it have the property of render oil thicker and cause they to dry more rapidly to make white precipitate of eead if small quantity of strong nitrous acid be pour on litharge which see the acid unite itself to the metal with considerable effervescence and heat some water be now pour on and the glass vessel contain the mixture shake turbid solution of the litharge be make if small quantity of acid of viz triol be now add it throw down beautiful white precipitate and the acid of nitre be leave at liberty to act upon the remainder of the litharge begin anew to dissolve it with effervescence .. when it saturate which will be know by the disconfinuance of the bubble more acid of vitriol be to be drop in and white precipitate be again throwis down if any of the litharge remain undissolved the nurous acid be set at liberty second tiime attack it as at first and by continue to add acid of vitriol the whole of the litharge may be converted into most beautiful and durable white unfortu= pately this color can not be use in ofl though in ater it seeim superior to any .. if the process be well manage a ounce of nitrousacid may be make to convertseveral poand of litharge into white of this kind k have be strongly recompmend to paper and other who use watercolor in large quang tity to prepare they lake and the color now prepared of chalk on the basis of the above precipitate of lead .for instance if the color require be very fine one suppose from cochingal the color thatter be to be extract by spirit of wine without heat when the spirit be sufficiently impregnate it be to be pour by little and little upon the cal the spirit soon evaporate and leave the calx colore with the cochineal more of the tincture to be pour on rub the mixture constantly and thus by proper management many beautiful color not inferior to the best carmine may be prepare when only small quantity of color for the more exquisite touch of the miniag ture painter be require we would recommend the process to be conduct on the basis of white precipitate or cale of tin pursue the same method of rub in the color tincture as when whice precipitate of tead be use if instead of cochincal brazilwood turmeric legwood exc be substirute different kind of red yellow and purple may be produce way of conclusion to this part of we work we shall add some miscellaneous remark extract from small work by the late ingenious mo . rorertson which be only distribute among he private friend and never publish be in few hand and be the result of the experience of many artist communicate to he as well in italy as in england and write down by he will we hope be acceptable to we friend as certainly many of the idea and hint be very good ground and peiminh forrester communicate to I the followin ubservation which he have from mir patoon and other the venetian master often work upon jess grounds thus prepare take fine and even can be of board and give it one coat of jess make with size when asy paint upon it the first colering will sink in as the jess drink up the oil but by that means leare the greater brilliancy in the color the second painting will not sink so much and also very clear after which you may very safely retouck and glaze or scumble with the mastic war sish at pleasure and you picture will retain by far more force and vigour than if paint on any other sround fou may likewise paint with safety on this th or even on white silk without any preparasion in water color prepase in the common way any head agur landscape after be barmonize and finish in watercolor the mastic warnish must be carefully lay on before you proceed to retouch glaze or scumble in the usual way with oil and varnish until the effect prove satisfactory this will bear out and retain more force delicacy and clearness than any oilpainting whatever and will even last as long and be also method make use of by some of the finest colorist in they best work it be of great importance in we first and second painting whether of flesh drapery landscape to paint only with earth reserve the most clear and brilliant color for the last painting and glazing by which mean greater truth and force will always be preserve in we work and they will also last the longer for it it may reasonably be suppose that proper foundation of strong holding color be nece saty such as most earth be under the more delicate which will make they last and bear out the befter whilst on the contrary if earth be use upon the clear and brilliant color the effect must be both stull and heavy besides if in dead or second cofor the finest and brightest tint be use what color can be find to brighten or finish with the method use by pietro bianchi who be very ingenious and general painter and whose picstill maintain great clearness and freshness though do forty fifty or sixty yearsâ€”is this he take one half of drying oil and the other half of clear nut oil these he mix well together and he picture be dry he rub with sponge of brush these ixed oil upon the pieture leave it only damp therewith after which he

which he say will never change and dry much sooner than nut we the method of apply it be by let the picture be well dry then rub with small sponge dip in the oil the part of the painting which you intend to retouch after that spread the oil with the palm of the hand which will make the color spread and work very agreeably mo . andrew say that if you would unite any part of picture in water color whether sky face drapery or any other part you must wer the picture on the back with clean sponge moderately so as to damp the color after which you may retouch scumble or repaint as often as you please pro= vide the size with which you mix you color be neither too weak nor too strong and that the preture be paint on a unprimed fine cloth of silk .this mo . patoon secret and may be repeat

cloth should be primed with peachstone black and whice that we to say the second go over the cloth or the last hand as it be term should be do with this black and white and the picture will maintain itself without the least danger accord to mo . west when you intend to bepaint retouch or glaze you picture let it first be tolerably dry then give the whole or the part which you intend to paint coat

the least occasion for varnishing those part when the whole be finish only cover the other part that appear dull or sunk in accord to mo . jenkin when the varnish be very dry on the pietare the best method be to rub on the part to be paint or retouch little purify nut oil which must be wipe clean off so as to leave only little dampness on the place which assist the fresh color in uniting with the
