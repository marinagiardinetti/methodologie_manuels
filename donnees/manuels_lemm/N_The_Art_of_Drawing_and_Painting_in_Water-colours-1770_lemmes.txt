painting in watercolour part the principle ef draw chap of draw in general raw be the art of represent the appearance of object by imitation or express by line and shade the formi or appearance of any thing in nature or art the copying of another draught or any design conceive in the mind and all this without the assistance of mathematical rule the art of draw be a accomplishment not more elegant agreeable and ornamental than useful be therefore by no means to be neglect in the education of youth wherein any genius or inclination that way be discover besides its being of all art the most universally admired and esteem there be few other art or profession to which it be not assist its great ujse be not only confine to painter engraver gardener embroiderer weaver and many other concerned in design but the mathematician engineer architect and navigator daily practise it all design and model be execute by it it be use appear in every station of life and it be equally admire by child and by adult to be able on the spot to take the sketch of fine building or beautiful prospect of any curious production of art or uncommon appearance in nature be not only very desirable accomplishment but veryagreeableamusement rock mountain field wood river cataract city town castle house fortification ruin or whatever else may present itself to view on we journey or travels in we own or in fo reign country may be thus bring home and preserve for we future use either in business or conversation this art transmit to we view thing that be long since past or would otherwise perisn reprefent to we the deed of people aud nation for many age dead and preserve the feature ffature and resemblance of ancestor or other valuable person for many generation it be therefore no wonder that a attainment so uni¬ versally useful and admire should be distinguished as one of the highest embellishment of liuman life and be patronize and cultivate by all the generous and ingenious part of mankind chap ii of the proper material for draw evhe material require in draw be black leadpencil crayon of black white be red chalk crowquill pen rule and compass camelhair pencil and indian ink accustom yourself to hold you pencil further from the point than you do in writing whichwill give you better command of it and contribute to render you stroke more free and bold theuie of you pencil be to drawthe first sketch or qut line of you piece as any stroke or line that be amiss may in this be more easily rub out than in anyother thing and when you have make you sketch as correct as you can with the pencil you may then draw carefully the best qutline you have get with you crowquill pen and ink the ink make use of fof this purpose must not be the common but indian ink be much softer than the other and not run and and by mixing it with water it may be make to any degree of strength and may be use in pen like common ink after use the ink you may wipe out the pencilline by rub the piece gently with the crumb of stale bread have thus get you outline discharge you next work be to shade you piece properly as you shall be direct below either by draw fine stroke with you pen where it require to be shade or by wash it with the hairpencil and the indian ink as to the rule and compass they be never or rarely to be use except in measure the proportion of you figure after you have draw they to prove whether they be right or not or in house fortification and gher piece of architecture red lead and red or black chalk be use in the same manner as black lead white chalk and tobaccopipe clay be use in heighten or give stronglight and in draw on coloured paper pastil or crayon be any colour mix with tobaccopipe clay which while soft and in the consistency of paste be roll up in piece about the thickness of quill and two or three inch in length and then dry they be generally use on coloured paper and the colour be rub and wring one into another in such manner that no stroke appear but the whole look as if it be do with brusn chap iii of light and shade it be the artful management of light and shadethat give the appearance of substance roundness and distance to whatever body be represent by draw draw circle on piece of paper fill it up with any even colour and it will appear to be body with round circumference and flat side but by colour it stronger in the middle and cause it gradually to weaken towards the circumference it will receive convex appearance like that of bali or glabe wherever the vivacity of colour be strongest that part of the object catch the sight first and appear nearest to it whereas its weakness and going off be more and more broken and faint and seem to ffy farther off from the sight in round the paat of any ohject the extremity in turn must lose themselves insensibly and confusedly without precipitate the shadow into the light but the passage of the one into the other must be common and imperceptible that be by degree of light into shadow and shadow into light object that be painted light must have sufficient breadth of shadow to sustain they and dark body must have sudden light behind to detach they from the ground or from those object that be place belind they otherwise they will appear confufedly as stick upon each other whereas the opposition of shadeto light object and of light to dark one give projection and separate they from other body there should be balance preserve betweenthe light and shadow broad light oughtriot to be introduce into draught without large shadow the nearer any object be to the eye it be see so much tlie stronger and plainer sight be weaken by distance and the more reicte any object be it be see in more imperfect manner therefore those object which beplace foremost to the view ought to be moresinissied than thosc that be cast behind and they should have such relative dominion over each other that as one object by its heightningsscause other to retire more backward so the same object must be chase and make to appear farther fromthe sight than other which be morestrongly illuminate it be not sufficient that remote object be only coloured in more faint and languid manner but accord to they distance the part must appear more or less confused the eye not be able to discover minutely what be far separate from it pure and unmixed white either draw a object nearer or carry it off to greater distance it it be accompany with black the opposition of light and dark render the object more sensible and bring it nearer to the advanced part but pure white be the lightest of colour unless it be force forward and support by black will sly off to the remotest view as for pare black it be the heaviest most earthy andmost sensible of all colour andbring the object nearer to the sight it must be place in mass be insensibly confused and have its proper repose the representation of bodic give they alway such light as be most proper and convenient to they suppose situation if the object be in the fieldsor open air and the sun not visible or obscure by cloud you must then introduce almost a universal light though not warm and strong and you shade must be faint but when the sun be conspicuous and shine in its full lustre then the light must be very strong and bold and the shadow very dark if the object you represent be suppose in room little but not very much illuminate and you survey it from without and stand on level with the light that strike upon it the shadow of that figure must be very soft whereby the figure itself will appear beauteous to the eye and will notwithstanding the softness of the shadow seemas imboss and come boldly out small light illuminating body occasion the shadow on the dark side to be large and they extremity to be very bold on the other hand light make the shadow on the darker side to be more distinct and more soft in they limitation reflection be to be use in delineating glitter or shine body as glass pearl silver let the cause of the reflection beit more or lef be see in the thing itself place all you light one way through the whole work and if the light fall sideways on the picture the other side which be the farthest from the light must be make the darkest that part of the body must be make lightest which have the light most opposite to it if the light be place above the head then the top of the head must be make lightest the shoulder must receive the next greater degree of light and thus must you continue to fhiade lose the light by degree by how much one part of the body project more than another it must by so much be make the lighter and on the contrary those part that bend inward must be make so much the darker two equal light must never be make in one and the fame picture the greater be to strike forcibly into the miedle and with greatest lustre on thofe part of the design where the principal figure and strength of the action seem to lie diminisning it gradually as it approach nearest the extremity of the piece general rule for draw begin with plain geometrical figure as line angles triangle polygon arch circle oval cone cylinder and the like be the foundation of all other proportion the circle be of use in the several orbicular form as the sun moon globe the oval in give just proportion to the face and mouth and the square confines picture youare to copy the triangle be of use in draw side or half face angles and arch in perspective and the polygon in groundplat fortification the cone in spire steeple top of tower the cylinder in column pillar have bring you hand to be fit and ready in general proportion accustom yourself to give every object it be due shade accord to its concavity or convexity and to elevate or depref the same as the object appear either nearer or farther off the light before you begin to work view you original with close attention divide it in you mind into several part observe the length the breadth and the similitude of each part consider they proportion to each other and to the whole the distance from one part to the other and what part lie opposite to each other after you have do you copy view it afresh by compare it with the original for the docover and amending of fault as it will not only serve to perfect you in that particular draught but will improveyou knowledge of line and proportion in general and in time enable you for the nearest imitation the qutline must be draw in glide manner large and smooth which will give they the resemblance of life and motion you must preserve in you draught strong resemblance between the part and the whole every member ought to be make to agree strong limb have no relâtion to consumptive body or decay old age and the eye leg hand and foot should be exactly nair have good copy to draw after learn to reduce they to other proportion either larger or smaller and this by frequent practice in drawing fruit as apple pear cherry with they leave herb tree of different kind as also in the imitation of beast fowl fishie it be requifite not only to be perfect in lay down the exact proportion but before you proceed to the shadow and trimming you work to be well acquainted in the general or outward line and this be still more necessary in imitate the body of man with all its lineament as head nose eye ear cheek arm and shoulder as also in the drapery or fmitation of the cloath and the artificial setting off the outward covering habit and ornament of the body in they natural and proper fold chap particular direction for draw in draw after picture or print you must take care to place it in such light that theglof ofthe colour may not interrupt yours view but so that the light and you eye may fallequally and obliquely upon the piece to thisend you be to consider from what point and inwhat direction the eight fall upon the object accord to which direction let all you light and shade be place throughout the work .. that part of the object must be the lightest whichhave the light most directly opposite to it if thelight fall sideways on you picture you must make that side which be opposite to it lightest and on the contrary that side which be farthest from it darkest let the piece be place at such distance that upon open you eyeyou may view it all at once and the larger the picture be it fhould be so much the more place off at the greater distance but right before you and little reeline draw all you ontline at first very faint with the feather of duck s wing or the crumb of bread bread and these outline should be draw true and agreeable to the pattern before you begin to shadow any part of the object the qutline next the light should be draw more faint and when vou have draw one feature it should be direction for you in some measure to draw anothe by observe with you eye the distance from that to the next feature make afull mark at the place with you coal then draw it and so to the next till you have draw the whole figure then obserye the middle of the picture you would copy and touch upon the paper with the point of you coal afterwards observe the more conspicuous and uppermost figure if there be more than one which you be to touch lightly in they proper place thus run over the whole draught you will see as it be the skeleton of the piece you be to draw have make out these sketch view they diligently to see if they answer you pattern or not for the gesture of the life ought to shew themselves eminently in the first and rudest draught of the piece correct and amend whatever you perceive amiss add and diminish as it vary from the pattern by which mean it will be bring nearer and nearer to the life observe the distance of one limb joint or muscle from another and the same in all other accident of the figure they length bréadth turning shadow next to the light very faintly and where you see bold and free touch be not timorous in express the same in drawing head after the life or otherwise take care to place the feature exactly right upon the crossline whether it be full face or threequarter face in foreshortening you must make the crofline to sly upwards but where the aspect be downwards they must be make downwards in circular manner have draw the qutline true with coal you be to proceed to trace the same line again with pen indian ink draw they with more exactnessand by imitate all the hatch with they exact distance one from another they crossing turning and winding with more boldness and freedom perfect you design in draw after naked body all the muscle be not to be so plainly express as in anatomical figure but that side whose part be most appa¬ rent and of signification in the performance of any action must be make to appear more or lef accord to the force of that action in draw young person the muscle must not appear manifestly so hard as in elder and full grow person the same thing be to be observe as to fat and fleshy person and such as be very delicate and beautiful and in woman scarce any muscle muscle at all be to be expreff or but very little unless it be in some very forcible action and then too they be to be represent very faintly the like be also to be observe as to child the motion of the whole body muit be considered in draw of the muscle as in the risincand falling of the arm the muscle of the breast appear either more or less the hip do the like accord as they be bend outward or inward and it be the same chiefly in the shoulder sidez and neck accord to the several action of the body the breadth and largeness of picture be alsoto be consider it should be larger about the leg and garment shew itself slender aboye by discover one shoulder and hide the other which be shorten by turn the body butsometimes the figure be to be represent biggest in the upper part by represent either or boththe shoulder or both the arm shew the one leg and hide the other orboth of they after one manner at discretion neither ought this to be observe only in the whole body but even in every part so that in the leg when be raise outward on the one side that which be directly on the contrary side must be draw in andhide as it appear in the life .. the proportion of the figure ought to be mul¬¬ tiply by degree in proportion ofone to two three three four for herein the chief skill confist the diameter of the biggest place between the knee and the foot be double the least and the largest part of the thigh triple ch ap vi of draw face in draw head it be usually divide into four equal part from the crown of the head to the top of the forehead from the top of the forekead to the eyebrow from the eyebrow to the bottom of the nose from thence to the bottom of the chin but this proportion be not constant those feature in different man be often very different as to length and shape in well proportion face however they be nearly right to direct you therefore in form perfect face you first business be to draw complete oval as you see in plate figure in the middle of which from the top to the bottom draw perpendicular line and through the center or middle of this line draw another directly acrof from one side to the other of you oval on these two line all the feature of the face be to be draw as follow divide you perpendicular line into four equal part the first must be allot to the hair of the head the second be fromthe top of the forehead to the top of the nose between the eyebrow the third be from thencethence to the bottom of the nofe and the fourtk include the lip and chin theline across the perpendicular one or the breadth of the face be always suppose to be the length of five eye you must therefore divide it into five equal part and place the eye upon it so as to leave exactly the derstood only of full front face for if it turn to either side then the distance be to be lessen on that side which turn from you less or more in the top of the ear proportion to its turn be to rise parallel to the eyebrow at the end of the diameter or erof line and the bottom of it must be equal to the bottom of the nose the nostril ought not to come out farther than the corner of the eye in any face and the middle of the mouth must always be place upon the perpendicular line the mouth when shut be as the follow be a ingenious device which perhaps may somewhat assist the young practitioner in form the face accord to its different turning and in place the feature properly thereon procure piece of smooth wood turn for the purpose in the shape of a egg which be nearly the shape of the human head draw line lengthways quite round it as in the last fig and divide this line into two equal part by anothe line draw directly across it at right angles the feature be draw on these two line accordaccord to the rule deliver above will produce foreright face turn the oval small matter from the left hand to the right and the perpendicular will appear bent like bow as you see in fig upon which the particular feature be to be draw as in fig always observe in what manner the nose project beyond the round of the oval the same must be observe ff youturn the oval from the right hand to the leave as in fig and if you incline the oval downwards and to the right the line of the crof will appear as in fig and the feature draw on they as in fig if you turn it upwards recline to the leave the line of the crof will appear as in fig and face draw on they as infig great variety of face may be shew by this oval accord as you incline recline or turn it more or less but those figure which come sideways be to be draw by means of perpendicular as in fig upon which the forehead nose mouth and chin be tobe draw as you see in fig be to be observe that if the face be fat the gheek will seem to swell if lean the jawsbone will stick out and the check fall in but ffit be neither too fat nor too lean it willbe nearly round touch the feature lightly where the eye nose mouth and chin should stand then begin to draw they more exactly and so proceed till you have finish the face after which draw the hair beard and shadow about it you be to consider der all those chief touch which give life to face and that discover the disposition of the mind thus the mouth extend and the corner turn à little up shew smile counte¬ nance you must take care that the shabe light because afterwards they can not be rendered more light and remember that they be to be more faint and light in fair than in swarthy complexion chap vii of the measure andproportion of the several part of tbe body he ancient commonly allow eight head to they figure though some of they have but seven however the modern ordinarily divide they figure into ten face thatis from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot in the manner follow from the crown of the head to the forchead be the third part of the face .. the face begin at the lowest hair which be upon the forehead and end at the bottom of the chin the face be divide into three proportional part the first contain the forehead the second the nose and the third the mouth and chin from the chin to the pit between the collarbone be two length of nose from the pit betwixt the collarbone to the bottom of the breast one face from the the bottom of the breast to the navel one face from the navel to the genitals one face from the genitals to the upper part of the knee two face the knee contain half face from the lower part of the knee to the ancle two face from the ancle to the sole of the foot half face man when he arm be stretch out be from the longest finger of he rigkt hand to the longest of he left as broad as he be long from one side of the breast to the other two faee the bone of the arm call humerus be the length of two face from the shoulder to the elbow from the end of the elbow to the root of the little finger the bone call cubitus with part of the hand contain two face from the box of the shoulderblade to the pit betwixt the collarbone one face if vou will be satisfied in the measure of breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other so that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body you must observe that the box of the elbov with the humerus and of the humerus with the shoulderblade bear the proportion of half face when the arm be stretch out the sole of the foot be the sixth part of the figure the thamb contain nose the inside of the arm from the place where the muscle disappear which make the breast called the pectoral muscle to the middie of the arm four nose from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand five nose the longest toe be nosé long the two utmost part of the teat and the pit betwixt the collarbone of woman make a equilateral triangle for the breadth of the limb no precise measure can be give because the measure themselves be changeable accord to the quality of the person and accord to the movement of the muscle chap viii of draw the boox at full length irst make you oval for the head and haveing divide it accord to the instruction already give draw perpendicular line from the top of the head to the sole of the foot and measure out eight length of the head this line be of special use to direct you in place the figure upright and in the action of the posture where it fall in and where it swell out one head s length from the chin you must draw the breast the third measure reacheth to the navel the fourth to the privity the fifth to the middle of the thigh the sixth to the lower part of the knee the seventh to the lower part of the leg and the eighth to the heel and sole of the foot observe in every measure what touch à there be of the muscle draw that leg first on which the body stand then draw the other and after that the arm and hand but draw at first all the part very lightly with coal only because there be least trouble in alter and rub out the coal as for the hand they be twice as long as they be broad and each of they part have its length breadth and thickness the nailupon the finger be about half the joint it be upon the length of the foot be à sixth part of the height of person and the length be five eighth more than the breadth the length of the face and hand ought to be exactly equal and make but just the tenth part of personheight the rule in draw child be as followsome make child to contain five measure of the head viz from the top of the head to the privity three and in the thigh and leg two more the breadth between the shoulder the length of head and half the breadth of the body above the navel the length of onc head and the breadtn of the upper part of the thigh be the third part of two length of the head the breadth of the knee be just the measure there be betwixt the eye and the chin the small of the leg and the brawn of the arm be of the thickness of the neck in general let it be observe always to begin with the right side of the piece you be copy for by so do you will always have what be do before you eye and the rest will follow more naturally and with greater ease whereas if you begin with the left side you hand and arm will cover what you do first and deprive vou of the sight of it by which mean you will not be able to proceedwith so much ease pleasure or certainty as to theorder and manner of you proceeding in draw the human body you must first szetch the head then the shoul¬ der in they exact breadth then draw the trunk of the body begin with the armpit leaving the arm till afterwards and so down to the hip onboth side be sure to observe the exact breadth of the waist when you have do this then draw that leg which the body stand upon and afterwards the other which stand loose then draw the arm and last of all the hand take notice also of the bowings and bending of the body make the part opposite to that which bend correspond in bend with it for instance if one sidc of the body bend in the other must stand oût answerable to it if the back bend in the belly raust slick out if the knee bend out the hain must fail in and so of any other joint in tlie baidy finally endeavour toform all the fart of you figure with truth and in juît proportieii nat one arm or one leg bigger or less than the other not broad shoulder with thin stender waist nor raw and bony arm with thick and gouty leg but let there be kind of harmony and agreement amongst the member and a agreeable symmetry throughout the whole figure but as the essence of draw consist in making at first good sketch you must in this particular be very careful and accurate draw no tered that to you mind you may then finisn one part after another as curioussy as you can in draw ¬ ing the eye ear leg arm hand foot great care study and practice be requisite this must be learn by carefully imitate the best print or drawing you can get of eye ear for as to the mechanical rule of drawing they by line and measure they be not only perplex and difficult but also contrary to the practice of the best master but the action and posture of thè hand be so many and variwe that no certain rule can be give for draw they that will universally hold good and as the hand and foot be difficult membey to dtaw it be necessary and well worth while to bestow some time and pain about they carefully imitate they van ious posture and action so as not only to avoid all lameness and imperfection but also to give they life and spirit in draw labour man you must represend he with strong limb and ralse muscle swell and stand out especially in bear burden draw weight leap walking combate or such like violent exercife in represent person afleep you must carefully avoid give any such posture or action in they lie as would not in all probability afford rest for great want of judgment would appear in represent they limnb or body support by they own force and not by the help of something else with regard to the representation of the pasfion mo . de pile observe that it be absurd as well as impossible to pretend give such particular demonstration of they as to fix they expression to certain stroke which the painter should be oblige to make use of as essential and invariable rule this say he would be deprive the art of that excellent variety of exepression which have no other principle than diversity of imagination the number of which be infinite the same passion maybe express several way each yield more or less pleafure in proportion to the painter s understanding and the spectator s discernment though every part of the face contribute towards express the sentiment of the heart yet the eyebrow accord to mo le brun be the principal scat of expression and where the passion passion make themselves most know it be certain say he that the pupil of the eye by its fire and motion very well shew the agitation of the soul but thenit do not express the kind or nature of that agitation whereasmotion of the eyebrow differ accord as the passion change they nature to express simple passion the motion be simple to express mixt pafsion the motion be compound if the pafsion be gentle the motion be gentle if it be violean the motion be so too we may farther observe say he that there be two kind of elevation in the eyebrow one in which the eyebrow rise up in the middle this elevation express agreeable sensation and it be to be observe that then the mouth rise at the corner another in which the eyebrow rise up at the end and fall in the middle denote bodily pain and then the mouth fall at the corner in laoghter all the part agree for the eyebrow which sall towards the middle of the forehead make the nose the mouth and the eye follow the same motion in weep the motion be compound and contrary for the eyebrow fall towards the nose and over the eye and the mouth rise that way it be to be observe also that the mouth be the part of the face which more particularly express the emotion of the heart for when the heart complain the mouth falls at the corner when it be pleased the corner of the mouth be elevate and when it have a aversion the mouth shoot forward and rise in the middie the head say mo . de pile contribute more to the exprefsion of the passion than all the other part of the body put together those separately can only shew some few passion but the head express they all some however be more peculiarly express by it than other as humility by hang it down arrogance by lift it up languisnment by incline it on one side and obstinacy with stiff and resolute air make it stand upright six and stiff between the shoulder the head also best shew we supplication threat mildness pride love hatred joy and grief the whole face and every feature contribute something but more especially the eye yet though the paffion of the soul be most visible in the line and feature of the face they often require also the assistance of other part of the body without the hand for instance a betion be weak and imperfect they action which be almost infinite create nuinberless expreffion mise cail and send back they be the instrument of threatn prayer praise by they we in great measure approve condenin refuse admit fear afk cxpress we joy and grief we doubt regret pain and admiration but to say how these part must be dispose for express tie varsous paffion be impossible nor can any exact rule be give for it both because the task would would be infinite and because every one must be guide inthis by he own genius and the particuchap ix of drapery in the art of cloath you figure or casting the drapery upon themwith elegance and pro¬ priety many thirig be to be observe however this art consist chicssy in three point viz the order of the fold or plait the different quality of the stuff and the variety of they colour as to the fold they ought to be so managed as that you may easily perccive what it be they cover and distinguishi it from any thing else as for instance that you see it be a arm that be under the drapery and not leg or leg and not a arm again the fold ought to be large and contrast should be observe between they otherwise in the first place they break and divide the sight too much and in the next place the drapery will be too stiff as to the quality of the stuff it should be well consider some fold be abrupt and harsh while other flow more soft and easy again the surface of some have à lustre while other be flat and dead and some be fine and transparent while other be firm and solid the variety of colour when well manage make the greatest beauty in painting some be not equally agreeable with respect to each other and some be never to be place near certain other the drapery must never be make to adhere or stick too close to the part of the body but it must seem to flow round and as it be embrace they yet in such manner as that the figure may be casy and have free motion great lightness and motion of the drapery be only proper in figure in much agitation or expose to the wind the nudity of the figure should always be design before you proceed to draw the dra pery draw the qutline of the garment lightly then draw the great fold first and stroke these into lesser take care that they do not cross one another the drapery that cover those part which be expose to great light must not be so deeply shade as to seem to pierce they nor should those member be cross by fold that be too strong lest by the too greai darkness of they shade the member look as if they be break fold in general should be large and as few as possible however they must be greater or less accord to the quantity and quality of the stuff of which the drapery be suppose to be make suit the garment to the body and make they bend with the body accord as it stand in or out strait or crook or as it bend one way or anothe and the closer the garment sit to the body the narrower and smaller must be the foid the quality of the person be also to be considered in the drapery for instance if they be ma gistrate they drapery ought to be large fine and flow if countryclown they ought to be coarse and short and if lady and nymph light and soft fold well imagine givemuch spirit to any kind of action because they motion imply the like in the act member which seem to draw they forcibly and make they more or less stir as the action be more or less violent a artful complicatiun of fold in circular manner greatly help the effect of fore snortenings all fold consist of two shade and no more which you may turn with the garment at pleasure shadow the inner side more deeply the shade in silk and sine linnen be very thick and small require . little fold and light shadowe observe the motionof the air or in order to draw the loose apparel all sly one way and draw that part of the garment that adhere closest to the body before yoû draw the looser part that sly off from it lest by draw the loose part of the garment first you should mistake the position of you figure and place it awry .. rich ornament when judicioussy and sparingly use may sometimes contribute to the beauty of drapery but such ornament be far below the dignity of angel or heavenly figure the grandeur of whose drapery ought rather tocon¬ sist in the boldness and nobleness of tlie fold than in the quality of the stuff or the glitter of ornament light and fly drapery be proper only to figure in great motion or in the wind but when in calm place and free from violent action they drapery should be large and slow that by they contrast and the fall of the fold they may appear with grace and dignity chap of draw mix figure in order to draw the form of any beast begin at the forehead with the lead or coal draw downward the nose mouth upper and nether chap end the line at the throatthen view it again from the part where you firmerly begin continue it over the head ear and neck till you have give the full compass of the buttock afterwards mark out the leg and touch out the breast with the eminency thereof finish the tail paw tongue tooth beard and the several shadow in draw beast you must be well acquainted with they shape and action without which you wiil never perform any thing excellent in this wayand whatever beast you draw you must be sure to give sketch of the landskip of the country natural to that beast in draw bird you be to begin also at the head continue the breastline from under the throat down to the leg then begin at the pinion for make the wing this be join to the backline the figure will be presently finish the eye leg and tail be to be draw last the feather begin at the head very small must fall backward one way in five rank still increase till finish infect as fly bee wasp grasshopper worm and such like be draw with great ease provide you for the first time have the original before you eye in draw flower begin from the rosetuft or wart inthe middle as in rose or marigoldwith the yellow tuft which be make draw line equally divide from thence to the greatest compass or extent of the flower they may be draw either fully open or in the bud the laave may first be draw rudely afterwards give they they vein or jaggedness chap xi.. of draw landskip building will true draw consist in nicely measuring the distance of each part of you piece by the eye in order to facilitate this you be to imagine in you own mind that the piece you copy be divide into square as for example suppose or imagine à perpendicular and a horizontal line cross each other in the center of the picture you be to copy then suppose also two such line cross you own copy obierve in the original wnat part of tlie design those line interfect and let they fall on the same part ef the suppose line

away lower and lower till they come almost level wlth the lineof the horizon lessen every thing proportionably to its distance and observe also to make you object fainter and less distinct the farther they be remove from you eye make all you light and shade fall one way and let every thing have its proper motion as tree shake by the wind the small bough bend more and the large one less water agitate by the wind and dashing against ship or boat or fall from precipice upon rock and stone and spirt up again into the air and sprinkling all about cloud also in the air now gatheied with the wind now violently condense into hail rain and the like always remember that whatever motion be eause by the wind must all be make the same way let the work imitate the season it be intend torepresent

monument with thousand such other thing proper to particular subject ch ap xii curious rulesfor draw any object in its qutline as exact as nature with some farthe instruction for shadow without any regard to the foremention rule or any knowledge in the art of draw take sheet of the thinnest or whitest brownpaper and brushit over with oil of turpentine which will immediately render it transparent then after drying the paper in the air strain it upon frame and fix it against the object you design to draw this do place right before it picce of wood with hole in it fit for one s eye to look through and as you meet any outline of the object on the transpa¬ rent paper trace they over with pencil hy which mean vou will obtain the just proportion and true representation of any object in its qutline to render this still more elegant observe the tracing of you draught wherever the shade be and mark they with you pencil for all the art in the world can never dispose the shade so regularly as one may touch by this method but the shade must be dra wn quickly after the qurline be draw not at different time because the sun instantly change they here observe as in certain object you will have fainter stronger and darker shade in you remark of they to take such memorandum as may direct vou how to finisn they with indian ink or other colour whenyou sit down to complete you work to this end the best way be before you trace out you object to prepare three shell or gallipot of indian ink mix with common water viz one of very faint black one of middle black and one of a intense blackt tirnberitig they and as you make vaer observation on the shade of you object mark upon you draught the same number number as they happen to appcar so that afterward you may finish with certainty in this regard the transparent paper be of great use for be lay upon any paper or print in loose sheet all the line will be see so perfectly through it that you may copy they with the greatest ease and if the print or picture be do by good master you can see which line be strong which soft and how to imitate they there be yet another way to take view and landskip which some prefer to the transparent paper and that be either with white or black tiffany or lawn strain upon frame and use in the same manner as the paper excepting that as the blacklead pencil be use to the paper on the white tiffany and on the lawn you must use charcoal very soft and finely powdered bat on the black tiffany very tender white chalk be to be use chap xiii stveral other curious and easy method of take view copy draught print to the greatest degree of accuracy draught may be take regularly from draw on transparent paper as follow take piece of paper of the same size with that of the draught rub one side of it with sone powder of blacklcad till it be well and equally black so that finger touch it will hardly be ting with the black then take the print and lay the paper underneath it with the black side downwards upon another piece of white paper of the same size pin the three together in two or three place afterward take pin or needle somewhat blunt at the point and trace it over the qutline of you picture which with little press will direct the black paper to impress the white so as to receive every stroke you draw this do you may carefully correct what error you see withyou blacklead pencil clean the newmake draught slightly with the crumb of stale bread as for the draught takeon tiffany orlawn they be only to be lay on paper that be such as be draw with charcoal upon white and that draw with chalk upon black orblue pa per and then give each of they knock ortwo with hammer the charcoal or the chalk will fall through they upon the papers directly in the line they be draw and give you the true representation of the object draw from the life in white line upon the black paper and in black line upon the white then strengthen these shadow of drawing with you blacklead pencil chalk or redoker upon the piece of paper where they make the mark for otherwise the line will easily be rub out but it must be observe that this amendment be to be make soon after the line because those tender draught will quickly vanisn if care be not take to strengthen they immediately you be to begin this operation at the bottom of the draw another way be by take thin piece of paper and hold it against glasswindow particularly sash one because the interruption of the lead in the smaller glaze window will hinder part of the prospect then draw what you see from the glass and afterwards the blacklead paper be to be use asdirect before there be another way still which may be more easy to the hand or arm of person not becustom to draw upon paper or lawn place upright which be by the use of camera obscura though to help the hand one may hold baguette or such stick in the left hand as the oilpainter use to rest the right hand upon or have some other rest make for the right hand as may be easily serewe up and down at pleasure but thère be this difference still between draw piece of perspective or view on transparent paper or lawn place upright against any object and draw by the camera obscura that such piece will take in more of the view or object and from greater distance than the canmera obscura will however the portable canmera obscura will at first be very easy to the arm of beginner by reason the object appear on a horizontal plane such as tabie and the hand hand have proper rest will more easily follow the line represent on the plane withgreat exactness the camera obscura be machine or apparatus vherein the image of external objectsare represent distinctly and in they genuine colour either in a invert or erect situation this manchine may be make as follow darken chamber onc of whose window look into place set with variety of object leave only one little aperture open in the window in this aperture fit lens either plane convex one or one convex on both side so as to be the portion of à large sphere at due distance to be determine by experience spread paper or white cloth on the wall unless the wall itself be whiten so as to serve the purpose and on this the image of the desire object will be delineate invertedly in this case it be not more difficult to draw or rather copy the object though they be reverse than to draw or copy several thing which we see upright on the frame of transparent paper lawn or tiffany for to trace line will be as easily do one way as the other and though the object fall on the paper or cloth will while you be draw they be reverse it bebut turn the paper or cloth upside down when they be do and the draw will be right to the eye but to obviate this difficulty let the paper or what be to receive the object be place against the back of chair and let person look on the several object represent thereon over the back of the chair and this will set they right to the eye or if you would rather have the image appear erect it may be do either by means of concave lens or by receive the image on plain speculum incline to the horizon under a angle or by means of two lense include in drawtube instead of one it be to be observe that if the aperture do not exceed the bigness of pea the object will be represent thereon even though there be no lens at all to render the image clear and distinct it be necessary that the object be illuminate by the sun and they will be still brighter if the spectator sirst stay quarter of a hour in the dark care must be likewise take that no light escape through any chink and that the wall be not too much illumine farther the greater distance there be between the aperture and the wall the larger and more distinct will the image be the kay become thus too much dilate the brightness of the image be weaken till at length it become insensible but the portablé canmera obscura be more proper for beginner as be¬ ing more easy for they arm besides the object appear on a horizontal plane may of course be draw with greater exactness the construction of portable camera obscura may be as follow provide wooden chest in the middle of which raise little turret either round or square open toward the object behind this aperture incline little plain mirror to a an¬ gle of which will reflect the ray upon lens convex on both side include in tube at the end of the focus of the lens place table cover with white paper to receive the image and lastly make a oblong aperture tolook through by means of this machine the image will be exhibit perfectly like they object each cloath in they different colour whereby any person unacquainted with design or draw will be able to delineate any thing to the greatest degree of accuracy and justnef and those even well verse in painting will find many hint by it to perfect they in this art thus far we have shew how any personmay copy draught print or piece of painting or even make a exact representation from the life but we shall yet add two other method both easy and entertaining not hitherto mentioned for taking of draught or drawing which be as follow prick with pin the qutline of the print or draw you design to copy and then lay the sanie on sheet of paper take powderpuff or tuft of cotton dip it now and then in charcoaldust and beat it over the pricked line through the picture by which mean you shall have full direction mark on you cloth or paper sufficient to finish just draw the other way be by make such a impression from the print as shall give ajust copy of it and it be of great use when we want to carry every stroke of the engraver along with we which method if you be very careful will indeed but very little sully the print for this end take some white or green soap whien mix with such quantity of water as will bring it to the consistence of jelly with this mixture rub the print and with wet sponge gently wet the paper design for receive the impression then lay it on the print cover all with two or three other picce of dry paper and rub it very hard all over with any thing that be will have uponit the reverse of the print you rub it upon with every distinct line in the original if you have be careful to rubitequally chap xiv secretss for copying of drawing continue als for takingoff medal various way with several other curious precept for the use of painter statuary founder to take draw with fix ink take thin sheet of paper and rub it all over with fresh butter as equally as possiblé then dry it well by the fire and rub the butter . de with either carmine lampblack blackleadpowder or blue bice finely ground till it be all equally coloured take care in rub on any of these that the colour will not come off by very slight touch of the finger then lay the colour side of this butter paper upon piece of clean paper and lay the print you design to copy upon the butter paper afterwards with fine pin or needle blunt little at the point trace the outline of the draw carefully by on you white paper which may be touch afterwards with crayon or the like colour ii to take the impression of print with redink mix some vermilion finely ground with linseedoil but not so much but what it shall still be liquid enough to run or slow in pen with this trace the line of you print and then with sponge dipt in water wet the backside of the print and turn the print side down upon piece of white paper so as to lie smooth then lay over part and the lower white paper will receive the imprefsion but if you have à linnenpress it be better to put you papers between two of the leave and screw the pref as tight as you can by which mean you will have fine impressioniii to take draught wvriting with red loose ink take some vermilion finely ground and mix it with fair water in gallipot with some cotton in it so as that it may run very free in the pen with this mixture draw over all the stroke of you print imitate both the siner and stronger line then with sponge dipt in gum watar wet piece of clean white paper and while it be wet turn the print upon it and press it well take off the print and you will sind all the stroke remain on the clean paper and as soon as it be dry the vermilion will be fix to it this sort of ink have be use frequently in wiit any thing design to be engrave for by turn the writing side of the paper down upon copperplate cover with beewax and wnite ground rub it very equally the impression will be upon the wax take draught with blue loose ink vou may likewise make such fort of ink wirh blue bice and common water as will run very fineiy in pen and serve for the same use as the former ink the take off draw in stand red colour by trace take vermilion finely ground and mixing it with little fresh butter rub clean sheet of paper on one side with this mixture so that it may bear à slight touch of the finger without leave the paper then lay the coloured side of this paper upon clean sheet lay you print upon the other side of the coloured paper and then trace every line you think proper as already direct in trace draught with six ink but be sure to pin the thice papers togethe at the corner to prevent they stip which would inevitably spoil you work this impression make by trace will hold without rub or press the papers the quill of swallow after they be thoroughly dry be havery good for trace by mixing carmine with some freshi butter and colour paper with it in the same manner you will obtain more beautiful colour and by colour paper in like manner witn blue bice and butter you may have the draw blue vi to take the natural or lively shape of any herb or tree first take the leaf you would copy and goly rub the vein on the backside of it with piece of lvory or some such like matter so as to bruise they little afterwards wet the same side gently with linseedoil and then press it hard upon piece of white paper and you shall have the perfect figure of the leaf with every vein in it justly express this imprefsion be afterwards coloured will seem truly natural and may be useful to such as would remember plant vii another way of painting the leave of plant so that the impression shall appear as black as if it have be do in à printingpref be as follow when the leaf be dry take such ball as the pressmen use for black the type and rub it equally over with printer s ink strike it gently all the vein be black with the ink then lay the leaf on flat board or the like with he backside upwards clap piece of white paper well moisten on the leaf and press it pretty hard but not so as to bruise the fibre you shall have fine impression but this may still be do to greater advantage by means of piece of wood in the form of cylinder about foot long and a inch and half diameter the middle part about six or eight inch long be cover with wooll cloth roll three or four time round it with thistime backward and forward and you will but where printerink be not conveniently come at the follow method may be make ufe of rub the back of the leaf as before direct with burnt linseedoil then strew some powder of black lead or for want of that some charcoal or smallcoaldust or the powder of burnt cork upon fmooth board so as equally to cover it stroke the powder gently over and oil the backside of the leaf clap it upon the board and then lay the white paper upon the back of the leaf press or roll it as before if none of these ingredient be conveniently have take vermilion and mixing it with fresh butter to the consistence of printerink cover you printing ball with it dawb it over the back of the leaf and take you impreffion as before where vermilion be use bice may afso be make use of either with butteror oil by grind blue bice with some burnt linseedoil and useing it as before thus you may have fine red or blue ink proper for impression of this sort but the blue be preferable in colour leave be¬ cause it be a agreeable colour for the green sort it may be observe that the reason why the back of the leaf be the proper side to make the impression from be because the rib or vessel rise on that side above the fleshy part of it and therefore be coloured with any of those ink they be the fittest to give a impression whereas in the foreside of the leaf the fleshy part rise and these fine fibre be sunk between they viii to take off the leaveso plant in plaister of paris so as that they may afterwards be cest in metal those person who cast in metal have bequent occasion touse leave of several sort in order to embellisn they work these be generally make from model doby the hand which take up great deal of time and even at last be imperfect but the follow way which be communicate by gentleman from itoly be greatly preferable and much easier soon after you have crop the leaf you desire to take a impression from lay it between the leave of abook till once it shall lie flat then upon smooth board with strong gumwater make of gumarabic fix the foreside or front of the leaf to the broad when this be do raise round it little wall of coarse paste half a inch high or if you can conveniently surround you piece of wood with pasteboard or cardpaper so close as that it shall hold liquid for some time then oil the back of you leaf as direct below in the method for casting of medal and pour on water and plaister of paris as be there direct which when it be dry will give you a exact impression of everyvein of the leaf and from which you may easily make mould to cast in as you fancy a expeditious method of take the impression of any butterfly in all its colour have take buttersly kill it without spoiling the wing which contrive to spread as regularly as possible in fly position then with small brush or pencil take piece of white paper wasn part of it with gum water little thicker than ordinary so that it may easily dry afterwards lay you buttersly on the paper cut off the body close to the wing and throw it away lay the paper on fmooth board with the fly upwards and lay another paper aver that put the whole preparation into screwpress and serew it down very hard or otherwise prefsit let it remain under that pressure for the space of a hour afterwards take off the wing of the buttersly and you will find perfect impresion of they with all they various colour mnark ed distinctly remain upon the paper when this be do draw between the wing of you impresion the body of the butterfly and colour you draught of the body after the life to take off the impression of medrl this may be of use to such as would preserve to themselves good specimen or fine draught of curious medal especially as it be easily execute and with but trifling expence one way be as follow take isinglaf and break it in piece dissolve as much of it as be necessary over the fire in quantity of water sufficient only to cover it take care to keep it stir till the whole be dissolve this do with hairbrushi stroke some of the glue over the medal whose impression you would take after place they as horizontally as you can and when you have cover they perfectly all over let they lie till the glue be harden and afterwards with the point of pin or needle raise the edge of the glue from each medal and the whole impression of the medal in glue will sly off as hard as horn with all the fine sharpness of the medal as it be strike this glue may be make of whatever colour you please by mixing the colour in the water the glue be boil in the impression must be dry immediately but very regularly and not in hot sun nor in any damp place if you use isinglass without any colour mixedt with the water you may as soon as you take the impression srom the medal breathe gently on the concave side of they and then lay they upon the thickest sort of leaf gold which will stick to they and by fhine through the isinglass will appear like gold medal but if we would imitate coppermedal we should mix carmine with the water that we dissolve we isinglass in although water may do very well for dissolving the isinglass in for this purpose yet brandy or spirit of wine will give the glue à much greater strength so as not to be subject to soften in damp air x i to take the impression of large medal first rub the medal gently over with tuft of sine cotton moisten or grease with sweetoil then have some melt brimstone enough to cover the medal half a inch thick put hoop of cardpaper round the edge of it and pour the melt brimstone on it but not too hot as soon as it be fix and harden take off the hoop of paper and the impression on the brimstone will come clean from the medal which shall serve for sharp and correct mould wherein you may cast another with plaister of paris but brimstone should not be use on silvermedal because it will effectually change they colour therefore to take silvermedal off bind they round after oil they with hoop of some stiff paper as before and mixing alittle plaister of paris with water sill the hoop with it then immediately sill the case in sprinkling manner with the same plaister till it harden and when it turn dry take it off from the medal but from those mould cast in brimstone that be concave you must igain cast such medal in plaister of pa re and they will be convex oil the mould and use the plaister of paris as beforé by this method you may take off any medal or sine bassrelief with great exactnef even so as to form medal from they in any fort of metal x ii another way of take off mrdalsis as follow procure some thin piece of lead and place the medal horizontally on the top of firm post or any steady place lay piece of harder metal flat over the lead and place piece of round turn stick over that such as be use in the staff of housebrushi see off about five or six inch in length and hold that tight with the left hand on the lead and flat piece of metal strike the top of the stick smart blow with large hammer and it will give the lead perfect impression of the image of the medal but this must be do by one single blow to render the impression perfect xiii various way of take off medrl take the shaving of paper and boiling they till they be tender pound . they well in mortar so as to reduce they into paste then boil they again in springwater with little gumarabic let this mixture standsome time to settle then pour off the water strain it through sieve or linnencloth and the remain part of this mixture will be a excellent ingredient either to press into any mould or upon any medal for when the paste be dry it will come off very sharp some medal that be underwrought can not be take off this way therefore in such case you should take common glue and melt it six hoop of pasteboard round the edge of the medal and pour on the glue hot the medal have be first oil with tuft of grease cotton when the glue be dry and hard take off the hoop and the glue will sly off from the edge and it will as be subject to bend and give way which the thing formerly mention be not come very easily off but the glue ought to be make strong and should be pour on one third part of a inch thick when a impression have be take by this means you must then hoop you mould of glue with either cardpaper or pasteboard as before direct take care to oil it so that no bubble or blister may be see then you may cast you plaister of paris in it and you will obtain by these means good copy of the medal when this be dry the glue will sly off or may be break off and there will remain good pattern to cast from also putty may be make of linseedoil and fineground starch which be well work together into paste will take good imprefsion from any medal by means of these mould you may cast good medal of beewax but they will come offmuch sharper if the mould be in brimstone than if it be in plaister of paris but then you wax should be as well blanch or whiten as if it be use for waxcandle however it will be necessary to grease the mould before the wax be pour in and though white wax be here recommend yet it will not be best that the copy of the medal be white because the darker colour shew the medal much better if you would have you copy of red colour mix vermilion with the wax while it be melt and if you would have it blue put in stoneblue well beaten or ground into the melt wax as soon as these waxmedal be cold enough to take off you should lay some leafgold upon they press it down gently with piece of cotton without rub it backward and forward and that will gold vour medal when you cast medal in plaister of paris to make they look like steel or metal rub they over with tuft of cotton lightly grease with oil then strew over they some powder of black lead rub they well with such brushi as be use for the tooth till the whole be equally cover and this will give they fine metalgloss you may make these Idal in plaister of paris look like box by boiling they in linseed oil and this will harden they to such degree as to bear the brush to clean they when they turn foul or dirty if you would have these medal look of yellow colour boil little pearl ashy in pint of water till it make strong lixivium then put in half quarter of pint of frenchberry boil this till the liquor be of strong yellow and use it with you plaister of paris instead of common water if you would have the medal look green the fine transparent gum of verdegrease mix with the plaister of paris will give they that colour and for à silvercolour leafsilver or tinfoil may be use in the same manner as the leafgold for the goldcolour for the coppercolour german leafcopper may be use xiv to take off impression in plaister of paris from copperplate oil the plate à little and bind they about either with card or other pasteboard paper pour on they some of the finest plaister of paris and water and finish the work with plaister till it become dry and harden you will have fine imprefsion or draught of the line on the plate in the plaister which you may make use of to draw from as you may have occasion xv to take off the fine engraving from watchcase snuffbox hold they over the smoke of candle till they be quite black then wipe off the black with the soft part of the palm of you hand lay piece of white paper little wet with sponge over the engraving and over that clap thin piece of flannel or brown paper press down very hard which be rub the paper next the picture will obtain as fine a impression as if it have pass through rollpress the doctrine of watercolour for illuminatin in the best manner chap of colour in general olour be to bedistinguissied as follow cthe first be the white colour next the yellow next the orange then the red after that the purple afterwards the blue and lastly the black it be to be observe that white and black be the extreme of colour yellow be the lesser point of colour towards the white the next to that be the green and after it the blue with regard to the colour of print if the paper be pure white you be to use no colour on it unless in the shade part and then in painting of flower if they tend towards reddisn colour you be to use faint colour of carmine with gum¬ water upon the shade only if bluish use littie faint indigo in gumwater slightly pass over the shade easily touch upon the light where there beyellow tinge either use faint tincture of gamboge or of frenchberry which will be describe among the yelliow or if the white have purplish cast use thin cake on the shady side suffer the colour only to shine little into the light which will give lustre to the white and if greenisn cast should be there use very faint colour of the sapgreen or in proportion of the sapgreen mix with the verdigreasegreen all these colour mention for shad the white may be find in the follow direction chap ii white for painting in miniature he best white sell for painting in watercolour be flakewhite this be better than white lead ground and if it be pure far exceed it in beauty because the white lead be aptto turn blackish especially if it be use in hard water but some recommend white make of pearl and oystershell reduce intoan impalpable pow ¬ der so foft as to feel like grounds of starch or hairpowder this be by some call pearlwhite and will mix well with any colour but if you use white lead first rectify it with whitewine vinegar which cause fermentation the white will soon settle after which pour off the vinegar and wasn the white with common water the method of wash it be thus put the powder into glass of water stir it about and presently pour off the water whileit be white into some other clean glass or vessel then let it settle pour off the water from it and you shall have a excellent white to which when it be settle you be to put as much gumwater as be necessary to give it glaze it be observable that white lead will turn black if mix with water that come from iron or clay that be in the space of month or two you may perceive those place where it lie thickest ting with black and if it be mix with any other colour it will soon change or alter it some recommend the powder of eggshell of the brightest colour and well clean andi wash as very good to be ground with gumwater or you may put twentieth part of clean white sugar candy to grind with it in water it must be ground as fine as possible that be to the state of a impalpable powder and then use it some say it be better if rectify spirit of wine be pour on it which will clear it from any dross that may be in it this it be probable must be pour off when the spirit of wine have do it be work and then the part leave behind must be mix with gum water again but it have be find by experience that eggshell powder be of very great service as white in watercolour and that itself and the oystershell powder well rectify and mix with the white of a egg well beaten will make a extraordinary mixture in other colour and will correct they from changingor alter they quality as to white for illuminating of print the clear white of the paper be to be leave uncoloured and if it happen that the paper be apt to sink or to spread any watercolour that be lay upon it more than be necessary then the way to correctit be as follow fix thepaper in such station as that it may only receive the colour you lay on to glaze just as far as you design it then take some starch boil and prepare in water of middle strength and with large paintingbrush stroke it over the black of the print and after it have be well dry in the air or sun put the print in book with weight upon it to take out the crumpling which it may receive by wet of it and thus will any print be render fit to receive watercolour which will be prevent from run further than one would have they fine white for watercolour be make by dissolve filing of sine silver or silverleaf in aqua fortis then evaporate the aquafortis till it look like chrystal in the bottom of the glass decant the other part of the aquafortis and wash the silver five or six time in common water till it be freed from the aquafortis which may be know by taste it then dry it for use it must be use with gumwater and little water of sugarcandy a incomparable fine white leadcolour be make by grind choice white lead well upon porphyry with vinegar so that it turn blackish then take pot full of water and wafh the white lead in it very well let it settle and pouring off the water grind it again with vinegar repeat this once or twice more and you will have a excellent white both for watercolour and painting in oil the make good white for the ground for water or oil colour proper in miniature take pound of glover s clipping put they some time to steep in water then boiling they in kettle with twelve quart of water till it sink to two strain it through linnen cloth into new earthen pan this be call gloveglue or size and to know whether it be strong enough it be only necessary to tzy when it be cold and have get it be consistence whether it be stiff and firm under the hand the glue be make take white chalk and reduce it to powder and melt the glue while it be hot put such quantity of white init as to make it so thick as pap then leave it to steep for quarter of a hour stiritabout with bristlebrush then take some of this white put more glue to it in order to make it brighter for the first or second lay this must be apply by beat with the end of the brush mind that you let every lay dry well before you put on another if it be wood you work on you must put on dozen but if it be thick paper six or seven be sufficient this do take water and dip soft brush in it and draining it with you finger rub the work with it in order to render it the smoother when you brush be full of white you must wash it again and also change the water when it be too white you may likewise sometimes make use of wet linnenrag instead of brusni you work be very even let it dry and when it be so rub it with shavegraf or à bit of new linnencloth to make it soft and free chap iii of yellow here be some object which have the appearance of gold shine through the colour of green red or blue such as some fort of fly and beetle and the cantharide this golden transparency be very well imitate by laying sonie goldleaf on the shade part of the draw give in little to the light side of the print the way of lay on the goldleaf be by wash the part where the gold be to be with dry by lay on the gold as smooth and even as pofsible press it down close with cotton but in do this care must be take that in lay on the gum water you do not exceed the limit you would have the gold appear to shine in this case the gold be toshineonly through the transpa¬ rent colour which be to be lay on it must be observe that the goldleaf will not receive watercolour regularly and for that reason it must be stroke over with little thin liquor of oxgall in painting brush of camel s hair by which mean it will receive any colour that you have mind to paint upon it and will hold it the green may be first the verdegreasegreen or sapgreen which colour should be de¬ scribe in they place the red may be lake or carmine the purple lake and fine indigo or carmine and indigo and for the bly indigo on the dark side and on the light little stroke of uitramarineblue just to shine into the light which will have a admirable effect there may be find upon rise tree in june and juiy kind of beetle of gold and green colour which may serve for direction in this kind of painting but if gold itself be use it will be best to polish it which may be do in the follow manner there may be see in some manuscript fine golden letter which rise above the surface of the vellum or paper the composition that raise they thus be say to be make up of vermilion and the white of a egg whisk or beaten up to the consistence of a oil and work together like kind of paste and with stamp fix to the vellum or paper with gumarabic on this figure of letter wash some strong gumwater with pencil of camel s hair observe that the gum do not reach more than the outline then lay on the gold leaf close with some cotton and be dry rub it with some dry cotton and then polish it with dog tooth this will make it appear as if it be really cast in gold there be besides this another way of work in gold and that be perform by shellgold but then it must be pure gold and not that bring from germany which turn green in few day time time before you use this gold cover the fhrady part with vermilion and after you gold have be well rectify with spirit of wine lay it on with gum water which will readily mix with it and when it be dry polisn it with dog s tooth in lay on gold it will be best to leave the light without it because it will make much brighterappearance than if the object be covered all over with it but if by accident or otherwise the whole piece happen to be cover with gold there be no better way to set it off than by trace over the shady part with gallstone or what be much preferable the yellow make of frenchberry the composition of which be treat of belowbut it be the deepest that be to be use in thisway little minium heighten it very much how the minium be to be rectify may be learn among the red observe to polisn the gold before you use the minium on it after this colour of the gold the vellow shall be treat of as they fail gradually in they strength the first yellow be kind of strawcolour and be make of flour of brimstone which of itself be fine enough to mix with gum water commonway of illuminating print be by give the tincture of gamboge for yellow and this may be of two or three fort either fainter or stronger the last to be shade to the first and to be shade with the preparation of frenchberry mo . boyle say that if the root of barberrie be cut and put into à lixivium make strong with with water and pearlasn there will be fine try succeed very well he likewise propose anotherway for make transparent yellow which be by boiling the root of mulberrytree wash well from the earth in strong lixivium of pearlash and water this will afford yellowisn juice from which may be extract tincture much deeper than the former yellow oker will likewise make another good pale yellow but it be colour rather of too much body for illuminating of print yet after it have be well wash the plant celandine will afford another good yellow by infusingit in water and press it goly and then boiling theliquor with little alum this yellow will ineline somewhat to green but yellow which some prefer to the rest and may be use in several capacity of light be one make of frenèhberry and prepare as follow boil two ounce of frenchberry in quart of lixivum make of pearlashy and water till the liquor give fine tinge of yellow to bit of paper dip in it and then pour it off fromthe berry let the liquor cool and bottle it up for use then again put pint of the same lixivium to the berry and boil they till the liquor be as deepcoloured as gallstone and this will be fit for the shade of any fort of yellow you can use this may be boil tifl it produce brown colour and will with little oxgall serve to shade any leafgold that be lay on paper and be much preferable to gallstone in imitate any goldcolour and it answer well upon tincture of gamboge or any of the former yellow next to this may be reckone the tincture of saffron in common water only which afford bright reddish yellow such as would be require for a orangecolour in cover the shadow part of print and when saffron be infuse in rectify spirit of wine there be nothing higher but then it will sly unless it be load with gumarabic as for deep yellow with body dutch pink come the nearest of any to the foremention strong yellow make of frenchberry in point of colour but the english pink which be still make of frenchberry be of lighter yellow also good yellow colour for illuminating print may be extract from the root of ginger and with transparent verdegrease it make fine green it be to be observe that the englisn and dutch yellow pink be make with frenchberry ground to sine powder and boil chap iv of orangecolour a orangecolour for wash print be make by lay on teint of gamboge and over that some minium or red lead wash and rendered sine and fit for use it not be fine enough to paint with as it be buy at the shop and besides it will change or turn black in few week if it be not refine but be well prepared it will be very lasting and beautiful but this you must take notice of that a ounce will not produce above twenty grain of good colour to stand the test of painter this colour may be mix with gamboge upon white dutch tile to render it of the teint you would have it either softer or stronger or else the gamboge may be glaze over and strengthen with the tincture of saffron which will make it glare into strong orange chap of minium the brightest red lead the manner of prepare it ahe minium or red lead be as heavy and strong colour as most we have and prepare be the most beautiful one when it be well wash and cleanse of its more weighty part which cause it to turn black mo . boyle direct the prepare or cleansing it in the follow manner put four ounce of it in quart of rainwater then stir it pour off the water immediately and let it settle to the bottom of every cup or glass you pour it into then pour off that water in day s time you will have the colour dry and as fine as can be desire afterwards put little gumarabic into each glass or cup and as much water as will moisten each of they any of these may be afterwards use with gumwater but if the gum you put in itat first make it strong enough to glaze it then you need only add to it common water and accord as you colour be less or more gum use less or more gumwater for it be of itself dead colour when you use this colour touch it gently on the yellow abovemention that be make of the ycllow berry into the light side and if it want shade you may put à little vermilion upon it but vermilion be too heavy to paint with when you would illuminate you print because it hide the shade of the engrave though sometimes they have better be hide than appear some generally shade this minium with carmine which give it sine effect and render it equal to the brightest red flower that be to be see leave still the light uncoloured only dafh little way into the light with the minium when the carmine have shade the minium it may be shade again with lake in the strongest part to bring it to deeperred chap vi of other red scarletred scarlet may be represent on plane with minium little mix with vermilion but if you have occasion to paint flower of scarletcolour on print let you light as well as shade be cover thin with minium and the shade part glaze with carmine which will produce a admirable scarlet such as be see in the flower scarlet martagon crimsonred crimsoncolour be represent with carmine but it be necessary that the buyer be inform that there be several sort of it some darker and some much coarser than other therefore it should never be buy by candlelight unless of such as person can confide in for between the best and the worst there be ten shilling a ounce difference nay indeed all the money that a ounce will cost because bad carmine will but spoil the work next after crimson come lake which be of use in shad and heighten carmine but it must be observe that in lay of carmine upon print you must touch yourlight only with such thinteint of it as can scarcely be observe lay it on strong just on that part of the light which enter upon the shade and afterwards lay some lake on the stronger part of the shade lake be to be have in most colourshop ready pregare in shell for watercolour to make fine lake take half pound of good brazil and boiling it in three pint of ley make with the asn of vinetwig till half the ley be evaporate let it settle and then strain it which do boil it again with fresh brasil quarter of pound cochineal two ounce and terra marita half a ounce add pint of fair water let this boil till it be half evaporate as before then set it by to settle and strain it but when you take it off the fire remember to put in a half ounce of calcine alum reduce to a impalpable powder and dissolve it by stir it about with stick add quarter in order to give it body reduce two cuttlefisn bone to very sine powder and put in the powder let it dry up at leisure then grind it with good quantity of fair water in which leave it to steep and afterwards strain it through cloth and make it up into fewtablet or cake set it to dry on card or pasteboard if you would have this lake redder add lemonjuice and if you would make it deeper add oil of tartar another lake may be make as follow boil shaving or shearing of scarlet in ley of the ashy of burnt tartar this ley have the pro perty of separate the dye from the scarlet shred when it have boil enough take it off and put in cochineal powder mastic and rochalum boil the whole again and while it be quite hot strain it two orthree time through fine bag thefirst time the bag must be squeezed with two stick from the top to the bottom then the gross matter remain be take out of the bag wash it well after this paf the liquor you express with the stick through the bag again and you will find paste stick to the side of the bag which you may either spread upon pasteboard or divide into small parcel upon paper and set it aside to dry to make lakecolumbine steep half pound of the finest brazilwood of fernambuca rasp in three pint of the finest distilled vinegar for at least month the longer the better after which seethe the whole in balneo mariae till it boil up three of four time let it settlé for day or two after this prepare fourth part of powdered alum and put it in clean earthen pan strain the liquor upon the alum and so let it remain for day afterwards heat the whole again till the liquor simmer and let it settle twentyfour hour then reduce two cuttlefishbone intopowder and have warm the liquor pour it in upon they and stir it about with stick till it be cold and leave it again for twentyfour hour before you strain it kemember that it must be first strain upon the alum before it be pourod upon the cuttlefishbone but à liquid colour not much inferior to carmine itself may be make of the rasping of brasilwood this colour be the transparent crimson and be make as follow boil a ounce of the rasping of brasilwood sell at the drysalterand at some colourshop in twelve qunce of pale stale beer and little alum till the colour of the liquor be as strong as you please which may be discover by dip slip of white paper into it when this colour be as you would have it pass it when cool into linnencloth and bottle it up for use and if you would bring this colour to à body take oxblood and dry it till it can be reduce to powder which be do mix it with the liquor and it will communicate colour to it little inferior to middle carmine some saythat the blood of a ox or cow dry will make good body for any colour crimsan colour from mo . boyle take the fruit of the berry bear spinach which be press will yield beautiful redcolour juice boil this add fourth part of alum to it then let it cool put it up for use the red beetroot bake with little strong vinegar produce a elegant redcoleur equal toa tincture of carmine then pour it on alum and it be fit for use where carmine should be use in wash print for it be à fine transparent red another grimson colour for wasn print be prépare as follous put thirty or forty grain of bruise cochineal into gallipot with as many drep of tartarley as will just wet it and make it give forth it be colour then immediately add to this . xture half spoonful of water or more if the colour be¬ still toadzep vou will have delicate purpleliquor or tincture then take bit of alum scrape very finely with knise small quantity of it into the tincture and this will take away the puiple colaur and make it delicate tincture strain it through fine cloth into clean gallipot and use it as soon as you can becausethis be à colcur that will always look exquisitely sine if it becon make use of but will decay if it stand lolg indian red next to these be the indian red which though it be colour of body yet be useful for back ground for flower at distance when use with gum water there be also a earth bring from the isle of wight which have be find to mix extremely well with gum water though be of viscous nature it require less gum than most other colour and as it be naturally fit for use without grind and be viscous so it will no doubt mix with oil as well as with water there be one thing very extraordinary in this earth which be that if you rub dealboard with it it will make the board exactly of tha colour of mahoganywood and stain it so deep and with so much strength that it be hard to get it out with wash chap vii .. of purple fine transparent purple may be make either redder or nearer the blue as you would have it by boiling four ounce of rasp brazilwood in pint of stale beer with half a ounce of logwood or campeachywood till the liquor be heighten to the colour you desire which maybe know by dip piece of paper in it if you find it too red add a ounce of logwood to the brafilwood which will make it much nearmethod you may humour it to any degree of purple by put in either more or less logwood to the fornier composition and fix the colour with alum this will produce such clear purple as no mixture of solid red and bly will do and the receipt have be for long time keep secret it be say that the best purple colour that can be make may be compose between the carmine and indigo to strengthen which on the red side you may add lake between the lighter and darker part and so lake when it be use in the same way on the forego purple or the liquid criinson produce very fine effect the colour may be varied and make either redder by put more carmine or bluer by use more indigo which be mix on white dutch tile will shew itself fine purplecolour may be make of the grof part or sediment of lakecolumbine both for oil and watercolour as follow take the sediment of lakecolumbine which fall to the bottom of the vial in which be the bone of the cutilefisn let it dry and grind it there will be no lake so fine as this and if you mix it with lake it will give it berter body besides more srength and vigour chap viii of blue he uitramarineblue be not only the first but the best sort of bright blue we have as it give spirit to all painting where bly be use this colour be make from the lapis lazuli divest of its gold and ground into a impalpa¬ ble powder which be do as follow take half pound of lapis lazuli and put it upon redhot coal let it stay there until it be redhot then quenchingit in very strong vinegar and grind it upon porpliry or any such hard stone with rectify brandy to a impalpable powder make apastil with which the lapis be to be incorporate for the making of this pastil take beewax turpentine rosin andlinseedoil of each quarter of apound and melt the whole together over slow fire when it begin toboil pour it into glaze pot this be the paste of ultramarine take of this paste quantity equal to that of the lapis kncad they together upon the marble and be well incorporate tthem remain for one night after which to bring out the uitramarine that be in the paste pour clean water upon it and knead it with you hand as paste be knead and the ultramarine will come out for the receive ofwhich place porringer or other proper vessel under you hand and let it settle in this water till you sce the uitramarine at the bottom of it ifyout colour seem to be clammy or nasty you may correct it thus add theretotartar disselve in water as much as will drow it and let it rest for one day at least then wasn it in warm water and you will by that means have it correct and well purify ultramarine must be choose of high colour and well ground which may be know by put lt between the tooth for if it feel gritty it be sign that it have not be well ground to know whether it be pure and unmixed pat little of it into crucible and heating it redhot if the powder doc not change it be colour after trial it be certaisly pure but on the contrary if there be any change or black speck in it then it have be adulterate the prussian blue be next to ultramarine in eeapty if it be use in oil though it be not agree on whether it will hold so well as the other particularly as not have the body of the ultramarinethe prussian blue do not grind well in water because there be such a oily quality in it that it do not mix kindly with water and at the best will change as it be now prepare in the common way attempt have be make to make it blue ink which indeed have hold the colour for month or two but then turn to muddy yellow and when you put you pencil with gumwater into shell of this blue you will find that where the water spread the blue will turn yellowish till the bedy of the colour be well stir up and after all that can be do with this colour in water it will only serve to shade ultramarine with but in oil it may serve very well for the present to supply the place of ultramarine bluebice be colour of good brightnef and be the next to the prussian blue it be also colour of good body and will flow pretty well in the pencil especially if it be well wash as be direct to be do of the white and minium saunderblue be also of very good use and may serve as shade to ultramarine or the biuebice where the shade be not require to be very deep and be of itself pleasant blue to be laybetween the light and shade of such flower as be of mazarineblue the lacmus or litmusblue be another beautiful colour and will run in pen as free as ink be make of lacmus or as some term it litmus which be sell at miost druggistshop but as this colour be never to be meet with prepared for watercolour we therefore shall give the foliow method of prepare it accord to mrs . mariana take a ounce of lacmus and boil it in about pint of small beerwort till the colour be as strong as you would have it then pour off the liquor into gallipot and let it cool for use it will soon become jelly and by degree will grow hard but this colour be to be open again and make liquid by water so as to be wein ink anà will be either paler or darker as it be make tnicker or tiinner this afford bright we and he extraord inary effect for it be not onlya pearitral but hold colour this colour if it be touch with aquafortis immediately change into fine crimson little inferior to carmine and sink quite through the paper so as not to be get out so that when it be use às blue it be best to keep it from aquafortis or such strong acid it be good shade for ultramarine or bluebice where the strongest shade should not be extremely deep and for colour of print it be very good as it be transparent colour and go great way indigoblue make the strongest shade for bly of any other and be soft warm colour when it have be well ground and wash with gum water by means of stone and muller it be make of what lightness you please by put more gumwater to it and by how much the less gumwater be put to it the darker it will be to try it upon dutch tile for it run warmly in the pencil and so perhaps may otherwise prove too strong for you design which be alway to be take care of when slow colour be to be lay over the dark shade of print which shade will much heighten it s black ness and even make it appear quite black sine blue from mo . boyle take of the blue leave of rue and beat they little in stonemortar with wooden pestle infuse they in water juice and all for fourteen day or more wash they every day till they be rotten and at last beat they and the water together till they become pulp and let they dry in the sun this will produce as good bluc as indigo and be much softer but in order to keep it à long time when you beat it the last time add little powder of gum arabic to it of which you may put more or less as you would have it more free or tenacious in the working this be a excellent blue for shad have good body and ruiis warm in the pencil transparent blue from mo . boyle equal to ultramarine this be beautiful blue the chief ingredientof which be the cyanus or blue cornbottleflower this flower have two bly in it onc of pale colour in the larger outward leave the other of deeper colour in the inner leave or middie of the flower both these will do be separate from the button and case they grow in but the deep blue leave in the middle produce by much the best colour this may be observe by rub the leave while they be fresn so hard upon picce of good writing paper as to press out the juice which will yield a excellean colour that will not fade for several year tniis part of the flower beerefore the principal and what may be depend on and should be pick from the rest of the flowerleave the same day it be gather or as soon afterwards as possibly can be good quantity of thcse middleleave be procure press out what juice you can from they and add little alum to it you will have last transparent blue of as bright standing colour as can be desire scarce inferior in beauty to uitramarine and very durable as for the outward flowerleave which be much paler it be not certain that they will answer the end but some trial may be make whereby that may be know also let the flower be gather about the beginning of june or in july or august but the preparation of the colour by pick out the middle deep blue flowerleave and press out the juice must be do with all the expedition possible or else they will lose they perfection it be probable that if the leave of these blue cornbottleflower be cure in the same manner as saffron be they would produce much greater body of colour fromwhich tincture mnight be draw with more ease than if press raw or fresn from the field in order to do this such kiln must be prepared as be use for cure of saffron in which may be make small charcoalfire that may communi¬ cate heat to the top of the kiln which be to be cover with haircloth upon this should be lay four or five sheet of white paper such as be use in cure of affron afterwards parcel of the pick flower be to be lay on to the thickniess of two or three inch lay they close and slat with knife and sprinkling they with some gumwater then the cake of flower be to be cover with two or three sheet of paper and board with fmall weight lay on for few minute after which the board be to be take off and the cake of flower to be turn on the kiln take hold of all the papers with both hand and when it have be rightly place take off the upper papers and sprinkle the cake second time with some gumwater then settle the cake again with knife let the papers be lay on as before with the board and weight for minute or two after which let the papers be turn again and again till the cake of flower become united and of the thickness of cake of saffron in this operation you will find the flower grow darker and darker every time they be turned till at length the cake will look of deep blue tend to black from whence tincture may be easily draw during this operation great care should be take that the fire do not scorch the flower but that it be as constant and gentle as possible which will be sure way to bring the cake to good colour but it will not be improper for any person who shall undertake the cure of this colour to consult the method of cure saffron of which they may be inform either in treatise of the method of cure saffron write by mo . dowglas or in another by mo . bradley in he monthly trcatise of husbandry and gardening chap ix of black the proper black for watercolour be ivoryblack which if pure and well ground be of use in painting in miniature but it be not proper for colour print be too heavy colour and hide the beautiful stroke of the graver unless do with great care however if it be necessary to use black for darkening aprint rather choose strong tincture of good india ink than the lvoryblack but to colour piece in miniature use the lvoryblack prepare as follow grind the lvoryblack well in gumwater till youperceive kind of oilyliquor settle to the bottom this liquor mix with as much of the lvory black as you think will be proper to make it flow freely in the pencil and it will bear a extraordinary gloss and if the object bethine such as the wing of some beetle mix with some of it à little white upon dutch glaze tile till you find it light enough to receive the shade andthen make another lighter mixture of the same which be use on the brighter part of the subject will produce the effect you desire chap of green green be allow by all to depend upon the yellow and blue and any green colour whatever you please may be make with they gamboge be one of the first yellow which may be make to produce five or six green with verdegrease accord as the gamboge be in the greater or lesser proportion if it abound it will make tolerable oakgreen and be mix with greater quantity of verdegrease it will make fine grassgreen but the yellow which some prefer before all other be make of frenchberry as already describe under the yellow which be either deeper or fainter as the liquor they be boil in be more or less stain with they if it be very thin it make good glaze all over the verdegrease and as it approach nearer to dutchpink or gallstone command almost any colour we want be agreeably mix with the transpa¬ rent verdegrease and be still transparent in like manner yellow draw from the root of barberry and also that droy from the root of the mulberrytree will in agreat measure produce the like effect be mix with the transparent verdegrease as for the verdegrease itself it produce fine bluisn green flow easy in the pencil and may even serve as a ink to write with the way of prepare the transparent verdegrease be as follow take six ounce of com¬ mon verdegrease the distilled verdegrease not answer this purpose so well break it into little piece and boil it gently in quart of whitewinevinegar keep it continually stir and when you perceive it to boil add little tartar break and continue still to stir it till youfind the liquor of such colour as you would have it that be till it be of fine transparent green with bluishi cast which you may know by dipping in bit of white paper then pour it through linnencloth into a open vessel and set it to cool and when it be quite cold bottle it up for use remember to cork the bottle close for be expose to the air it will dry however it may be reduce again by common water this liquor should be touch upon part of the light and shade of print and the shade afterwards coloured with sapgreen in the making of this green remember that it be strong enough because it can not be strengthned afterwards without the trouble of boiling it afresh but may at any time be render as faint as you please by mixing common water with it sapgreen be colour like that of a oakleaf if . it be use thin with common water for this as well as the formerwant no gum but if it be use strong it will produce as dark green as any it will be proper to try the colour first upon awhite dutch tile andby thinningit with water vou may render it of what strength you please and may brighten it very much by the addition of very little verdegrease there be twoways of make sapgreen viz first take the flower of blue flagiris or flower de luce and press they while there be any juice to be get from they boil this gently in glaze pipkin till it grow thick add à little alum to it and it will make very useful and last green you must observe this that in the boiling of any juice of the colour before mention you should always do it in a earthen pipkin for if it be boil in vessel of metal they will oftentime change it from the colour intend the second way to make sapgreen for the wash and illuminating of print be to take the juice of buckthornberry and though that juice simply will yield only dark purple of very bafe hue yet either of these colour will mix with the liquid verdegrease abovemention and will make delicate shade for it there be besides these another green which be admire by some person that carry good body with it and degree of transparency too as it may be make but as it be commonly use be à colour of full body and fit only for painting in miniature this be make by mixing dutch pink with indigo to what degree of colour you please but the high preparation of frenchberry with indigo be much to be prefer to dutch pink especially as this answer all the intention of dutch pink and carry transparency with it which the dutch pink have not chap xi the use and nature of dry colour bluebice be the most excellent blue next to ultramarine which be too good to wasn withal wherefore we leave it out here because bluebice may do very well instead of it and indeed both may be leave out since smalt may be use instead of they however it will not work so well as bluebice which without doubt be too good to use upon all occasion only when you intend to bestow some cost and pain upon you work otherwise you may use no other blue in you piece than blueverditer with which you may make very good shift without any other blue that be in any ordinary work indigo be dark blue that be use principally to shade with upon other bly indigo and yellow berry mix together make dark green to shade other green in the darkest place blueverditer be very bright pleasant blue and the easiest to work in water it be somewhat inelining to green and be mix with yellow berry it make very good green this be the blue most use verdegrease be good green but subject to decay when it be dry upon the paper it will be of lighter colour than it be when first lay on therefore to preserve it from that fault put some sapgreen among it to dissolve in it which will make it keep its colour there be distily verdegrease to be buy at the shop that be far better green than the other but it be somewhat dearer and the other may serve instead of it verditergreen be light colour seldom use in any thing but in colour landfkip and those place that should appear afar off and it be good for fuch purpose because it be somewhat incline to blue but you may make shift to do any thing well enough without it for little blueverditer mix with coppergreen and little white make just such another green sapgreen be dark dirty green and never use but to shadow other green in the darkest place or else to lay upon some dark ground behind picture which require to be coloured with dark green but you may do without this green for indigo and yellow berry make just such another colour coppergreen be a excellent transparent green of fhine nature if it be thicken in the sun or upon gentle fire and it be the most use of any green in wash especially in colour of the grass ground or tree for it be almost grassgreen vermilion be the most perfect scarletcolour you need not either grind or wasn it be fine enough itself only temper it with you finger in gallipot or oystershell with gumwater and it will be ready to use if you put à little yellow berry among it it will make the brighter colour this be principally use for garment lake be a excellent crimsoncolour with which may shade vermilion or you yellow garmente in the darkest place and be mixed with white vou may make skycolour with it or flesn colour by mixing white and little red lead withit andit be a excellent colour of itself for colour garment or the like indian lake be the best lake but it be too good to be use in wasnie print with unless you intend to bestow great curiosity upon you werk for the best sort of ordinary lake will serve well enongh for ordinary use and this also will be somcwhat too costly tnerefore instead thereof you may use red ink thicken upon the fire which may serve you purpose very well better even than lake unless it be very good observe that if you would make light skycolour of you red ink or if you would mix it among you fleshcolour you must not thicken it but shade you vermilion rather with spanisnbrown than thick red ink as it may serve very well for that purpose but be not altogether such bright and clear colour redlead be the fiearest to a orangecolour and put à little yellow berry into fame of it will make perfect orangecolour but if you desire to make fleshcolour of it you must put no yellow in it this colour be use in colour building or highway in landfxip after be mix with little white besides this be the only bright colour to shade yellow garment with in order to make they look like changeable taffaty it be good also to colour any light ground in picture take only the thin water of it and so for several other use as you shall see occasion ii yellow berry be most use in wasn of all other colour they be bright and transpa¬ rent fit for all use and will be sufficient without the use of any other yellow saffron be deep yellow if you let it stand good while it be of use principally to fhade yellow berry with instead of red lead and it be somewhat of brighter shadow but you may make shift well enotgh without this colour for red lead and yellow berry make just such another colour masticote be light yellow just like yellow berry and white and therefore you may do well enough without it only for save you the labour to mix you yellow berry with white when you have occasion for light yellow then you may make use of it to colour light ground in picture in which case snadowit with the water of burnt umber or red lead that be the thinnest part of the colour ceruse be the best white if it be good and finely ground or for want of it white lead pick either of these will serve well enough for either of they be mingle with another colour will make it lighter and the more so inproportion to the quantity of either mix with it spanisnbrown be dirty brown colour and of no great use to colour any garment with unless it be a old man s gown or to shade vermilion or lay upon any dark ground behind picture or else to shade yellow berry in thedarkest place when you want lake or thin red ink it be the best and brightest colour when it be burnt in the fire till it be redhot though if you would colour hare horse dog or the like you must not burn it but for other use it be best when burnt for instance to colour any wooden post body of tree or any thing else of wood or any dark ground in picture it benot to be use about any garment unless you would colour number of old man gown or cap stand together on account they must not be all of one colour therefore for distinction and variety s sake you may use umber unburnt for some of they printerblack be most use because it be eaiiest to be have and serve very well in wash vou must observe that you be not to put any black among you colour to make they dark because it will make they dirty neither should you shade any colour with black unless it be spanishbrown when you would colour a old man s gown or the like that require to be do of à sad colour ivory burnt or instead of that bur not bone be the best black and be thus make take ivory or for want of it some white bone and put it into the fire till it be thoroughly burnt then take it out and let it cool slit it and take out the blackest part of it in the middle grind it for use ch ap xii direction for make gum alum or other water to make gum water take a ounce of fine white gumarabic and half a ounce of clear white candy sugar dissolve these in quart of fair water then pass it through fine sieve or piece of muslin bottle it for use and as you have occasion to use it pour out à little at atime remember to keep it clear for if it should prove dirty or foul it will spoil you colour by adding little coloquintida to the solution of the gum it will prevent the fly from spoiling you work if it should chance to be expose or gumwater may be make thus pour quart of pure springwater into jar glaf and hang in it tie up in fine wool rag sufficient quantity of pure white gumarabic bruise let it hang till the gum be dissolve then put you finger into the water if you find they stick together as if they be glue you water be too strong or full of the gum and therefore you must put more fair water to it and if you find it too weak you must put in it mre gum add if there be any occasion for it the coloquintida as before with this water most of the colour be to be temper and with so much of it as that be touch when dry the colour will not come off it be to be observe that if the colour glister there be too much gum in it to make alumwater boil four ounce of alum in pint of fair water till the alum be dissolve or thus to two quart of spring or wellwater put half pound of powder rochalum dissolve it well by boiling then filter it through brown paper keep it up for use wet you paper with this water before you lay on any of you colour and it will prevent they from sink in and will besides add lustre and beauty to the colour lay on but you must take notice that if the paper be not good it must be wash over four or five time with large brush or pencil remember also that alumraise stand colour and preserve they from fad if you design to varnisn you print after
