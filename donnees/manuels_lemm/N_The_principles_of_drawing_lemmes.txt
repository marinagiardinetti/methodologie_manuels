case as the several part of the human body whole figure landskip cattle curioussy engrave on copper plate after the design of albert durer abrah bloemart carlo morac le clerc hollar and other great master to which be prefix a introduction to draw contain a account of the instrument and material use in draw and the method of manage they with easy and proper lesson for young beginner tend to form he judgment and direct he practice translate from the french of monsieur gerard de lairesse and improve with abstract from du fresnoy the sixth edition london print for john bowle at the black horse in cornbill and carington bowle in st . paul church tard mdcclxiv draw be the art of represent by line and shade the figure of any object we see or of any form we conceive a idea of in the mind it be most ingenious useful and elegant art and the study of it ought to be encourage in every youth that discover a inclination or genius towards the practice thereof whatever station of life he may be place in its utility be so very ex tensive there be few art and few profession in which it be not serviceable all design and model be execute by it mathematician cngineer architect mariner gardiner embroiderer weaver and multitude of other profession have frequent occasion to practise it in most station it be use ful from the general who command a army to the I chanic who support himself by handicraft person who have knowledge in draw and capacity of perform it usually see and remember the form shape and other circumstance of object more minutely and perfect than one unacquainted with the art and posiess a accom plishment exceedingly desirable both for amusement and use he be qualified to take on the spot the sxetch of fine build ing of beautiful prospect of any curious production of art or of uncommon and strike appearance in nature and to bring home for future inspection and service the form of ob ject which yield entertainment in journy and distant placc whether you draw after nature or the performance of other the hand can only express by line and shade those form and idea which have imprest the mind hence the utility appear of accustoming the mind to curious and attentive observation of object especially of those intend for imitation its impression will hereby be strengthen its con ception will be more exact and just and the hand will deli neate with greater ease and correctness those form which be clearly and strongly retain in the memory inform yaur judgment of the property and excellency of draw well execute in this knowledge the mind will make quick improvement by frequent aftentive inspection of the performance of those who have excel in view they contemplate the srecdom and boldness of the outline the cor rectness or justness of the proportion of the several part the character which be peculiar and distinguishing in every figure and expressive of the circumstance it be suppose to be in the elegance or that which give kind of delicacy or certain agreeablenefs which please every one the perspective or re presentation of thie part accord to they situation with re spect to the point of sight if the judgment be well inform in these particular the young practitioner will make much greater improvement than can possibly be attain if he pro ceed in practice without due regard to increase knowledge and judgment mere to the genius than the hand eve owe from this the beauty of you art must flow the labour of the hand must second and support that of the brain to become a able art ill tnc art must be make habi tual a easy and just expression be only to be gain by con stant practice in all art the rule be lcarred in little time but the practice require long and severe diligence the hand should be improve in practice and the mind in judg ment every day this ingenious art not only afford à very pleasing entertain ment to man of leisure and fortune in variety of instance but enable they to judge the propriety of design for such work as they intend to have execute to lay down and ex hibit they construction and vary and improve the plan most to they own like of all other this art have the greatest number of admirer and no wonder since in kind of universal language under stand by all man it represent to we view the form of innu merable object we have no other way of beholding and help we to the knowledge of many of the work in nature or art which any other method of describe would be insufficient to give a idea of it transmit to we view thing long fince past and preserve the form of other that will soon perisn it represent the deed of people and action for many age dead and hand down to we the feature and resemblance of we ancestor and of other valuable and renowned person of former generation the esteem of this excellent art be not confine to adult child admire it and often by the power of natural genius draw varicty of object in such man ner as to excite commendation for the instruction of youth in this useful art the follow rule be lay down and course of proper leffon exhibit for they practice let you first practice be employ in imitate the most plain and simple object in accustoming you hand to draw strait line perpendicular and horizontal one circular and irregu larly curve line this method will be useful in bring the hand to facility of operation moreover these line be the rudiment of all object that can be express they bound and circumscribe every figure all its part or member be com pose of they little time may be advantageously employ in draw after plain inanimate sigure which require stroke of various curving after this draw the particular feature of the face begin with the eye the nose tlie mouth the ear draw they in they different position persevere in copy several time after the same example before you make the tran sition to new one you can not expect to draw a entire head or face till you be capable of perform the part separately nor of copy with pleasure and improvement those object which require more art and time till you have acquire cause tomary exercise of patience and freedom and exactnef in copy those that be casier sketch you outline at first very faint that the amendment of if may be perform without its appear to be re touch endeavour at graceful freedom boldness and just proportion of all its part in these the excellency of good outline con sist it should be draw with flow and glide stroke not swell suddenly but with gradual risings such as might just be feel in statue be careful that it lose nothing or in gee and boldness when you correct it by reduce some part and swell other the outline on that side nearest the light must be fainter than the other the surest and most improve method of practice be to fketch outline for considerable time without attempt to shade any of they and to make num ber of sketch srom the same pattern imitate as nearly you can every stroke and carefully to compare each of you copy with the original that you may observe wherein it be faulty and avoid those error in you next sketch good outline be of the greatest importance and extent in the art of draw a ability to make it can only be acquire by appli cation and practice proceed slowly in you first attempt make it you care to secure every stroke and rather to produce one good sketch than in heedless manner to hurry over number of bad one view you original with close attention ponder upon the length the breadth and the form of each paït they proportion to one another and to the whole the distance from one part to the other which of they lie parallel and which underneath the other in confider what part be opposite to each other you may conceive or occafionally draw perpendicular line from the top to the bottoin and strait line frem side to side and notice what part be mark by these linc and in what manner other deviate from they this obsei vation may be make by lay you ruler across the work and observe tlie part interfect there by sketch out the general appcarance of the whole in very faint stroke without regard the minute particular and little turn these may be aad afterwards review you sketch after it have be lay aside for some time compare it again with the original fault may then appear which be undifcover be fere this method of practice tend to make you more per fect in any particular sketch and by improve you know ledge of outline aad proportion to enable you for nearer imi¬ tation after other pattern proportion or the just magnitude of the several member of figure with regard to one another aed the whole figure make one essential article in every good draught scheme of the proportion of graceful huiman iigure be give in the fifth lesion take from the meafare of antique stlatue esteeny for the highest degree of proportion knowledge of thefe will be of great service to the young sludent yet it must not be fup pose that this scheme be the standard of measurement for all figure for different attitude make sensible difference in the limb of the fame body the muscle shist they appearance swell one way and narrow another in different movement thus the arin the soot the knee be enlarge by bend they and the limb be also foreshorten moreover different human body of agreeable appearance have not the same meafure and exact proportion in they feature and limb therefore the eye must judge of gracefulness and proportion fitness to peculiar character should always be join to the idea of proportion brawny muscular limb be expressive of strength and more slender form of agility for motion the leg of chairme and the shoulder of waterman be enlarge by they different occupation aukward as such figure ap pcar yet thoughtless country clown be fitly express by large head short neck high shoulder flat stomach thick knee and thigh and large foot proportion in these and other in stance be regulate by fitnef to peculiar character and no exact dimension can be give of they the proper material for draw the material for draw be black lead pencil char coal crayon of black white or red chalk or other dry colour make up into crayon poitcrayon indian ink hair pencil crow quill pen ruler and pair of compass black lead pencil be most convenient at the beginning of practice slope you pencil to fine point accustom yourself to hold it further from the point than the nib of pen in writ ing this be necessary to a eafy command of hand and to the make you stroke with freedom and boldnef charcoal of fine fmooth grain slit into slender piece for the portcrayon be very proper sor skctching as any stroke make with it be eafily brush out with feather or clean soft rag if you think they wrong have fecure you outline with charcoal wipe it slightly over with feather to make the line faint then go over they with black or red lead endea vour to make they more correct ' hefe new stroke whea wrong may be discharge with the crumb of stale white bread in sketch after plaister or academy figure charcoal be much use because it be cafily discharge chalk the best sort of it be free from grittiness and sand be pretty soft and have kind of fatness in it black chalk be often ufe on biue or grey paper the colour of which serve for good part of the shad and the light be put in with white chalk red chalk be use on white paper the shade make in hatch with it receive à softness by rub they in gently in the broad strong part with stump make of wasn lezther and then hatch upon they again chalk be proper for draw large figure but littie experience will teach you to le careful not to make falfe stroke with it for they be very difficult to be discharge from the paper crayon be any colour mixt with tobacco pipe clay which while soft and in tie consistency of paste be roll up in piece about the thicknef of quill and two or three inch in lengta and then be dry be properly call dry colour tliey work eafiest and express theniselves strongest on paper of rough grain and be use on coloured paper if dark or brownilh or near the colour of white broivn paper it yield good relief to the tender part of the work in use these colour they arc rubb ' and wroughit one into another in such man ner that no slroke appear but the colour be mixt as if they be lay in with brussi many picture after the life be paint in crayon draw with these dry colour be quick and expeditious and when the crayon be handle with judgment they give delicate softness but the touch of rude finger may spoil the sine work or damp place mildew it indian ink doc not spread and run like common ink and the work perform with it appear much softer it be buy in small cake and by mixing it with water may be make to any degree of strength and use either wilh hair pencil or in pen like common iuk when the young student have make some pro gref in draw with he black lead pencil and begin to use this ink let he secure he outline as correct as he can with the black lead then he may trace it over with pen or hair pencil and indian ink and afterwards with the crumb of white brcad rub out any remain mark of he black lead pencil shad with this ink be sometimes do by hatch with the pen or make stroke crosf one another but this be as well or better perform with the hair pencil more expe ditious and customary manner be wash or work the shade with the ink and hair pencil in the same way as water colour be use the shade make by hatch resemble the stroke of engrave print in wass the snade they appear like those in metzitinto print in which there be not any line the ruler and compass be useful in make geometrical figure and in architecture except in thefe instance the ruler be never to be use and the compass but seldom occa sionally they may be apply in nicely examine tlie agreement of the copy with the original but it be best to judge in most case by the eye only and if you would the compais manage right guide it not witb you hand but by you sight the conduct of the tint of light and shadow it be the proper distribution of light and shade which give the appearance of substance round or siat shape distance and relievo or projection to whatever body you represent draw circle and accord to the manner in which you shade it it will either receive flat globular or concave appearance fill it up with a even colour or with number of line of the same strength and it will resemble body with round circumference and flat side by colour it strongest in the middle the edge be make to retire by the gradate shade and it receive convex appearance like globe by gradually weaken the shade from the edge towards the can ter the middle part will be make to retire and concave ap pearance like bafon be give to it those part of a object which have the greatest vivacity of colour catch the sight sirst and aprear nearest to it by gradu ally weaken the coloer the other part be make to iccede from the eye and appear farther off pure and unmixed white either bring a object nearer or make it to retire further if the white be gradually weaken and support by fhade it then advance but unless it be thus force forward it fly off to the remotest view in round the part of any object the light and shade must be gradually foften into one another and lose themselves by slow and almost imperceptible degree the outline must be saint in those part which receive the light and strong aad boid where the stiad fall begin you shad at the top proceed downward and go through the whole of it with faint shade before you give the finish to any particular part balance should be preserve between the light and shade they serve for repose to one another broad light must there fore be accompany with broad shade fainter light with fainter shade light object must have sufficient strength of shadow to sus tain they and dark body must be relieved by mass of light behind without this opposition object will adhere to the ground or stick to one another but by distributng light and shadow to advantage they be loosen and set free and re ceive strong relievo those object or part of object which come forwardest to view must have strong and smart oppofition and the highest finisning those that be design to be throw further off must be make still weaker and less distinct in nature object ap pear distinct er confused accord to they nearneis or do tance the feature of face or fold of garment be not diilinguishable the length of street and the innumerable leave of distant plantation look like one confused maf more accurate or slighter finish give to object relative dominion over each other as to they distance the heighten of one chane another further from the sight which be not so minutely and strongly pencill give to eyery object such light as be most proper to its sup pofe fituation in the open air when the sun shine full upon object the light must be strong aad bold and the shadow dark if the sun be obscure by cloud the light be more equal and universal but not so strong and warm and the shade must be fainter and more siveet artificial light tinge the object with its own colour and occasion large shadow with bold extremity elcmentaiy light be pure and more generally diffase and the shadow it produce be softer the pro ject part of object be nearest to the light catch it first be brightest and produce shade upon the lower part confider from what point and in what direction the light fall upon the in all art and science the learner begin with the most simple principle the knowledge of the alphabet be a introduction to the grammar and a ability to imitate the forin of different line ' tis no matter of what shape so that they be exactly imitate be the foundation of draw after every kind of object in this first lesson the scholar be present with many line of differeat kind for he imitation perpendicular line mark that be line fall directly on another so as to object and place all you light and shade accord to that direction if it fall perpendicular upon man the top of the head be then lightest the shoulder in the next degree so and the lower part gradually darker the cavity and part that bend inwards not receive any direct ray be darkest of all and the colour be lose in they the fuil force of the princi pal light be to be only in one part and ought not to be cross or interrupt with little shadow sudden brightness be see and many reflection and demy tint be produce when the sorce of light strike upon silk fattin vessel of silver copper or upon other glitter object the very extremity of the shadow side of object be seldom the darkest of all because it almost always receive reflection of light from adjacent body reflex be scarce sensible ex cept in the shadow part all reflcct light be suppose to carry with it part of the colour of the body which reflect it so that those place which receive this light have they own colour mix or ting with the other much szill and accu racy be often require in manacement of the refiex as the sanie place many time receive they from different object dif ferently coloured every circumstance of the colour light and pofition of cach figure and what effect each have take the other be to be consider and nature pursue in all the variety of mixture nature give vast variety of appearance in light and shade curious observer of they be rewarded with high delight and the artist with much improvement the sky always gradate one way or another the rife and set fun exhibit it with astonishiing beauty and perfection the variety of form and colour reflect in water from the sky and cloud from tree house and other object be exceed beautiful to behold accustom yourself to consider the different effect of light fall ing upon object its various and delightful softning and mo dulation in the shade or part which be more or less deprive of the ray you judgment will this way be best inform by you senfe how to represent these pleaf appearance the proper management of which make one of the great division or branch of painting make equal angles on each side horizontal line which paf from one point to another without any deviation ob lique line converge or approximate one way and diverg ing or continually increase they distance the other way parallel line which be every where equidistant from each other . at two semicircle be draw from point asfume in the lower line and the upper line be tangent to both of they prove the truth of its be draw parallel en ample be also give of various fort of curve and twining line this second lesson consist partly of geometrical figure some of they with plain line other with they furface form by light and shade number be circle the circle appear with flat fide be fill with a equal shade convex appear ance give to the circle by light and shade concave ap pearance give to it other convex and concave surface square of four equal side a cquilateral triangle this lesson will be more pleasing to the learner than the qualisy he to copy more difficult representation the follow leave exhibit many example of the fea turc of the human face as the eye nose mouth car the pupil should practise after the different fcature in they various position till he able to draw they well unless he can perform the part separately it will be fruitless to at tempt the whole together spiral or curve line issue from center and continu ally go off from it at every tur cone these with other figure shew in this lesson be useful in different part of practice by consult fmall treatise of practical geometry by le clerk the student in fhort time will gain knowledge of the construction of geometrical figure very advantageous in draw multitude of object former one and practise after the instance here give will several easy example be also give of entire face and head in various attitude when the student have make progress in sketch after those in outline there be other which be sinisned ior he to shade after by consider the plate annex he will improve he idea of face and the method of draw it in all the change and variation which be occasion therein by different turning of the head the division and proportion of the head and face draw head and face four equal part the length of the nofe be usually allot from the top to the bottom from the crown of the head to the top of the sorchead from thence to the top of the nofe to the bottom of the nose from thence to tlie bottom of the chin the breadth of the faoe be divide into five cqual part one of which part be the length of the eye the distance between the eye be the measure of one part and from the corner of the eye to the side of the face be one part the width of the mouth be little moic than one of these part the width of the nose across the nostril little less the eye be divide into three part one of which be the meafure of the pupil or fight with the iris round it the ear be usually the length of the nofe these be approve proportien of good face view in front but in different beautiful subjecis the fame featute often vary both in lengeh and shape the head in general have nearly the shape of a egg or oval as in figure of the annex plate in the middle of the oval draw from the top to the bottom perpendicular line as in fig through the center of the line draw another directly zeross as in fig on these two line the feature of the face be to be draw in they due proportion that the learner may apprehend more per fectly the ufe of these two line they varia tion in the different turning of the head and how the feature on they appear when the face be incline to either fide turn up ward or downwards let he either conceive of or procure piece of fmooth wood turn in the form of a egg draw line lengthways quite round the egg as in fig and perpen¬ dicular from top to bot tom as in fig di vide this line into two equal part by another which reach from side to side as in fig feature be draw on these crof line produce front right face as in fig turn the egg fmall matter to the leave or to the right the cross linc appear more cur ved as in fig and the feature inust be draw on they a in fig and nose always pro ject beyond the per pendicular line in pro portion as the face be more or less turueil aside and moie of the car and nearest side of tlie face eecome vifi bie the firstlinc which be draw round the egg be no longer its boundary but it gain new circumferent line by be turny into new position by ju cline the egg down ward and little to the leave the cross will appear as in fig if raiied upwards and re cline to the right the line appear as ili fig and the feature in these instaaze be shew in fig vast varietv of face dif fetently inclined may be steak by this oval or egg divide the perpendicular line into four equal part the first must be allot to the hair of the head tne second be from the top of the forehead to the top of the nose the third reach to the bottoen of the nose fhe fouith divinon include the lip and chin this peipendicular line divide the face breadth way into two equal part it lie exactly in the middle betwixt the eye run down the midst of the nose and the gutter underneath the middle of the mouth must always be place on it and the bottom of it terminate on the point of the chin divide the cross line which be the breadth of the face into five equal part and place the eye upou it so as to leave ex actly the length of one eye between they this be t be un derstood of front face as in fig for if it turn to either side the distance appear lessen on that side which be sarthest from you the cross line be the boundary fer the top of the car the bottom of they be parallel with the boctom of the nose the noitril should not swell beyond the inner corner of the eye the feature of front face when draw upon the cross line accord to these direction will aprear in they proper place whatever way the oval or egg be tal aed as be shew in fig and or side face be to be draw by means of perpen¬ dicular as in ngure on which the forehead nofe mouth and chin be to be place as in fig in these figure the line froin top to bottom be strictly perpendicular it would be so in a oval draw on paper or any flat surface but the cur vizy of a egg tuin it out of that sorm though ' for dislinction sake it be describe by that name in the forego account when you mark the featute in they proper place touch thein very lightly at first and afterwards proceed on they with greater exactness then draw the hair beard and shadow about it in all face there be some principal toucle which when the pupil can draw face and head tolerably well he miy proceed upon the hand and foot the hand be very important article and to perform they with ease and freedom be not à littie difficult much labour should be bestow in practise aster the example give of they in they various action and soreshortnings the hand from the tip of the fore singer ' the wrist be the length of face that be three quarter of head and this length be equally di¬ vide into two pait one of which be for the palm of the hand the thumb be the length of the nose the breadth of the plam be the same as its length equal to the length of the fore singer the nail of the finger be about half the joint it stand upon the foot view sideways be in length the sixth part of the sigure and may be divide into four equal part one of which be for the heel two other for the sole and the other for the toe the great toe be commonly the length of the thumb these proportion usually obtain and it will he useful for the pupil to fix a idea of they in he niind thol there be few opportunity of apply they directly because of the foreshortnings in which these part appear in almost every graceful action the ancient commonly allow eight head to they figure the modern ordinarily divide the figure into ten face the face begin at the root of the lowest hair on the forehead and end at the bottom of the chin a human figure divide accord to this method into ten cqual part of the length of face each division will reach as follow the first from the crown of the head to the nostril the fecond to the hole in the neck between the collar bone the third to the pit of the stomach the fourth to the navel the fifth to the lower part of the belly ihe sixth and feventh to the upper part of the knee the thigh be the length of two face he knee contain half face from the lewer part of the knee to the ankle two face from the ankle to the sole of the foot half face man with bis arnis extend from the extremity of the longest singer of he right hand to the longest of he lest nicasure as broad as he be long viz from the tip of the long finger to the joint of the wrist one facc thence to the elbow one sace and one third begin with make the oval for the head and divide it accord to the instruction al eady give agreeable to that universal rule in all just design of compare and pro portionisg every part to the first the rest of you figure must now be proportion to the head therefore draw perpendi cular from the top of the oval and mark on it eight divifion er length of the head for the heighth of the figure and ad justment of its part this line be also of ufe in place the figure uptight and wbether it be measure by eight head or ten facc the former lesson direct what part of the body be to be place on the feveral divifion ketch the head first then the shoulder then draiv the trunk of the body begin with the arm pit leave the arnis till afterwards and so down to the hip on both fide give spirit and be the characteristic tkereof thesé should sa well confider and earafully exprest if the face be fat the eheck will seem to fwell if lean the jaw bone will stick out and check fall in the corter of the mouth and iniddle of the eye brow will be elevate in agreeable fensation the eye brow will rise up at the end and fall in the middle and the eorner of the mouth will fink in pain or uneasinefs the mouth by shoot forward and riling in the middle express averfion every passion of the soul be vifible in the feature of the face the line and light which be expressive of they claim particular attention thence to the juncture of the shoulder one face and one third thence to the hole in the neck one sace and one third in all five face which with the five along the other arm to the tip of the middle finger give ten in measure figure by eight part each part the length of the head the divifion allot to they be viz from the erow of the head to the point of the chin one thence to the bottom of the breast one thence to the navel one thence to the lower part of the belly one thence to the middle of the thigh one thence to the lower part of the knee one thence to the small of the leg one thence to the bottoin of the foot one the figure with he arm stretch out meafure breadth way by eight part or head be divide as follow ariz . from the end of the long finger to the wrist one thence to the bend of the arni one thence to the bottom of the shoulder one thence over to the other shoulder two thence to the end of the other loug finger three the proportion of man differ in some respects from those of woman particularly the head of woman be lef than that of man and she neck longer tlie breast and belly be lower the fpace from the bottom of the breast to the navel be half the length of the nose less than in man and the thigh third part of the nofe shorter as to the breadth woman have she breast and shoulder narrower and she haunch larger she thigh at the place of articulation be larger the top of they arm and leg be larger than man ' but down ward more slender and they hand and foot be less new bear insant be not at most above four head long and feldom so much at four or five year old it be about five head long and the length of the body increase with its age till it arrive to the state of manhood and attain its full pro portion the thickness of the limb must be adjust agreeable to the quality and eharacter of the figure in general it iay be notice that the breadth of the thigh at the thickest be double that of the thickest part of the leg and treble that of the fmallest but therc be diffcrence in the contour of part when put in different posture thus when the arm be bent it be arger than when straight the same be true of the foot and knee and other limb and joint be careful to observe the breadth of the waiit then draw that leg which the body rest npen and afterwards the other which stand loose next draw the arm and last of all the hand it be sometimes recommend to begin the sketch on the right fide of the figure that in the procef of the work the performer 's hand may neither hide or shade any part of it as it may happen in some draught when begin on the left side to enforce direction already give in the general rule carefully view the original you draw after the distance of one feature limb joint muscle from another thieir length breadth and turning they proportion to each other and to the whole figure which of they be directly under the other which of they be parallel and how they stand fituate with regard to any part of the figure preserve just symmetry and harmonious correspondence in all the part of the figure by form they in due proportion to one anotlier not one arm bigger or longer than the other or of size ill adapt to any of the other part not plump and strong limb with shrivel face or decay body or broad herculeati shoulder with the waste limb of fribble take notice of the bowings and bending of the body and contrast the opposite part answerable thereto if the belly bend in the body must stick out if the knee bend out the in draw naked body whatever muscle appear must be exprest agreeable to the rule of anatomy they must not be subdivide into small section but keep as entire as possiblé only the principal muscle and those which be of significa tion to express that action which be represent should be make appcar the motion or action of the figure must al way be consider in draw the muscle for they rise and sink and be cither less or morc apparent accord to the different motion of the body the muscle of the leg which support the body or of a arm that list weight be fuller or more swell than in the leg or arm which be not so em in cloath you figure or casting the drapery over they with elegance and propriety it should be consider that the beauty of drapery consist not in the multitude of fold but in they natural order and plain simplicity the dra pery miust encompass the part loosely when it sit too strait or close it give stissness to the figure and seem obstructive to its motion draw the plait large and follow the form of the limb underneath that they may be distinguissied from other by due management of the light and shade the extremiity of the joint as the shoulder elbow knee should be so niark as to be apparent as sar as art and probability will permit notwithstanding they be cover this be so material consideration that many artist first sketch the naked iigure and afterwards put the drapery on it the grcat fold must be draw sirst and afterwards break and di vide into lesser one and great care be take that they do nat cross one another improperly though ' in general the sold should be laege and as few as possible yet they must be gicater or less accord to the quality of the stuff of which the drarery be suopose to consist some as coarse woollen make they fold abrupt and harsh and other as silk and fine innen more soft and easy the surïace of some have lustre other be dull some be pliable and transparent other strong and tolid the quality of the person be likewise to be con sider in the drapery if they be magistrate or dignify perforage they robe or dtapery should be large and ample if lady and nymph thin soft and piable if country clown ordinary people er slave they ought to be stout and ham must fall in and so of every other joint in the body sketch you outline at first very faint mark the general ap pearance and proportion of the most conspicuous and remark able particular with slight touch and afterwards introduce the minute part by trace it over again correct the first sketch by little and little untii the whole contour be finisn with admirable exactness steady even light be always to be choose that no glare may come on the original or on you own work ploy those of the breast become more or less visible by list up or hold down the arm in draw young person the muscle must not appear so manifestly as in those who be elder and full grow the same be to be observe in fat and fleshy people and in such as be very delicate and beautiful in woman and child scarce any muscle at all be to be exprest and but faintly when swell by forcible action in person of a hardy and ro bust make they be most apparent coarse suit the garment and fold to the postare of the body and the sway or action of the limb crook or strait or bend one way or another accord to they various po sition in such manner as will best express they attitude and motion different posture and niotion vary the fold and bring they into new form and whatever posture the body be suppose to be in should be exprest by a artsul complication of they when they be well imagine they give much spirit to every action grcat lightness and motion of the dra pery be only proper sor figure in great agitation or expose to the wind the loose apparel in this case must all fly one way and that part of the garment which adhere closest to the body should be draw besore the loose part which fly from it in order to secure the true position of the figure the closer the garment sit to the body the narrower aud smaller must be the fold the drapery which cover those part that be expose to great light niust not be so deeply shade as to seem to pierce they nor should thc limb in that situa tion of light be cross by sold that be too strong lest the great darkness of the shade give they the appearance os be ing break whenever the drapery be adorn with rich ornament they should be introduce with judgment and priety suitable to the character of the figure and in ge use sparingly it be altogether improper and debase to use they in the imaginary representation of angel the dignity and grandeur of whose drapery oight rather to consist in noble flow of the fold slow of the sold than in rich stuff and the glitter of ornament always chuse north light if possible because it be steady and mofi equally diffuse darken with the shut ter all the window of the room but one and darken the lower part of that window the light contract in this maniier aed only admity at a altitude above the position of the figure will make the sliadow distinct and shew every part of it to ad vantage if you be constrain to window which have south aspect transparent fasn of oil 's paper will moderate the light and take off the glare sit at distance from the model in proportion to its size so far that you may see the whole of it at once which may be effect at distance about twice or three time its magnitude seat yoursel in such manner as to bring you eye upon ievel with tlee figure direction for copy place you picture in good light by which be mean not only a even steady light as direct in the former be ticle but also the proper light for the picture that it may fall thercon either on the right or leave side agreeable to the light and shadow in the painting seat yourself at proper do tance from it to see the whole picture at once observe nicely what object be place in the middle of the picture mark slightly the middle of you paper and give it the same situa tion observe the principal ohject on the lest and on the right side how they be place and range sketch they rough form very slightly in the same disposition and proportion till all the principal part be mark on you paper in they pro per place the expression or suppose character and cir cumistance of every object in the picture must be well study and imprint on you mind its attitude postuie and gesture preserve in you copy and thofe part be particularly no tice by which the action and fentiment be represent in strong and lively manner as the whole composition should be slightly sketch ' before you begin to finisn any part so in the snad you should go on with the whole together with faint shade before you finisn any part many direction be give in the precede essay for the light and snade common method of adjust the distance the situation and proportion of every object agreeable to the picture be to divide it into little square and then to divide the paper for the copy into the same number of square and to draw in they for draw landskip or have fixt you station and determine what extent ha of view to delineate draw the horizontal line faintly and mark it into three division then divide in you mind the landskip iuto three division likewise sketch the niddle divi¬ fion first then that on the left hand afterwards that on the right observe what object fall under one another and mark they on you paper accordingly what object raage on level with each other between the two side and place they parallel in you draught remark what object be the observation heretofore lay doin be applicable branch of draw to urge the most material of they copy after good original mark out all the part be fore you begin to shadow make tlie contour in great piece without take notice of the litile mufcy and other break observe every stroke as to its perpendicular pa¬ rallel and distance and particuiariy so to compare anc op pvse the part that meet upon and traverse the perpendicular as to form kind oi square in the mind which be the great and al most the only rule sor produce à just and exact copy regard not only the model you be copy after but also the part you have already draw there be no possibility of preserve strict justne in you performance but by compare and proportioning every part to the first what be correspondent to each square this be sure method to enlarge or reduce draught with exactness but be the stu dent accustom himself to practise by the help of these fquare he will certainly stint and confine he judgment let he ratiier help it by imaginary line than cramp it by real one let he conceive in he miind perpendicular and a horizontal line intersecting each other in tlie middle of the picture and observe what object be cross by they and tuen suppose two such line cross he paper in order to give those object similar situation in the like manner the situs tion and pro portion of all the chief part throughout the gicture may be consider by imagine other line traver they and di vid as it be the several pait of the painting into imall square the primary qualification in the art of draw be readiness of compare and meafure by the eye all tte part of composition and a ability to expreis they with boldneis and justness this essential accomplishment be to be acquire by habit and application the proportion form and magnitude of object they dimi nution in size and lustre be govern by the rule of perspec tive knowledge in the practical part of that science will greatly advance the pupil 's judgment and facilitate he prac tice and this knowledge may be attain with surprizing ease by consult that plain and familiar treatise the jesuit per spective translate by ephraim chamber see through
