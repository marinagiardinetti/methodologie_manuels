chalk be be ufe ch kiii several ether curious and eafy methed of take vie copy draught print e the greateff degree of accuracy draught may be take regularly from draw on transparent paper as for low take piece of paper of the same size with that of the draught rub one side of it with some powder of blacklead till it be well and equally black to that finger touch it willhardly be ting with the black then take the print and lay the paper underneath it with the black side downwards upon another piece of white paper of the same size pin the three together in two or three place afterwards take pin or needle fomewhat blunt at the point and trace it over the outline of you picture which with little preffing will direct the black paper to impress the white of as to receive every stroke you draw this do you may carefully correct what error you fee with you blacklead pencil clean the nnowmake draught flightly with the crumb of hale bread as for the draught take on tiffany of lawn they be only to be lay on paper that be fuch as be draw with charcoal upon white and thatdrawn with chalk upon black or blue paper and then give each of they knock or two with hiammer the charcoal or the chalk will fall through they upon the papers directly in the line they be draw and give you the true reprefentation of the object draw from the life in white line upon the black paper and in black

but it muft be obferve that this amendment be to be make foon after the line becaufe those tender draught will quickly vanith if care be not take to ftrengthen they immediately you be to begin this operation at the bottom of the draw another way be by take thin piece of paper and hold it againft glasswindow particularly fath one becaufe the interruption of the lead in the smaller glaze window will hinder part of the prospect then draw what you fee from the glass and afterwards the blacklead paper be to be ufe as direct before there be another way hill which may be more eaty to the hand or arm of perfon not becuftome to draw upon paper or lawn place upright which be by the fe of camera obicura though to help the hand one may hold baguette or fuch stick in the left hand as the oilpainter ufe to reft the right hand upon or have fome other reft make for the right hand as may be eafily fcrew up and down at pleafure but there be this difference flill between draw piece of perspective or view on tranparent paper or lawn place upright againft any object and draw by the camera obicura that fuch piece will take in more of the view of object from greater diftance than the camera obfcura will the portable camera obicura will at firft be very eaty to the arm of beginner by reafon the object appear on a horizontal plane fuch as table and the hand have reft will more eafily follow the line reprefent on the plane with greater exactness the camera obfcura be machine or apparatus wherein the lmage of external object be reprefent diftinctly and in they genuine colour either in a invert or erect situation this manchine may be make as follow darken chamber one of whofe window look into place fet with variety of object leave only one little aperture open in the window in this aperture fit lens either plane convex one or one convex on both side of as to be the portion of large sphere at due diftance to be determine by experience pread paper or white cloth on the wall unless the wall itfelf be whiten to as to ferve the purpofe and on this the lmage of the defire object will be delincate invertedly in this cafe it be not more difficult to draw of rather co the object though they be reverf than to draw or copy feveral thing which we fee upright on the frame of tranfparent paper lawn or tiffany for to trace line will be as eafily do one way as the other and though the object fall on the paper or cloth will while you be draw they be reverf it be but turning the paper or cloth upfide down when they be do and the draw will be right to the eye but to obviate this difficulty let the paper or what be to receive the object be place againft the back of chair and let perfon look on the several object reprefent thereon over the back of the chair and this will fet they right to the eyc or if you would rather have the lmage appearerect it may be do either by means of concave lens or by receive the image on plane speculum inclined to the horizon under a angle or by means of two lenfe include in drawtube inftead of one it be to be obferve that if the aperture do not exceed the bigness of pea the object will be reprefent thereon even though there be no lens at all to render the lmage clear and diffinet it be neceffary that the object be illuminate by the sun and they will be still brighter if the spectafor firtt ray quarter of a hour in the dark care muft be likewife take that no light elcape through any chink and that the wall be not too much illugginate farther the greater diffance there be between the aperture and the wall the larger and more diftinct will the image be but the ray become thus too much dilate the brightness of the image be weaken till at length it become infenfible but the portable camera obicura be more proper for beginner as be more eaty for they arm befide the object appear on a horizontal plane may of courte be draw with greater exactness the conftruction of portable camera obicura may be asfollow provide wooden cheft in the middle of which raife little turret either round of quare open towards the object behind this aperture incline little plane mirror to a angle of which will reffect the ray upon lens convex on both side include in tube at the end of the focus of the lens place table cover with white paper to receive the lmage and laftly make a oblong aperture to look through by means of this machine the image will be exhibit perfectly like they object each cloath in they different colour whereby any perfon unacquainted with defign or draw will be able to delineate any thing to the greateff degree of accuracy and juftnel and thofe even well verf in painting will find many hint by it to perfect they in they art thus far we have fhewn how any perton may copy draught print or piece of painting of even make a exact reprefentation from the life but we shall yet add two other method both eafy and entertaining not hithertomention for take off draught or drawing which be follow prick with pin the outline of the print or draught you defign to copy and then lay the fame on sheet of paper take powderpuff or tuft of cotton dip it now and then in charcoal duff and beat it over the prick line through the picture by which mean you shall have full direction mark on you cloth of paper fufficient to finith juft draw the other way be by make such a impreffion from the print as shall give juft copy of it and it be of great ufe when we want to carry every stroke of the engraver along with we which method if you be very careful will indeed but very little fully the print for this end take some white or green soap which mix with fuch quantity of water as will bring it to the confiffence of felly with this mixture rub the print and with wet sponge gently wet the paper defign for receive the impreffion then lay it on the print cover all with two or three other piece of dry paper and rub it very hard all over with any thing that be fmooth and polifh and thus the wet paper will have upon it the reverfe of the print you rub it upon with every diftinct line in the original if you have be careful torub itequally xiv secret for copying of drawing continue also for take off medal various way with several other curious . re cept for tbe dse of painter statuary founder to take draw with fix iwk thin sheet of paper and rub it all over withfreth butter as equally as poffible then dry it well by the fire and rub the butter sidewitheither carmine lampblack blacklead powder or blue bice finely ground till it be all equally coloured take care in rub on any of thofe that the colour will not come off by very hlight touch of the finger then lay the colour side of this butter paper upon piece of clean paper and lay the print you defign to copy upon the butter paper afterwards with fine pin or needle blunt little at the point trace the outline of the draw carefully by which mean you will have good copy of it upon you white paper which may be touch afterwards with crayon or the like colour ii to take the impression of print with redivk mix some vermillion finely ground with linfeedoil but not to much but what it shall ftill be liquid enough to run or flow in pen with this trace the line of you print and then with sponge dipt in water wet the backfide of the print and turn the print side down upon piece of white paper foas to he fmooth then lay over that piece of dry paper and press it hard in every part and the lower white paper will receive the impreffion but if you have linnenfress it be better to put you papers between two of the leave and fcrew the press as tight as you can by which mean you will have fine impreffion iii to take draught writings with red loose ink take some vermillion finely ground and mix it with fair water in gallipot with some cotton in it to as that it may run very free in the pen with this mixture draw over all the stroke of you print imitate both the finer and fironger line then with sponge dipt in gum water wet piece of clean white paper and while it be wet turn the print upon it and preffing it well take off the print and you will find all the stroke remain on the clean paper and as foon as it be dry the vermillion will be fix to it this sort of ink have be ufe frequently in write any thing delign to be engrave for by turn the writing side of the paper down upon copperplate cover with bee wax and white ground rub it very equally the im = prestion will be upon the wax iv take draught with blue loose ink you may likewife make fuch sort of ink with blue bice and common water as will run very finely in pen and ferve for the same ufe as the former liik .. to take off draw in stand red col.our by trace take vermillion finely ground and mixing it with little fresh butter rub clean sheet of paper on one side with this mixture to that it may bear flight touch of the finger without leave the paper then lay the coloured side of this paper upon clean shect lay you print upon the other side of the coloured paper and then trace every line you think proper as already direct in trace draught with fix ink but be fure to pin the three papers together at the corner to prevent they flipping which would inevitably fpoil you work this impreftion make by trace will hold without rub or preffing the papers the cuill of swallow after they be thoroughly dry be very good for trace by mixing carmine with some freth butter and colour paper with it in the same manner you will obtain more beautiful colour and by co . louring paper in like manner with blue bice and butter you may have the draw blue vi to take the natural or lively shape of any here or tree firft take the leaf you would copy and genly rub the vein on the backfide of it with piece of lvory or some fuch like matter to as to bruife they little afterwards wet the same side gently with linfeeoil and then press it hard upon of white paper and you shall have the perfect figure of the leaf with every vein in it juftly expreft this impreftion be afterwards coloured will seem truly natural and may be ufeful to fuch as would remember plant vii another way of painting the le ave of plant so that the impression shall appear as black as if it have be do in printingpress be as follow when the leaf be dry take fuch ball as the press menufe for black the type and rub at equally over with printer ink firike it gently four or five time on the back of the leaf till the vein be black with the ink then laying the leaf on fiat board or the like with the backfide upwards clap piece of white paper well moiften on the leaf and preffing it pretty hard but not to as to bruife the fibre you shall have fine impreffion but this may ffill be do to greater advantage by means of piece of wood in the form of about foot long and a inch and diameter the middle part about fix or eight inch long be cover with wool cloth roll three or four time round it with this cylinder roll the paper over the leaf four or five time backward and forward and you will have curious impreffion but where printer ink be not conveniently come at the follow method may be make ufe of rub the back of the leaf as before direct with burnt linfeeoil then ftrew fome powder of black lead or for want of that fome charcoal or fmall coalduft or the powder of burnt cork upon fimooth board to as equally to cover it stroke the powder gently over and oil the backfide of the leaf clap it upon the board and then lay the white paper upon the back of the leaf pret or roll it as before if none of thefe ingredient be conveniently have take vermillion and mixing it with freth butter to the confiftence of printer ink cover you printing ball with it dawb it over the back of the leaf and take you impreffion as before where vermillion be ufe bice may allo be make ufe of either with butter or oil by grinding blue bice with some burnt linfee oil and ufe it as before thus you may have finer or blue ink proper for impreffion of this sort but the blue be preferable in colour leave becaute it be a agreeable colour for the green sort it may be obferve that the reafon why the back of the leaf be the proper side to make the impreffion from be becaufe the rib or veffel rife on that side above the flethy part of it and therefore be coloured with any of thofe ink they be the fitteft to give a impreffion whereas in forefide of the leaf the ffethy part rife and thefe fine fibre be funk between they to take off the le ave of plant in plafter of paris so as that they may afterwards be caft in meial .. thofe perfon who caft in metal have frequent occafion to ufe leave of feveral sort in order to embellish they work thefe be generally make from model do by the hand which take up great deal of time and even at laft be imperfect but the follow way which be communicate by gentleman from iioly be greatly preferable and much eafier soon after you have crop the leaf you defire to take a impreffion from lay it between the leave of book till once it shall lie flat then pon finooth board with ftrong guniwater smade of gumarabic fix the forefide or front of the leaf to the board when this be do raife round it little wall of coarfe pafte half a inch high or if you can conveniently furround you piece of wood with pafteboard or cardpaper to clofe as that it shall hold liquid for some time then oil the back of you leaf as direct below in the method for caft of Idal and pour on water and plafter of paris there direct which when it be dry will give you a exal impreffion of every vein of the leaf and from which you may eafily make mould to caft in as you fancy ix a expeditious meth of take the impression of any butterely in all its colour have take butterffy kill it without spoiling the wing which contrive to pread as regur larly as poffible in fly pofition then with small bruth or pencil take piece of white pa= per wath part of it with crumwater alittle thickor than ordinary to that it may eafily dry afterward lay you butterffy on the paper cut off the bodyclofe to the wing and throw it away lay the paper on finooth board with the fly upwards and lay another paper over that be put the whole preparation into screwpress and screw it down very hard or otherwife press it let it remain under that preffure for the space of a hour afterwards take off the wing of the butterffy and you will find perfect impreffion of they with all they yarious colour mark diffinctly remain upon the paper when this be do draw between the wing of you impreffion the body of the butterffy and colour you draught of the body after the life to take off the impression of wedal this may be of ufe to fuch as would preserve to themfelves good specimen of fine draught of curious medal especially as it be eafily execute and but triffing expence one way be as follow take hinglass and break it in piece diffolve as much of it over the fire in quantity of water fufficient only to cover it take care to keep it fir till the whole be diffolve this do with hair brush ftroke some of the glue over the medal whofe impreftion you would take after place they as horizontally as you can and when you have cover they perfectly all over let they lie till the glue be harden and afterward with the point of pin or needle raife the edge of the glue from each medal and the whole impreffion of the medal in glue will fy off as hard as hforn with all the fine sharpnnet of the medal as it be strike this glue may he make of whatever colour you pleafe by mixing the colour in the water the glue be boil in .. the impreffion muft be dry immediately but very regular and not in hot sun nor in any damp place ii you ufe ifing glat without any colourmixe with the water you may as foon as you take the impreffion from the medal breathe gently on the concave side of they and then lay they upon the thickeft fort of leafgold which will rtick to they and by fhine through the iling glat will appear like gold medal but if we would imitate copper medal we should mix carmine with the water that we diffolve we slat in hing although water may do very well for diffolying the ifingglat in for this purpofe yet brandy or spirit of wine will give the glue much greater strength to as not to be subject to foften in damp air x i to take the impression of large medal firft rub the medal gently over with tuft of fine cotton moiften or greaf with sweetoil then have some melt brimftone enough to cover the medal half aninch thick put hoop of cardpaper round the edge or it and pour the melr brunffone on it but not too hot as foon as it be fix and harden take off the hoop of paper and the impreffion on the brmfone will come clean from the medal which shall ferve for charp and correct mould wherein you may call another with plaifter of paris bur brini hone should not be ufe on silvermedal be caufe it will effectually change they colour thereto take silvermedal off bind they round after oil they with hoop of some riff paper as before and mixing little plaifter of paris with water fill the hoop with it then immediately fill the cafe in sprinkling manner with the same plaifter till it harden and when it turn dry take it off from the medal but from thofe mould caft in brimffone that be concave you multagain caft fuch medal in plaiffer of paris and they will be convex oil the mould and ufe the plaiffer of paris as before by this Ithod you may take off any medal or fine eassrelief with great exactnct even to as to form medal from they in any fort of mctal x ii another way of takine of medal be as follow procure some thin piece of lead and place the medal horizontally on the top of firm poft or any heady place lay piece of harder Ital flat over the lead and place piece of round turn stick over that fuch as be ufe in the staff of houfebruth faw off about five or fix inch in length and hold that right wich the left hand on the lead and flat piece of metal hrike the top of the stick fmart blow with large fiammer and it will give the lead perfect impreffion of the lmage of the medal but this mut be do by one fingle elow to render the impreffion perfcel xiii various way of take off medal take the shaving of paper and boiling they till they be tender pound they well in mortar to as to reduce they into pafte then boil they again in springwater with little gumarabic let this mixture fland some time to fettle then pour off the water ftrain it through sieve or linnencloth and the remain part of this mixture will be a excellent ingredient either to press into any mould or upon any medal for when the pafte be dry it will come off very sharp some mledal that be underwrought can not be take off this way therefore in fuch cafe you should take common glue and mele it fix hoop of pafteboard round the edge of the medal and pour on the glue hot the sfc dal have be firft oil with tuft of great cotton wthen the crlue be dry and hard take off the hoop and the clue will fy off from the edge and it wiil as be funycet to bend and oive way which the thing formerly mention be come very cafily off but the giue ought to be make frong and should be pour on one third part of a luch thick when a impreffion have be take by this means you muft then hoop you mould of glue with either cardpaper or pafteboard as befire take care to oil it to that no bubble or bliffer may be feen then you may caft you plaifter of paris in it and you will obtain by thefe mean good copy of the medal when this be dry the glue will fly off or may be break off will remain good pattern to caft and there from alfo putty may be make of lin feedoil and fineground starch which be well work together into pafte will take good impreffion from any medal by means of thefe mould you may caft good medal of beewax but they will come off much charper if the mould be in brimftone than if it be in plaifter of paris but then you wax should be as well blanch of whicen as if it be ufe for waxcandle however it will be neceffary to greate the mould before the wax be pour in and though white tax be here recommend yet it will not be beft that the copy of the medal be white becaufe the darker colour thew the medal much better if you would have you copy of red colour mix vermillion with the wax while it be meltin and if you would have it blue put in stoneblue well beaten or ground into the melt wax as foona thefe waxmedal be cold enough to take off you should lay some leafgold upon they preft it down genly with piece of cotton without rub it backward and forward and that will gild yourmicdal when you caft mledal i plaifter of paris to make they look like steel or metal rub they over with tuft of cotton lightly great with oil then ftrew over they some powder of black lead rub they well with such bruth as be ufe for the feeth till the whole be equally cover and this will give they fine meralgloss you may make thefe Idal in plaiter of paris look like box by boiling they in linfeeoil and this will harden they to fuch degree as to hear the brusk to clean they when they tarn foul or dirty if you would have thefe medal look of yellow colour boil litle pearlath in pint of water til it make firong lixiwium then put in half of pint of frenchberry boil this till the liquor be of firong yellow and ufe it with you plaifter of paris infread of common water if you would have the medal look green the fine tranfparent gum of verdegreafe mix with the plaifter of paris will give they that colour and for silvercolour leaffilver or tinfoil may be ufe in the jame manner as the leatgold for the goldcolour for the coppercolour german leafcopper may be ufe xiv to take off impression in plaiffer of paris from copperpl ate oil the plate little and bind they about either with card or other pafteboard paper pour on they fome of the fineft plaifter of paris and water and finithing the

candy to grind with it in water it muft be ground as fine as poffible that be to the state of a impalpable powder and then ule it some lay it be better if rectify spirit of wine be pour on it which will clear it from any dross that may be in it this it be probable muft be pour off when the spirit of wine have do it be work and then the part leave behind muft be mix with gum water again but it have be find by experience that eooshell powder be of very great service as white in watercolour and that itfelf and the oyftershell powder well rectify and mix with the white of a egg well beaten will make a extraordinary mixtureinothercolours and will correct they from changingor alter they quality as to white for illuminating of print the clear white of the paper be to be leave uncoloured and if it happen that the paper be apt to fink or to pread any watercolour that be lay upon it more than be neceffary then the way to correct it be as follow fix the paper in fuch station asthet it may only receive the colouryoulay on to slaze juft as far as you defign it then take fome starch boil and prepare in wiater of middle strength and with large painbruth firoke it over the back of the print and after it have be well dry in the air or sun put the print in book with weight upon it to take out the crumpling which it may receive by wet of it and thus will any print be render fit to

with you hand as pafte be knead and the u will comeour forthereceiving of which place porringer or other proper vellel under you hland and let it fertle in this water till you tee the ultramarine at the bottom of it iyour colour feem to be clammy or nafty you may correct it thus add thereto tartar diffolve in water as much as will drow it and let it reft for one day at leave then wash it in warm water and you will by that means have it corfect and well purify ulramarine prytt be choose of high colour and well ground which may be know by put it between the feeth for if it feel gritty it be sign that it have not be well ground to know whether it be pure and unmixed put little of it into crucible and hear it red hot if the powderdoe not change it be colour after trial it be certainly pure but on the contrary if there be any change or black speck in it then it have be adulterate the pruffian blue be next to ultramarine in beauty if it be ufe in oil though it be not agree on whether it will hold to well as the other particularly as not have the body of the ultramarine the pruffian blue do not grind well in water becaufe there be fuch a oily quality in it that it do not mix kindly with water and at the beft will change as it be now prepare in the common way attempt have be make to make it blue inc which indeed have hold the colour for monthortwo but then turn to muddyyellow and when you put you pencil with gumwater into shell of this elue you will find that where the water pread the blue will turn yellowiff till the body of the colour be well ffir up and after all that can be do with this colour in water it will only ferve to fhade ultramarine with b in oil it may ferve very well for the prefent to fupply the place of ultramarine bluebice be colour of good brightness and be the next to the praffian bluc it alfo be colour of body and will flow prerty well in the pencil especially if it be well wath as be direct to be do of the white and mlinium saunderblue be allo of very good ife and may ferve as shade to ultramarine or the blucbice where the shade be not require to be very deep and be of itself pleafant elue to be lay between the light and shade of fuch flower be of mazarineblue the laemus or litmusbluc be another colour and will run in pen as free as ink be make of laemus or as fome terni it litmus which be fold at moft druggift hop but as this colouris never to be meet with prepared for water colour we therefore all give the follow method of prepare it accord to mrs mliriona take a ounce of lacmus and boil it in about pint of finall beerwort till the colour be as ftrong as you would have it then pour off the liquor into calipot and let it coel for ufc it will foon become jelly and by degree will grow hard but this colour be to be open again and make liquid by water to as to be ufe in ink and will be either paler or darker as it be make thicker or thinner he afford bright colour and have extraerdinary effect for it be not only beautiful hi hold colour this colour if it be touch with aqua fortis immediately change into fine crimfon little inferior to carmine and fink quite through the paper to as not to begotout to that when it be ufe as blue it be beft to keep it from aquafortis or fuch ftrong acid it be good shade for ultramarine or bluebice where the ftrongeft shade should not be extremely deep and for colour of print it be very good as it be tranfparent colour and go great way indigo blue make the ftrongeft shade for bly of any other and be foft warm colour when it have be well ground and wath with gumwater by means of stone and muller it be make of what lightness joupleafe by put more gumwater to it and by how much the less cumwater be put to it the darker it will be before you ufe it upon print it will be proper to try it upon duich tile for it run warmly in the pencii and to perhaps may otherwife prove too frong for you defign which be always to be take care of when flow colouris to be lay over the dark shade of print which shade will much heighten it be blackness and even make it appear quite black fine blue from mo boyle take of the blue leave of rue and beat they little in stonemortar with wooden pefile infule they in water juice and all for four = teen way or more wath they every day till they they be rotten and at laft beat they and the water together till they become pulp and let they dry in the sun this will produce as good blue as indigo and be much fofter but in order to keep it long tune when you beat it the laft time add litle powder of gum arabic to it of which you may put more or let as you would have it more free or tenacious in the working this be a excellent blue for fhad have good body and run warm in the pencil transparent blue from mo boyle equal to

deeper colour in the inner leave or middle of the flower both thefe will do be teparate from the burton and cafe they grow in but the deep blue leave in the middle produce by much the beft colour this may be observe by rub the leave while they be freth to hard upon piece of good writing paper press out the juice which will yield a excellean colour that will not fade for feveral year this part of the flower be therefore the principal and what may be depend on and should bepicked from the reft of the flowerleave the same day it be gather or as foon afterwards as poffibly can be good quantity of these middleleave be h procure press out what juice you can fromm they and add little alum to it vou will have lafting tranparent elue of as bright slanding colour as can be defire fcarce inferior in beauty to ultramarine and very durable as for the outward flowerleave which be much paler it be not certain that they will antver the end but some trial may be make whereby that may be knownalfo let the flower be ga= thered about the beginning of june or in july or uguft but the preparation of the colour by pick out the middle deep blue flowerleave and preffing out the juice muft be do with all the expedition poffible or elfe they will lofe they perfection it be probable that if the leave of thefe blus cornbottleffower be cure in the same manner as saffron be they would produce tuch greatbody of colour from which inctare might be draw with more eafe than if preff raw of fieth from the field in order to do this fuch kiln muft be prepared as be ufe for cure of saffron in which may be make fmall charcoal fire that may communicate heat to the top of the kiln which be to be cover with haircloth upon this should be lay four or five sheet of white paper fuch as be ufe in cure of saffron afterwards parcel of the pick flower be to be lay on to the thicknets of two or three inch lay they clofe and hat with knife and prinkling they with some . wiithen the cake of flower be to be

with both hland and when it have be rightly place take off the upper papers and prinkle the cake second time with some gumwater then fettle the cake again with knife let the papers be lay on as before with the board and weight for minute or two after which let the papers be turn again and again till the cake of flower become united and of the thickness of cake of saffron in this operation you will find the flower row darker and darker every time they be turned till at length the gake will look of deep blue tend to black from whence tincture may be eafily draw during this operation great care should be take that the fire do not fcorch the flower but that it be as confiant and entle as poftible which will be fure way so bring the cake to good colour but it will not be improper for any

they gamboge be one of the firft fellow which may be make to produce five or fix green with verdegreafe accord as the gamboge be in the greater or leffer proportion if it abound it will make tolerable oakgreen and be mix with greater quantity of verdegreafe it will make fine rafgreen but the fellow which some prefer before all other be make of frenchberry as already describe under the yellow which be either deeper or fainter as the liquor they be boil in be more or less ftain with they if it be very thin it make good glaze all over the verdegreafe and as it approach nearer to duichpink or gallfone command almoft any colour we want be agreeably mix with the tranfparent verdegreafe and be fill tranparent in like manner yellow draw from the root of barberry and allo that draw from the root of the mulberrytree will in great weafure produce the like effect be mix with the tranparent verdegreafe as for the verdegreafe itself it produce fine bluith green flow eaty in the pencil and may even ferve asann ink to write with the way of prepare the tranfparent verdegreafe be as follow take fix ounce of common verdegreafe the diftil verdegreafe not antwer this purpofe of well break it into lityle piece and boil it genly in quart of whiter winevinegar keep it continually ftir and when you perceive it to boil add little tartar break and continue flill to fiir it till you find the liquor of fuch colour as you would have it that be till it be of fine tranfparent greeff with bluish caft which you may know by dipping in bit of white paper then pour it through linnencloth into a open veffel and fet it to cool and when it be quite cold bottle it up for afe remember to cork the bottle clofe for be expose to the air it will dry however it may be reduce again by common water this liquor should be touch upon part of the light and shade of print and the shade afterwards coloured with sapgreen in the making of this green remember that it be ftrong enough becaufe it can not be ftrengthened afterwards without the trouble of boiling it afreth but may at any time be render as faiit as you pleafe by rhixing common water with it sapgreen be colour like that of a oakleaf if it be ule thin with common water for this as well as the former want no gum but if it be ufe flrong it will produce as dark green as any it will be proper to try the colour firft upon white dutch tile and by thin it with water you may render it of what ftrength you pleafe and may brighten it very much by the ddition of very little verdegreafe there nere a twe way of make sapgreen viz cake the flower of biuc flagiris or flowor de luce and press they while there be any since to be get fom they boil this genly in glaze pipkin till it grow thick add latle alum to it and it will make very ufeful and lake green vou muft obterve this that in the boiling of any juice coc of the colour before mention you should always do it in a earthen pipkin for if it be boil in veffel of metal they will oftentime change it from the colour intend the second way to make sapgreen for the wath and illuminating of print be to take the juice of buckthornberry and though that juice simply will yield only dark purple of very bafe hue yet either of thefe colour will mix with the liquid verdegreafe above mention and will make delicate shade for it there be befide thefe another green which be admire by some perfon that carry good body with it and degree of tranfparency too as it may be make but as it be commonly ufe colour of full body and fit only for painting in miniature this be make by mixing duich pink with indigo to what degree of colour you pleafe but the high preparation of frenchberry with indigo be much to be prefer to dutch pink especially as this anfwer all the intention of dutch pink and carry tranfparency with it which the dutch pink have not chap .. x i the use and nature of dry colour dluebice be the moft excellent blue next id to ultramarine which be too good to wath withal wherefore we leave it out here becaute bluebice may do very well inftead of it and indeed both may be leave out fince smalt may be ufe inftead of they however it will not work to well as bluebice
