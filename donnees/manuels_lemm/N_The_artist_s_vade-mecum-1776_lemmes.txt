light that one might imagine one felf on the spot and this in language underftand by all mankind the implement for draw be fmoothgrain charcoal blacklead pencil red black and white chalk portcrayon hair pencil crowquill pen indian ink ruler and pair of compaff—— charcoal be proper to lketch with as any stroke make with it may be brush out with feather if wrong and the black lead pencil give the correct outline red chalk be proper to draw large or academy figure with and black chalk the fame especially on colour 's paper where the light put in with the art of draw with whitechalk have beautiful effect——it be beft to begin draw from fome of the leave complex example as they be place in this collection every thing should be draw at firft with stroke juft vifible and afterwards correct by alter what be amiss make as like the original as poffible in this manner learner should draw the feveral fearure in different pofition well before he attempt a entire head or face for he can not do the whole together until he be mafter of the part this do draw face and head from forme in outline only ketch the outline and finith from the same hade before in this particular will here give the moft approve proportion of face and head and the better to underfland it shall defcribe one view in front in which pofition it 's outline make nearly the shape of a egg divide by line as in the example the upper divifion for the hair then to the top and next to the bottom of the wose the lower one to the chin this laft part be fubdivide equally into three the uppermoft be the diftance between the nose and mouth the breadth be divide into five equal part of which one be the eye another the diftance between the eye from the outfide of the eye to the side of the face be another part the mouth be little more than one the nose little lef the eye in front be divide into three one of which be the pupil or sight the ear be the length of the nofe one of the greateft beauty in draw face and which be abfolutely neceffary to it be to place the feature truly in they place that be the middle of the forebead the nofe and the moutb exactly under one another in line and the eye on line properly croff that on which the forchead nofe and mouth be place if you would fee how thefe line curve in the feveral attitude the head may be put into there be very ingenious method in do it by get piece of box or other fmoothgrain wood turn in the shape of a egg make rraight line on this piece of wood from the middle of the top to the middle of the bottom then make cross stroke on it at the on the art of dr win proper diftance as before direct in peak of the pro portion of the head for the eye nofe ec and by fet this piece of wood in variety of different attitude you will fee how the line curve on thofe occafion and accord to thofe curve you muft place and turn the feveral feature by this means think you will eafily underftand this rule for place the feature properly which be one of the moft difficult point and at the fame time to abfolutely neceffary that it be impoftible to do any head well without it and next proceed to bland feer oc and for due proportion of which fee the example after you draw thefe part well and with eafe try a entire figure of which shall here give you the moft approve meafure and proportion the antient commonly allow eigbt head to they figure but we ordinarily divide the figure into ten face from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot viz from the crown to the forehead one third of face the face begin at the root of the loweft hair upon the forehead and end at the bottom of the chin——the face be divide into three proportionable part the firft contain the forehead the fecond the nofe and the third the mouth and the chin thence to the pitbetween the collarbone two length of nofe to the bottom of the breaft one face to the naval one face to the genitory one face to the upper part of the knee two face the knee contain half face to the ancle two face to the sole of the foot half face man 's arm ftretch out be from the longeft finger of he right hand to that of he left as broad as he be long from one side of the breaft to the other two face the bone of the rm call humerus be two pace from shoulder to the elbow thence to the root of the littlefinger the bone call cubitus with part of the hand contain two face from the box of the shoulderblade to the pit betwixt the collar bone one face the sole of the foot be the sixth part of the figure the hland be the length of face the thumb nofe ec thofe meafure be general but liable to exception varying on the art of draw from the quality of person and movement of the miaf cle be careful to make juft symmetry and harmonious corin the whole figure not one leg of rm big ct or longer than the other not the fhrivell face of old age with the plump lip of vouth the body of bacchus with the limb of a apollo or the shoulder of a hercule with the waift of fribble it be proper here to take notice of hew great advantage to perfon who would draw human figure well it be to underftand fomething of the anaremy of it mean to much of it as relate to the bone and the mufcle and as appear externally more than this would be to he mere matter of curiofity but thus much be worth the pain of every one to become mafter of who be ambitious of knowing the foundation of the art for it will be means of piving grace strengib and bearuty to he figure and he wilk be able to expret the proper part of the limb which principally operate in every action not blindly and by chance but with
