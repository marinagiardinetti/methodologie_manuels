will greatly affift the pupil to remedy the defect have by clofe attention and practice improve he idea to far as to be able to compleat figure in outline we shall pro ceed to instruct he in the drapery or cloathing but before we quit this subject it will be neceffary in this place to give he the beft method of afcertaining the proportion and dimenfion of the several part of the human body by raif perpendicular on the place you intend for the middle of the figure and divide it into head and from fuch form scale to regulate the proper distance but as it have be common to divide the figure into ten part we have though we do not to well approve of this method give a example of both of thefe method together with rule for the iluftration of each respectively the proportion of figure divide into eight head see plate iii the length of the head be from the crown of the head to the bottom of the ehin line rule through the second divifion will directly crof she pap of the breaft the third divifion will fall near the naval the fourth across the privity which be exactly the middle of the figure the fifth croffe the middle of the thigh the sixth be juft below the bend of the knee the

third to the wrift and the fourth to the finger end from shoulder to shoulder in man of common size meafure exactly two headss but there be no precife standard for the breadth of the limb which vary accord to the bulk of the perfon and the movement of the mufcle the proportion of figure divide into ten part see plate firft of thefe divifion extend from the crown of the head to the under lip the second little below the collar bone and line draw through this part of the figure will paf over the middle of the shoulder the third divifion will make line juft below the pap of the breaft the fourth

eight directly through the calve of the leg the ninth reach half way from the calf to the bottom of the heel which determine the tenth and laft divifion of the figure the young beginner will find the forego rule of infinite advantage to which we would advife he to give due application till they become ftrongly impreff on he mind but care muft be take that too striet a obfervance of the precede dimefion may not deftroy that variety of compofition to abfolutely neceffary nor will the preservation of the same proportion be always allow in the subject which mohofarth in he chapter of proportion very judicioutly remark in he obfervation upon the celebrate statue of apollo belvidere where he fay can not throw ftronger light on what have be faid hitherto of proportion than by animadverting on remarkable beauty in the apollo defvidere which hath give it the preference even to the antinous mean super addition of greatness to at leave as much beauty and grace as be find in the latter in in the same apartment at rome be to be feen thefe two mafterpiece of art where in view the antinans the spectator be fill with admiration when the apollo ftrike he with surprife and as traweller express themfelves with a appearance of fomething more than human which they be always at lof to describe but the effoot of this be they fay the mere extraordinary as the difproportion upon examination be evident to every common eye the foundation of defign be perfect knowledge of all the part of the human body but no more be neceffary to painter than that which relate to the bone and the principle mufcle that cover they there be a abfolure neceffity to be thoroughly acquainted with the form and joint of the bone becaufe the dimenfion be often alter by motion and likewife to underftand the office and situation of the mufcle fince the moft firik truth in defign depend upon they as it be indispentably neceltary that the pupil should have some knowledge in anaromy it be the fundamental part of defign and enable artift to difcover the beaurie of the antique it be therefore earneftly recommend the student to pay fome atrention to ii as all that be neceffary for draughtfme be very eafily retain of drapery when you have draw the outline of the figure you want to cloath faintly with charcoal kketch the outline of you drapery lightly with the feveral foldsy remember that they muft not cross each other due regard muft likewife he have to the qualiry of the drapery as stuff and wooll cloth be more harth than silk which be always flow and eafy remember that the drapery muft not stick too clofe to the body but let it feem to ffowr eafy about it and yet appear of that the motion of the figure be free and natural be careful that the drapery suppose to be blow by breeze of wind all flow one way and draw the part nexr the body before thofe which fly off the garment muft always bend with the figure and if you make the drapery almoft clofe to the body the fmaller muft be the fold and if quite clofe there muft be no fold but only faint shadow to reprefent the bend of that part of the body which it cover ie be neceffary the student should take every opportunity of improvement in this ufeful branch by remark the fold in the drapery of gentleman and lady accord to they feveral pofition by this unerring rule of nature the learner will greatly heighten he own idea and give superior excellence to he work thus far may serve to give the young draughtfman general idea of drapery but that he may not be at loss in perfect himfelf in this neceffary branch of the art we have here fubjoin the follow more particular instruction viz be careful to avoid overcharge you figure with superfluity of drapery let as much of the form of the body as poffible be shew underneath it when the drapery be large throw they into as few fold as you can and ler thefe be large and graceful on on the contrary fet thofe which be clofe to the body and short be loofen by small fold judiciouly place which will be the means of avoid that stiffness which for want of this caurion appear when the drapery be make to fit too ftrait and make the figure feem as if wrap round with bandage instead of be gracefully cloath when much drapery be require let the greater part if poffible be throw into shadow obferve that the fold which fall in the light muft have fuch foft and tender shadow as may make they fir hollow from the body and not feem to girt too clofely to it let the fold be properly contraft and avoid ftrait line as much as poffible judicious repetition of fold in circular form greatly contribute to characterife forethorten limb in fix arritude let the drapery appear likewife motionlet unlet expose to the air but the drapery of figure move with great agility should teem to play as if agitate by the wind but in proportion only to the velocity of the figure in motion we can not conclude this subject withour give this very wfeful caution viz ler the pupil be carefl how he fiudy statue and remember that the beft of they be only memorial of thofe great artift whofe life be fpent in endeavour to express they own idea of perfection which varied accord to the different tafte ef each and the nature of the material upon which they wring and let it be likewife remember that there be stiffnet which should be fiudiouly avoid in copy even though correct one make after the fineft statue which will never convey any idea but that of statue whereas there be fuch freedom obfervable in the imitation of nature as evidently diftinguiffe they from thofe take either from marble or plaifter of light and shade the proper distribution of light and shade in picture be abfolntely neceffary to be know as it not only determine the proper distance of one object from another without which the whole would be a undiftinguished maf of confufion but it give likewife to each respective object its substance roundness and effect therefore have outline the fold and the other part of drapery you may next attempt the shadow of you figure obferve the follow method shadow the draw with the pencil or pen in which great care be require firft obferve from which side the light come in which if natural ought to be from the right or leave for when the light come in the middle it be call a artificial light as proceed from fome artificial luminary as candle lamp lay you shade rather faint at firft of that you may heighten they at pleafure where neceffary for you may at any time darken you shadow when you can not lightenthem remember that you shade muft be all on the fame side of the figure that be to fay if the right side of the face be in shade of muft the same side of the body arm leg cc you shade muft all be faint as they approach the light the strength gradually decreate towards the extremity to prevent harth appearance as that be neverfail sign of bad workman when one part of the body project over or before another the part project muft receive ftronger light thofe part that bend inward muft be make of much the darker and shadow deepeft next the light two equal light muft never be make in the fame picture the ftrongest light should fall upon the middle of the piece where the principal figure ought to fland diminithing gradually towards the extremity stump make of paper or gloveleather roll hard and cut almoft to point like pencil be ufeful if you shade with the pencil red chalk or crayon to blend the shade and foften they into each other as alfo where they appear too ftrong to weaken they with the aforefaid roll by examine nature you will improve you idea in light and shade as well as in outline and be enable to form right judgment of the truth of you draw the indian ink may be prepare for few different shade by rub it more or less in water on marble stone cut in hollow for that purpofe referve one of the hollow for the water of draw landscape thiis will give the student a inexhauftible fund of amnfement from the variery of subject which nature conflantly fupplies for he observance and imitation and in order to improve in this study the heft method be to adhere to the rule before lay down with regard to the human body by begin with the moft fimple object as the outline of cottage tree cc for which reafon we shall give few example in each with they proper shade but would advife the pupil not to be too hafty in the shadow before he be perfect in the outline and as it be impoffible he should excel in landicape without fome knowledge of perspective we shall give fome direction fuitably illuftrate with problem as neceffary affistant to the practitioner which will prevent he be impose on by faulty and incorrect original where the ignorance of perspective make the whole landicape appear unnatural and diftart of perspective the firft thing neceffary to learn before we proceed to the problem be a explanation of the feveral rechnical term ufe in the practice of this artz and these be as follow the bafe or fundamental line be the bottom of the draw or that part of the ground on which the perfon be suppose to fland look towards the point of sight perpendicular be a upright line with respect to any part of the bafe parattel line be equidittant from each other as the horizon to the bafe the horizon be the moft distant part where the cloud teem to touch the earth and limit the sight the point of sight be that part of the horizen where all the vifual ray center ray be beam of light convey the likenet of any thing to the sight and the knowledge thereof to the mind point of disfance be fet off on the horizontal line at equal diftance on each side of the point of sight diagonal line be thofe draw from the point of diftance to the end of the baic line the abridgment of the square be the line where the diagonal crot the vifual ray and muft always be parallel to the bafe this be only of ufe when the sight be limit by perpendicular as the end of church or room the forego term be illuftrate in plate iv fig the point of direct view be when the object be feen in front as houfe or geometrical elevation raif from groundplot comprehending a equal space on both side the point of sight the point of oblique view be when the object be feen fideway for inftance of canal with fome remarkable building when the perfon draw the faid view be place on the bafe line oppofite to the building of that the ray of light may be more oblique and the building let foreshorten and appear to greater advantage accidental point be thofe where object end in the horizontal line not in the point of sight or diftance ferve for street houfe chair cc take different direction jchnography be plan of groundplot to be faif in perspective scenography be bring any thing raif in perspective from a ichnographic plan to its proper proportion that all object may be diminish in picture the fame as in nature as the art of perspective be construct on geomerrical principle it may be neceffary previous to the rule themfelves to demonstrate the follow introductory operation from point in give line to raife perpendicular see fig ii plate iv draw the give line then fet one foot of the compaff in and extend they to rather more than half the length of the line ftrike the arch and with the same extent of the compaff fet one point in and describe the arch then without alter the compaff fet one foot in and fveep the arch rule through the point to interfect the arch at ro and draw the line from t to which be the perpendicular require to raife perpendicular upon it be the center of the give line see fig iii plate iv divide the bafe line into two equal part then extend the compaff to any distance greater than bor and with one foot in tweep the arch de then with the fame extent of compaff fet one foot in and sweep the arch and from the interfection of the two arch at draw line to the center of the bafe tine at and you have the perpendicular require to to draw line parallel to or equidiftant from another give line see fig iv plate iv extend the compaff to the diftance of the parallel require then with one foot in any point of the line give as in sweep the circle hi again without alter the compaff fet one foot in another point as in and defcribe the circle then rule the line touch the ourward part of the two circle and you will they have the parallel to the line give to bifect or divide give line intotwo equal part see fig plate take with you compaff any diffance greater than half the give line proceed with ohne foot of they in to describe the arch and without alter the diftance fet one foot in sweep the arch and thefe arch will interfect each other in the point which join by perpendicular will crof in the middle point hlave three give point not in right line how to turn circle through they see fig vi plare iv three point be fix as at and proceed to join they by the right linex and then by fig bffect the line with the line hi which be do divide the line with the line and from the middle where thefe line center extend you compaff to and tweep the arch fure way of draw a oval see fig vii plate iv divide the give line into four equal part one feot of the compaff be fet in defcribe circle withour alter the extent of the compaff frem tweep the circle then extend the compaff one foot in and tweep the arch with the fame excent fer one foot in and turn the arch the interfection muft be united by perpendicular from to then proceed with one foot of the compaff in to defcribe the arch and with the fame extent of compaffe fer one foot in and turn the arch another certain method see fig viil plate iv rule give line then place one foot of the compaff in and describe the circle then with the same extent of compaff on the line in the fuppofe point describe the circle and through the point where the two circle interfect rule the perpendicular then have one foot of the compaffe fet in extend the other to as to tweep the arch to the lower exxtremitie of the circle then without alter the compafy fet one feot in and turn the arch to join the upper extremity by the precede example it be evident that a oval of any form or size may be construet at pleature only obferve always to fet the compaff at a equal dif rance from the give line on the perpendicular pradical example in perspective to draw square pavement in perspective see fig ix plate iv supposing you have piece of pavement confift of piece of marble each foot square you firft bufiness be to draw a ichnographical plan which be thiis perform a exact square be make to the size of you intend plan proceed to divide both horizon and bafe into eight equal part and from each divition in the bafe to he oppofite point in the horizon rule perpendicular line and divide the side into the fame number ruling acrof from point to point parallel line to that of courfe you pavement will be divide into square foot as the eight foot in length be mulriply by the eight in breadth produce the number of piece contain in the whole then rule from corner to corner diagonal line and you will have you groundplot as in the fame figure now to throw this ine perspective draw another square as before direct and divide the bafe line only into eight equal part fix you point of sight at in the center of the horizon then to every divifion in the bafe rule line from the fame point and proceed to rule diagonal from to and from to to answer thofe in the groundplot and you will then have you square reduce to the triangle and from the point where the line be interfect by the diagonal to the oppofite interfection where the line be interfeet by the diagonal hi then rule parallel line which be the abridgment of the square from the reft of the line which go from the bafe to the point of sight through the point which be interfect by the diagonal rule parallel line and you willthen have you square pavement lay in true perspective as in fig plate iv to find the height and proportion of object appear above the horizon on suppofe plane see fig xl plate iv have you horizontal line rule proceed with fix you point of sight as at and mark the place of you neareft pillar by dot at the summit or top as at and another at the bafe as at then rule line from to ard anothe from to and thefe two line give the height of any number of villar for inftance would you have you pillar at fix you dor for the bafe then meet the diagonal at by rule parallel line and to the diagonal rule the perpendicular which perpendicular thew the height of the pillar require at or would you have pillar place at obterve the forego direction rule the parallel il and and the perpendicular and will shew the require height and diftance in find the diameter at any particular diftance you be to be guide by that nearcit the bafe as for example fuppofe you neareft pillar to be ten foot in height and one in diamerer interfect from bottom to top in two equal part and upon the bafe of the pillar for off one of they from the point of sight to the dinmeter then rule line to the point of sight from and you will have on the respective bafis the thicknet of each pillar the precede rule exemplify in object beneath the horizon see fig kii plate iv have rule the horizontal line fix the point of sight as at then becording to you judgment make dot for the foot of you figure as at and another for the head as at es then rule line from to and from to and thefe two diagonal will shew the true height of any number of figure that can be want make dot for the place of the foot of any figure where you would have they stand as at ii and now to know the height of each respectively draw parallel line from the dot ii and to the diagonal then raife perpendicular from the point where the parallel interfect this diagonal at mo ns and pu and the perpendicular thew the height of the figure at as do mo of that at ns of that at of that at and p of that at note you will be oblige always to fix the height of one figure as at de in order to find the size of the reft and the point of sight may be place at any diftance you pleafe from the firft fuppof figure on the horizontal line from line give to form square see fig kiii plate iv rule you bafe line of any length you pleafe as at then raife perpendicular as in fig ii from to and from to next take with you compaff the length from to and fet one foot in turn the arch ef then with the same extent of compaff fet one foot in and defcribe the arch laftly rule line from to touch the outward part of the two arch where they interfect the perpendicular and you have the square require from give line to form parallelogram see fig kiv plate iv rule give line of the length require as at then raife perpendicular at and another at as in fig ii and on they fet off the proper height as and bd join dwith line and you parallelogram be complete fic x v plate iv in this figure we have attempt to thew how to draw with certainty that curve line which mohogarth in he ingenious analyfis have ftile the line of beauty there have however be a objection raif by some that he have omit the rule whereby this truly afefid line may be find for which reafon and in order to enforce the study of it we have give this figure not as a infult upon that celebrate author whofe meaning be very clear but as line well deferve of attention be of itfelf fingle and eafily draw and as we be defirous of follow the method of that great artift in the explanation of we idea by the moft familiar object we here inform the student that it may be plainly feen in that wellknow amulement of the schoolboy fix point star in which the contraft half of any two opposite point give the line which be with great propriety stile the line of branty to execute direct view see fig plate if you would draw direct view of houfe and wall or in other word geometrical elevation to be raif from plan or groundplot by scale make accord to the dimenfion of the building firft rule the bafe line above the plan at any height you pleafe then erect perpendicular at and for the extremity of the houfe alfo from the window mark in the plan ef no which will give the breadth of all the window rule thefe perpendicular faintly with black lead have do this fuppose the bottom of the parlour or groundfloor window to be foot above the bafe line take off with you compaff foot from the scale and transter that meafure from to at each end of the houfe then fuppofing the parlour window to be foot high fer off that meafure from the scale and transfer ir to the extremity from to then if the diftance from the top of the parlour window to the bottom of thofe on the firft floor be foot take ir as before from the scale and fet it off at each end from to then fuppose the chamber window to be foot high transfer that diftance from the scale from to at each end next supposing from the top of the firft floor or chamber window to the bottom of the cornice to be foot take foot from the scale as before and fet off that diftance at each end from to then if the cornice be foot high meafure it off from the scale and transfer it to each end from to laftly fuppofe the roof to be foot from the top of the cornice fet off foot at each end from to then rule faintly with you pencil the parallel and you have the height and breadsh of all the window cc which have ourline rub out the parallel and perpendicular with bread and fet off foot the fuppofe height of the wall rule the line from to at each end and the work be ready for shad to draw a oblique view see fig ii plate firft rule the horizontal line and if the moft remarkable object be on the lefthland as at have take you station on the bafe line as at from that place raife perpendicular which at the point of sight will inrerfect the horiand to find the roof and bafe of the principal building rule the diagonalsl and I obferve whether the prospect before you make curve which if it should be careful to make the fame in you copy whether it be direct or oblique to draw view wherein be accidental point see fig iil plate suppofe large building in which be feen two front take different direction as in this view fix you station at about the center of the bafe line after which rule the horizontal line then fix upon that you point of sight and es and rule firft the diagonal and and you may draw diagonal from the point of sight to and cc that they may take they proper direction towards they respective point of sight accidental point feldom intervene where there be but small diftance as in canal grove noblemeh 's seat cc which be to be draw by the stricleff rule of perspective but when the prospect be extenfive it muft include every thing analagous thereto but as this require fuch a infinite number of accidental point you have better not attempt they till you idea be farther improve and you judgment more htrengthen of enlarge and contracting fig iv and plate wirff you compaff divide you original into any number of square and with you pencil rule from side to side and from top to bottom then divide you paper into the jame number of square bigger or let than the original you intend to enlarge or contract and you may to prevent wiltake number the square both in the original and copy as they be dene in the plate this do place you original before you and draw square by square that be to fay make the fame part as be contain in one square of you original fall into the jame square of you intend copy and by do this with care you will make the one exactly correspond with the other in due symmetry and proportion then outline you subject with indian ink and rub out the mark of the pencil with bread and of preceed to thad of copying of draught when you would copy print or draw exactly of the jame size rub the back of it with the duft of red chalk or black lead lay this upon you paper and pin it down at the four corner then with blunt point trace the outline and breadth of the shadow which do have carefully examine it to fee that nothing be omit take it off and finith it with the pencil or pen another way to make a exact copy and at the tame time to preserve the original be to lay piece of tranfparent paper upon it and draw the outline thereon with black lead pencil then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon place piece of thin poftpaper redden or blacken at the back after which pro ceed to trace and finish it accord to the forego rule if you would reverfe you original you need only turn the tranparent paper with the draw you have make upon it downwards upon the peftpaper and trace it as above direct of the imitation of life chiise the perfon you be to draw from to be of a handfome shape and good proportion as this will confirm you idea and illuftrate the rule beforemention place the perfon in the moft natural and eafy pofition always avoid in you early practice the copying of ungraceful or diffort attitude which ferve only to give the young practitioner wrong bias and render he incapable of form just and proper conception of the natural bcaury and grace of the human form begin as before direct with flight skerch with you charcoal of the main lead stroke or ourline which have do correctly proceed to finith with you pencil take particular notice of the mufcle as they occur as this will give refemblance of the perfon in the outline if correctly obferve before you shadow it in draw likeness great care be neceffary to express the paffion in the livelieit manner and this be do by minding the difpofition of every feature with peculiar nicety this be by far the moft difficult part the pupil have to learn we would advife he not to be too hafty to attain it before he have make thorough proficiency in the eafier and more practicable branch of draw nor would we on the other hand difcourage the effort of genius which in the purfuit of any art or science be noft certainly truly laudable and have be frequently attend with the deserve success all that we mean to inculcate by this caution be not to afpire all at once or by too hafty stride to perfection but rather to afcend progreffively the neceffary step which lead towards it of hisory the student have in this branch the whole art of draw as it be blend together and when he have of far gain he point as to draw completely the human body this will be the moft delightful employment that can be imagine for the choice of subject he need never be at loss as he own or he neighbour family will furnish he with abundance book will likewife greatly affift he particularly the sacred hiftory which be replece with a inexhauftible fund of event above all other worthy to be record and therefore moff deferve he ferious attention to this we may add the hiftory of we own country wherein the illuffrious action of ancient heroes as well as thofe of we contemporary and particularly we gallant officer military and naval in the laft war afford ample matter for the exercife of the ingenious artifl as to bealt bird flower fruit plant cc we think it wholly unneceffary to give any direction concern they as the subject we have already difcuffed be by far the moftufeful and he who can draw human figure correctly be fufficiently qualified for every other branch of this noble art but as the experience draughtiman may fometime choofe to vary the object of he study which when perfeet in anatomical subject he may do with safety we have give few example of beaft bird shipping for he farther entertainment and amufement observation on defign as well in regard to theory as practice the theory of defign be only to be acquire by fludying the beft author who have lay down the fcientifical rule for the attainment of this art by find knowledge in the theory of defign thofe who be unable to draw the moft fimple object may be enable to give they opinion upon the performance of the beft mafter in this cafe theory be detach from practice be equally confider and diftinguished by the epithet of tafte there be another method of acquire tafte which be by frequently examine good picture in the prefence of thofe who be efteem connoiffeur in the art who generally pat they judgment without referve theory in this senfe of the word have be hitherto the greateft support of painting for have tafte be confine to practice only we should not be able to find of many invaluable piece in the cabinet of prince and other encourager of art and who could not perhaps have be permit by they avocation to have acquire any tafte for this polite art to that painting of courfe would have find no patronage the practical part of defign be produce only by frequent application of the hand accompany with the understanding in the imitation of various form thofe object whether perfon or place which we have but tranfient view of be in the memory like sketch of charcoal upon paper which the whilk of feather will entirely deface how then shall the unaccuftomed hand perform its function when the object be not inculcate in the mind and can in short time retain only confute idea of its refemblance this be therefore a infallible proof that the only way to attain perfection be to blend practice with theory from what have be already faid it be plain that the conveyance of the similitude of object be only to be obtain by a unwearied application the hand by practice acquire facility which give freedom and we muft correct that freedom by judgment pleafe to obferve that we do not here mean by judgment but exertion of the underftanding that be neceffary to compofe a hiftorical picture but relate only to proportion it be nothing uncommon for one who be good practical draughtf man to be entirely incapable of compofe which we think should be with the usmoft propriety afcribe to the genius
