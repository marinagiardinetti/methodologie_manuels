bring to a impalpable pow ¬ der call pearl white which will mix well withi any colour if you use white lead clarisy it with white wine vinegar after the white be settle pour off the vinegar and washi it with watcr thus put the powder into glass of water stir it and presently pour the water off while it be white into another clean glass when it be settle pour off the water and yon will have a excellent white to which add as mucli it have be often notice that white lead will turn black if mix with water that come from iron or clay so that in the space of month or two you may perceive it and it will also change any colour with which it be mix it be recommend by some to take the powder of eggshell of the brightest and whitest sort well ground with gumwater to the state of a impalpable powder to which add one twentieth part of white sugarcandy other esteem it most when clarify in spirit of wine and then use it with gumwater it have be find by repeat experience that this egg shell powder be extremely serviceable as white in watercolour and that this and the oystershell powder rectify and well bruise will make a excellent mixture with other colour to keep they from change fine white for watercolour may be make by difsolving filing of silver or silver leaf in aquafortis evaporate the aquafortis till it appear like chrystal in the bottom of the glass decant the other part of the aqua fortis and wash the silver four or five time in pure water till it be entirely clean from the aquafortis drving it for use it must be use with the water of gum and sugarcandy good white for watercolour proper for miniaturebe make thus take pound of the shredding of gloveleather and steep they in water boil they withtwelve quart of water tillit waste to two strain it through line cloth into wellglaze earthen pan this be call glue or size and proper to use with co¬ lour in candlelight piece to know if this be strong enough feel if it be stiff and firm under you hand the glue be melt reduce some white chalk to powder and while it be hot add such quantity of chalk as will bring it to the consistency of paste let it steep for quarter of a hour stir it with brush make of hogbristle in order to make this white brighter addmore glue be carefulto observe that every layer be dry before you put on another if you work upon wood you must put on dozen but six or seven be sufficient if you paper be thick afterwards dip soft brush in some water draining it with you finger rub the work withit in order to make it smoother whenyou brushi be full of white you must wash it again and also change the water when it be too white or you may use wet line rag instead of brushi yellow in some object there may be see ffiining like thiat of gold through colour of red blue or green such such as some fort of fly or beetle and the cantharide this gold transparency may be very well imitate by lay some leafgold on the shade side of che draw give à little to the light side to lay oh the gold leaf press it smooth and close with cotton after you have wash it with strong gumwater but care must be take that in lay on the guin you do not exceed the limit through which you would have the gold appear in this case the goldis only to shine through the transparent colour which be to be lay over it as leafgold will not receive watercolour regularly iit be necessary to be provide with water of oxgall and with this hiquor to stroke over the goldleaf by which it will receive any colour you be desirous of lay over it and will also retain it in june and july there may be find upon rosettree kind of beetle of gold and green colour which may prove extremely serviceable in this kind of painting but in ufe you gold it will be best the polish it in this manner in some manuscript there may be see gold letter which séem to rise above the surface of the paper the composition which raise they be make of ver milion and the white of a egg beat to the consistence of a oil and fix to the paper with gumarabic on this figurative letter wash some strong gumwater with camel s hair pencil lay on the goldleaf close with some cotton and when dry rub it again with icotton and burnish it with dog s tooth and it will appear as if it be really cast in gold there be also another way of work in gold which be perform by shellgold but then it must be pure and not that bring from germany which turn green in few day cover the shady part with vermilion before before yon use ihis gold and when you have rectify it with spirit of wine lay it on when dry burnish it as before direct in lay on this gold it be best to leave the light without it as it will appear to much greater advantage than if all the object be cover but provide the whole performance should chance to be cover the best way of set it off be to trace over the shady part with gallstone or the yellow make of french berry sof which we shall treat hereafter heighten with minium have treat thus much upon gold we shall now speak of yellow in general gambodge be beyond doubt one of the mellowest colour nature have pro duce it be of so mild temperature that when it be touch with any fluid it instantlydissolve so that consequently it want neither gum nor grind it be productive of à variéty of the most agréeable and pleafant yellow tint that fancy or art could ever imagine it will generally shade itself though you will sometimes find in the description of flower it require help gallstone be very rich deep yellow tend toward brown exceed useful in many case need but little gum or grind work free but will not shade itself mo . boyle say if you cut the root of berberry and put they into strong lixivium make of pearlashy and water from they will proceed very agreeable yellow this experiment have often be make and as often attend with success he also give a account of another sine transparent yellow by boiling the root of mulberrytree well cleanse in the forego lixivium yellow yellowochre make very good pale yellow and be ground with gumwater will prove extremely useful another very useful yellow be make by infuse the plant celandine in clear water gently press it adding to the liquor some alum water let it boil the virtue of the yellow extract from french berry be so well know that we need not discourse upon it but only give the direction for prepare it in quart of the precede lixivium boil two ounce of french berry till the liquor be of fine yello strain it from the yellow berry and when cold it be fit for use to the berry put pint of the same ixivium and boil it till the liquor be as strong as gallstone with which you may shade anyyellous this you may boil till it come to brown ald will with the addition of alittle oxgall serve to fhade the gold leaf you may likewise make yellow by infuse saffron in pure water when this be steep in rectify spirit of wine there be nothing higher but it be very apt to fly unless it be high guin good yellow for the illumination of print may be extract from the root of ginger which make good green when mix with transparent verdigrise those yellow call english and dutch pink be make with french berry ground to fine powder and then boil king s yellow fine body
