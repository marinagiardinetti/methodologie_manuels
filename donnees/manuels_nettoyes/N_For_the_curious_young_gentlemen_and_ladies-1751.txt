ONE of the Arts, which have been invented for the Ufe or Amufement of Mankind, can boaft
to great  Number of Admirers as that of DRAwINC; and very juftly, for it gives fuch an agree-

able Reprefentation of Things, that we are apt to fancy we fee Objects which have no real Exifience,
and that the Imagery before us, which is no more than  painted Cloth, actually breathes. The whole
Creation, with all its Works and Wonders, comes within the Power of its imitation.  fets before us
Things long fince buried in Oblivion, exhibits to perfect View the moft noted Actions of People who
have been long in their Graves, and thews as our Anceffors, in  perfect Refemblance of their Fearures,
thro' feveral fucceffive Generations. There is fcarce any Art or Profettion which receives not fome
Affiftance from DRAwINC; without her Help, no Defigns or Mcdels can be well executed; to her
the Mathematician, Archifect and Navigator is continually indebted; no Station of Life is exempted
from the Practice of it, from the General at the Head of an Army, to the Mechanic, who fubfifts by his
Handicraft. This excellent Art feems inculcated by Nature herfelf, for we fee it not only practifed by
grown Proficients, but even Children frequently drawing various Figures, and that to curioully, as even
to aftonith us with their Productums.
That therefore Fouth may be inftructed how to attain to  good Degree of Perfection in the Art, we
shall prefcribe the beft Rules we are able, at leaft fuch, as we apprehend, are abfolutely neceftary
for their Information; after which, we shall give them fome very ufeful and pertinent Inftructions for
their betrer underftanding of this Art.
     for the Direction of the young Practitioner in the Art of DEAW IN .

RAWING may be defined,  Reprefentacion, by Lines and Shades, of any Object in Nature or
 Art; the imitation of another Draught, or the exprefting the Likeness of fomething conceived in

our own Mind. In lmitations of Nature, or copying from any Draught, the Form and Shape of the
Figures is the firtt Thing that makes an Impreftion on the Mind, which is afterwards reduced into
Form by manual Operation, which draws the Lines; hence appears the Neceflity of frequently employ-
 the Mind in curioutly obferving whatever Objects are propoted to it, by which Wleans it will be
more capable of conceiving rruly and exactly of Objects, and the Hland will more eafily and juftly de-
lineate that which is to ftrongly fixed in the Memory.
: is highly neceilary for him who would draw well, to underfland what is truly good and beauti-
ful in  Draught : In order to which, the moft expeditious Method will be, to compare Prints and
Draughts together. Many Painters have grievoully mifcarried, by fatisfying themfelves only with imitat-
ing had Pieces, without giving any Scope to their own Genins, of improving their Knowledge in judg-
ing of the Beauties and Defects of  Picture. The Ideas in our own Minds may in  great Meafure
ferve us for  Model, and to improve thefe, we should frequently examine the Performances of others,
and our Obfervations on Pieces that are efteemed correctly done, should be nice and critical; we should
attentively confider every Print and Draught we fee, and every Beauty we find in it, endeavour to fix on
our Memory, particularly the Freedom and Boldness of the Out-lines, and the Proportion
of the feveral Parts. Above all Things it is neceffary that the Judgment be rightly informed, for then
the voung Practitioner will make the greater and quicker Progress in his Improvement, than if he goes
on in Practice without encreafing his Knowledge; for his Succets will be more owing to his Genins
thin his Hand.
The Labour of the Hand muft indeed aid and affift that of the Brain; for whoever would be an able
Arrift, muft, by continual Practice, make the Art habitual. The Rules of all Arts are foon learned,
but to attain Perfection in any of them,  long Pradice and striet Attention are abfolutely requifite. It
is  true Mexim, that Laziness was never the Parent of any Thing excellent. Drawing is not attain-
able har by  Length of Time, nor Perfection in it acquirable, unless the Iland be frequently employed
in the Pultice, and the Mind in judging; every Day should produce fomething, and the Hand give
frequent Proofs of the Speculations of the Head.
Ac some Part of every Day should be spent in the Practice of this Art, we would recommerd the
Murning as fitteft for that Purpofe; which therefore should be employed in perfecting yourfeives
both in Judgment and Practice.
He


 

 


 


 who propofes to gain an Entrance into Minerva’ Cabinct, muft make his Approaches gradually;
thus in the Art of Drawing, tho' the Reprefentation of the human Figure, or many Figures in  Piece,
be the principal Object which every Practitioner has chieffy in View; yet he muft not make this his firft
Effay, but proceed to that by proper and regular Steps. Let the firft Part of his Study be to draw Rreight
and curved Lines, (quare, round, regular, irregular and inanimate Figures; allo Parts of human Figures,
as the Rye, the Ear, the Hland, Feet, oc. This will be  good Foundation whereon to erect his future
Structure; for by this Means he will acquire  Readiness of Hand,  Freedom and Exactnets in drawing
Lines, and accuffom himself to the Exercife of his Patience; Qualifications abfolutely necellary for one
who would be eftcemed an exact Copier of Nature, especially in Pieces that require  Length of Time,
and more than ordinary Skill in the Performance: He who begins well, has more than half perform’ his
Work.
The Out-lines are the circumferent Strokes of  Figure; the Perfection of  good Out-line confifts in
the Freedom and Boldness of the Stroke, and the due Proportion of all its Parts: To attain which, the
Scholar is admonithed to reject all mean and trifling Practices, fuch as tracing the Originals thro' oil’
Paper, or making ufe of thin Paper for the fame Purpofe, or taking Advantage of an artificial Light.
The fe of fuch Deceptions will certainly prevent all Progress and Improvements in Drawing. Neither
should the Rule and Compaffes be ufed, except in Arcbitetfure, or to raife  Perpendicular, in order to
form  Square, or fome other Figure to draw in; or, when an Artift has finithed his Draught, he takes
this Method to compare it with the Original, to fee whether there is an Agreement between them; how-
ever, the bare Eye, if ufed to it, will be fufficient for fuch  Difcernment.
For forme Tune at firft, be fatisfied with practifing upon  good Out-line, without aiming at 
finithed Piece, nor is it neceffary that you should, as yet, hatch or fhade your own Draught; your
Out-line at firft maft be sketch’ with flight and faint Touches, that you may have an Opportunity
to amend it where proper, which fo will have the less Appearance of being retouched. In every Stroke
endeavour an exact Imitation, and whenever you mend the Out-line, either by taking away  little of
its Parte, or by swelling the others, be fure to lofe nothing of the Freedom and Boldness of it. Mind
frequently to compare your Copy with the Original, take particular Notice of what is amiss, and let not
the


 leaft Fault efcape uncorrected, that fo in the Draught, which you may afterwards make of the
fame Original, thofe Errors may be avoided; for you muft not pass from one Original to another, tiil
you are in  good Degree Mafter of the firft. The beft and jureft Method of Practice is, to make 
great Number of Sketches of the fame Figure, in each of which endeavour to excel what you did in
the former.
In your firtt Operations proceed flowly, for hafty Productions are feldom beautiful or correct, and 
Defign is often thus spoiled in the firft Attempt; it is no eafy Matter to amend had Habits; Expedition
in Performance is acquired by  Conftancy in Practice. As the young Beginner will have frequent Occa-
tion for the Exercife of his Patience, he muft be careful to fubdue his Paftions; in his firfl Attempts he
mutt proceed deliberately and flowly, and ufe his utmoft Endeavours to perform well, fecure every Stroke,
and try all his Skill to make one good Draught, rather than to hurry over, in  negligent Manner,  great
Number of bad ones.
When you fit down to work, and all the Time you are at it, rake  srict and clofe View of your
Original, and in your Mind divide it into feveral Parts; take due Notice of the Length, Breadch, and
Similitude of each Purt; observe the Proportion of each to the other, and to the Whole, the Diltances
between the Parrs, and the Parts that lie parallel, or are exactly oppolite to each other.
When you have finithed your Copy, and laid afide both the Example and Draught, let your Mind
be employ’ for fome Time on other Affairs, then return to it again, and view your Work afreth, and
 probably you will difcover Faults which did not appear to you before.  eafy to imagine, that
when the Eves have been engaged  confiderable Time on the fame Object, the Form and Shape of it
become familiar to him, and that on  Revifal his Mind may entertain different Notions of it than in
the Light it appear’ before; and affure yourfelf, whatever Pains you beflow in reviewing and com-
paring your Copy with the original Draught, in order to difcover and amend your Faults, will vot
be ufelets; but you will find this Advantage in it, that it will be  Means of perfecting you in that
particular Draught, and improve you in the Knowledge of Lines, Draughts and Proportions, and by
continuing to practite this Method, you will in  litde Time find yourfelf qualified for the exacteft
Imitations.
Let


 your Out-lines be large and finooth, and drawn in  flowing gliding Manner; for if they are too
streight they will carry  difagreeable Stiffness, but if drawn according to this Direction, they will have
the Refemblance of Life and Motion, and appear with an eaty Grace.
In all your Draughts let there be  perfect Relation between the Parts and the Whole, and Uniformity
run thro' the whole Piece, that is, let every Member be made for its own Hlead, and agree with it; you
muft not put firong Limbs to  Body that is confumptive, or to old Age in its Decay; nor muft you be
lets exact in pairing the Eyes, Ilands, Legs and Feet, for the leaft Dilproportion will be  Blemith; or
when any of the Limbs are not proportionate to the reft. In the Inftructions which we shall prefently
give, the Learner will find Directions to avoid any fuch Miltakes and Solecifins.
When you draw the Mufcles, take Care to infert them according to the Rules of Anaromy; they muft
not be crouded into fmall Sections, but kept as entire as poffible, and only the principal Mufcles ex-
preffed; in  Member which is to express any particular Force, they muft be thewn large, as in the Leg
when it fupports the Body, or in the Arm when it lifts  Weight, Oc. and be more (well’ than in any
other Members.
Thus when the Limbs and Members are drawn with few and large Mufcles, they thew themfelves
with Majetty and Beauty; fo in Draperies, the Beauty of which confifts not in  Multiplicity of Folds,
but in their plain Simplicity and natural Order. The Drapery muft feem to cover the Part loofely, for if
it be too clofe and Hreight, the Piece will appear too fiff; the Plaits muft be large, folding naturally
over the Parts which are to be feen underneath, which is done by placing properly the Lights and Shades.
In covering both the Extremities of the Joints, fuch as the Shoulders, Elbows, Knees, Oc. Care muft
be taken to mark them in fuch  Manner as to diftinguith their Shape. And in Fact, Drapery is no
trifling or intignificant Part of this Art; for, if well done, it adds  new Grace to the Picture, gives an
enlivening Air to its other Beauties, and never fails of pleafing the Eyes of the Spectator,
 MATERIALS proper for Drawing

HE Materials neceffary for this Purpofe, are either Pencils of Black Lead, or Black Lead fixed in
 Porcrayon, Charcoal, Chalk black, red and white, Paftils or Crayons, Pens, Hair-Pencils, and
Indian Ink.
Nothing is more proper for Beginners to practife with than Black Lead, in drawing plain Lines, Coc.
eSpecially as this makes  fmoother Stroke than can be done by Charcoal or Crayons. Cut your Lead
with  Penknife till you have brought it to  fine Point, that it may give  neat fnall Stroke. Or you
may fix  Piece of the same Lead in  Porcrayon. But whatever it is you fketch with, ute yourfelf to
hold it long-ways in your Hand, and let your Fingers be much farther from the Point than the Nip of
 Pen is when you write, and let your Strokes be formed with light gentle Touches; ihus will you gra-
dually acquire  ready Command of Hland, and you will with Eafe make your Our-line free and bold.
In practifing after Limbs and Figures it will be proper, at firfl, to draw the rough Skerch with Char-
coal, which is more eafily discharged from Paper than Slack Lead. Slir your Charcoul in Imall flender
Pieces, one of which fix in  Porcrayon the better to hold it; then tharpen it to  Point, and lightly,
but correctly, fketch out your Original. When you have to done, if there is any Thing you miflike in
the Performance, you may eafily wipe it out by bruthing it with  Feather or clean Rag. When you
have fecured your Out-lines with Charcoal, proceed thus; take  Feather and wipe them flightly over
with it that they may appear faint, then go over the Lines with Black or Red-Lead, and correct them
wherever you can. If after all this you slill fee any Errors to amend, take  Bit of Crumb of  Htale
white Loaf, with which you may difcharge any Part of it you pleafe, by rubbing it therewich.
You may afe Red-Lead, or Red or Black Chalk in the fame Manner as Blick-Lead.
If in Heightnings, or when you would give ftrong Lights, or draw on colour’ Puper, ufe white Chalk
and Tobacco-pipe Clay.
Piffils


 and Crayons are Terms which perhaps the Learner may not readily underfland; they are Colours
mixed up with Tobacco-pipe Clay, which muft be worked into  Pafte, and rolled up into the Thicknels
of  Cuill two or three Inches long, and then dried; when fit for Ufe, the Artiff works with them on
colour’ Paper, but not in Hlatchings, as Black and Red-Lead commonly are; the Colours are rubbed
and worked together, to that there is no fingle Stroke, but the whole appears as if only  Brush had been
ufed.
The Crayons is  very expeditious Manner of Drawing, and when skilfully handled, always produce 
delicate Softness and fine Expreftion; however, it muft be obferved, that the careless or rude Touch of 
Finger may at once blot out all the Beauties of this fine Work; to prevent which, let it be preferved in
Books, or in  Frame under  Glafs. The Crayons will be work’ more eafily if the Grain of the Paper
be  little rough, and be express’ more flrongly than when the Paper is quite finooth; or if the Paper
be fomewhat dark or brownith, or what they call  whiced-brown, it will give  Relief to the tender
Parts of the Work, by shewing the light Strokes of it.
In Chading Draughts fometimes Pens are afed for harching the cross Strokes; however, the Hair Pencil
and Indian Ink ferve much better for this Ofe, which are not only proper for hatching by Strokes, but for
thading by  Method much more expeditious, that is, by Wathing, which is the fame Way of working
as with Hair Pencils and Water Colours. In Hatching, the Shades are produced by Lines, not unlike
the Strokes which fhade  Print engraved; but in Washing, no Lines appear, but the Shades thew them-
selves like thofe in  Metsitinto Print.
Of the Tints of Lights and Shadores.
 and Shades, when judiciouly difpoted, give the Appearance of Subftance, Nature and
Diftance to fuch Bodies as the Pencil repretents. Suppofe, for Iaftance,  Circle drawn on  Piece

of Paper; imagine you fee it fill’ up with any even Colour, you can conceive of it no otherwife than
as  round, flat equal Body; but if you put the Hrongeft of the Colour in the Middle, and weaken it

 towards the Extremities, you will perceive an agreeable Deception, and inslead of  flat even
Body, it will have the Refemblence of  Ball or Globe.
Wherever the Colour appears the moft lively, there the Object catches the Eye firft, and teems neareft
to ir; but where the Colour weakens and goes off, it grows faint, and at length feems to tly off and
break away from the Sight. Thus the Painter, by breaking and diminithing his Colours, throws that
behind which he has  Mind shall be lefs vifible.
When you round the Parts of an Object, it requires the niceft Touch of the Pencil to draw the Ex-
tremities to, as that in tarning they shall lofe themfelves infensibly and confafedly, without too fudden 
o of the Light into the Shadows, or of the Shadows into the Light, but let the one pass into
the other as it were reciprocally and imperceptibly, that is, by Degrees of Light inmo Sh:dow and Shadow
into Light.
When your Objects are to be painted light, you muft allow  due Breadth of Shadow to fustain them;
if dark,  fudden Light muft rife behind them, to feparate them from the Ground, or from other Objects
that are placed behind them, or elfe they will appear as if they were sticking upon each orher in  con-
fated Manner; whereas by  juft Opposition of Light to Shade and Shade to Light,  Projection is given,
which makes  Separation of the Objects.
Vou muft keep  proper Ballance between Light and Shadows, and in introducing  broad Light into
your Draught, you muft give it  large Shadow. You muft make your Lights ferve as  Repote to the
Darks, and the Darks to the Lights; thus  Drapery, which is coloured red or yellow in some Places, in
others will take  brown with  good Effect,
The hye fees an Objet the more frongly and plainly the nearer it is; Diftance werkens the Sight;
the farther off an Object is, the more imperfectly it is perceived; thofe Objects therefore which fland
neareft to View should be better finith’ than thofe which are thrown bekind; but obferve, that they
muft have  reciprocal Dominion over each other, to that as one Object by its Heightenings forces others
to appear at  Dillance, to the fame Object maft be thrown farther from the Sight, than others which
are illuminated more krongly.
It


 should be farther obferved in regard to Lights and Shades, that it is not enough that remote Ob-
jects be coloured in  more faint and langaid Manner, but the more or less diffant they are, the Parts
should appear more or lefs confufed; the Eye cannot minutely difcriminate an Object which is at 
Diffance from it. We can fee human Figures at  Streer' Length, but cannot difcern the Features of
their Faces or the Plaits in their Cloarns; to the innumerable Leaves of  diftant Grove appear to the
Sight but as one MMass.
White, pure and unmixed, has two different Properties, it draws an Object nearer to it, and it car-

ries it off to  farrher Diftance.
When it is placed with Black, the Opposition of Light and
Dark brings the Object more into View, and renders it more fenfible; but pure White, as it is the
lighteft of Colours, will fy off to the remoteft View, unless forced forwards, and fupported by Black.
On the other Hand, pure Black is deemed the heavieff, moft earthy and moft fenfible of all Colours,
and prefents Objects nearer to the Sight; you muft caft it into Maffes, confufe it infenfibly, and give it
its proper Repofes.
In the Reprefentations of Bodies, you muft always give them fuch Lights as are moft proper and con-
venient for their fppofed Situations. Suppofe the Objects before you be in the Fields or open ffir, and
the Sun obicured with Clouds, your Bufiness is to introduce an univerfal Light, tho' not vivid or frong,
your Shades too muft be faint. But when the Sun appears in all its Glory, your Lights muft then be
very flrong and bold, and the Shadows exceeding dark.
Suppofe again, that the Object you reprefent is in  Room,  little, tho' not very much illuminated,
and to furvey it you take your Station without, and ftand level with the Light that ftrikes upon it,
that Figure muft have very foff Shadows, which will thew it very beautifully, and tho' the Shadow be
to foft, yet the Figure will feem as if it were emboffed, and have  very hold Appearance.
When  fmall Light illuminates  Body, the Shadows on the dark side appear large, and their Ex-
tremities very bold; whereas  large Light renders the Shadows on the darker Side more diftinct and
much fofter in their Limitations.

 Instructions for the young Prattitioner.
HOEVER would make any Proficiency in the Art of Drawing, muft firft underftand Geome-
try; for it is by this, and the Help of Lines, that we are instructed to take the Length and
Largeness of Bodies, and know whether they be streight or curve, round, oval, square, or any other
imaginable Figure. But as it is not our Bufinets here to treat of Geometry, or give thofe Geometri-
cal Rules which are ufed in the Art of Drawing, we shall refer the Learner to Le Clerc'’ Practical Geo-
metry.
He that would be  perfect Mafter in the Art of Drawing, muft learn to (Ketch well, to which
therefore he ought to give the greatelt Attention. In copying  Statue, fome Perfons begin with the
Head, which they entirely finith before they proceed any farther; by which means it frequently hap-
pens, that they either make the Head too little or too big, and the other part to difproportionate, that
there is but small Refemblance of the Original, occafioned chiefly thro'  Want of duly obferving Di-
fances. When therefore you have any Thing to draw, let your firft Care be to divide it into its diffe-
rent Parts, then meafure the Diftances in the Original with your Eye, mark the Diftances and Length
of each Divifion with  faint Line on your Paper, and make  Sketch of the whole Figure before you
proceed to finith any Part of it; fo will you fecure the Proportions in the exacteft Manner.
The Learner will find among thefe Examples feveral Draughts of the Parts of the Face, as the Eyes,
Nofe, Mouth,  viewed in different Pofitions, all which he should practife upon before he attempts 
whole Face; for which Purpofe we shall lay down fuch Leffons and Inftructions concerning an Oval,
with its feveral Changes and Variations, and of the Cross in the fame, as will enable him to figure all
Bowings and Returnings, Reclinations and Inclinations of all Sorts of Faces.
The Head, you are to obterve, has the Shape and Form of an Egg, or Oval; this Head has Eyes,
Eye-brows, Nofe and Ears, which must be placed in their proper Situations, by running . Cross thro'
the Oval. By this Means you will divide the Perpendicular in the Oval into four equal Parts, which
will make the Head to meafure four Nofes in Height, the Face three only; the Diamerer crofting the
Perpendicular, divide into five Parts, each being the Breadth or Wideness of one Eye; this Diameter
is called the ocular Line, or that whereon the Lyes are to be placed; you muft therefore draw  Rreight
Line


II.
Line from the Top of the right Ear thro' both Eyes to the Top of the left Ear; and the Line drawn
from the Top of the Head down thro' the Nofe, Mouth and Chin, is called the Perpendicular, cross-
ing the Diameter or Ocular-line at right Angles; thefe Lines together we call the Cross of the Oval;
upon which Crots (whatever Situation the Face is in) you muft place the Eyes, Nofe, Mouth and Ears
in proper Places.
When you underfland this thoroughly, and have fixed it in your Mind, you will foon be able to
draw good Faces out of your own Fancy and Invention, and execute them in  mafterly Manner: But
if you accuftom yourfelf to draw only after  Print, Draught or Picture, without knowing the fe of
the Crots-lines; and the Proportion of  Face with its Parts, you take  wrong Method, don' Know
what you are about, and will never attain to any Degree of Perfection.
Having thus inftracted you in the feveral Methods of drawing  Face, we come now to give you
the Dimenfions and Proportions of the feveral Parts of the Body.
It was cuftormary with the Antrents to allow eight Hleads to their Figures, tho' fome of them have
only feven. The Moderns ufually divide  Figure into ten Faces, taking if at the Crown of the Head,
and ending at the Sole of the Foot, thus:
From the Crown of the Head to the Forehead, is the third Part of the Face.
The Face takes it Beginning at the Root of the loweft Ifairs on the Forehead, and its End is at the
Bottom of the Chin.
Painters divide the Face into three proportional Parts; namely, the Forehead, the Nofe, the Mouth
and Chin.

The Diftance from the Chin to the Pit betwixt the Collar-bones, meafures two Lengths of  Nofe.
From the fame Pit to the Bottom of the Breaft, one Face.
From thence to the Navel, one Face.
From the Navel to the Privities, one Face.
The Diffance from the Genitals to the upper Part of the Knee, two Faces.
The Knee itfelf meafures half  Face.
Meafure from the lower Part of the Knce to the Ancle, and you will find it two Faces.
From the Ancle to the Sole of the Foot, is half  Face.
When


  Man firetches out his Arms as wide as he can,  line drawn from the Top of the longeft
 of the right Hland to the Top of the longeft Finger on the left, will meafure the Length of his
whole Body, or he will find himself as broad as he is long.
The Diftance from Side to side of the Breafts, two Faces.
The Bone of the Arm called Humerus, from the Shoulder to the Elbow, meafures two Faces.
The Bone called Cubirus, with part of the Hland, meafuring from the Tip of the Elbow to the
Root of the little Finger contains two Faces.
From the Box of the Shoulder-blade to the Pit betwixt the Collar-bones, is one Face.
In taking the Meafurement of the Breadth, from the Extremity of one Finger to the other, to fee
if it be equal to the Length of the Body, you are to obferve that the Boxes of the Elbows with the
Humerus, and of the Humerys with the Shoulder-blade, bear the Proportion of half the Face, when the
rms are fretched out.
The Sole of the Foot meafures the fixth Part of the Figure.
The Hand is the Length of the Face.
The Thumb, of the Nofe.
From the Place where the Pectoral Mufcle, or that Mufcle which makes the Breaft, difappears, to
the Middle of the Arm, meafures four Nofes.
Carry your Meafure from the Middle of the Arm to the Begining of the Hand, you will find
it five Nofes.
Your longeft Toe is the length of your Nofe.
The Tops of the two Nipples, and the Pit betwixt the two Collar-bones, make an equilateral Triangle.
No certain Meafures can be given for the Breadth of the Limbs; becaufe even the Meafures are
changeable according to the different Quality of the Perfons, and Movement of the Mufcles.
Thefe farther Rules are to be observed in drawing  Head, viz.
You muft fet the Eyes at fuch  Diftance from one another, that you may place one between them.
 Mouth, when thut, has the Dimenfions of an Eyc.
The Ears are always on  Level with the Eyes, -top and below with the Nofe, whether it be short
or long.
The



 Noltril should be placed exactly againft the Corner of the Eyc.
In  Face that is flat, the Cheeks fwell out, and in one that is lean, the Checks fall in, and the Jaw-
bones fland out.
Having finifhed our Inftructions for the drawing of the Face, let us now proceed to draw  Man at
full Length.
In the firft Place you muft make your Oval, then divide it as before directed; you then draw  Per-
pendicular Line from the Top of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, which you muft divide into eight
Lengths. This will be  good Direction in placing your Figure upright, or in whatever Action the
Pofture requires, where it either falls in or fwells out. You muft make the Length of one Head be-
tween the Chin and the Breafts, the third Meafure muft reach to the Navel, the fourth from thence to
the Genitals, the fifth to the Middle of the Thigh, the fixth comes to the lower Part of the Knee, the
feventh to the lower Part of the Leg, and the laft reaches to the Heel or Sole of the Foot.
In every Meafure or Divifion you muft take particular Notice what Touches there are of the Mufcles.
The Leg muft be firft drawn on which the Body slands, then the other, after which draw the
Arms and Hands. You muft at firft draw all the Parts very lightly only with  Coal, becaufe that
will give you the leaft Trouble in rubbing out or altering.
The Hlands you muft observe, are twice as long as broad, and each of their Parts has its particular
Length, Breadth and Thickness.
The Nail of the Finger makes about half the Joint it is upon.
The Leagth of the Foot meafures  fixth Part or Ileight of  Man, or five Righths more in
Length than in Breadth.
Take Noice, that the Length of the Face and Hlands are exactly equal, and is juft the tenth Part
of  Perton' Height.
Having thus indructed you to draw  complete Man, we shall in the next Place lay down fome
Rules for the drawing of Children.
Some will have the Length of  Child to contain five Meafures of the Head, as thus: From the
Top of the Head they make three, and the Thighs and Legs two more; the Breadth between the
Shoulders is the Leagth of  Head and  half; the Breadth of the Body above the Navel, the Length
Of



 one Head; and the Breadth of the thickeff Part of the Thigh is one Third of two Lengths of the
Head; the Breadth of the Knee meafures exactly the Diftance between the Eyes and the Chin; the
Brawn of the Arm and Small of the Leg are jutt the Thickness of the Neck.
If you take the Proportion of  Child ftanding backward, you will find it of the fame Meafure as
the former.
If you are defirous of drawing  Piece well proportioned, you muft be very careful and attentive to
copy all the feveral Parts fingly, as the Eyes, Ears, Cc.
.VL Es for silling
up empty Figures.
HU  far we have treated of Colours and Out-lines; we come now to infiruct the Learner, how
to fill up the empty Figures, and to mark the Hlatchings to as to produce the beft Effect.

In the firft Place obferve that your Hlatchings muft confift but of two Strokes, croffing each other,
or at moft three, to make the ftrongeft Shades. Where the Cavities are fuch as require the whole Force
of your Lead or Crayon, you muft rub it upon your Paper as you fee Occafion; for it would be  need-
lets Trouble to employ more than three Hatchings one upon another.
When with your Charcoal you have drawn the Out-lines, you muft retouch them with your Red-
lead Crayon, and then with  Feather bruth away the Dirtinets of the Charcoal. When you have done
that, you muft retouch with  gentle Hand fuch Places as have been fouled in the rubbing, as the
Hair, Eyes, Nofe, Mouth, Fingers, Toes, Out-lines,  Let me alfo caution you, that in those Outs
lines which are open to Day, you make your Strokes very light, but Aronger in thofe which are darkened.
Thus will the Out-lines appear in  natural Manner, and add  wonderful Beauty and Grace to human
Figures and all other Objects. When this is done, you muft begin the Shades with  fingle Hatching,
but pretty flrong; you begin it at the Top, proceeding infenfibly to the Bottom, as evenly in the Di-
stances as you poffibly can. You then go on to the Roundings, which you muft allo express by fingle
Strokes, with fuch  Light as the Object before you requires; be cautious not to make your Shadows too
hard or dark at firft. If you would preferve the Perspective in the beft Manner, begin the Shadows
lightly and faintly, and heighten them afterwards; and you will foon be pleafed with the agreeable Effect.
Instructions


 how to draw after  Picture,  Model, or the Life.

AVIN  given you the neceffary Instructions for drawing Prints and Draughts, we shall, in the

  latt Place, direct you how to draw after  Picture,  Model or the Life, and in what Manner you
are to place them.
When you have got  Picture to draw after, be fure to place it in  good Light, to that the Sight
of your Eye and the Light of the Day may fall together on the Picture. Place yourfelf at  moderate
Diftance, according to the Largeness or Smallnets of the Picture, at lealt no farther off than that you
may, with  Glance of your Eye, fee the whole Picture at once; for the larger the Picture is, at the
greater Diftance you muft fit to draw it. Be careful likewife to place your Print exactly right before
you, and let it not he down flat; for if it be laid flat, you will quickly fee the Figures in it fore-
shorten’. The Paper you draw upon you muft lay five or fix Times double upon  Pannel Board fet
in your Lap, and raifed as high as you can with your Knees, or let it be refted on  Form or flooping
Defk, to that your Work may fland upon one End before you. Thus will you be enabled to judge
of the Similitude between your Draught and the Original, which it will be impoftible for you to do if
it lies flat before you. The next Thing you have to do is, to guets as near as you can at the Middle of
the Thing you have to draw, whether  Picture or any other Matter; then mark it on your Paper
with the Point of your Coal; when you have done this, look for the largeft Figures (if there happens to
be more than one) and touch them lightly in proper Places, and to all that is in the Picture, you will
then prefently difcover whether your Gueffing and Sketching be true or not : But befides this, before
you draw  Stroke, be fure you do it with good Reafon and Obfervation, and be very careful about the
great and general Parts, and meddle not with the small Breakings till the next Sketching, and by con-
stantly practifing in this Manner, you will infenfibly acquire  Facility and Judgment in your Work.
Another Rule you are to obferve is, always to begin on the right side of the Figure, for to you have
the firft Strokes conflantly in your Eye, and the reft will naturally follow and give less Trouble: But
if you begin on the left Side, your Hand covers the Object from your Sight. Having thus made 
rough Skeich, you should carefully review and examine it, and fee if it be done according to Art, and
if


 the Action of the Figure or Figures in it be antwerable to the Original; now, as Actions are the
Life of  Picture, they muft thew themfelves in the firft Draught however rude it be, or you can never
expect it will be happily finithed. You muft then correct your Sketch and improve it in Neatness and
Air, by adding and diminithing as you fee proper, as you may eafily do with your Charcoal. But in do-
ing this, be mindful that you don' fpoil the firft good Actions in  which may eafily be done, if you
don' well obferve the Movements of the feveral Parts
You muft be careful to admit nothing into your Work that is improper or foreign to the Subject of
it, and to let nothing trifling have the chief Place in it.
If you can, always make choice of  North Ligbt for your Situation, becaufe it is less variable than
any other. Should you fit at  South Window, you will find it proper to place  Safh of oil’ Paper
before it, which will break the Intenfeness of the Sun' Rays, and diffufe them more equally without
any fenfible Variation. In drawing after the Life, you are to confider the Bigness or Size of the Object
you have to reprefent, and remove from it to the Diftance of three Times its Magnitude, and be feared
in fuch  Manner as that your Eye may be on  Level with it, and at every Stroke you draw be cu-
ricus to obferve what Parts of your Object lie under the Perpendicular or principal Line.
The next Thing you have to do is, to put your Figure, whether it be the Life or  Model, in 
proper Polition; the beft Light is that which is high and equally diffated, not too frong nor glaring;
when Objects are to dispoted you fee all their Beauties, and the minuteft Parts thew themfelves to Ad-
vantage. But this you are to obfervg, that in drawing from the Life, that your Light should come
from such an Altitude, as that the Shadows of Bodies projected on the Plane, be equal, and in propor-
tion to their Height. So that the Ligbt does not firike upon or enlighten all the Parts, fome of which
are theltered by the Protuberance of others; the Eyc-brows over-(hade the Hollow of the Eyc, the
Nofe hides fome Part of the Mouth, and the Throat is obfcur’ by the Chin. For this Reafon Pour-
trait Painters blind all the Windows of the Room they work in, except one, the lower Part whereof
they clofe up, and let the Light in from the upper only, which Irikes upon the Object they are
painting after, while themfelves are beneath the Light.


 Directions for the young Painter.

THE Instructions we have hitherto given the young Beginner, have been pretty much in the gene-
ral; we shall now introduce him into every Part of his Work, by fuch particular Directions,  Arictly observing them, will make him  compleat Draughtfiman.
For drawing the Face.
HEN you have drawn the Circle of the Face (which you muft do at firft with  plain circular
 Line,  thout making any Bending or Indentures in or out) make  Stroke from that Place of the
Forehead which is even with the Chin, Town the Place where you intend to fix the Middle of the Nofe,
and the Middle of the Mouth; this Stroke, you muft obferve, muft be ftruck that Way which the Face
should turn, either to one Side, or ftrait down, which Stroke will be  great Help to you in plaring the
Features rightly, to that they may not fland all awry, but directly one under another. Now if the Face
turn downward, the Stroke muft be ftruck in fuch  Manner that the Eyes may tarn anfwerable with the
Face downwards; when you have done that, make another Stroke for the Length of the Nofe where the
End of it should come, and another Stroke for the Mouth, that it be not made crooked, ftill obferving
to make all the Strokes to turn one Way, up or down, according as the Pace turns, that is, if the Face
turns up or down, the Eyes, Nofe and Mouth muft turn with it; when you have made thefe Strokes
exactly, proceed to plice the Features according to the preceding Rules.
In the Face is ufually obferved this threefold Proportion.  From the Top of the Forehead to the
Eye-brows.  From the Eye-brows to the Bottom of the Nofe.  From thence to the Bottom of the
Chin. This Proportion however is not conflantly the fame; for in fome Perfons the Forehead is lower
than in others, the Nofe of fome longer, and of fome fhorter than others; and therefore this Rule can
only be obferv’ in  well proportion’ Facc. The Diffance between the two Eyes is juft the Length of
one Eye, if in  full Face; but if it turn any thing afide, then that Diftance is leffened accordingly; the
Woliil
 ought not to come out farther than the Corner of the Eye in any Face, and the Mouth muft be
always placed between the Eyes and the Chin, juft under the Nofe.
As the greateft Difficulty, and principal Part of this Art lies in the lively drawing of the Face,  shall
add thefe farther Directions to perfect you in this particular Branch of your Prt.
Firft, if you would draw  Face exactly, to as to refemble the Original you draw it from; you mutt in
the firft Place take Notice of the Phyfiognomy or Circumference of the Face, whether it be long or round,
fat or lean, big or little, that to you may be fure to draw the Phyfiognomy, or Bigness of the Face right;
if it be  fat Face, you will perceive the Cheeks to make the Side of the Face fwell out, and to make the
Face look as if it were square; if it be  lean Face, the Jaw-bone will stick out, and the Checks fall in,
and the Face will look long and flender; if it be neither too fat nor too lean, the Face will for the moft
part be round.
When you draw the utmoft Circumference of  Face, you muft take in the Head and all with it, other-
wife you may be deceived in drawing the true Bigness of  Face.
Secondly, you muft carefully and judicioufly obferve and difcern all the Mafter Touches, which give
Life to  Face, or difcover the Grace or Difpofition of the Mind, in which lies the whole Grace of the
Work, and the Credit of the Workman; thus  fmiling Countenance is eafily difcern’ in the Mouth,
when the Corners of it are  little turn’ up;  frowning Countenance in the Forehead, Eye-brows bend-
ing, and the Top of the Nofe between the Eyes fomewhat wrinkled;  fober and staid Countenance is
beft difcerned in the Eye, when the upper Eyc-lid comes fomewhat over the Ball of the Eye;  laughing
Countenance is eafily difcerned all over the Face, and to is an angry wrathful Countenance, by extraordi-
nary Frownings; there are allo some Touches about the Eyes and Mouth, which give Life and Spirit to
 Face, which you will by Degrees find out by frequently obferving and imitating the Works of the beft
MaRers,
Further


 Rules for the young Practitioner in Drawing.
 & OUR Charcoal being neatly Charpen’, you muft, in the drawing of  Face, firft lightly draw the
Out-Rroke, or Circumference of the Face exactly, according to the Bigness of the Pattern, making

it to fland fore-right, or to turn upwards or downwards according to your Pattern; then make some little
Touches, where the Features, namely, the Eyes, Nofe, Blouth, Chin, should be placed, not drawing them
exactly at the firtt; when you have thus lightly pointed out the Features, then begin to draw them more
exactly, and to proceed till the Face be finished; which being done, then add the Beard, and other Things
about it. In drawing  Side-face, you need not at firtt draw the Nofe, Mouth, and Chin, that fland in
the outmoft Line, but only make it firft but  bare Circumference, turning this Way or that Way, ac-
cording to the Pattern, and then make the Mouth, Nofe, and Chin, in their Places and jutt Proportion.
 Vou muft be fure to place the Mufcles in the right and proper Places; by the Mufcles  mean all
the Shadows that are caufed by fome Dents or Swellings in the Face, and be able to find out the Reafon
of every Mufcle, that to you may proceed to work with the more Judgment; the Mutcles will be moft
vifible in an old wither’ Face, and you muft firft draw the moft principal of them, and then you may
draw the more eafily the leffer within; be fure to be very exact in the placing of them, or you will spoil
your Draught be it ever to good.
 Obferve to make the Shadows rightly, and be careful not to make them too dark where they should
be faint; for if you do, you can never recover it to make it light again, and to the whole Face will be
marr’, and appear unhandsome; the Shadows are generally fainter and lighter in  fair Face than in  Complexion. When your Draught is finished, you will do well to give some hard Touches with
your Pen where the Shadows are darkeft, which will add  great Life and Grace to your Drawing.
When your Face is finithed, you come next to the Ears and Hair, wherein you muft obferve this Rule:
Having drawn the Out-line of it, you muft firft draw the principal Curl, or Mafter Stroke in the Hair,
which will guide you with eafe to do the leffer Curls which depend on them; always make your Curl
to bend, and turn exactly according to the Pattern, that they may hie loofe and faft, and not appear fliff,
Rubborn


 and unpliable. When you have drawn your Curls exactly, you muft in the laft Place ftrike in
the loofe flairs which hang carelessly out of the Curls.
The Face being drawn (which is the principal Thing in the Art) then proceed to the Ilands and Arms,
Legs and Feet, and to to full Bodies of Men and Women, which are the moft difficult Things, which if
you can attain to perform, with  well grounded Celerity, nothing will be difficult to you, but moft eafy,
as Flowers, Birds, Beafts, Ships, or any other Thing that is to be drawn by Hand.
Of drawing the Hlands and Feet.
 come now to speak particularly of the Hlands and Feet, which you ought to spend some Time
& about, before you come to whole Bodies; becaufe they will be too difficult for you to enter up-
on, till you have pretty well practifed your Iland in the drawing of other Things, more especially Hlands
and Feet, which are the moft difficult Members of the Body to draw, except the Face; by learning of
which you will attain the reft with less Difficulty and greater Perfection; and undoubtedly it is  Thing
highly commendable to draw  Hland lively and exactly, which hath fuch  Variety of Poftures and Action,
and you will find it no eafy Matter to imitate it in every one of them, with Spirit and Life, or without
some Lameness or Imperfection.
The Actions and Poftures of the Hland are fo various, that no certain Rule can be given for drawing of
them, only this in general; when you firft draw it with Charcoal, you are not to do it exactly, that is, you
muft not make all the Joints or Veins, or other Things, to appear more than lightly or faintly, and to
touch out the Bigness of the Hland, and the Manner of turning it with faint Touches, and not with hard
Strokes; if you have done that right, then you part the Fingers afunder, or clofe, according to your Pattern,
with the like faint Strokes; then mark that Place where any of the Fingers fland out from the others, and
make  faint Refemblance of it; having fodone, if you perceive your Draught to be right, proceed to draw
it more perfectly, and make the Bending of the Joint, the Wriff-bone, and other principal Things some-
what exactly. And, laftly, go over it again, and draw every fmall Bending, or Swelling of the Fingers,
and make the Nails, Knuckles, and Veins, to many of them as appear, and every Thing elfe that you can
Lifcern.
The


 Proportion of  Hand you have fufficiently defcribed in the Print, which thews how many Equa-
lities or equal Meafures there be in it, which you should endeavour to be acquainted with, that to you
may know when  Hland is well proportion’ with juft and equal Diftances. But you are to obferve this
Rule, or Exception, that according as the Hand turns one Way or other, the Proportions muft be thortned,
according as they appear to the Eye, as you may fee by the fore-thortning of the Hand in the Print; to
much as the Hand turns away from our Sight, to much it lofes of its ordinary Proportion, and is made to
thorten unto that Proportion that the Eye judges of it, nay, fometimes  whole Finger, fometimes two or
three, or more, are loft to our Sight, by the turning of the Hand another Way from us, and to they muft
be wholly left out, and not made. As to the Feet, it is not to difficult to draw them as it is the Hands,
and you muft proceed in the fame Method in the one as in the other.
When you can draw Llands and
Feet pretty well, then proceed to Arms and Legs, wherein is little Difficulty; after which you may pro-
ceed to whole Bodies.
RULEs to be observed in drawing the whole Body.
 WN the drawing of  Body, you muft begin with the Head, to which you muft give juft Proportion
and Bigness, becaufe all the Body muft be proportioned according to the Head.

 When you have drawn the Head, proceed to the Shoulders, and go on to the Trunk of the Body,
beginning at the Arm-pits (leaving the Arms till afterwards) and to draw down to the Hips on both Sides,
and be fure you obferve the exact Breadth of the Naift: When you have done thus, draw firft that Leg
on which the Body slands, and afterwards that which flands loofe, or from the Body, and laft of all the
Arms, and then the Hlands, either joined to the Body, or feparated from it, agreeable to your Pattern.
 Observe in your drawing to place the parallel Joints, Sinews and Mufcles, directly oppofite in  strait
even Line one againft the other, as the Shoulders, Arm-pits, Waift, Hips, Knees, and to every Thing
elfe, that one may not be higher or lower than the other, that the Body may not feem crooked or de-
formed, but every parallel Jont, Bend, Coc. may directly anfwer the other that is oppofite to it; to which
End you may flrike  ftrait Stroke directly cross the Shoulders, to direct you to place them even and frait
one againft the other, which you may likewife do in other Places, as the Arms, Waift, Hips, Thighs, or
any


 other Parts that are oppofite; where you should place the one even with the other; but you muft have
the fame Care in all Parts of the Body, as you have in one Place, where any Bendings or Members of the
Body have or do require  direct Opposition one to the other, you make ufe of this Help and Direction.
 Obterve, that if the Body turn one Way or other, then this Stroke muft be to sruck, that it may
anfiver the Bowing of the Body; thus, if the Body ficop  little downwards, you muft firike the Stroke
Rloping or fide-ways, in which Cafe you muft make the Shoulders and other Things which should be ftrait
againt one another, to be formewhat higher than one another, to that the Side which the Body turns upon,
the Shoulders and other Things that otherwife should be placed evehn againft the other, muft be made
formewhat lower than the other side, more or less according to the Stooping of the Body.
 As you are to be careful in the placing rightly all level or parallel Joints, Bendings, Sinews and Muf-
cles, to you muft be very exact in all perpendicular Joints, Mufcles,  that is, when you have drawn
the Out-lines of your Piece, and are come to draw the Joints and Mufcles that are within the Body, you
muft be as exact in placing them, that is, directly one againft another, as you are in placing thofe even that
are oppofite to one another.. To the End that you may place Things exactly perpendicular, that is, in 
Rrait Line one under another, you may ftrike  ftrait perpendicular Line from the Pit of the Throat down
where you difcern the parting of the Ribs, and
to the Privities, juft in the Middle or Seam of the Body
from thence strait down to the Feet; which Line will direct you to place Things perpendicularly even,
that the Body may fland frait upright, and not appear crooked or awty.
 Take Notice of the Bowings and Bendings that are in the Body, to make that Part which is oppoi
Tite to that which bends, to anfwer to it in bending with it; thus, if one Side of the Body is bent in, the
other side muft fland out antwerable to the kending in of the other side; if the Back bend out the Belly
must bend in; if the Belly- come in the Back muft stick our; if the Breech flick our, the Thigh that an-
fivers to it in Opposition, muft come in; to alfo in any other Part of the Body; as when the Knee bends
out, the Hams that antwer to it muft come in; and the fame Rule muft firictly be obferved in all other
Joints of the Body, otherwife the Body will be made grotly and abfurdly, and without any Proportion.
 Be careful to make all Things of an equal Proportion and Bigness, that one Arm, or Leg, be not big-
ger than the other, or one Breaft larger than the other, or any Part of the Body in an unjutt Propottion;
but as every Thing in  Face moff anfiwer to the Bigness of the Face, to one Member muft anfwer to
another


 in Bigness, that to there may be  perfect Harmony in all the Parts of the Body; that it may not
have broad Shoulders and  thin flender Waift,  raw-bone Arm and  thick gouty Leg, or any Part dif-
proportionable from the other, unless it be fo that any Part of the Body doth turn awry from our Eye;
thas, if one Arm should be feen fide-ways, and the other fore-right, then the one Arm muft be made fo
much less than the other by how much it turns away from our Sight, and appears less to our Eye, and if
one Leg be feen full or fore-right, and the other Leg be feen fide-ways, then it muft be made to much less
than the other, by how much it turns away from your Sight.
 As  juft Proportion muft be obfery’ in the Bigness of your Draught, to likewife in the Length,
that one Thing may not be too long for the other, the Body not too long for the Legs, nor the Legs too
short for the Body, that neither Leg, nor Arm, be disproportion’ in their Lengths, but that every Thing
have its due Proportion both for Length and Bigness; unless when the Body Chortens away in any Part
from your Sight; as thus, if one Leg fland behind the other, it muft be made to much thorter than the
other, according to the Diftance it is removed from your Eye; to likewife if one Arm remove itfelf ever
to little out of your Sight, that which comes firft to the Eye, and flands neareft to the Sight, muft be
made longer than the other, and the other be made to much the shorter, by how much it turns away from
your Sight. So, again, if any Part of the Body be fore-shortned, that is, if it appears fo to your Eye, as
to hinder the full Light of the Latitude of that Part of the Body, then the Body, or that Part of the Body
muft be made to thorten, according to that Proportion that the Eye judges of it.
 Observe the due Diftance of one Thing from another, that you may be exact in your Draught, and
perfectly imitate your Pattern.
 Obferve how much one Part of the Body slicks out beyond the other, or falls in within the other,
or whether it flands even with the other; to which End, you may ftrike  finall Stroke down from the
Top of the Shoulder along by the Outfide of the Body ftrait down to the Feet; and this will direct you
how far one Part of the Body should fland out beyond the other, and how far other Parts should come
in; let nothing be done without Rule and Judgment.
 Let nothing be done, hard, Charp, or curty, that is, let not the Bendings that are in the Body or in
the Joints, be made as if they were Dents or Cuts in the Fleth with Charp corner Strokes, but finely round
and floping, like Bendings, and not like Cuts in the Body; this is  common Fault among Learners, who
should


 therefore be the more careful to avoid it by imitating their Pattern exactly, in the Manner of mak-
ing every Stroke and Touch that is given; for nothing should be done without Judgment.
Of Perspective Proportion.
DERSPECT IVE Proportion differs much from that we have been hitherto defcribing; and may be
defined, The Judgment of the Eye of the Proportion of  Thing by its Diftance from it; as thus, if

one Part of the Body come nearer to the Eye than the other, it is made to much bigger than the other

Part of the Body, which turns away from the Eye; thus if one Leg fland behind another, the foremoft
Leg that flands firft in Sight, muft be made fomewhat bigger and longer than the other, becaufe the Eye
to judges of it; it is the fame with regard to any other Part of the Body, the Proportion muft be leffend,
according to the Diftance of the Object from the Eyc.
The next Thing to be obferv’ in good Draughts, is graceful Pofture and proper Action; that is, that
the true natural Motion of every Thing be exprefted in the Life and Spirit of it; that is, the Life muft be
quicken’ by Art; as to express the Majefty of  King, you muft put him in fuch  graceful Pofture, as
may move the Spectators with Reverence to behold him; to to make  Soldier, you muft draw him in
fuch  Pofture, as may betoken Courage, Boldness, and Intrepidity; fo to make  Clown, he muft be seen
in the moft deteftable and clownith Pofture; to in every other Inftance, the inward Affection and Dispo-
fition of the Mind muft be expreffed in the moft lively Manner in the outward Action and Gefture of the
Body. Now to attain  competent Skill herein, my Advice is, diligently to observe the Works of our
great Mafters, of thofe especially who delight in defcribing  Fight at Handi-cuffs; to obferve the Eyes
of private Affaffins, the Courage of Wreftlers, the Actions of Stage-Players, the enticing Allurements of
Courtefans, fuch as are led to Execution, to mark the contracting of their Brows, the Motions of their
Eyes, and the Carriage of their whole Body, to the End you may exprets them to the Life in your Draw-
ings and Works.
Another Thing to be obferved in good Draughts, is, Loofeness or Air; that is, that the Body be not
made ffiff in any Part, but that every Joint may have its proper and natural Bending, to as it may with
the greateft Life express your Intention, that the Picture may not feem lame or the Joints fliff, as if they
Were


 not pliable or capable of bending, but every Joint or Limb muft have its proper and natural Pofture,
according as it may beft fuit with and become the Pofture in which the Figure is fet.
Another Thing to be noted in Drawing is, what the Painters call Fore-Chortening, which is, to take
Things as they appear to the Eye, and not to draw the full Length and Proportion of every Part, but to
make it shorter, by Reafon the full Length and Bigness is hid from our Sight; fo, if  would draw  Ship
standing fore-right, there can appear only her Fore-part, the reft is hid from our Sight, and therefore can-
not be express’. Again, if  would draw  Horfe flanding fore-right, looking full in my Face,  muft
neceffarily fore-Chorten him behind, becaufe his Sides and Flanks are hid from my Eyc. Obferve there-
fore this Rule, That you ought rather to imitate the vifible Proportion of Things, than the proper and
natural Proportion of them; for the Eye and the Underftanding together being directed in the perspective
Art, ought to be the Guide, Meafure, and Judge of Drawing and Painting.
The latt Thing to be regarded in good Drawing, is, That every Thing be done by the Guidance of
Nature, that is, that nothing be express’ but what accords and agrees with Nature in every Point: As
thus, when  would make  Man turning his Head over his Shoulder,  muft not make him turn more
than Nature will permit, nor muft any thing be forc’ beyond the Limits of Nature, or be made to come
short of it; but tho' Nature muft not be firetch’ beyond its Centre, yet it muft be quickened to the high-
eft Pitch of it: Thus, if  would express  King,  muft express him in the moft Majeftick Poffure  can
invent; and if  would draw  Clown,  muft reprefent him in the moft clownith Action  can imagine;
yet muft neither the one nor the other be drawn in fuch  Pofture as will not agree with the Motion of
Nature, that is, in fuch  Pofture which Man cannot imitate with his natural Body; fo in all other Things,
Nature muft be the Pattern of all Kinds of Draughts.
RULES for drawing Landships.
ANDSKIP is the exprefting  Tract of Land by Hills, Woods, Caffles, Seas, Valleys, Ruins,
Rocks,  in which there is not to much Difficulty as in drawing Figures; and therefore the fol-

lowing Rules will he fufficient.
 The belt Way of making Landlkips, is to reprefent them thooting away, one Part lower than ano-
ther, as hath been practifed by our beft Artifts; but others have run into  contrary Error, by making
the Landlkip mount up higher and higher, till it reach to fuch  Height, that it feems as if it touch’ the
Clouds, as if the Drawer had ffood at the Bottony of  Steeple, when he took the Prospect, which is alto-
gether incongruous; for we can difcern no Profpect at the Bottom of  Hill, but the moft proper Way
of making  Landlkip, is to make the neareft Hfill higheft, and fo to make the reft that are at  greater
Diftance, to thoot away under that, that the Landlkip may appear as if taken from the Top of an Hill.
 Be careful to leffen every Thing in proportion to its Diftance, exprefting it bigger or less according to
the Diftance it is from the Eyc.
 Vou muft make all your Lights fall one Way, both upon the Ground and Trees, and all Things
olfe, and all the Shadows muft be caft one Way.
 Vou muft give every Thing its proper Motion; as Trees when they are thaken with the Wind, their
finaller: and more pliable Boughs muft be thewn in fuch an Action, as if they struck one againft another,
by yielding and declining from that Paft whence the Wind blows; the stiffer Boughs have less Bending
and Motion; you muft likewife obferve the Bending of  Twig when  Birdfirs upon it, fo likewife if it

be forced or preffed with any otfer Thing,
Clouds in the Air maft be thewn with Motions now gathered together with the Winds, now violently
 carl make nothing
condented into Hall; Thunder bolls, Lighthing; Rain, and fuch like. Finally
but what requires  Motion pechliar to itfelf; according to which it ought to be reprefented: But this
Rule you muft always obferve; natmely; that all your Motions which are cauled by the Wind, muft be
seen to move one Way, becaufe the Wind can blow but one Way at once.
Always express  fair Horizon, fhewing the Heavens cloudy or clear, more or less according to the Oc-
cation; and if you express the Sun, let it be cittler as Rifing or Setting; and as it were behind or over fome
Hill or Mountain.
The Moon and Starsare feldonr or never depicted, unlets it be in Reprefentation of Twilight, becaufe all

Things are supposed to be feen by Day.
If ye
on express the Sun, make his Light to reflect upon all the Trees, Hills, Mountains, Rocks, or
Buildinge; thading the contrary side; after which Manner alfo fhadow Clouds, Mifts, and the like, mak-
In

 exprefting Things at large Diftances, as ten, twenty or thirty Miles off; where the Object is hard to
be difcerned, as whether it be Temple, Caftle, Houfe, or the like, thew no particular Signs thereof, or
any eminent Diftinction; but rather as weakly, faintly, and confafedly as the Eye judgeth of it.
If Landlkips be laid in Colours, the farther you go, the more you muft lighten it with  thin and airy
Blue, to make it feem as if it were afar off, beginning firft with  dark Green, to driving it by Degrees into
 Blue according to the Diftance.
In Rivers, obferve the general Current, and Dathing of the Waves againft the Boat Sides. In the Sea,
observe the Waves and other proper Agitations, the Rowling of the Billows, the Tumbling of Veffels up
and down; Ships floating, fome dipt, fome half drowned, fome flanding almoft an End, some hid almoft
with the Waves, thro' the Uncertainty of the Surges, others riving to live. In the Motion of Waters
falling from an high Place, but especially when they fall upon Rocks or Stones, you muft make it leaping
up in the Air, and fprinkling all about.
Let your Work imitate the Seafon you intend it for. Thus, if you intend it for  Winter Piece, re-
prefent felling of Timber; fliding upon the lee; fowling by Night; hunting of Bears or Foxes in the
Snow; making the Trees every where naked or laden with  floar Froft; the Earth bare without Green-
ness, Flowers or Cattle; the Air thick; Water frozen, with Carts paffing over it, and Boys upon it, Oc.
Laftly, let every Site have its proper Works, Adjuncts, or additional Graces, as the Farm-houfe, Wind-
mill, Woods, Flocks of Sheep, Herds of Cattle, Pilgrims, Ruins of Temples, Caflles, Monuments; with
 thouland fuch other Things, only proper to particular Subjects.
To take the perfect Draught of any Picture.
  Sheet of fine Venice Paper, wet it all over with Linfeed Oil on one Side thereof, which
 then wipe off as clean as you can; let the Paper dry, and lay it to any painted or printed Picture,
then with  black Lead Pencil you may draw it over with Eafe; put this oiled Paper upon  Sheet of clean
white Paper, and with  little pointed Stick or Feather out of  Swallow’ Wing, draw over the Stroke
which you draw upon the oiled Paper; to shall you have the exact Form upon the white Paper, which
may be fet out with Colours with pleafure.
Or


 thas: The Picture being drawn as before in the oiled Paper, put it upon  Sheet of white Paper,
and prick over the Drawing with  Pen; then take fome Small-coal, powder it fine, and wrap it if 
Piece of fine Linnen, and bind it up therein loofely, and clap it over the pricked Line by little and little,
and then draw it over again once or twice, with Pen or Pencil.
Or thus: Rub  Sheet of white Paper all over on one Side with Black-lead, or elfe with Vermilion mix-
ed with freth Butter; lay the coloured Side upon  Sheet of white Paper; then lay the Picture you would
copy out upon the other Side of the coloured Paper, or with  snall pointed Stick, or Swallow' Quill, go
over all the Strokes of your Picture, and it will be exact on the white Paper.
Or thus: Take an oiled Sheet (as before) rub one Side of it with Lamb-black or Lake; lay it upon 
Sheet of fair Paper, with the coloured Side downward, and upon it lay the Picture you would copy out,
and trace it over with your Swallow’ Feather.
Or thus: Take fine Lake mixed with Linfeed Oil, and draw with it over all the Out-frokes, and other
material Parts of  Picture; then wet the contrary side of the Picture, and prefs it hard upon  Sheet of
Paper, and it will leave behind it all that which you drew over.
To take the Shape of  Leas, Herb, or Plant.
 OLD  whole Leaf or Sprig (as of Nettle, Plantane, Gc.) in the Smoak of Gum Sandrack, Rofin,
 Link, or Wax Candle, till it is well black’, which place between the Leaves of  Sheet of

Whice Paper, and carefully press upon the Leaf with fome fmooth Thing; to shall you have in  Mo-
ment the Print on the Paper, especially the Backfide thereof, with the very Ramifications of the Fibres
disperted thro' it. This may be of good Ufe in Travelling, when we meet with ftrange Plants.
To take the Picture of an Herb. from an old Picture.


AK  Venice Soap, dip it in Water, and rub or moiften the old Picture all over very well with it;
then put upon it  Piece of white Paper, with other Paper over it, and rub hard thereupon, or press

Of Fresce, or Painting of Walls.
 painting upon Walls, to make it endure the Weather, you muft grind your Colours with Lime-
water, Milk, or Whey, mixt in Size Colour in Pots.

The Palte or Plaifter muft be made of well-wath’ Lime, mist with fine Powder of old Rubbich
Stones; the Lime muft be to often wath’, till all its Salt be caftrated; and all your Work muft be done
in clear and dry Weather.
To make the Work endure, ftrike into the Wall Stumps of headed Nails, about five or fix Inches
afunder, and by this Means you may preferve the Plaifter from peelirg.
Then with this Pafte, plaifier the Wall  pretty Thickness, letting it dry, being dry, plaifter it over
again about the Thickness of half  Barley-corn, very fine and fmooth, then your Colours being ready
prepared, work this laft Plaiftering over while it is wet, to will your Painting unite and join faft to the
Plaifter, and dry together as  perfect Compoft.
In Painting be nimble and free, let your Work be bold and flrong, but be fure to be exact, for there
can be no Alteration of the firtt Painting, and therefore heighten your Paint enough at firft, you may
deepen it at pleafure.

All Earchy Colours are beft; as the Oker, Spanish-white, Spanish-brown, Terrx-vert, and the like;
Mineral Colours are naughht.
Laftly, let your Pencils and Bruthes be long and foft, otherwife your Work will not be fmooth; let

for in this there is no after Alteration to be made.
C Wasking, and other Materials thereof.
 Wathing here we intend nothing more, but either to fet out Maps, or printed Pictures in proper

AD Colours, or elfe to varnith them.
The Inftruments and Materials of Wathing are fix, viz.  lum-water.  Size, of Gum-water.
 Liquid Gold. . Pencils.  Colours.  Varnish.
To make Alum-water : Take Alum, eight Ounces; fair Water,  Quart; boil them till the Alum is
diffolved.
Or thus: Take Spring, or Well-water,  Gallon; Rock Alum,  Pound, beat it to Powder, and dif-
folve it in Water by boiling; filter it thro'  brown Paper, and keep it for Ule. With this Water wet
your Paper before you lay on your Colours, it will keep them from finking in, and withal, add  Luftre
and Beauty to the Colours laid on: But this you muft note, that if your Paper is not good, you muft
wath it over four or five Times, which may be done with  large Pencil Bruth: Morcover, Alum gene-
fally raifeth ftaining Colours, and preferves them from fading.
To make Size: Take Glew, which fleep all Night in Water, then mell it over the Fire, to fee that it
be neither too ftrong nor too weak; then let  little of it cool, if it be too fiff when it is cold, put more
Water to it, if too weak more Glew, ufing it lake-warm.
To make Gum-water: Take pure Spring Water,  Quart; put it into  Jar Glass, and hang therein 
fufficient Quantity of pure, white and clean Gum-Arabick, bruifed and tied up in  Rag; let it hang till
the Gum is diffolved, then put your Fingers into the Water, and if you find them flick together as if they
were glewed; your Water is too ftiff, or full of the Gum, which you muft remedy by putting thereto
more fair Water; and if you find it too weak, you may help it by adding more Gum. With this Water,
or the former Size, moft Colours are to be tempered, and with to much of the Gum-water, as being
touch’ when dry, the Colour will not come off: Where note, that if the Colour gliften, there is too
much Gum in it.
Liquid Gold and Sitver: Take five or fix Leaves of Gold or Silver, which grind (with  fiff Gum-
lake Water, and  good Quantity of Salt) as fmall as you can; then put it into  Vial, or glazed Veffel;
add to much fair Water as may diffolve the Gum-water; then let it fland four Hours, that the Gold may
Settle;


 decant the Water, and put in more till the Gold is clean wathed: To the Gold put more fair Wa-
ter,  little Sal-Armoniac, and common Salt, digefting it clofe for four Days: Then put all into  Piece
of thin Glovers Leather (whofe Grain is peeled off) and hang it up, to will the Sal Armoniac fret away,
and the Gold remain behind, which keep.
Or thus: Grind fine Leaf Gold with flrong or thick Gum-water very fine; and as you grind add
more thick Gum-water being very fine, wath it in  great Shell as you do Bice; then temper it with 
litle Quantity of Mercury fublimate, and  little diffolved Gum to bind it in the Shell, shake it, and
pread the Gold about the Sides thereof, that it may be all of one Colour and Fineness, which ufe with
fair Water as you do other Colours. The fame obterve in liquid Silver; with this Obfervation, That if
your Silver by Length of Time, or Humidity of the Air become rufty; then cover the Place with Juice
of Garlick before you lay on the Silver, which will preferve it.
When you ufe it, temper it with Glair of Eggs, and fo ufe it with Pen or Pencil. Glair of Eggs is
thus made: Take the Whites and beat them with  Spoon, till they rife all in  Foam; then let them
fland all Night, and by Morning they will be turned into  clear Water, which is good Glair.

your Venus and Saturn with Spirit of Nitre, and precipitate Venus with  Lye made of the Salt of

Tartar, and your Saturn with Salt Water, edulcorating and drying them, the Venus will vield an excel-
lent Verdigrife, which will not corrode other Colours as the common Verdigrife does; and the Saturn yields
 Cerufe whicer and purer than the ordinary, and is much better for Painting and Chirurgery.
Vellow Fuftick berry: Boil ir in Water, or fleep them in Alam-water, it makes  good and tranfparent

wl well 
Colour Buildings with as much Variety of pleafant Colours as may be imaginable, yet let Reafon be
your Rule in mixing your Colours: Yon: may fometimes ufe- White, and Black for the Wall, Conduits; or
other Things. For Brick Houses and the like, red Lead and white; if many Heufes fland together, fet
them off with Variety of Colours, as Umber and White; Lake: and White; Red Lead and Whits, and

Roffct, and white for the next Degree; blue Bice, and white for the other; blue Bice, or Blue for tbe
bigheft.

Thefe Degrees and Colours muft be to wrought together, that the Edge of each Colour may not receive
any Sharpnets; that is, fo as that you cannot perceive where you began to lay them,, being to drowned
one in another.
Of the Practice of Wasking.
I II the Alom-water wet over the Picture to be coloured, for that keeps the Colours from fink-
ing into the Paper, and will add  Luffre unto them, make them thew fairer, and keep them
from fading.
Then let the Paper dry of itfelf (being wathed with Alomseater) before you lay on the Colours; or
before you wet it again, for some Paper will need wetting four or five Times.
The Wathing of the Paper muft be done with  large Pencill Boush.
But if you intend to varnith your Pictures after you have coloured them, inflead of wathing them with
Alom-water, firft fize them with new Size made of good white Starch, with  very fine Bruth; and this
 muft be fure to do all over, for elfe the Varniff will fink, through.
Having thus prepared your Work, go to laying on your Colours according to your former Directions,

fuiting them as near as may be, to the Life of every Thing.
But


 before you lay on your Colours, you muft know how to temper them; which you may do in this
Manner: . Such Colours as are ground with fair Water; take  fmall Quantity of them, put it into 
Horfe Muffle-shell, purting thereto fome Gum-water, and the Colour in  little Time will be foftened;
then with your Finger being very clean, bruife the Colour againft the Shell, till you find no Knot undif-
folved; after with  clean Pencil stroke down the Colour to the Bottom of the Shell, and it is fit for Ufe;
if it be too thick, add more Gum-water to it.  Such Colours as are wathed you muft temper in  Shell
with Gum-water, in the fame Manner as the former.  Such Colours as are fteeped, the Liquor only
of them is to be ufed without any other Preparation.
The Picture being painted, you may with Size pafte your Maps or Pictures upon Cloth, thus: Wet the
Sheet or Cloth therein, wring it out, and ftrain it upon  Frame, or nail it upon  Wall or Board, and to
pafte your Maps or Pictures thereon.
Laftly, if the Picture be to be varniffed, having thus fixed it into its proper Frame, then varnith it with
 proper Varnish (by the following Rules) and the Work will be fully finithed.
How to lay on your Colours.
IRST provide yourfelf of Pencils of feveral Sizes, and if you will be curious, you ought to have 

great and  small to each respective Colour; if not, you muft always have by you  Dith of fair

Water, in which you muft wath and cleanfe your Pencil, wiping it with  clean Linen Cloth, before you
put it into another Colour.
For your Pencils, chufe thofe that are good, thus: See that they be fulleft next the Quill, descending
or leffening into  small Room or Charp Point, which you may fee by putting the Hair into your Mouth,
and drawing it thro' your Lips once or twice, then you will fee what it is, and if you find any ftragling
Hairs,, finge them off with the Flame of  Candle.
Being thus provided with Colours and Pencils, if you defign to lay any Colour about the Edges of any
Map, Part, Piece, or Divifion of Ground, in  Plat; as fuppofe you would inclofe  particular Field, or
Clofe in  Meadow, with fellow; with your Pencil take Camboge, or Vellow-berry Water  very small
