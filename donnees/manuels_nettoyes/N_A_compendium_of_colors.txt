INIRCDUGTION.

 HE urility of the following CoMPENDIUM, will
appear to all who consider the variety of substances
which are employed in composing many colors, and
other materials, used in the Arts. It is to be re-
fretted that some professors are not more intimately
acquainted with this part of science; but, to the
student;; for whose service this compilation is chieffy
intended,: such information is evidently of great

Retvantage.
 an injudicious mixture of pignents, contrary
in their natures and properties, produces very dis-
agreeable consequences is universally agreed;as
indeed might naturally be expected from the various
 dissimilar origins of the ingredients, of which
some ate productions of the animal, others of the
regetable Kingdom; fossils afford some, and mine
fals others, Beside this, they have undergone vari-
ous modes of preparation for use; for some cannot
be used without calcination, others will hot bear the
fire; some constantly retain their proper hues,
others, though brilliant at first, after  while become
totally corrupted, and by their corruption they in-
jure, or destroy, their companions, which might
otherwise have stood well. It appears evident, there-
fore, that,  Knowledge of the origin of any pis-
ment, may conduce much to  beneficial association
of it with others.
No doubt, many other substances beside those in
common use, might be of great service, if their pro-
  were more sausfactorily understood, or if
better methods of managing them were discovered,
which can only be the result of experiment. More-
over, we know, that foreign countries afford  variety
of materials different from our own; which are used
by the artists of those countries: it would be  des
sirable acquisition, as well to the study: of natural
history in general, as to the arts, if gentlemen who
have opportunity; would inform themselves on such
subjects; of their origin, their manner of tieatment,
and their mode of preparation for use; of their Han

tures and their effects; and, if they could import

samples for examination by our own artists, not
only those artists, but, perhaps by: some happy dis-

covery; the nation; might become obliged to their

ry 
laudable endeavours.
Our own Kingdom and its dependencies afford 
variety of substances which we now receive from
foreigners: it would be well worth while for examine
our nlative productions with reference to theirt fure
ther utility; not to mention the pleasure arising from
investigation of every part of the works of nature: It

i submitted to gentlemen; and to artists, who reside parts of the Kingdom, that such intelligence of
British productions might be very acceptable to ariists
in other parts of the Kingdom, whose situation detains
them from such knowledge : and in particular, it is
submitted to artists, that, as the perfection of art is
only to be attained by liberal communication of im-
provements which becur to individuals; by such
generous behaviour, and by such only, can the arts
attain that excellence which is the earnest desire of

every genuine artist.
Such


 information would be valuable to the public,
since thereby many expensive materials might be su=
perseded, by others equally serviceable, at  much
less price; or improvements on those now disre-
garded, might render them objects of greater atten-
tion; whereby, not unfrequently, our manufactures,
as well as the arts, might derive great advantage.
In some degree, on this principle,  few articles not
in general use are admitted into this collection; for,
though their own services are but small, they may
afford hints to aid the discovery of others more
valuable; it has indeed been our endeavour, to insert
chiefly those articles whose utility may be depended
on; for it seems injudicious to burden this part of

but learners; nor can much novelty be expected on
the subject, though there are many original recipes;

To close these remarks:â€”It should be recoilected,
that some colors, &cc. are dangerous to health, with-
out due circumspection in preparation, and manage
ment; to guard against accidents from such is very
desirable, and is sufficient to prove the ntility of the
present work, in which somewhat of their natures
and effects are explained.

LACACLA: The flowers afford that bright yellow
which bears washing in the Chinese silks, exc. and
i used by them in painting on paper. The flowers
are gathered before they are fully open, then put
into  clean earthen vessel, and kept over  great
heat (stirring them continually) till they become
dryish and yellow. Then to half  pound of
fowers, they add three spoonfuls of fair water, or
just enough to hold them incorporated. This they
boil, till the water has extracted the juice from the
fowers; then strain it. To the liquor they add
half an ounce of allum, and one ounce of calcined
oyster-shell pulverised.
It is not impossible that Great Britain (or very pro-
bably some of its tropical dependencies) may pro-
luce  regetable similar in its nature, or that may
 the same purpose, at  small expence. The



procees to -obtain us color, would most likely be
much the same.
ANACARDIUM. Or CASHEW.NUT: From the
sweetish liquor contained in its shells, the Indians
extract an oil, said to preserve wood from putre-
faction, and to render black colors lasting.
ACTHICTE, called by the French Rovcov, by the
Dutch ORLEANE, is the flower, or seed, of  tree
which grows chiefly in very hot countries. The
grains of Acbiate, are soaked in an earthen vessel,
and repearedly washed in warm waters, till they
have discharged their vermillion colour, the sedi-
ment is formed into cakes, &cc. which when pure
 much valued. Some boil the grains to obtain 
greater consistence of colour.
 use it to compose CARMINE, but it gives too

smuch of an orange cast. It is used to dye wax
vermillion colour.
ALLURI,  inmeral chrystalizable salt, of an austere
taste; dissolves in cold water; but much better in
boiling water.  It is obtained abroad from sundry
Kinds of earth in England from  whitish bluish
Kind of stone called Irich slate. It is  principal
ingredient in -dying and colouring.. Its styptic
astringent quality binds the finer parts of the colors
together, and prevents their exhaling. Hence it

preserves paper impregnated with  solution of it,
from sinking when wrote upon.
ALLUR WATER is made by dissolving four ounces
of allum; in  pint of boilingwater filtre it through
Drown paper.

RoCk


 ALLUM, Or ROCHE ALLUM, is prepared

from pyritous stones, cut from quarries, and  from the common allum extracted
from earth, &.
PURIFTED ALLUM, is prepared by dissolving it in
hot rain water, and evaporating it, till it shoots
again into chrystals.
ROMAN ALLUM, is of  red color, not superficial-
ly but throughout; by breaking it, it may be dis
tinguished from counterfeits dyed red.
Price  per  Rock Allum  per  is  corrosive liquor, prepared
from nitre and vitriol; it dissolves all metals except
gold. It is made by distilling purified nitre, with
calcined vitriol, or rectified oil of vitriol, in  strong
heat: The vapour, which rises in blood-red fumes,
 the Aqua-fortis.
If to the liquor thus procured, be added sea-salt,
or sal-ammoniac one-fourth of its weight, it becomes
AGUA-REGYA, and ceases to dissolve silver, but will
now dissolve gold.
The chiefuse of Aqua-fortis in the arts, is in faci=
litating the progress of ErchINC. Being poured
of  proper strength on the copper-plate previously
prepared, it corrodes the lines drawn through the
ground, or varnish, on the copper. See Etching.
Aqua-fortis as sold in the shops, requires no very
considerable addition of water, to decrease its
strength; but smoking SPIRTT OF NITRE, which
is the strongest kind of Aqua-fortis, must be reduced
to  proper strength for use, by the mixture of four
times, or at least three times, its quantity of water,

oh its operation.
Price about   per pound weight.
ARCIIILL, is  white moss; which grows on the
rocks in the Archipelago, the Canary Islands, and
Cape de Verd Islands; it is said by LINNEUs, to be
found on the western coast of England. Prepared
Arcbill will yield  violet color to water, which
stains marble deeply; and renders it more brittle.
LINNEus thinks many common mosses might
yield celors; at least, the experiment on the most
 is worth making
ARSENIC, native, is called ORPIMENT. It is of
 yellow, or orange, color, Though always yellow,
its color admits of different shades and mixtures,
golden, reddish, or greenish.
The satal effects which may by accident arise from
this substance, will justify our forbidding its admission
into the collection of colors, of our young friends.

ASPHIALTUM, is  solid, bristle, black, inflam-
 brtuminous, substance, resembling pitch.
It is chiefly found swimming on the surface of the
Lacus Aspbathtes, or DeadSea, where anciently stood
the cities of Sodom, &cc. being thrown to the surface
of the water, it there swems like other fat bodies,
and gradually is condensed by the heat of the sun
and its own salt. It burns with great vehemence,
in which it resembles naphtha; but it is firmer in
consistence. Genuine Asphaltum has no smell, is
not acted on by water, by aqua-fortis, or by olive
oil. It is  principal ingredient in etching ground:
and is used in oil painting, but must not be too much


trusted


 to; it gives the appearance of age to pic
tures, &. Price  to  per ounce.
ASPHALTUM is excellent in the shadows of flesli,
draperies, fore-grounds, Exc. and particularly in
scumbling, but when used alone it is apt to turn
black; it is therefore necessary to imix it with lake,
or blue, or terra de Sienna, any of which colors
mix well with it, and effectually prevent its chang=
ing. This color being now much in use, perhaps
t much, we give the following receipt for mak=
ing it.
Receipt for making Asphaltum.
Put two ounces of balsamo de capivi, into  peal, or
Dipkin, over  slow fire until it boils, then put in one
 of aspbaitum, and as much oil of turpentine
as will make it liquid; care must be taken to pre-
went its taking fire. This receipt; with the method
of using the asphaitum, was communicated by Mr.
Mengs, and is used with success.
. . After glazing, it will be proper to put the
picture in the sun, in order to hasten the drying of it.
Another Method of preparing Asphaltum.
Welt two ounces of oleo dAbezzo, or Venice tur.
pentine, over  slow fire in  glazed vessel, then add
one ounce of aspbattum  little bruised; when
melted, thin it properly with oil of turpentine.
. . When you add the turpentine, take it from
the fire.
The best method of preparing asphaltum is
to melt it over  slow fire in the clearest bal-
  de capivi, observing it continually until it is
quite melted: and never to use it before the picture
is very dry, then rub the part which you design to

glaze with  little of Mengs' varnish, which must
also be dry before you attempt to glaze it; mix the
asphalrum with  little oil of poppy, to prevent its
being too sticky in glazing. This is the best me.
thod of preparing and using aspbaltum, for which
we are obliged to Mr. West.
AVIGNONBERRY, called also PRENCH-BERRT,
and TELLOw-BERRY, is the fruit of  shrub, grow-
ing plentifully in the neighbourhood of Avignon,
and elsewhere, in the south of France.
The berry is somewhat less than  pea; its color
is green approaching to yellow, its taste is astrin-
gent. Dyers make  yellow of it.  tincture for
Wash colors is thus extracted:
Put  pound of berries to  gallon of water, with
half an ounce of allum : boil them in  pewter, or
earthen, vessel; filter them, and eraporate the
fiuid. Or more simply  into  small earthen tea-
Pot, or other convenient vehicle, put  small quan-
tity of berries, pour on them boiling water, and let
them stand by the fire side till the tincture is strong
enough; add allum in proportion. When meant to
be kept, some add  small quantity of spirits of
wine. The tincture may be drawn very deep.
Price  per ounce.
BICE, is  blue color, prepared from the lapis arme-
nus, formerly brought from Armenia; but now
 the silver mines of Germany.
 bears the best body of all bright blues, used in
common; but is in its color the palest. It requires
good grinding to prepare it for use, being inclined
to be sandy, and should be well washed. It works
indifferently well. GREEN EICE, is made by addr
ing orpiment to the Blue Bice.
Price  per ounce.
 is composed of the most glossy, and highty
burned soot, finely pulverized, and sifted, then bak-
ed with  little gum water, and made into Cakes.
The best is prepared from the soot of dry beech
rood, by grinding it with urine, or with water,
Into  smooth paste; then diluting it with more
water: after the grossersediment is settled, pour off
the liquor, and let the finer particles, which are
the bistre, sink to the bottom. The best is of 
warm, deep, transparent brown, when moistened
with water.
This color may be used in the same mapnner as In-
dian ink, and is warmer in its appearance.
Price  to   per ib.
     .
BLUE BLACK, is the coal of burnt regetables; the
best is said to be procured from vine-stalks, and
rendrils. Price  to   per ounce. Kept in the
color-shops in bladders ground in oil, at  each.
LAMP-BLACK, originally perhaps the soot collect-
ed from lamps, is, generally, prepared by melting
rosin, or prick, in iron vessels; then setting it on
fire under  proper receptacle for the smoke; which
is the tamp-black. It is brought chiefly from
Sweden


 and Norway, where it is frequently obtains
ed from the refuse of the tree, left in preparing
rosin, or pitch. It is the basis of the ink used by
letter-press printers. The black takes fire very
readily; the best method of extinguishing it, is by
linen, hay, or straw wetted; water alone will not
succeed. This color is not much in request for oil
pictures, as it requires forcing to make it ary.
LvoRY-BLACK, is made of ivory burnt, or char-
red, between two crucibles well luted; being thus
rendered perfectly black, and in scales, it is ground
and made into cakes, ecc.
The goodness of vory-black, may be known by
the fulness of its color, free from any blue cast; and
by its fineness.  little white sugar-candy prevents
this color, when used in water (and others), from
Cracking.
It is used in painting in oil: but is commonly
rejected from use in water, INDIAN INk answering
much better.
Price   per  Bladders  each.
HORN-ELACK, is inferior to ivory-black; it is
made of bones burnt.
GERMAN, OF FRANKFORT, BLACK, is made of
the lees of wine burnt, and washed : and afterwards
ground in mills on purpose, with ivory, or with
peach stones, burnt. It is  principal ingredient in
the ink used by rolling-press printers. The French
 superior to the German. To try its goodness, it
is pat into the mouth; if free from grit, and of  black, it is good.
EARTH


 BLACK, is  kind of coal which well pul-
verised, is used in fresco.
Burnt paper, ground finely, is said to make  good

black.

Peach stones burnt, make  very fine black of 
bluish cast, much used in France. Cherry stones
may be substituted.



INDIAN-INK is an admirable composition, not
laid like our writing inks, but solid like our mine-
ral colors, though much, lighter. It is made in all
figures, but the most usual is rectangular, about  of an inch thick. Sometimes the sticks are
gilt with various devices.
To use this ink, there must be  little hollow
marble (to be had at any :color-shop) or other
stone, with water in it, on which the stick of ink
must be rubbed, till the water becomes of  suffi-
clent blackness.  Dutch tile, or piece of ivory, or
other neat substance, may serve as  substitute.
It makes  very black shining ink; and though apt
to sink when the paper is thin, yet it never runs or
spreads; so that the lines drawn with it are always
smooth, and evenly terminated, how large soever
they be. Itis of great use in designing, because its
tone of color may be augmented or dimiaished
of gs 
at pleasure. It is imitated by mixing. any
plack, prepared from linseed oil. (by hanging
 large copper pan over the flame of  lamp to
receive its smoke; with as much melted glue as is
requisite to form it into cakes; these cakes, when
dry, answer well enough in regard both to color,
and to freedom and smoothness of working. Irory
black





 and other charcoal blacks, levigated very
fine, have the same effect with lamp-black.
It is not easy to distinguish the best Indian-int
from the inferior; the usual manner is by rubbing
the stick on the back of the hand, or any other
place previously werted; but, frequently the sticks
are coated with  fine sort, and the part within is
worthless. The makers generally scent the best

 with the best musk.
In using Indian-ink it should always be remem.
hered, that  light color may be darkened by addi-
tional washing but that which is too deep cannot
 lightened; the safest and best way  to proceed
gradually from  weak tint, to  stronger, till the
Farious parts obtain the force intended.

ly: but in oil they become dull. They are found
among coppermines; water only is used in levigat-
ing them, to reduce them to  fine powder. This
blue ought to be used in works to be seen by candle
light (as scene painting) for though mixed with
much white, it retains its beauty.
There is nothing to be found in the shops under
this name but common verditer or some species
of it.
BLUE, PRUSSTAN, is  modern invention, conside.
fably in use among painters, though inferior to
ultramafine





 blue. It was discovered by accident;
about the beginning of this century.  chemist of
Berlin, having successively thrown upon the ground
several liquors from his laborttory, was surprised to
see it suddenly stained with  most bedutiful color.
Recollecting the liquors he had thrown on each
other; he made  sinilar mixture in  vessel; and
produced the same color. He did hot publish his
process; but prepared and sold his thie, which was
substituted for ultramarine. The account of it was
first published in the Berlin Memoirs,  but
without  description of its process.
In  paper of Dr. Woodwards; communicated to
the Royal Society,  there is given  short way
Ofmaking Prussian Blue; which was found to answer

perfectly well; and occasioned several experiments;
whereby was discovered the nature of the substances
iused in that preparation.
The method was this; Four ounces of bullock'
blood dried, and four ounces of sait of tartar; pre-
pared from four ounces of crude taftar; and as much
hitre, were calcined together; two hours after
which;  black spungy substance remained in the
crucible; weighing four ounces;  solutioh of which;
being made itn boiling water; and afterwards filter-
ed, left  remainder which, when dried; werghed
hine drams: An ounce of English vitriol was
dissolved in six ounces of rain water; and eight
ounces of crude allum was also dissolved in two
quarts of water: These, being mixed hot with the
blood; became green; but on adding two; or threey
ounces of spirit of salt, they became of  fine blue:
VOL. II: Edit.  subsided, and left the water clear: The pros
duet was an ounce of very fine color, fit for the
palette.
 the experiments made by mixing; in dif-
ferent manners, and proportions, the several liquers
of which this color was prepared, all produced 
blue but in different degrees, some being deeper,
others paler. In one experiment, the allum was
wholly left out, and  very pale blue was produced;
in another, the allum and vitriol were used in equal
quantities; then the blue was extremely deep.
in all receipts given for making Prussian Blue, the
liquors are ordered to be mixed together boiling
hot, except the spirit of salt; and the color, is most
readily, and beautifully, made this way.
 method of making Prussian Blue in perfec-
tioh, has been purchased as  very valuable secret.
Its process is very extraordinary, and could scarce
be derived  priori, from any reasoning about the
nature of colors. It is allowed to be an excellent
blue pigment in point of color; but its durability is
justly suspected : It should not, therefore, be used
in works of consequence.
The goodness of Prussian Blue must be distin-
guished by is brightness, deepness, and coolness.
Four different processes given for making the
finest sort of Prussian Blue with quick lime, are
given in the Hist. of the Acad. of Sciences at Parss,
for the year  . Take  of ox' blood, dried and re-
duced into  kind of small scales, an equal quantity
Of


( quick-lime newly baked,  of red tartar; and
  of saltpetre; pulverise the whole grossly,
and put it into  crucible, placed in the midst of 
great furiace, and give it  gradual fire. After
four hours, when the matter is reduced into  Kind
of paste which emits no more smoke, and is equally
red, throw it by spoonfuls into two pails of boiling
water; and, having fillrated the lixivium, mix it
with  solution of  of allum, and   of
green vitriol. This operation will yreld but  secuta; but its beauty will make sufficient amends
for the small quantity, as it will surpass, in this
respect, all Prussian Blues, prepared by other me-
thods. It has also as good an effect as the finest
ultramarine; and has, besides, the advantage of
resisting the impression of the air.
Process Il. Take  of dried ox'sblood, an equal
quantity of quick-lime,  of red tartar, and  nitre; let them be calcined and lixiviated, as in
the former process; pour the lixivium into  soln-
tion of  of allum, and  of green vitriol.
This operation will yield more of the blue secula
than the other, but the color will be less beautiful.
Process III. Take  of dried oxs blood,  of quick-lime,  of red tartar,   of
saltpetre, proceed as before. This operation will
produce  most beautiful blue; but the quantity
will be only about  and  drams.
Process IV. Take  of dried ox' blood,  of
quick-lime,  of red tartar, and ilb.  of nitre.
Calcine and lixrviate as before; pour the warm lixi-
vium into  selution of  of allum, and iltgret
  vitriol; the secula precipitated in this waywis
be as beautiful as those of the first process, and the
quantity nearly  ounces.
The price of that kept in the shops is from  to  ounce. Bladders, ground im oil,  each.

BLUE, POWDER, of SMALT: This is  troublesome
color, pot much in request. Price from   to
 per ounce.
BLUE, TURNSOL, is made of the seed of that plant,
by boiling four ounces of turnsol in  pint and an
half of water, in which lime has been slacked.
NIT. BoyLE has given us the following method of
making trapsparent blue, nearly equal to ultrama,
rine. The principal ingredient is the eyamis, of
blse corn-bottle-flower; which may easily be pro
cured during the summer months.
This flower has two blues in it,  pale color in the
large outer leaves; and  deeper blue, in the middle
of the flower : these produce much the best color.
This may be observed by rubbing the leaves, while
fresh, on  piece of writing paper, so as to express
the juice, which will yield an excellent color; that,
by the experience of two or three years, has not been
found to fade.
 sufficient quantity of these middle leaves being
procured, let the juice be pressed from them; to
which  little allum being added, will give  lasting
transparent blue; scarcely inferier in brightness to

ltramarine.
 is very probable, that if the chives of these
fowers were cured in the same manner as saffron,
they would produce  much greater body of color,
from which  tincture might be drawn with more
case than when pressed fresh from the field.
Mr. BoyLE also recompmends another fine BlvE,
produced from the blue leaves of rue, beaten in 
stone mortar with  wooden pestle, and then put into
water for fourteen days, or more, washing them
every day, until they are rotten, These, beaten up
at last, water and all, until they become  pulf

and then dried in the sun, will make  fine blue for
shading.
BLUE, TRANSPARENT, for washing maps, &cc.
Take half  pound of the best French verdigris,
add six ounces of red argil : let them soak together
about six and thirty hours, in about two quarts
and  half of fair water: then boil them till the in-
gredients are dissolved, let the liquor sertle and pour
It off.
United with the tincture of Avignon-berry, it
makes an excellent green, and will keep well; to
secure which you may add  little spirits of wine.
It is necessary to caution our friends against morst-
tening the pencil used in this color, with the
fongue; or by any other means admitting the color
into the mouth, as the verdigris is apt to occasion
 disagreeable sickness.

 tree grows in dry, barren, places, or on rocks,
is very thick and large, usually Knotted, and crook

the trunk to less than half its former size. The
Howers, which are of  finered, exhale  very agree

buc is the best. It should be chosen clean, close,
sound, and free from bark.
From the best Brazil-wood, is procured  kind of
carmine, by means of acids.  tincture is drawn
from it thus:
Infuse  quarter of  pound of Brazil-wood (which
may be bought in chips, or shavings) in about two
quarts of water; when it boils, add nearly an ounce
of rock allum powdered. Strain the liquor when
of the strength desired. This may be evaporared
to  very deep color: or, the wood once boiled,
may yield  weaker tincture. It requires no great
Skill in using.
RED INK, is made of it, by boiling  quarter of
 pound of the raspings, in vinegar, wherein it has
been infused two or three days; then, while hot,
filtering it through paper, in an earthen cullender;
then heat it again, and add half an ounce of gum
arabic, and, when that is dissolved, of allum, and
of white sugar, half an ounce each.

neither the original, or the copy, be moved, from
their exact situation with respect to each other;
during the operation; lest the parts transferred
should be false.
Drawings intended to be made in fed chalk, should
be calqued by red chalk : not by black lead, as that
has  greasiness which refuses to cut chalk properly;
nor by black chalk, since the lines may then injure
the drawing by their different color from the rest
Of it.
CALAUING, is likewise used to signify the taking
an impression from  drawing in chalk, by passing
it through  rolling-press, with  sheet of wet paper
upon it. The use of this procedure is to transfer
on the wet paper the powderly particles of the chalk
used in drawing, and to fix those remaining in

sneared. The tone of the drawing is rather deep-
ened than lightened by this operation; the copy on
the paper will be an exact reverse of the original.

several drawings laid on each other, may be passed
atwace; but if they are passed more than one way,
there is  hazard of their being moved and isplaced
in their passage back.
Sometimes prints are calqued by dissolving part of
their ink, by means of soap, and transferring it to  ground; or, white paper, ec.
 drawing in water colers may be calgued by pass-
ing over the outlines with  good black-lead pencil,
them warming the plate on which the ground is
laid, so as hardly to melt the ground; and, laying
the drawing on it, pass them through  rolling-press
properly adjusted. This method succeeds very well
for landscapes. Or, if  tracing be made with red
chalk, ground with water only, the colors will,
wheh passed through  rolling-press, be transferred
to the ground on the plate.
CAMPEACHY-WOOD, is nearly related to BRa-
 and by no means superior for its utiliry in the
arts; but it furnishes  good purple.
CARMINE, is  bright, deep, rich, crimson color,
bordering something on purple, used constantly in
water colors, but very rarely in oil; because it
will not mix kindly in oil, as well as because of its
high price. It is  color which spends well. Car-

CHARCOAL, is an artificial coal, or fuel; being
wood half burnt, and then extinguished. It is an
excellent material to sketch with in beginning 
design, as it may be brushed out even by  feather.
The softest kind is preferred, which is that made of
the willow.
CHALKS, are very useful in the art of design,
being usually put into the hands of beginners. We
have WHITE, RED, and BLACK CHALKS.
WHITE CHALK, of the best quality, is usually
brought from Ltaly, which country does not possess
our common chalk, but  distinct species. Italian
chalk is in its texture more firm and compact, its
touch is uch smoother and neater than any other,
consequently it may be used on smaller subjects.
The same remark is just on the black chalk of
Laly.


  WHITE CHALK, is soft, and adapted oufr

for large subjects, as are all the chalks of France:
its black chalk is only fit to be used where expedi
dition admits of stumping. Considerable quantivies
of SPANISH chalk are imported; which is in
fexture between the foregoing, but not very smooth,
RED CHALK, is very much used in design. it is in
general of  kind and moderate temper, and readity
forms  grain. It is, however, very far froth cleanly
inits nature, and is apt to smear, and stain; whatever
it touches; the precautions necessary to guald
against this quality, in fact, contribure to its useful
hess, since whoever having been Habitnated to red
chalk can draw clean with it, is secure from injury
by using other materials.
Red chalk is best used simply on white paper, but
some shadow it with black chalk; or, stump in black
chalk first, into the shades, and relieve with red.

COLOGNE EARTHl, is of  deep brown color,.  in oil, but mere in water colors.
It is  very singular substance, reckoned by the
colormen not  little troublesome to manage. It
has been, and still is by some accounted  genuine
earth; but athers say it contains  great proportion
of regetable matter. It does not form, like other
earths,  regular; of entire, stratum where it. is
found, but is gathered in large flat separate masses,
 among, other strata.
It is moderately dry while in the earth, and of 
texture soft and crumbling, when dried it becomes
more compact, and united;  is very light, smooth,
and easily reduced to pieces, adheres firmly to the
tongue, and is very astringent, and austere, in its
Faste, resembling the taste of oak bark; from these

the spring of the year, when cut.
Genuine CoPAL is very rare; but in default of
this, is brought from the West India islands, another

CRAYON, is  general name for all colored earths,
or other substances, used in drawing, or painting
dry,  . without oil, or water, ecc.
CRAYON substances are erther natural, or artificial;

consistence, and admits of being cutinto  convenient
Size and form; such are chalks, whose uses we have
nouced, such are black lead, charceal, Ec. but, in
general


 crayons are compositions of colored pig-
ments previously reduced to powder, and re-com-
posed into proper mixture and form.
The art of composing crayons, depends principally
on the mixture of the component colors, and on the
adaptation of the vehicle by which they are held
incorporated. This is evident, if we consider, with
respect to the brilliancy, or the truth, of the tone
of color, that it depends on the admission of more,
or less, of any certain pigment; and that all com-
pound colors, by possessing too much of any one
color which enters into their composition, may
prove, when used, unfriendly to their neighbours.
That the vehicle  of importance, appears from the
consideration that scarce any two earths are equally
tenacious; whence it follows, that as some naturally
of  loose texture are not without difficulty held by
strong binders, others naturally compact, would be
rendered, by such binders, almost stones; and; in-
deed, these are the prevailing faults among those
usually offered for sale.
It is perhaps proper to remark, that, although sofi
crayons are preferable generally, yet crayons may be
 soft, even for large works; and that for smaller
works they may be never the worse if  little firmer;
yet preserving the utmost distance from bardness.
Soft crayons may, however, be used in large per-
formances; but those which are too hard to give
their colors freely, or without wetting, are to be
rejected, as totally useless.
For smaller works, CRAYON PENCILS have lately
been composed; whose utility depends, like thar of

White chalk is so readily offered by nature, that

( composer, are all crayons made; and an endless
variety of shades results from their different com-

  
 
binations.
The different compositions of colors must be cut
into proper lengths, after they are prepared, in
order to be rolled into pastils for use. Each crayon
should be formed by being rolled in the left hand
with the ball of the right; and be formed firstcylin-
drical; then taper at each end. If the composition
be too dry; dip the finger in water; if too wet; the
composition must be laid on the chalk again, till
more of its morsture is absorbed. The erayons
should be rolled as quick as possible; and, when
finished, must be laid upon the chalk again; to lose
all remaining morsture. After the gradation :of
tints from one color are formed, the stone should
be well scraped; and cleansed with water, before it  for another color.
It is impossible to lay down rules for mingling
of every tint necessary in composing  set of Cray-
ons, there being many accidental compositions, en-
firely dependant on fancy and opinion. The stir-
dent should make it  rule to save the leavings; of
his colors, for of these he may form many. varioils
tints, which will occasionally be useful.
We suppose now, that we desire to make crayons
of any color: In this case, we first prepare the
simple color, grinding it with spirits of wine, till it
be perfectly smooth, fine, and even; then, taking
 proper quantity of it, we lay it on the chalk, till
somewhat advanced toward dryness; then we roll it,
and form it, and return it to the chalk to be finished
  drying theroughty. Of the cofor which remaing
ready ground we proceed to compose tihts of vai
ous shades, by mixture with the purified chalk,, 
whiting, already mentioned,â€”as thits:
Take some of the simple color, and levigate 
with spirits of wine, adding about one part of washed
whiting to three parts of color, of which, when
Properly incorporated, make two parcels. The new
gradation should be composed of two equal quant.
ties of color and whicing, of which four crayons may
be made. The third composition should have ope
fourth color, and three fourths whiting, of this mate
sir arayons, which will be  good proportion with
the rest. The last tint should be made of whiting
very faintly tinged with color, of which make abou
eight crayons, which will complest the above-mes
tioned proportion. As these compound tints are
levigated, they are to be laid immediately on the
chalk, that the morsture may be absorbed to the
groper degree for their formation into crayons. 
Its consistency be right, the composition may ther
be laid upon the glass, which will prevent it from
beceming too dry before it is convepient to form 
into crayons.
CRAYbNs when complete should be kept in  ber
by themselves, each sufte of colors distind,
t prevent injury from its neighbours; in the order
from lightest to darkest; and, if numerous
the lighter ones separate from the darker of the
same color.

By the combinations to be gathered from these
hints, may be composed an nexhaustible variety of
tints. It is seldom that an: artist procures  com-
plete set of crayons (price not less than three guineas)
but selects what he chooses from among others, to
form his collection, which is more or less numerous
at pleasure.
When the set of crayons is completed according

to the rules prescribed, they should be arranged in
classes for the convenience of painting with them.
Some thin drawers, divided into  number of par-
titions, is the most convenient method of disposing
them properly.â€” The crayons should be deposited

according to their several gradations of lightness.
The bottom of the partitions must be covered with

FLAKE WIITTE, is lead corroded by the vinous
acrd. The purest and best is brought from Ltaly.
It is very useful in oil, and varnish painting;
because those vehicles prevent the access of the ar
so as to act upon the lead; for, it is to be observed,
that however prepared, lead constantly retains 
lisposition to recover its natural color, Hence,
in water colors, the air to which it is liable, injures
it, as also does every ferruginous mixture. Water,
impregnated with iron, will in time turn the white,
with which it is used, into  dirty black: and will
even hurt the lighter colors, into mixtures of which
the white has been admitted.
To prevent this in part, some use distilled water;
others, content themselves with grinding the white
lead first in vinegar, till it becomes thoroughty
 then washing it with water, till it returns to
whiteness: and this they think will maintain its

FRUIT.â€”As many of the colors used in the arts are
extracted from vegetables, it should seem by parity
of reason that many might be procured from FRvIT-
but all :endeavours to this purpose have hitherto
failed; for however bright the colors thus extracted
may seem, they quickly fade. It is true, the juises
of currants, mulberries, elder-berries, morello, and
black cherries, may be dried, and if worked up
again, they give nearly their first color, but it
cannot be depended on, especially if exposed in the

open  might, nevertheless, be worth while to examine
the juices of fruits natives of warmer climates, which
require and receive most solar heat to bring them to
perfection: since those juices which are naturally
most exalted, are usually most durable, and best
admit of extracting in tincture. The bright red
fruit of the opuntia, or prickly pear, is said to fur-

GOLD SHELL, is used to write gold letters in

gold leaves, or gold-beater' fragments, with  little
honey, and afterwards washing the honey from the
gold by water. The gold thus procured, may be
transferred by  little gum-water to the shells for use.
Another process is thus given :â€”Grind the finest
leaf-gold with strong gum-water very fine, adding,
as you grind it, more guim-water as you see heces-

wherewith it is to be shadowed, stroke it over with

GROUND for Etching. The importance of this
article to engravers is very considerable. There
are several compositions which have been employed
a grounds; (called varnish by some) as for instance:
REMERANDTS GROUND. Take half an ounce of
asphaltum burnt, and gum-mastic the same quan-
tity, one ounce of virgin wax; beat, or grind, the
mastic and asphaltum very fine; melt the virgin
wax, in  new earthen pot, over  gentle heat, add
to it, when melted, the mastic and asphaltutn, by
degrees, strring the mixture till they are thorough-
 incorporated; when intimately compounded
pour the whole into clear water, and make it into
 ball. In using this ground the plate must not be
to hot, and the thinner it is laid the better.
CALLOTS GROUND. Take  quarter of  pound
of virgin wax, and half  quarter of  pound of
asphaltum, the same quantity of mastic, one ounce
of rosin, one ounce of shoe-maker' pitch, half an
ounce of common pitch, half an ounce of varnish;
melt the wax, and add the other ingredients gra.
dually, as before, and, when incorporated, pour it
Into Water.
If the quantity of mastic be greater, it renders the
ground softer; which, if the quantity of mastic be
less, will be proportionably harder.
Another ground is made thus; To  quarter of 
pound of virgin wax, add, half  quarter of  pound
of asphaltum, one ounce of amber, one ounce of
mastic, grind the asphaltum and mastic very fine,

HORTUS SICCUS is  name given to  collection
of dried plants. As the manner of preserving spe-
cimens of this Kind may occasionally prove very
serviceable to artists; we shall transcribe the pro-

Cess from Dr. HILL:
Take


  plant in flower, with one of its bottons
leaves on it, if it have any; bruise the stalk, if too
rigid, or slit it if too thick; spread the leaves and
flowers on paper, as nearly in their natural order as
may be, cover them with more paper, on which.
place  sufficient weight. In  day, or two, or
whenever perfectly flat, lay the plants on  bed of
dry common sand; sift over them more dry sand,
and let them lay three weeks, or  month. After
they are perfectly dry, and hardened, they are
placed in books by the following cement: Infuse
for  considerable time before it is wanted, two
ounces of camphor in three quarts of water, shake
it from time to time. add, when the plants are
ready, two ounces of carpenter' glue, and two
ounces of isinglass, to  pint of water; let them
stand  day or two, then boil the liquor, and strain
it through  coarse cloth. Smear the backs of the
plants with this cement when warmed; lay them on
paper, and gently press them; then expose them to
the air  few minures, and finally lay them to dry.
under  small weight.
To preserve flowers perfectly; we are told, to
gather them when not yet thoroughly open, in the
middle of  dry day.; put them into  good earthen
vessel glazed within; fill the vessel up to the top
with them; and when full, sprinkle them over with
some good French wine, with  little sait in it;
then set them by in  cellar, tying the mouth of
the pot carefully down. After this, they may be
taken out at pleasure, and on setting- them in the
sun, or within reach of the fire, they will open, and
retain not only their color, but their smell.

LACCA


( STICK-LAC, improperly called CUnr LAc,
  red, brittle, transparent substance, brought
from Malabar, Bengal, and Pegu, used in painting
 varnishes, ec.
It is  Kind of comb, such as bees, and other
insects, make. On being broke, it appears divided
into many little cells, of  uniform figure, contain-
ing little bodies, or other parts, of the insects that
produced the lacca. These little bodies are of 
beautifulred; and, when broken, make  powder
as fine as cochineal. It is most probable they are
the embryos of insects, or, perhaps, their skins.
To obtain the fine red lac used by painters, boil
the stick-lac in water, filtre the decoction, and
evaporate the liquor to dryness over  gentle fire.
This being the first bright color obtained by this
process from similar materials, has given the name
of LACAUES, Of LAKEs, to several pigments not
otherwise related to it.
LAKE, is drawn from several flowers;  yellow
lake from flowers of juniper,  red lake from the
Doppy,  blue lake from the iris, or violet, esc.
The tinctures of these flowers are extracted by
digesting them several times in aqua vitz, or by
boiling them over  stove fire in  lixivium of pot
ashes and allum.
An ARTIFICIAL LAKE, is made of Brazil-wood,
boiled in  lixivium of the branches of the vine,
adding  little cochineal, turmeric, calcined allum,
and arsenic; it is incorporated with the bones of
the cuttle-fish, pulverized, and made up into little
fakes, and dried.
VOL. II. Edit.  render it very red, add the juice of lemon; 
make it brown, add oil of tartar.
DOVE-COLORED, Of COLUMEINE LAKE, is made
with Brazil of Fernambuc, steeped in distilled vine
gar for the space of  month, and mixed wif
allum incorporated in cuttle-fish bone.
TELLOW LAEE, is made by the following po
cess: Take  pound of turmeric-root in fire
powder, three pints of water, and an ounce of si
of tartar; put them into  glazed earthen vessd
and boil them over  clear gentle fire, till ite
water appears highly impregnated. Filtre the
liquor, and, gradually, add  strong solution of
roch allum in water, till the yellow matter is pre
cipitated; this, filtered again, will leave the yellon
matter behind. It is washed repeatedly with frest
water, till pure. In this manner may lake bo
procured from any of the tinging substances that
are of  strong texture, as madder, log-wood, &
but it fails in the more tender species as the
flowers of roses, violets, &cc.
 VELLOW LAKE Is also made from broom
flowers, thus; make  ley of pot-ashes and lime; in.
this, boil over  gentle fire, fresh broom-flowes
till the ley has extracted all their color: then bol
the ley in earthen vessels, adding as much allum 
the liquor will dissolve; empty this liquor intor
vessel of clean water, and the yellow color wil
fall to the bottom. Let all settle, and decant it;
wash the powder till the salts of the ley are washed
off; then separate the yellow matter, and dry it 
the shade.
REd





 LAkE is at present seldom prepared from
any other substance that scarlet rags, cochineal,
or Brazil-wood. The best of what is commonly
sold; is made of the color extracted from scarlet
rags, and deposited oh the cuttle-fish bone; it is
prepared thus:
Dissolve  pound of the best pearl-ashes in two
quarts of water, and filire the liquor; add to this
solution two more quarts of water and  pound of
clean scarlet shreds; boil them in  pewter boiler,
till the shreds have lost their color: take out the
shreds, press them, and put the colored water
yielded by them to the other : in the same solution
boil another pound of shreds; and likewise  third,
and fourth pound. While this is doing; dissolve 
pound and  half of cuttle-fish bone in  pound of
strong aqua-fortis, in  glass receiver; adding
more bone; if it produces any ebullition in the
aqua-fortis. Pour this strained solution gradually
into the other. The crunson sediment deposited
by the liquor is the LAkE: pour off the water, and
stir the lake in two gallons of hard spring water,
and mix the sediment in two gallons of fresh water;
repeated four or five times. If no hard water can
be procured, or the lake appears too purple, half an
ounce of allum should be added to each quantity of
water, before it is used. Having freed the lake
from the saits, drain off the water through  filter,
covered with  worn linen cloth. When it has
been drained to  proper dryness, let it drop
through  convenient funnel on clean boards, and
H drops will become small cones or pyramids, 
which form the lake must be suffered to dry.
RED LAKE may be prepared from cochineal, by
gently boiling two ounces of cochineal in  quart of
water; filtre the solution, add two ounces of peal
ashes dissolved in half  pint of warm watet, and
siltered. Dissolve cuttle-fish bone as in the forme
process and, to  pint of it add two ounces of
allum dissolved in half  pint of water. Putths
mixture gradually to that of the cochincal ad
pearl-ashes, as long as any ebullition appears po
arise; and afterwards proceed as above.
 beautiful RED LAkE may be prepared fron
Brazil-wood; by boiling three pounds of it, duiing
an hour, in  solution of three pounds of common
salt in three gallons of water; and filtering the hot
faid through paper: add to this  solution of fie
pounds of allum in three gallons of water. Dissoly
three pounds of the best pearl-ashes in  gallon and
 half of water, and purify it by filtering; put this
gradually, to the other, till the whole of the cold
appears to be precipitated, and the flaid be left co
lorless. But if any appearance of purple be seeh
add  fresh quantity of the solution of allum, by
degrees, till it becomes scarlet. treat the sediment
as before. If half  pound of seed-lac be added to
the solution of pearl-ashes, and dissolved in 
before its purification by the filtre; and two pount
of the wood, and  proportionate quantity of com
inen salt and water, be used in the colored solutiof
 lake will be produced that will stand well in of
or water, but it is nnot so transparent, in oil, 
without the seed-lac.
The


 lake from Brazil-wood may also be made by
adding half an ounce of anotto to each pound of the
wood. The annotto must be dissolved in the solu-
tion of pearl-ashes.
LEAD, BLACK, is used to make pencils; not being

RED LEAD, or MINIUM, is  cals of lead, of 
vivid orange colour, or yellowish-red; which colour
it acquires by the very slow calcination to which it
 exposed. It is chiefly brought from Holland.
This colour would be very valuable, if it was dur-
able; but, like every preparation of lead, it  to become black. It is used in water colors,
and requires  moderate proportion of guin-Water,
and to be frequently stirred up while using, as its
weight inclines it to settle.

WHITE LEAD is kept in the colour-shops under
the name of Nottingham, and is used in oil for
COarser purposes.

LITMUS, is  blue pigment, procured from archil,
by adding to the archil (previously bruised by
grinding), quick-lime, and spirits of urine; the
mixture being evaporated becomes at length of 
due consistence. It is chieffy brought from Hol-
land. This colour is liable to change towards crim-
Son, by the least approach of acids.
Litmus may be thus prepared for use: boil an
ounce in  pint of small-beer wort till it acquires 
proper colour; then pour off the liquor, and let it

LOGWOOD furnishes an excellent purple undure
to obtain which some proceed thus:

Lquor is of  due colour. More logwood makes 
more purple; more Brazil-wood inclines it to red

MILINUM, famous for being the only white of the
ancient artists, is  fine white marley earth of  com

chieffy in the East, or the Levant.
Since white lead is so very deceitful, especially in
water-colours, might not this, or an earth of the
same species, well supply its place!
OCHIRES are an extensive genus of earths. The
most common are, yellow and red: but there are
likewise blue, brown, and green, ochres: and of
these several distinctions. Dr. HIrLL describes of
red, eleven sorts; of yellow, the same number; of
blue and green, one each, and of black two.
There are several Kinds dug up in England, and it
i probable, more might be found on examination.
They are cheap colours; from one penny to two

OlLS are very principal objects of  painter' care,
being so intimately mixed with the colors; on
which they have unquestionably much influence.
OIL, LISEED, is used to colours of deep shades,
but injures the lighter : it is sometimes rectified by
exposing it in  bladder to the sun, &cc. which ren-
ders it more transparent. Some painters reject it
totally, notwithstanding such rectification, which
they regard as of little use.

PLASTER OF PARlS is  very useful commodity
in the arts, as it not only receives impressions from
copper-plates, erc. but, being cast into molds,
affords copies of any piece of sculpture whatever,
at  very reasonable rate; and, perhaps, nothing imore
contributes to the acquisition of knowledge in de-
sign, than  careful study of excellent Plasters; since
they are, in some respects, superior even to  living
model, always retain their situations and attitudes,
and greatly assist an artist in the projection of
shadows, ec.
Plaster of Paris is dug out of quarries in  substance
like  stone, and is then termed crude: To prepare.
it for use, the stone is calcined thoroughly; then
pounded and very finely sifted.

This powder mixed with water, qurckly:  or
hardens into  solid consistence; and; when setting;
increases in bulk, which property renders it so highly
and singularly applicable in forming casts; ecc.
To take dn impression off  plate, by means of plas-
ter of Paris, nothing more is requisite, than after
having prepared the plate with ink; and cleaned the
surface; to thix the plaster with water, and pour it
on the plate, in  few minutes it will dry, and easily

As it is probable that many vegetables, if treated in
the same manner as saffron, might afford permanent
calors, we shall transcribe from the Philosophicd
Transactions an account of the method of dryingi
 styles,or chives, being separated from the
other parts of the plant, are dried on  Kiln. of  pro
per constructien; over which they lay, , net-werk

of Iron-wite, or  hair-cloth, and over. this five of
six sheets of white paper; upon which they spread
the saffron two or three inches thick.  They corel
this with other sheets of paper; over the whole they
  coarse blahker, rve or six rirfies doubled, or 

canvass pillowfilled with straw; when the fire, which
is made of charcoal free from smoke has warmed it,
they lay on the whole  board; having  large
weight. When the chives have been sweated and

dried, for about an hour, they turn the papers and

saffron cakes, and treat the fresh side as the other.
The cakes are repeatedly turned, till thoroughly
dry, which usually takes about twenty-four hours.
English saffron is the best in Europe.
SAP-GREEN is furnished by buckthorn berries,
which being gathered when ripe, are bruised and put
into  brass Kettle; with some pounded alum, where
they are suffered to remain for several days; they
are then pressed, and the liquor hung up in  blad-
der to dry and harden. This is afterwards dissolved
in water or wine, (Canary is said to be the best to
preserve it from starving), this again consolidated,
is sold in the shops.

TERRA SINOPICA, by many called BLOOD STONE,
is an earth of  purple color, varying in tone, and
depth of color, found in plenty in the Jerseys in
America, and probably elsewhere. Its color renders
further acquaintance with it highly desirable. Its
texture is close and compact: its weight consider-
able. It is not very hard, melts slowly in the
mouth, is perfectly pure and fine, and retains its
color in the fire. Why should it not be brought
into further use ?

TERRA DI SIENNA, like other earths, is denomii=

 ROOT is in form not much unlike
oinger : as it grows old, it becomes brown. To ex-

tract  yellow tincture from it:
Put two ounces of proof spirit, and one ounce of
water in  phial, with two drachms of powdered tur-
meric root; let them stand three or four days, shak-

the tincture of Avignon berry.

be previously well ground.
VARNISII is used to give  gloss, and lustre; to
works. Also to defend them from the weather,

There are divers kinds of varishes; some of the
principal are as follow:
AMEER VARNISH is prepared in the following
manner; put four ounces of amber into  crucible,
and melt it with  small degree of heat; pour it
out upon an iron plate; when cold, reduce it to
powder, and add to it two ounces of drying oil,  .
linseed oil, thickened by being boiled up with
litharge, and one pint of oil of turpentine; dissolve
the whole together into  liquid varnish.
This simple amber varnish is of great use for many
purposes, and is said to be the basis of the fine var-
msbes which we see on coaches, and might be ap-
plied to pictures with good effect,

 finishing varnish for paintings in oil :â€”The
finest and clearest coach varnish, made of copal
one quart, (the Birmingham varnish is yet better,
there being no oil in it) put it into an earthen pip-
Kin, set it over  very gentle fire, it need not boil, if
pretty hot it is enough; at the same time set
ahnother pipkin over the same fire, containing three
half pints of turpentine and half  pint of strong
drying oil mixt together; when hot take both pots
off, and pour the varnish in very small quantities
into the turpentine and oil, every time replacing
the pots on the fire to preserve the heat; repeat
this several times,  dozen at least, till the whole
 mixt, keep it continually sarring to incorporate
them well; take it from the fire as soon as possible,
lest it brown the varnish.
. . Were they put together cold, too hastily.
or in too large  quantity at  time, the copal
would be precipitated to the bottom.
Let it stand to clear, well stopped in  bottle for
use. So much oil being thrown into it, prevents its
Cracking, and makes it more proper for oil paintings;

it is long in drying, and must be kept free from
dust; after two or three days it sets, and retains no
stickiness, as mastic, &cc. always does.
VOL. II. Edit.   small pictures may be neatly painted with
this varnish alone.
This varnish hardens so strongly on the picture,
that it cannot be taken off again, but must be
painted over if any alterations are intended.
 varnish that may easily be removed is made of
isinglass diluted with water, with the addition of
one-fourth or one-fifth the weight of the isinglass,
of sugar, or honey.  sponge and hot water will
readily remove this from the picture, ec. over
which it is used.
MASTIC VARNISH is made by putting five
ounces of powdered mastic into  proper bottle,
with  pound of spirit of turpentine, and setting
them to boil in balneo Marix, till the mastic
be dissolved, and straining the solution through
Hannel. This varmsh may be converted into 
varnish for painting with, by grinding one ounce
of guin anme on  stone with water, till it becomes
an impalpable powder; then drying it, and grinding
it again with half an ounce of turpentine, and after
wards with the proper colors, and morstening it with
the mastic varmsk, till the mixture be of  due
consistence for working with the pencil. It must
then be kept in phials or in vessels, and diluted, as
there may be occasion, with spirit of turpentine.
Price As. or  per pint.
Others recommend the following mastic varnish,
as very useful for glazing:â€”Twelve ounces of pure
mastic put to one quart of spirit of turpentine in 
glazed earthen pot, (for safety have  large iron
heater made nearly red hot, on this set the pot in
SOIE


( open place, where free from danger) let it boil
very gently about  minute, it is easily dissolved
even without boiling; keep stirring it with  stick,
when melted set it by to clear itself. Keep it in 
bottle well corked for use.
To make the VARNISH recommended by NENGS.
To two ounces of the finest mastic in powder add
fourounces of aqua di Rbasa, mix them in  glazed
pot, which must be set in  pan of boiling water,
and there continue over  slow fire for one, two, or
three hours, as shall appear necessary to bring it to
 proper degree of consistence for drying in  short
time after it is laid on the picture. This varnish
may also be prepared by being dissolved in the
sun. In using this varnish great care must be
taken that the picture is quite dry, and has been
painted five or six days at least, even then it will
be proper to let it stand for  short time, either be-
fore the fire or in the air, but the varnish must not
be laid on before the pieture is quite cold. After
the picture is varnished, it will be proper to let it lie
for  day or two free from dust, after which you may
work upon, re-touch or re-paint it as often as you
shall think necessary: but it will be proper to re-var-
nish the piece when you have completely finished it.

To make white or re-touching VARNISH.
Mix one ounce of gum-mastic with half an ounce
of hut oil, and  quarter of an ounce of spirit of

VIRNISHES
   for preserving paintings.

For this purpose some have recommended the fol-
lowing composition : viz. half  pound of guim san-
darac; an ounce and  half of Venice turpentine;
three quarters of an ounce of each of the gums
anime and copal; half an ounce of mastic; benzoin,
gum elemi, and white resin, each two drachms, and
one pound of rectified spirit of wine. The benzoin
and gum anime powdered, are put with the Venice
turpentine into  phial, with eight ounces of the
spirit; the copal and resin powdered are also put
in  phial with six ounces, and the powdered gum
elemi with two ounces of spirit of wine. The seve-
ral phials are frequenily shaken, till the guins, erc,
are dissolved; then the solutions are strained
through  fine linen cloth into one bottle, and when
the mixture has stood some days, it is decanted off
clear, and kept in  separate boitle for use. Some
have substituted sarcocolla for the copal,
Another composition is formed, by dissolving mas=
tic and sandarac, gressly powdered, of each six
ounces, and Venice turpentine half an ounce in 
quart of highly rectified spirit of wine, and strain-
ing off the solution. If it be required harder, an
equal weight of the gums apime and copal may be
added, and the quantity of spirit of wine doubled.
In the use of this varmsb, the painting should be
thorgughly dry, and it should be spread very gently
with the pencil. The varnish should be laid on in
 very wartn place, or the picture irself warmed to
 moderate degree, in order to prevent the chilling
of the varnish. in which case another coat should
B  added. And, indeed, two or three coats. are
necessary to preserve the painting, and to bring out
 due effect of its colors, if they are in that state
called sunk in, occasioned by the attraction of the
cloth, on the oils mixed with them.
An oil of turpentine yarnish may be made by
grossly powdering mastic and sandarac, of each four
ounces; two ounces of white resin, and sarcocolld,
anime, copal, and olibanum, of each one ounce, and
putting them into  phial with two pounds of oil of
turpentine, stopping the phial lightly, and placing
 in any gentle heat, so that the mass may not boil,
and straining off the solution for use.
Or,  varmish more simple, and equally good, may
be made by powdering two ounces of sandarac,
mastic and olibanum, of each an ounce and half;
or three ounces of mastic and Venice turpentine
half an ounce; and dissolving then in half  pound
of oil of turpentine, and proceeding as before.
WHITE VARNTSHiS usually made of guin sandarac
and gun mastic, dissolved in spirits, left to settle
two days; then strained through  linen cloth, and,
after standing some time, the clear poured off, and
bottled for use.
The more curious artists dissolve the two gums se-
parately; and, having made  separate varnish of
each, mix them occasionally, as their work requires
 stiffer or  softer varisb.
But for the best white varish more gums are re
quired; viz. Venice turpentine, gum copal, elems,
Ben anune, and white resin,

posed to the air, it will answer the purpose. With
this glue, while hot, wash over the print as quick as
possible, and let that stand for  day or so, to dry
well; wash it over again in the same manner, and
afterwards brush it over at such  distance from the
fire that it may not blister; do this also, two or
three times. Varnish it with white varnish, and let
it stand; afterwards varnish it again. If it should
at any time be soiled by flies or the like, you may
wash it with  sponge and water, to clean it.
The print should be previously mounted:  . past-
ed on  cloth, and secured by  straining frame.
VERDITER ought to be procured from the lapis

this kind is very rare.
VERDITER is obtained by adding chalk to  solu-
tion of copper in aqua fortis. It is prepared by the
refiners of silver, which metal is thought to assist
the copper. Some say pearl ashes would produce 
blue superior to chalk. When good, it is  cool,
full blue, but must not be greatly trusted to for du-
rability, either in oil, or in water.

 foregoing list contains those colors which are
generally adopted into use every master has some
nethod peculiar to himself in their management, as
well as  certain set of colors which may be termed his
favorites. Some, indeed, so perpetually resort to

formances strongly evidence the mannerist;  cha=
racter to be avoided by all who desire excellence.

we have done service to those who choose first to
count the cost: it may perhaps obviate objections in
the minds of some, to observe how reasonable are the
principal requisites for attempts in most branches of

We shall how proceed to offer  few hints of the
management of these materials; advancing from the
simple to the more complex methods of application,

 EM    
 TO THE




USE OF COLORS IN GENERAL.

BEFORE we proceed to explain the use of colors,
and the materials for practice, it may be proper to
premise  few observations, as introductory to the ap-
plication of them.
In general the more simply, and distinctly, colors
are used the better; they are not oply more easy to
work, but they are also brighter, and more durable.
Of colors produced by composition, such as green,
and purple, those tints which contain the fewest in-

gredients are usually to be preferred.
Some colors very necessary in painting in oil, are
entirely useless in water; others, of great service in
water, agree not with oil; and some which in appear-
ance promise well in other manners, are found defi-
cient in effect and durability, when used in erther.
Few colors are, in their natural state, fit for imme-
diate use, but must undergo previous preparation,
according to their texture or temperâ€”of these pre-
parations, the principal are WAsHINc and GRIND-
INs; but some require CALCINATION.
OF
 WASHING COLORS.
Colors are wASHED, by being mixed with, and

etrongly stirred about in,  proper quantity of fair
water, till the water having dissolved them, is tho-
roughly colored by them; if the sufface of the
Water appear greasy, take off that scum; then pour
the colored water into  clean bason, leaving the
grosser sediment behind: the water thus poured off,
will in  little time deposit  quantity of color.
This operation may be repeated, till the color obtain-
ed is sufficiently pure, which appears by its fineness,
and its prilliancy. The use of vinegar; of milk, or
of other liquids, is occasionally adopted by some
artists, for certain colors.

OF GRINDING COLORS
Colors are ground by means of  large muller, on 
flat stone; this operation requires strength and care;
they are occasionally collected together, as the mul-
ler spreads them, by means of  large knife; the
oil, or other vehicle, with which they are ground,
being added as wanted.
In grinding colors the motion of the muller should
not be too swift, but gentle, lest the color by being
heated, lose part of its lustre; especially, if it be 
color of no great body. In grinding white, observe
to cease, before it becomes greasy, or dirty.
Colors are liable to injury by being ground on 
stone not thoroughly cleaned from the color which
preceded : many persons who are curious, grind
their


 own (at least the finer colors) that they may
depend on their purity.
The GRINDING of colors should be continued,
till they are capable of uniting so intimately with the
wehicle they are compounded with, as to seem only
 liquid of that color, (which is termed bearing 
body); and those colors which permit this, are al-
ways most agreeable in using; whereas, some will
not embody, but are apt in working to separate, and
disperse. This remark chiefly concerns colors in-
tended for oil; many of the best water colors are fit
for use by being dissolved in gum water.
Colors ground in oil can be used only in oil. Oil
colors kept too long grow fat, and become useless.
Colors united with cUnrs, for the purpose of water
colors will not readily mix with oil.
Colors ground in SPIRITs may be preserved after
grinding, and used either in oil or in water, being
capable of mixture with either.
OFCALCININGCOLORS.
Some colors require CALCINATTON, to render
them fit for use; some are burnt, merely by putting
them in the fire till thoroughly red hot; others, are
rather dried than burnt, being placed in an iron
ladle over the fire, and kept there, till the smoke
they ennt ceases. Ivory, is burnt between two cru-
cibles, well luted together, and covered with coals.
OF


.  TEMPERING WATER COLORS.
The colors being free from those impurities which
are natural to them, to TEMPER them, take  small
quantity of any color, put it into  clean shell, or
cup,  add to it  few drops of guin water, and
incorporate them, by working them about the shell;
let them dry, and when dry, touch the color with
your finger; if any of it comes off, it requires 
stronger gum water; if the color shines, and glisters,
when dry, the guin water was too strong, and must
be qualified by lowering it with fair water. lways
let it dry before you use it; then, having wetted it,
take  proper quantity in your pencil, transplace it
on the pailet, and mingle such colors as the subject
requires.
GUM WWATER is made by dissolving  quantity of
sum arabic (the clearer the better) in fair water. The
strength of the gum water required must determine
the proportien of the ingredients. Take  quarter
of an ounce (or, perhaps, half the quantity) of
gun arabic, and pour boiling water on it in  tea-
cup, when dissolved it is fit for use.  little colo-
quintida added to the solution, will prevent flies
from injuring the work if exposed.
The wATER with which colors are united, is of
more consequence than is generally imagined; and,
unless limpid and pure, contributes to their fading.
Flake white, used with water containing particles of
Iron, soon becomes black, and disagreeable. To
remedy





 this evil, the curious use only distilled water,
which is easily obtained from  common tea-Kettle,
by condensing the steam; which, if the Kettle be not
too full of water, may be done, by binding round
the spout,  cloth wetted in cold water; or, by the
addition of  tin spout to fit the kettle, wetting, and
cooling, the cloth occasionally. There are mineral
waters, Erc. which produce very singular effects with
Sotie Colors.
But beside the colors which require the use of
guin water as above described, there are several use-
ful colors (extracted chiefly from vegetables) in the
form of tinctures; to obtain which, the customary
method is, to boil the ingredients, with the addition
of alum, in  quantity of water, till the water has ac-
quired  sufficient strength of color : sometimes the
nixture is boiled yet stronger; and sometimes, but
not often, the sediment of the mixture after boiling
 of use.
To use  color in tincture, (generally called 
WWASH COLOR) try first whether its strength be what
your subject requires; if it be too deep, it may be
lightened by the addition of fair water; if too light,
It may be deepened, by setting  saucer of it to sim-
mer over  gentle fire, till it acquires the strength
desired. The watery part may, by this means, be
nearly, or even totally, evaporated. Red Brazil
wash, for instance, will hereby take  solid form,
and afterwards work up pretty enough.
Boby ColoRs (as they are called, to distinguish
them from washes) may be ligbtened by being diluted
with water, but cannot be deepened beyond the
natural


 state of the original material; to shadow
which, when used of its full color, recourse must be
had to  darker color, of  similar species.
Care should be taken to keep the drawing, &.

should ruh to those parts, and there make patches of

If the paper will not readily take the colors, 
lirle fish-gall, or ox-gall, mingled among the colors,
will help them.
To prevent colors from sinking in, take roch alum
two ounces, and boil ir in  pint of spring water;
wet the back of the paper with  sponge dipped in
the water while warm. Some use starch applied at
the back.  yet stronger mixture, which will pre-
went the color from sinking not only on paper, but
likewise on sattin, is made, by boiling isinglass in
waters brandy, or spirit of wine, till the liquor is
strong, and clammy, then, after your outlines are
drawn, wash them over with this solution while hot.
Repeat it if wanted.
OFOIL COLORS.
 principal advantage of oil colors is, that after
they are dry they afford  constant opportunity of
being retouched, or even changed, either in whole,
or in part; thus, black may be re-colored white, or
brown, blue, &.; but, though this be undoubtedly
 great advantage, yet it is only to be used when re-
quired by necessity: for, the under color; if allied
to the superficial, promotes both force, and har-
mony; and it somstimes happens, that if the under

 beyond its due force, it may be lowered,
by diluting some similar color with oil, and (as it.  GLATING It over till it is brought to the tone.
 Glazing is sometimes used on  more im-
 or at least  more extensive plan; as when
great richness is wanted in some particular color, as
criison, &cc. after having painted and finished it, as
highly bright as he can, the artist glazes it over
with  coat of lake. Sometimes this is repeated, and
the lights re-touched; and instances have been, where
an artist has glazed  bright white into  crimson,
by means of carmine and lake, erc.


Glazing is best performed with colors naturally
transparent, such as lake, &cc. but, after all, it is
not applanded by those whose skill enables them to
produce equal effects without this practice.
Those painters who have attained nearest to  just
representation of nature,  have usually composed on
their pallettes,  great number of tints related to the
subject on which they were about to employ them;
and, by mingling these tints, they have approached
nearer to truth, than those who mingle the secondary.

OF RANKING COLORS.


Colors are ranked as follows, wHITE, FELEOw;
ORANGE, RED, PURPLE, BLUE, BLACK. WHITE,
and BLACK, are the extremes of color; yellow is
the color next to white; then green; then blue;
green is composed of  mixture of yellow and blue;
 of  mixture of yellow and red; purple of 
mixture of red and blue; these compound colors
admit an infinity of tints, as they incline most to
either of the primary colors of which they are com-
    
pounded.

is sine te   Riclll  thus given some general hints on the nature
of colors, by way of introduction,, we proceed to nor
fice, more particularly, the various manners of their
applications.

which are perfectly thin and flaid, usually called

with water, intimately mixed with them, by their

to the size of the space intended to be stained, briskly
apply the wash; always endeavouring to avoidâ€”

. All passing over the proper limits of that color;
 All rannings of the color into spots, or parts of 
deeper tint than the rest; occasioned by the settling
of  greater quantity of color in some places than in
others: or, sometimes, if one part of the space be
dry before the rest, by  second coat of color passing
over it. Begin the boundaries of your space first,
that you may not exceed them.
Be careful that no two limits, which touch each
other, are of the same color; since the prime intent
of this business is distinction.

Distribute yourcolors, if practicable, so as to pro-
duce  pleasing effect in the whole.
 After the various divisions are faintly washed, the
boundary lines should be very neatly colored with 
much stronger color of the same kind.
 COLORING PRINTS.
In this business regard should always be had first
to the paper on which the prints are printed; if it
sinks, it may require the assistance of roch alum, or
other strengtheners,
The body of printing ink, which remains on the
surface of the paper, should proportion, in many
cases, the strength, and consistence, of the color to
be used, according to the effect required. If it be
intended only to stan the print, the effect of the en-
graving will be useful as forming shadows, and as
keeping the drawing.. If it be proposed to color the
print highly, as advancing towards  picture, the
engraving, although it must be attended to as the
regulator, and guide, of form, and of effect, yet may
be concealed by  surface of color.
Ouit white color wherever you can do without it:
.  in the lights, or parts approaching to lights, let
the thipness of color supersede the admission of white.
Omit black color on the same principle : if you
cannot do entirely without it, take especial care to
use as little as possible, that it be not heavy.
 In the broad lights, rather mingle colors of nearly
 similar tone, to produce the effect required, than
admit white; the same principle adopt in the shades.
Take great care that the outlines of all objects are
mellowed, sweetened, and softened; and hnerther
sudden, nor rugged, nor cutting to the eye.
Sometimes  print may be washed, and afterwards
finished with body colors to good effect.
Farmony and tenderness of color should alwaysbe
much attended to: then distribution and warmth.
The proper colors are those for wATEk CoLoRs.
 TINTING DRAWINGS.
Drawings are tinted on the following principles:
. Sometimes after being outlined with  black-
lead pencil, they are stained; the sky and distances
in landscape with  thin wash; the ground and front
objects with body colors, then wrought up to effect
with stronger colors alone, or united with Indian ink.
II. Sometimes they are more perfectly ourlined,

and washed with Indian ink;, then the colors are
added afterwards to finish the whole.
Drawings done in colors only, seldom look well,
being usually deficient in effect and repose; for be
it always remembered, glaring colors are purtful.

The best way for slight drawings, is to, procure an
effect with the Indian ink, and then  brilliancy, and
Variety of tone, Ecc. with colors.
Flesh colors should be very tenderâ€”the less the
Hish is loaded with color the better.
In general, the lights require more finishing than
the shades; in which  breadth of pencilling has
usually an excellent effect. Warmth is very neces-
sary in all drawings; opposition of colors -should be
carefully attended toâ€” heavy effect in  drawing is
very bad.

The middle tiht is the beauty of all drawings, and
should predominate throughout the whole.
The proper colors are those for WWATER CoLORS.
OF



 PAINTING IN WATER COLORS.



This part of art is seldom practised in historical
ot
 or figures, they being generally treated

 
in oil; yet it has both its uses, and its beauties: The
 are free from smell, and often rich, and pleas-
 they are mixed on the principle of oil colors,
 
 rejecting white where proper.

As it is impossible to convey by words exact ideas

of the numerous combinations, tones, and variations

 colors, it is evident, that the following directions
 igs
must be understood with great latitude. They may
serve to impart the rudiments of  principle, to be


 according to the efrects desired; but the same

proportions of colors will not serve every occasion
equally well, nor produce the same harmony, or even
appearance, if surrounded by different neighbours.

Directions, therefore, are, at best, but very imper-
 
feet; and, though we think it to the advantage
 students to insert these directions, yet we are
aware of their imperfections to many purposes which
may be required in treating of different subjects.

It is evident, even on  slight inspection, that the
proportions of the several ingredients in these com-
bound colors must vary the tint, the tone, and the
effect of them when used : as no general rules can
be laid down which shall suit every subject, we
leave to the accuracy of the students eye and judg-
nent the making of those peculiar variations; which
every different composition requires.
Directions for laying on the different Colors.
Before you begin, have all your cofors ready before
you;  pallette for the conveniency of mixing them;
. paper to lay under your hand, to keep your work
clean, as well as to try your colors on; also  large
soft brush, or fitch, to wipe off the dust when your
colors are dry.

Lay your colors on very thinly at first, decpening
them and mellowing them, by degrees, as you see
occasion. The quicker you lay them on, the evener,
and cleaner, your drawing will appear.
Take care to preserve all your colors from dust;
and before you use them, wipe your shells, and pat
lette, every time with your fitch.
When you have done your work, or, would lay it
aside, be careful to wash out your pencils in clean
 
Waril Water.
For


 face-painting, mix up carnation, or ffesh
color, with gum-water, in  shell by uself. For 
fair complexion mix vermilion and flake white; for

 swarthy one, add  little masticot, English ochre,
Of Doth.

Let your Hesh color: be always lighter. than the

   you would paint; for, by 

Cn It, you may easily, lower it, but you cannot rea-

.
diay heighten it.
  

for the cheeks and lips, use  mixture of lake and
red lead, or carmine, as occasion requires; and fof
blue tints, (as under the eyes, and in the veins
 
indigo, or ultramarine, and white.

In coloring landscapes, at first only lay dead co-
lors, smooth, all over the piece, leaving no part un=
covered; use  masterly freedom; and the work,

though seemingly rough at first, will have  good

effect when finished.
Let not the roughness of the color dis=ourage you;
 it is easy to soften it by degrees, with the other
shadows, observing only to sweeten, and heighten,

them, according as the light falls.
In some places lay on strong touches, and in those
places bring your work up together to an equal
strength; tempering, and sweetening, your colors,
with  sharper pencil than the first, that no lumps,

or harsh edges, be left, but that all your shadows
may be soft, and smooth, and gliding gently, as it
were, into one another.
You are not to finish any part before another, but
work up all the parts gradually alike, that you may
judge of their effect on each other, and on the whole.
N laid your dead colors, begin first with the
distances, and lighter parts, as the sky, sun-bearns,
Eic. then the yellowish beams (which are to be done
with indsticot and white); next the blue of the sky
(with ultramarine, bice, or smalt alone); making
jour Colors deeper as you rise upwards from the hori-
 except in tempestuolis skies. The tops of
distant mountains must be worked so faint; that they
ay seem to lose themselves in air.

All distant objects imust be made imperfect as they


appear in natiure. and all distances must be finished
with colors laid as thin, of in as small quantities as
possible.

 your colors forward as you advance to the
MAIF
front; till you come to the fore-ground itself:
where you may employ not only stronger colors, but
 greater quantity of them, and in  bolder manner.
In coloring trees, boughs, and branches, touch in
all the dark shades first, raising the lighter leaves

apove the darker; the uppermost of all are to be
done last; tough lightly the extremities of the leaves,
and set off the darkest shadows with sap-green and
indigo; or other strong colors.
The intentofevery picture, &, is to imitate nature;
therefore, where nature indicates different compo-
sitions of colors, from what we have given above,
 Seoce
compose them as fear as possible; if you fail at first,
you may sacceed afterwards. It is not to be sup-
posed that the real effect of colors in combination,

can he understood or attained till after the hand and

the eye are inatured by practice and re-consideration.
OF





(   PAINTING IN MINTATURE.
Painting in minlature has many advantages over
other branches of art. It. is nearer, and not so

incumbered with materials; as you may easily take
with you all that are necessary, and entertain your-

self wherever you please, quit and resume it when
you will, without such  variety of preparations as
are necessary in oil coloring.
The colors are those used for water colors; they-
must be of the best quality, finely ground, cleanly
 erc. and mixed in the shells with gum water
 must be reserved in  phial kept corked, and
observe never to take any out with  pencil that has
color on it, but with  quill cut for the purpose in
the form of  scoop.
To Know whether yourcolors are properlygunmed,
draw your pencil when filled with color on your
hand, which dries immediately, and should you per-
ceive that it cracks or shines, it is then too highly
gummed; but if it rub off, by lightly passing your
finger over it on your hand, it has too little gum in
it, and must have an addition put into the shell, tak-
ing care not to use too much gum, which makes they
color hard. Gum adds strength to dark colors;
and when you choose to give  greater force to any
color than it naturally bears, increase the quantity
of sum.
To correct the greasiness of dark colors, mix 
little of the gall of an ox, carp, or cel, particularly
 latter, dried and dilured with brandy for use;
this makes the color work free, and prevents its
scaling.
Ivory is generally used to receive the colors, but 
card is very useful, and may be sufficient for slight
subjects.
The choice of good pencils is  great matter,
therefore wet them  little as you draw them through
your lips, and if the hairs keep close together (as
you turn them on the back of your hand; and make
but one point, they are fit for use; but if they make
several points some longer than others, they are use-

 When they are too sharp pointed, with only
 few hairs longer than the others, they must be trim-
ined with  pair of scissars, taking care not to clip
dway too much. It is necessary to have different
sizes, the larger for laying grounds and dead coior.
ing, and the smaller for dotting and finishing.
To bring the hairs of your pencil to join close
together, and make  fine point, just put it between
your lips, moistening and pressing it, leaving only
so much color on it as is sufficient to give fine and
equal touches. None of the colors used in miniature
painting are porsonous, of prejudicial, except King'
yellow, and orpiient, which are seldom, or never

used. This method is particularly used for dotting
and finishing the naked parts of  picture, that the
touches may be neat, and not too much charged with
color. As for draperies, and other large masses; it  to draw the pencil over the edge of the
shell to unload it, giving  few strokes upon  card,
or paper, before you use it on the picture.
The


(  North light as desirable for the painting-roomi,
as by that light we view objects most truly, and with-
out glare; it is necessary to admit the light at one
window only, and that confined to your work,


placing your left side next it, and your desk on  just high enough to wark at, in an easy, and
graceful manner,, without stooping, or crampness,
&. which is very detrimental to health.
Sketch the outlines of the picture with thin car-
mine; this being finished, proceed to dead color;
making the shadows, tender, that they may afterwards
be heightened by dotting, and brought to proper
color, and spirit.
There are several methods of dotting, and every
painter has that peculiar to himself; some make their
dots perfectly round, others make them long, but
the best and most expeditious manner, is by little
strokes that cross each other every way, till the work
appears as if it had been dotted; softening them, so
as to give your picture  fleshymellowness, and avoid.
ing all dry, or hard touches.
After you have dead-colored  picture, begin the
back-ground. First, lay in  light tint of the proper
color, then pass  layer of the same color over that;

laying it as smooth as possible with large strokes of
the pencil, . . not with dots.
 Dark back-grounds are composed of bistre, umber,
or Cologn earth, with black and whire, others more

yellow, with  great part ochre. Black, white, and
 little indigo, for grey back-grounds: Dutch pink,
 and black, make  greenish, or olive ground,

correctly, begin the shades with vermition and car.

mine; giving the strongest touches at the corners of
the eyes, next the hose, under the nose, the ears, and

inder the chin; the fingiis; and in every part where
you would mark out separations in shades that are
obscure.
Next lay in the blueish tints with indigo, on such
parts as go off; or turn from the light; as the temples,
under, and in, the corners of the eyes, on both sides
of the mouth,  little on the middle of the forehead,
between the nose and eyes; on the side of the checks,

the heck, and such other parts as nature indicates.
Fellow tints are composed of ochre and vermilion,
and are given on the sides of the nose towards the
Bottom, under the eye-brows,  little underneath
the checks, and on the other parts which rise, and



come forward, to the sight. It is particularly: in
these tints the complexion is to be observed.

Vhen you have done your dead-coloring, and laid
in the several tints, proceed to finish, by dotting
over the shadows with greenish tints, and finishing
the yellowish and blueish tints before directed. Soften
the extremity of your shades on the light sides, pre=
serving the color of the vory for  middle tint, which
adds  fine sofiness to  picture. Finish your strong
shadows with bisfre and vermition, or terra di Siennd;
and in some parts with pure bistre, according to the
subject you are painting, laying on your colors as



clear as possible.

It is  frequent over-sight in artists to think
when they have completed the head of  portrait,
which being drawn from nature, possesses in conse-
quence  considerable degree of truth and force, that
the picture is finished, and their work is done;
whereas much of the grace of the picture, and very
much of the general effect of it, depends on the

addition of accessaries, which are to complete its
these, if well disposed, and apply suited to the
main subject, not only embellish that subject; but
confirm and invigorate its effects, by imparting 
splendor and brilliancy throughout the whole:â€”
whereas if unsuitable and unfit, they enfeeble what has

been already well done, and spoil that which in itself
had spirit:â€”In short, for these also consult Nature.




  CRAYGNDRAWINGS.
The following article will furnish much informa-
tion in the manner of using crayons, which may with
propriety be adopted in drawings, intended afterwards
to be finished with chalks; to that article, therefore,
we refer, as illustrating the present.
The procedure, in this instance, is, by preparing
the masses of light and shade with crayons, either
lightly touched with the finger, or more accurately
defined with  stump, according to the size of the
subject. The drawing being thus inserted in proper
colors, the chalks (chiefly red and black) are very
neatly stippled into every speck, or interstice, agree-
ably to the color of the part,  . using red chalk,
where the flesh inclines to red, and black chalk in
the shalows, or, in the parts inclining to blne, ec.
 In working some subjects, it is  good way to
Scrape  little powder off each crayon that may be
requisite, and to lay the several listle heaps of color
in order on white paper: then (the outlines being
Dreviously drawn) with small rolls of paper carefully
made, rub in the colors; and finish with chalks.
Stumps made of Kid-leather (gloves, if not soiled
in that part, serve very well) rolled up tightly, will
answer the purpose yet better, Some use stubbed

camel'-hair pencils.
Several crayons made of earths, when thoroughly
dried, then gradually warmed, or rather heared, and
dipped into linseed oil, till saturated; may be shar=
pened to  very fine point; and the lines drawn by
them, will not be injured without violence. Perhaps,
by judicious experiments,  complete set might be
Cemposed.

OF CRAYONS.
The perfection of crayons consists much in their
being kindly tempered; for it is impossible to exe-
cute  brilliant pieture with them if they are not; on
which account great care should be used in forming
them, to prevent their being hard. We have al-
ready forbid white lead in their composition, because
it will certainly turn black; which white chalk;
tobacco-pipe clay, or whiting, well washed, will
ot do.
Whether  painter works with oil colors, water
colors, or crayons, the grand object of his pursuit
is still the sameâ€” just imitation of nature: But
each species has its peculiar rules, and methods.
Painting with crayons requires, in many respects, 
treatment different from painting in oil; because
colors used dry are generally warmer than when wet
with oil.
The proper paper for crayons is  strong
Daper,
it
either brown, or blue; the thicker the better, if not
t coarse and Knotty. The Knots should be levelled
with  pen-Knife, or by hard rubbing; then pasts
the paper very smooth on  linen cloth, previously
strained; but, some artists reckon it most eli-
gible to delay pasting the paper till the subject is
dead-colored.. The method of doing this, is by
laying the paper thus dead-colored, on its face, on
 smooth table, and pasting the back of the paper;
the frame, with the strained cloth, must then be laid
on the pasted side of the paper, after which turn the
painted side uppermost, and lay  piece of clean
Paper
 on it to prevent injury: this done, it may be
stroked gently with the hand, by which means the
air between the cloth and the paper will be forced out.

  
with  box of crayons in the lap, is the
Sitting
most convenient posture to paint in.


The box made use of, when the student paints,

should be about  foot square, having nine partitions

in it. In the upper corner, on the left hand, (sup-


posing the box in the lap) place the black and grey

crayons, those being the most seldom used; in the
second partition, the blues; in the third, the greens
and browns; in the first partition on the left hand

of the second row, the carmines, lakes, vermilions,


and all deep reds the yellows and orange in the

middle; and the pearl tints next; as these last are of
 very delicate nature, they must be kept very clean,
that the gradations of color may be easily distin
guished: In the lowest row, let the first partition
  piece of fine linen rag to wipe the crayons
with while they are using; the second, all the pure
lake, and vermition tints; and the other partition
may contain those tints, which, from their complex
nature, cannot be classed with any of the former.
That part of the picture which is immediately
painting, should be rather below the face of the
 for, if it be placed too high, his arm will
be fatigued. The windows of the painting-room
should be darkened, at least to the height of six feet
from the ground (as before directed for miniature
and the subject to be painted should be situated in
such  manner, that the light may fall with every

advantage.

 features of the face being correctly drawn
with chalks, take  crayon of pure carmine; and

carefully draw the nostril, and edge of the nose HIcxt
the shadow, then, with the faintest carmine tint,
broadly lay in the highest light upon the nose; and
the forehead. Proceed, gradually, with  secondr
tint, and the succeeding, to the shadows, which must
be covered brilliant, enriched with lake, carmine; and 

deep green. This method will, at first, offensively
strike the eye, from its crude appearance; but will
be  good foundation to produce  pleasingieffect, in
finishing; colors being much more easily sullied,.
when too bright, than raised to brilliancy. The:
pearly tints of fine complexions must be imitated
with blue verditer and white; but if the parts of 
face where those tints appear, are in shadow, crayons
composed of black and white must be substituted.
Though all the face should be laid in as brilliant
as possible, yet each part should be kept in its proper
relation of tone, and of color, to the others.

Touch in the eyes with  crayon inclined to the
carmine tint, brilliant, not loaded with color, but
lightly: incline the light of the eye- very much to :
blue cast, cautiously avoiding  staring white; pre-
seiving  broad shadow occasioned by the eye-lash.
Avoid  heavy tint in the eye-brows; treat them like
 broad, glowing, shadow, on which afterwards the
hairs of the brow are to be painted; by which method
the former tints will shew through, and produce .
pleasing effect.

Begin the lips with carmine and lake; the streng
vermilion tints should be inseried afterwards. Mark
the corner of the mouth with carmine, brown ochre;
 greens, intermixed. If the hair is dark, pre-
serve much of lake, and deep: carmine,, therein;
This may be easily overpowered by the warmer
hair hats, which will produce  rich effect when
finished.
Having dead-cofored the head, sweeten the whole
together, by rubbing it over with the finger passed

Ofteny because it will produce rather the appearance
of  drawing; than of  painting. To avoid this,
replenish the picture with crayon wherever, and as
often, as necessary.
When the head is somewhat advanced, let the
back-ground be laid in; which must be treated in 
different manner, covering it as thin as possible. Near
the face, the paper should be almost free from colot,
for this will do the head great service by its thinness.
In the back-ground, no crayon that has whiting in its
composition should be used, but chieffy such as are
least adulterated. The ground being thin next the
hair, will give an opportunity of painting the edges
of the hair in  light manner, when finishing.
The face, hair, and back-ground being covered,
carefully view the whole at some distance; remarking

what parts are too light, and what too dark; being
particularly atteative to white, or chalky, appears

The next step is to complete the back-ground and
the hair; because the dust, in painting these, will
fall on the face, and would much injure it if that was
completed first. From thence proceed to the fore-
head, finishing downward till the whole picture is
cempleted.
In painting the forehead the last time, begin with
the faintest vermilion tint, in the same place where
the faint carmine was first laid, keeping it: broach
In the next shade work in some light blue tints; in=
fermixing with them somewhat deeper vermition
tints, melting them into one anether. Some light
yellows may also be used, but sparingly; toward the
roots of the hair, strong verditer tints, intermised
with greens, will be of use. Pearly tints, compesed
of verditer and white, are to be preserved beneath
the eyes, under the nose, and on the temples; be=
heath the lips, tints of this kind are proper, mixing
them with the light greens and vermition.
In finishing the checks; let lake clear them from
any dust contracted from the other crayons; then,
with the lake intermix bright vermilion; and, last of
all, (if the subject should require   few touches
of orange-eolored crayon, but with extreme caution;
after this, sweeten that part with the finger as little
as pessible, for fear of producing  heavy effect.-

VOL. II. Edit.  eye is the most difficult feature to execute in
crayons, as every part must be expressed with the
utmost nicety, to appear finished; at the same time
that  painter must preserve its breadth, while partn-
cularising the parts. To accomplish this, it   good
general rule to use the crayon in sweetening, as much,
and the finger as little, as possible.When  point
to touch  small part with, is wanted, break off 
little of  crayon against the box, which will pro-
duce  corner. To dark eye-lashes, use some of the
carmine and brown ochre, and the crayon of carmine
and black; and with these, touch the irns of the eye
(if brown, or hazel). Red tints of vermition, car-
sine; and lake, will execute the corners of the eye
properly; but if the eye-lids are too red; they will
have  disagreeable appearance. The pupil of the
eye must be of lamp-black; between this and the
lower part of the irns, the light will catch very strong,
yet it must not be made sudden, but be gently dif-
fused round the pupil till lost in shade. When the
cye-balls are sufficiently prepared, the shining speck
must be made with  pure white crayon, first broken
to  point, and then laid on firm; but, if defective in
neatness, it may be corrected with  pin, by taking
off the redundant parts.
The difficulty, with respect to the nose, is to pre-
serve the lines properly determined, at the same time
so artfully blended into the check, as to express its
projection, and yet no real line to be perceptible on
close examination. In some circumstances it should
be quite blended with the check, which appears be-
hind it; and determined entirely with  slight touch

In coloring the neck; preserve the stem of  pearly
hue, and the light not so strong as on the chest. If
any part of the breast appears, its transparency must
be expressed by pearly tints; but the upper part of
the chest should be colored with beautiful vermis
lions, delicately blended.

It is evident, that the foregoing principles are ap-
plicable only to the finest complexions; it would be
absurd, to treat the portrait of  sea-officer with
transparent blues, and pearly tints.  variation of
colors, according to the subject, is indispensable;
but such variety is not difficult to whoever reflects.

on what has been already hinted. Crayons usually
appear to greatest advantage, in the tender blendings
of their tints, in female countenances: the warmer
and bolder colors succeed best in oil.

 We have been particular in noticing the

places of the colors, because the same rules apply in
many other subjects, and are drawn from nature
itself.
P  



 DRAPERL. AN CRAYONS:


 



Dark blue, purple, black, pink; and all kind of

red draperres, should be first tinged with carmine,
which will render the colors more brilliant than any
other method; over this, should be laid the middle
iiht, except the masses of dark shadow, which may
be laid on deep.

With the light and dark fints, the smaller parts
are to be made with freedom, executing, as much
with the crayon, and as little with the finger as pos-
sible: in each fold touching the last stroke with the
crayon; which stroke the finger must never touch.
In reflexions, the simple touch of the crayon will be
harsh, therefore, fingering will be necessary. With
respect to reflexions, in general, they must always
 of the same color as the object reflecting;
but in the case of single figures, of whatever color
the drapery is, the reflexion on the face must partake
thereof, otherwise the picture, like paintings on glass,
will have but  gaudy effect.
Linen, lace, fur, &. should be touched spiritedly.
with the crayon, fingering very little, except the lat-
ter; and the last touches, even of this, should be
executed by the crayon, without sweetening with
the finger.
The coat of crayons should be but thin on the
shadows, but in the lights  body of color will con-
tribute to force, and to durability.

  PAINTINC ON GLASS; OR BACE-PAINTING.
This manner of painting is executed with great
facility: it gives all the softness that can be desired,
and is easy to work; there are no outlines to draw;
nor shadows to insert, but the colors are put on.
without the trouble of either.
The prints for this purpose are done in mezzotinto;
but many of those well-finished, engraved in the
manner of chalks, are very proper; fory their sha-
dows being blended together, when rubbed on the
glass, appear soft, and united, as drawings in Indian
Ink.

From such prints cut off their margin, then on 
piece of fine crown-glass, very clean, the size of the
print, and free from Knots and scratches, lay some,
Vepnice turpentine on one side, quite thin and
smooth, with  painter' brush. Lay the print flat.
in water; when thoroughly wetted (which requires
four-and-twenty hours for some sorts of paper, but
other sorts are ready in two hours), take it carefully
out; and lay it between dry papers, that the super-
fluous water may be absorbed.
Next, lay the damp print flat on  table, with its
face uppermost; then, holding the glass over it,
without suffering the turpentine to touch it rill it is
exactly even with the print, gently press the glass
down in several parts; and turning it, press the print
with your fingers, drawing them from the centre to
the edges, till every part is quite smooth; and free
from blisters.

This done, wet the back of your print with

then rub it gently, and the white paper will roll off,

lights must be first inserted, the pictures are apt to
suffer by  coldness; which is evident in the per-

ciples of their art. This must be guarded against;
and care must be taken to give spirit to the pencil;
otherwise the smoothness of the glass will impart 

tameness to the picture.

GENERAL ELEMENTS OF PAINTING IN OIL.

 the predilection of many persons
for pietures in miniature, of in crayons, there are
scarce any who are not sensible of the superiority of
oil pictures: their more accurate coloring, and their
greater force, as well as their services in subjects of
considerable dimensions, render them principal ob-
 of attention.
 Of the ChoTHs necessary for this kind of painting
 of the pencils, tools, pallette, and pallette-knife;
&. see the respective articles in the Compendium

of Colors.


To these urensils most painters add, what they

at one end of which is tied  ball of soft rag, cotton,

against which it rests. This stick is held in the left.
hand, and its use is, to, support the right hand while
at work, keeping it steady, and firm; but many
artists who possess command and freedom of hand,


decline the mall-stick as  bad custom.
EASELS are of various forms, and contrivances,
but generally composed of three uprights orlegs, the
longest behind. In the two which are in front are 
number of holes, corresponding in height to their
opposites in each leg, so that when  peg is placed
in them, whatever is laid on these pegs, is kept even.
It is usual to place  slight piece of board (termed 
shelf) on these pegs to support small pictures.

  colors proper for painting in oil, ase usually
kept in the color shops in bladders, at certain prices;
and this is the best method of purchasing small quans
tities of them, except ultramarine, carmine, and
vermilion, perhaps also the lakes and Prussian blue,

which should be bought in powder, as in that state

they will be best preserved; the least touch of these
will give the picture  cast: mix up no more of these
Colors than you want for present use, which must be
with  drop, or two, of nut-oil on the pallette, with
the pallene-knife.

To get the color out of the bladders, prick  hole
in the side of each, and press it, till you have suffic
cient for present use; as what remains will dry and
skih over, and so become useless.

 FLAKE WHITE, when pure, is the very best
white; though it has not the body of Nottingham
 Lead. This color should be ground with the
 
finest poppy oil.
White is  very friendly working color, and
comes forward with yellows and redsâ€”but retires
with blues and greens. It is the nature of whites to
sink into whatever ground they are laid on; there-
fore they should be laid on white grounds to preserve
their brilliancy: or,  considerable body. of the

color should be laid on to allow for sinking in.
 Of NoTTINGHAM LEAD there are two sorts;
the best is little inferior in whiteness to the best
Slake white : it will stand well.

 WAPLES
VOL. II. Edit.  NAPLES TELLow will not bear iron to touch
it, without altering its tint. It should be  clean
tender color.
. PATENT YELLow  new invented coler, very
bright and durableâ€”dries very well.
 TELLOw LAk should be used sparingly; time
will deprive it of its beauty, unless it he well secured
by varnishâ€”it is  bad driey.
 TELLOw OCHRE. The best stone ochre is
very difficult to procure genuine; but the want of it
may be supplied by Sienna earth and Nottingham
white; which will produce pretty much the same
tint, or rather brighter, with this advantage, that it
is deeper in its tone, with less of the lead in it: the
great body of the lead supporting the Siennd earth,
which alone is semi-transparent.
. RED OCHRE is  valuable color, when prime
and genuine, for though cheap, it is often to be had
only of an inferior quality. The best is that which is
very hard and stony, difficult to grind, more difficult
to procure in perfection; this, with  little deep
lake, is not inferior to the best Indian red, in many
effects that may be produced by it. It is  friendly
mixing color, of great useâ€”should be ground with
put ail, though lipnseed oil is commonly used for it,
 LIGHT REp is fine light ochre burnt: this
mixes very agreeably with white, and produces 
flesh color of great use.
 FiNE RED LEAD. By an improved method
of pusifying it, is rendered very bright, and stands
well
 Of


 Of VERMILTON the true native cinnabar: is,
by some artists, reckoned the best. It will not
plate, but is  fine color when glazed. It is ground
with linseed oil; and should be used with dryingoil.
 PALE, or BRIGHT VERMILION, is esteemed
much the most useful of the vermitions; as the
effects of the others may be produced with this and
good lake : but they cannot equal the brightness of
this, by any mixture wharever.
 INDrAN RED, is  strong, pleasant working
color; but will not glaze well, and when mixed
with white falls  little into the leadch tone. It is
ground and used as lake;  mixture of red ochre
and lake is occasionally  substitute for Indian red:
nevertheless this is  useful and powerful colorâ€”in-
deed it is often rather too powerful, and especially
while wet, in which state it differs from itself when
dry: experience alone can justly foresee its true
effects.
 LAKE is  tender, sympathising decpred, but of
no strong body, therefore it should be strengthened
with Indian red. It is the best glazing color: It is
ground with linseed oil, and used with drying oil.
 CARMINE Is  most beautiful crimson between
lake and vermilion, is  fine working colot, and
glazes. It should be ground with nut oil, and used

with drying oil.
 BROWN OCHRE.  color allied to this may
be made from yellow ochre, and other mixtures of

the ochres,

 ANTWERP BROwN. This brown is not al
ways kept in the color-shops, we shall therefore give
here the manner of preparing it: it is valuable from
its great depth of tone; it has great body, and will
stand well, being produced by fire.â€”Put some good
asphalrum into an iron ladle, set it over  very slow
and feeble fire, taking care it does not boil over;
keep it there till it will boil no more, but is become
nearly  cinder; when cold, put to it the proportion
of half an ounce of sugar of lead to half  pound of

 BRowN PiNk is  fine glazing color, but of
no strong body; in the flesh it should never join or
mix with the lights, because this color and white are
enemies, and mix to  warm dirty hue; for which
reason their joinings should be blended with  cold

middle tint. In glazing of shadows it should be laid
before the other colors, that are to enrich it: it is one
of the finishing colors, and therefore should never be
used alone in the first painting. It is strengthened
with burnt umber, and weakened with terra verte

more certain, may be made from Antwerp brown
and patent yellow.
 UMEER, burnt or unburnt, is especially use-
ful in dead-coloring; it forms outlines, ec. well, or
washes in  subject, &xc. to advantage.
 BURNT UMBER is  very quick drierâ€”is 
fine warm brown, and  good working strong color:
it is of great use in the hair, and mixes finely with
the warm shade. It is highly commended by some
artists, and highly blamed by others, as  sullyingcolor.
 ULTRAMARINE Is the finest blue Known in
the world : it stands even in the fire; it is tender,
glazes beautifully, and never glaresâ€”it is  retiring
color. From its great value should be used with the
purest oils.
 PRUSSTAN BLUE iS  fine blue, and  Kind
Working color; but apt to be cold, and rarely or
never stands well : it should be ground in nut oil, as
grosser oils injure  Ir should only be ground

 LAMP-ELACK Is  troublesome color, and
should be burnt in an iron box till red hot; being 
greasy color, and when mixed with the strongest
drying oil, still requiring the assistance of  little
sugar of lead, to force it to dry.
 IvoRY BLAcK is far preferable to lamp-black,
as it mixes much berter with other colors; it is 
good shade for deep blue. Ivory black and  little
Indian red make  good general shadow colot; it is

color, of any cast: but every color has an inclination
to, of  tinge of, some other.  blue sky seems at
first an exception, yet it is not so in fact; nor the
color of the sed, nor the green of  field; for an in-
humerable variety of lights, reflexes, exc. are perpe-
jually playing upon it, and thereby diversifying,
debasing, and confusing, the original color. Even
draperies vary in the colors of their lights and shades:
the yellow light of the sun, the red light of  fire, 
white light, &cc. alter their appearances; and the
deprivation of light in the shades, as the parts are
more or less retired, is too obvious to need expla-
nation. yet, even shadows are altered by reflexions
from their neighbours.
It is evident, from this mode of reasoning, that to
set  pallette well, requires no meak skill; and per-
haps, if those who consider it as labour lost were to
bestow more attention on it, their pictures would not
fare the worse for it, we shall therefore give  variety
of modes, as practised by the best masters:
Method of setting the Pallette as used by Chevalier
Menss, and others.
 The principal light of fiesh is composed of
white and Naples yellow, or light ochre, or brown
ochre, according to the complexion of the person;
of these form the first and second tints.
 White, light red; with  little yellow.
 The same  little darkes.
For


  Middle Tint.
 White, black and yellow, tempered with :
bittle red.,
 The same  little darker.
For Shadorws.
. Tellow, black, with  little red : in three de-
grees of strength. In all these shadow tints  little
asphaltum may be used, in order to give  transpa-
rency and an harmony.
For  Warm Tint.

 Naples yellow and lake.
 Lake and vermilion.
 Lake and light red.
 Lake and terra de Sienna, burnt.
 little asphaltum must be used in all these
Warm tints.
Likewise make two other tints composed of black
and white onlyâ€”and two other tints of  purplish
hue, which are composed by mixing  little vermis
lion with the black and white.
Another Method of setting the Pallette.
 Light. Fellow ochre and white.
 Ditto. The same  little darker.

For  very fine complexion add  little vermi-
lion in the tints, No.  and  Ditto. Vermilion and white is also necessary
in the checks, &cc.
 Demi-tint. The same as No.  with peach
black.
 Second tint. Fellow and black, in the dead 
little red.
 Third tint. Terra de Siennd burnt, yellow
and black.
 Reffexion. To No.  add yellow ochre and
brown ochre.
 Dirto. To No.  add lake and burnt ochre.
 Black. Lake, burnt ochre and terrd de Sienna.
In setting  pallette it is good to observe to lay
those colors near each other which harmonize: for
example, first, white, then Naples yellow, next light
yellow, dark yellow, light red, vermillion, terra de
Sicnnd burnt, lake, blue, umber light and burnt, and
black; also, observe in mixing the tints on the pal-
lette to place them under in like harmony, begin-
ning with the lightest of each, and so placing those
of the next degree of strength one beside the other.
OF THE PRINCIPAL TINTS FOR PAINTING FLESH;
MADE BY MIKTURE FRGM THE PRINCIPAE
COLORS.
 LIGHT RED. TINr, of lightred and white;
it is the best conditioned of all colors; for  general
ground for flesh. With this color, and the shade-tent,
we should make out the flesh,like claro obscure, or



VOL. II. Edit.  We should also remember, that this
color will grow darker; because it is naturally too
strong for the white; therefore we should temper it
ii Ehs
by mixing some vermilion and white with it, in pro-
portion to the fairness of the complexion; and though

thus mixed, it may yet be called the light red tint,
to avoid confounding the vermition tint with it.
 VERMILION TINT. Vermilion and white, mix.
ed to  middle tint; it is the most brilliant light red;

 agrees best with the white, light red, and yellow
tints.
 CARMINE TINT, is carmine and white, mixed
to  middle tint; it is the most beautiful red, for the
cheeks and lips : it is  finishing color, and should
never be used in the first painting.
 ROSE TINT, made of the red shade and white,
mixed to  middle degree, or lighter: it is one of the
cleanest and most delicate tints used in flesh, for
up the heavy dirty colors; and therefore,
clearing
.
in changing, will sympathize and mix Kindly.
 TELLOw TINT, is often made of Naples

yellow and white; or of light ochre and whice,
which is  good working color. Remember, the
ochre is too strong for the white; therefore it re-
quires  little allowance in using it. It follows the
light red tints, and should always be laid before the
blues. If we lay too much of it, we may recover the

ground it was laid on, with the light red tints.
 BLUE TINT, ultramarine and white, it is 
pleasant working color: with it we should blend the
gradations. It follows the yellows, and with them
 Miakes greens; and with the red it produces pur-
ples.


 No color is so proper for blending down, or
softening the lights into keeping.
 LEAD TINT, ivory black and fine white, mixed
to  middle, degree; it is  fine retiring color: is of
great use in the gradations, and in the eyes.
. GREEN TINT, is made of Prussian blue, light
ochre, and white: this color will dirty the lights, and
should be laid sparingly in the middle tints. It
 most used in the red shadows, where they are too
strong. It is of  dirty anripathizing nature.
 SHADE TIwr is made of lake, Indian red,
black, and whire, mixed to  murrey color, of  mid-
dle int; this is the best color for the general ground
of shadows; therefore called the shade-fint: it mixes
with the lights, and produces  pleasant clean co-
lor,  little inclined to the reddish pearl. As the
four colors of its composition are of  sympathising
tiature, this mixture will be the same; and therefore
may be easily changed, by the addition of other color.
 RED SHADE, is lake and  very little Indian
red. it is  good working color, and  good glazer.
it strengthens the shadows on the shade-tint; and
receives, when it is wet, the green and blue tints
agreeably. It is  good ground for all dark-shadows.
 WARM SHADE, is made of lake and brown
pink, mixed to  middle degree. it is  fine color
for strengthening the shadows on the shade-tint,
when they are wet or dry. We must take care, that
It does not touch the lights, because they will mix
with it to  dirry snuff-color; and therefore should be
softened with  tender cold tint.
R DARK


( DARK SHADE is made of ivory black and 
little Indian red only. This color mixes very kindly
with the red shade, and sympathizes agreeably with
the middle tints in the dead-coloring. It is  glazing
color for the eye-brows and darkest shadows. It is
an excellent shadow-color, and one of the finest
Working colors.

 finishing pallette for  fine complexion re
quires more; viz. carmine and its tint, lake, brown
Pihik; ivory black, and Prussian blue.
The first lay of colors consists of two partsâ€”one
the shadows only, the other the lights.
The


( use of the shadows is to make out the drawing,

very correctly, with the shade-tint, as if it was to be
done with this color only; and remember to drive the
color, or lay it sparingly. The lights lay in with
the lightred tint, in different degrees, as in nature:
these two colors united produce  clean tender middle
int; to go over the darkest shadows with the red of
warm shade, will finish the first lay.
The warm shade, if laid on the shade-tint, improves
it to  warther hue; but if laid insread of the shade-
tint, it will dirty and spoil the colors it mixes with:
if the red shade be laid first, instead of the shade-
tint, the shadows would appear too red and bloody;
the shade and light red tints are so friendly and
delicate in their natures, that they will not dirty each
other, though we are continually changing them.
To finish the first painting, improve the reds and
yellows to the complexion, and after theim the blues;
 that the blues on the reds make purple,
and the yellows green. The same method is to be
understood of the shadows; but be sure to leave
theim clean, and not too dark; therefore allowance
should be made in their grounds with the light red;
because glazing will make them darker. Acloth of
 dark, or bad hue, requires  strong body of color

all over the shadows, such as will not sink into the
ground, but appear warm, and  little lighter than
the life, that it may be of the same forwardness to
finish, as if it had been on  light oround; for, the


business of dead-coloring is, that we leave i always
in proper order for finishing.
The


( grounds of shadows, in the dead-coloring,
should be such as will support the character of the
finishing colors; clean, and  little lighter than the
finishing colors, because the finishing of shadows
consists, in  great degree, of glazing; all shadows
and colors, that are to be glazed, should be done
with colors of  clean solid body; because the glar-
ing is then more lasting, and has  better effect.
The light red and white improved is proper for
the first lay or ground; which should be always done
with  full pencil of suff color, brighter than the
life, because it will sink  little in drying. The
greater the body and quantity of color, and the stiffer
it is laid, the less it will sink: every color in diying
will sink, and partake, in proportion to its body, of
the color it is laid on; all the lights of the flesh, if
not laid on  light ground, must consequently change
 little from the life, supposing there is no allowance
made. The shade-tint for the shadows should verge
upon the rose tint, in proportion as the complexion
 delicate.
It is thought the great masters of coloring seldom
sweetened, or softened, the colors; but in uniting
the first lay, were very careful in preserving the
brightness of their colors, and therefore did not work
them below the complexion. The first painting
should be left bright and bold, and the less the
colors are broken the better: We should forbear
using any colors that will prejudice them, and te
contented to add what is wanted in the next painting,
 PAINTING.
The second painting begins with laying on  very
small quantity of poppy oil; then wipe it almost all
off, with  dry piece of silk hankerchief, leaving only
 moisture remaining from it.
The first lay of the second painting; is, scumbling;
the lights, and glazing the shadows: then finishing
the complexion with the virgin tints, and improving
the likeness, as far as we can, without daubing.
Scumbling, is going over the lights, where they
are to be changed, with the light red unts, or some
other of their own colors, such as will always clear
and improve the complexion, with short stiff pencils;
scumbling only such parts as require it.
The light red tint improved, is  good color for
scumbling, and improving the complexion, in gene=
ral. Where the shadows and drawing, are to be cor-
rected, employ the shade tint, driving the color very
stiff, and bare; the easier to retouch, and change it;
with the finishing unts. Parts of the shadows should
be glazed with some of the transparent shadow colors;
such as will improve them, and come near to the life,
taking care not to lay on too much, for fear of losing
the hue of the first painting, the ground of which
should always appear through the glazing. In umt-
ing the lights and shades, they should not mix dead,
and meally; the more the lights mix with the shades,
the more meally those shades will appear.
Go over the complexion with the virgin tints, to
improve the coloring to the utmost, both in the
lights


 and shadows. This should be done in the
same manner as we laid them in the latter part of the
first painting; with the reds, yellows, and blues;
blending them with delicate, light, touches of the
tender middle tints, without, softening. We should
leave the tints and their grounds clean and disimct;
and be content to leave off while the work is safe
and unsullied, leaving what, is required farther, to
the conclusion; for, in attempting the finishing.

It is much easier to soffen over sfrong tints when

 
they are dry, than when they are, wet, because we

 add the very colors that are wanting, without
endangering the parts that are dry. If any of the
colors of the pallette want to be changed to the life,
when we are painting, it is better to do it with the

knife on the pallette, than with the pencil.
OF BACK-GROUNDSs

The principal colors necessary for painting back:
grounds in portraiture, as walls, buildings; or the
like, are white, black, Indian red; light and brown
ochre, Prussian blue, and burnt umber, from which
the eight principal tinis are made; as follows:
. PEAEL is made of black, white, and  little
Indian red.
 LEAD, of black and white, mixt to  dark
lead color.
 TELEow, of brown ochre and white.
 OLIVE, of lightochre, Prussian blue, and whites
 FLESH, of Indian red and white, mixt to 
middle tints
 MURREY, of Indian red, white, and  little
black, mixt to  kind of purple, of  middle tint.
 STONE, of whice, umber, black, and Indianred.
 DARK-SHADE, of black and Indian red only.
Here the lead tint serves for the blues; the fiesh
tint mixes agreeably with the lead: the murrey
i  good blending color, and of use where the
olive is too strong. The umber, white, and dark
shade produce  Variety of stone colors: the dark
shade and umber, used plentifully with drying oil,
Make  warm shadow color. These colors may be
laid
 II. Edit.   with drying oil, because they mix. and set the

better with the softener.
Begin from the shadowed side of the head, and
paint the lights first; then, the gradations and sha-
Iir
dows, with  large, stuffish, tool, sparingly, with the
dark shade and white,  little changed with such
colors as will give it the hue required, but very nedr
in regard to tone and strength; leaving them like

ne dark and warm shadows should be laid before
the colors that join them with the dark shade and
umber, because, if those colors were laid on first,
they would interrupt and spoil the transparency,,
which is their greatest beauty. The more the first
lay is drove, the easier and better we may change it
with the finishing tints; therefore we may lay them
with the greater body.
As we heighten and finish the lights, we do it
with warmer colors; accompanied with tender cold
tints. The lightest part of the ground is always
hearest to the shadowed side of the head; and this

part governs all the rest; it should be painted with 
variety of light, warm, clear colors, which gradate;
and lose their strength imperceptibly. We. must
take care not to cover too much of the first lay, but
consider it as the principal color.
. When the lights are. well adapted to support the
head, it is easy to introduce whatever kind of sha-
dows we find most proper; then soften. and blend,
the whole, the tints will sink, and lose  little of
their strength and beauty in drying.
Grounds,
walls, &cc. may be finished at once painting; or at
terwards



 glazed with  little of the dark shade and
dryingoil, drove very bare; and their hue improved
with  few light touches of the color that is wanting.
The dark shadows may also be strengthened and im-
proved by glazing, after the subject is nearly finish-

ed; for fear of making them too strong.
Curtains should be dead-colored when we paint
the ground; with clean colors, of  hue near to
the intended curtain, such will support the finishing
colors, with  tender sort of keeping, in regard to
their tone in the lights, but much softer in the sha-
dows, mixing and breaking the whole with the colors
of the ground, as Fresnoy says, & bodies that are
back in the ground, should be painted with colors
 to those of the ground itsen. If we cannot

set the folds the first painting; we should leave the
masses of light and shadow, in regard to the keeping
of the picture, broad and well united together, such
 may appear easy to finish on. The colors of the
landscape, th back-grounds, should be broken and
softened, with those of the parts which join them:
hereby bringing them into keeping, so that the parts
do not stare, nor cut at their extremities.
The sky should be broke with the lead, and the
Hesh, tints: the murrey tint is of great use in the
grounds of distant objects; the umber and dark shade
in the near grounds: the greens should be more
beautiful than we intend them, because they will
 and grow darker. After all is painted, we should

go over the whole very lightly with the softener.
 siar ic is


  PAINTING DEAPERIES.
The rightmethod of painting draperies in general,

is, to make out the whole, with three coloys oply:
 the lights, the middle rint, and the shade tint.
The middle unt should be very near to the general
hue of the drapery; and the shade tint dark enough

for the general hus of the shadows.
The lights should rather incline to  warmish hue:
 middle tint should be made of friendly working
colors, such as will mix of  clean tender cool hue,
and the shade tint should be made of the same colors
as the middle tint, only with less light; with these
three colors we should make out the whole like
Me before we add any of the reflexions,
of finishing ints.
. The refiexions of draperies, &cc. are generally pro-

ductions of their own, and lighter than the shadows
on which they are found; being produced by light,
they will have  light, warm color, mixed with the
local color that receives them. Here it will be ne=
cessary to observe the general method in managing
the colors of the first lay, and those of the reffexiopns
and finishing tints.
In the first lay, the high lights should be laid with
plenty of suff color; then shaped, and softened
into chgracter with the middle tint, very correctly.
Where the gradations of the lights are slow, as in the
 parts, it is proper to lay the middle tint first at
(
their eatremities, with  tool that will drive the
colery


 and leave it sparing: because, the lights will
mix, and hie the better, upon it. Next make out all
the shadows with the shade tint drove bare. After
this, the middle tint, which fills up, and serves as 
kind of second lights and gradations, should be ma-
naged very nicely, to produce character, without
touching any of the high lights which finish the

irst lay.
Reflexions and finishing tints, are in general anti-
pathies to the first lay; they will, without great care,
dirty the colors on which they are laid; and there-
fore should he laid with  delicate light touch; with-
out softening: if overdone, it may be recovered
with the proper color of the part, either directly, or
when dry.
 the color of the cloth is very improper for
the ground of  drapery, we should change it with
those colors which are most likely to improve; and
to support, the finishing colers. This method will
preserve them in their greatest lustre. In dead color-
ing, the lights, and shades, need only hint at the
shape and roundings of the figure, but if we have 
design to work from, it will be proper to make all the
large and principal parts in their places, with  clean
color, lighter than the intended drapery, though in
general of the same hue, while the shadows are no
darker than  middle tint: these should be mixed
and broken in  tender manner; then softened with
 large tool, that nothing rough, or uneven, be left to
interrupt or burt the character of the finishing colors.
Instances

Instances of particular kinds of Drapery.
 SATTIN.
All whites should be painted on white grounds,
laid with  good body of color; by reason this color
SINkS more into the ground than any other.

there are four degress of colors in the first lay to
white sattin:  The fine white for the lights.

 The first tint, made of fine white and  very little
ivory black, mixed to an exact middle degree be-
tween the white and the middle tint. This color
follows the white, and with this, we should give the
lights  character, taking care that this tint appear

distinctly between the white, and the middle tint.


 The middle tint should be made of white,
black, and  little Indian red, mixt to  beautnful,
clear color, of  pearly huc. Remember to allow
for the red hue changing  little toward lead color.
If there be occasion to make any part of the middle
int lighter, we should do it with the first tint only.
This color should also be laid, sparingly, before the
white, in the lights that happen in the middle tints
and shadows; on which we should lay the white with
one light rouch, not covering all the part made with
the first tint: but, preserving  softening edge, or bor.
der, between the white and the middle tint.  The
shade tint should be made of the same color as the
middle tint; but with less white, so that it be dark
sough for the shadows in general; with which we
should make out the shadows into character.







  
In the reflexion and finishing tints of white sattins
brown ochre, mixed with the color of the lights,
is  useful color, in general, for all reflexions pro-
duced from their own colors. Accidental reflexions
are made with the color of the parts from whence they
are produced, and the local colors that receive them.
Two reflecting tints are wanted for draperies, in ge=
neral, one lighter than the middle tint, the other
darker. These may be changed on the pallette with
the first, and the middle tints, as occasion requires,
or be lightly broken on the part that receives them:
but this last method is not so safe as the other. The
tint for blending the dark shadows to the mellow
tender hue, is made with the shade tint and  little
brown ochre; laid on very sparingly, with soft light
touches, for fear of making them heavy. If it be over-
done, we may recover it with the color it was laid
pon.
We often see  little blue used in the first tint of
white satfin. When  warm, or dirty color; is mixed.
with  clean light one, they will form  dirty color.
It is the want of the red hue which makes white sat-
tins often appear like pewter.

BLUE SATTIN.
Blue sattin is made of Prussian blue and fine white.
The best ground for blue is white for the lights,
and black and white for the shadows.
The first lay of colors for blue is divided into
three degrees:

 The
 The middle tint of  beautiful arure.  coler for the lights about  middle degree be.
ween that, and white.  The shade tint, dark
enough for the shadows, in general. The broad
 should be lard with plenty of color, and
shaped to character with the middle tint, before we
lay on any other colors. The less the colors are
miked, the better they will appear, and stand; for
the lights of blue should be managed with as much

Care as those of white sattin. Next follows the rest
ofthe middle unt, and then the shadows. The more
we drive the shade tint, the better it will receive the
refiexions and finishing tints. The shadows should
be strengthened, and blended, with ivery black,
and some of their own color, mixt into  tender
mellow hue:
The reflexions are made as those of white sattin
with ochre and some of the lights: which should be
Jane at ence. The shadows, when dry, may be im-
Droved with the colors they were made of. The
Prussian blue best to be used, is that which looks the
most beaunful before it is ground: the soorner it  after it is ground, the better.
VELVET may be painted at once. The method is,
to make out the first lay with the middle tint, and
shade tint; on which place the high lights with light
touches, and finish the shadows as those of sattin; but
the nearest imitation of velvet is procured by glazings
having first prepared  ground, or dead coloring
with such colors as will, when dry, bear out and
support the glazing color. The glazing color is, of
 fine transparent quality, used smply with oil only;
  that whatever, ground it is laid on, the whole may
 he
applar distinctly through it.. The best ground for


blue is made with white and ivory black: the white
 for the high lights, which, with the middle tint

 shade unt, makes out the first lay like mezzo-

tinto. The middle unt should be lighter, in propore
 to the grazing, because that will make it darker.
It is often necessary to cover all but the high lights
  glazing, laid with less quantity than if it was
to be done once only. If any of it touch the lights,
 should wipe it off with,  clean rag. The very
high lights should be improved, and made of  fine
 and left to dry.  glazing color is Prus-
sian blue, ground very fine with nut oil; and should

be laid with  large stitlisn fool, that will drive the
color as occasion requires. On the last glazing
strengthen and finish the shadows.
We observe, in this instance, that glazing the
middle tint, which is made of black and white, will
not produce  color so blue, as if it had been pre-

pared with Prussian blue and white; yet this color
will preserve the beauty of the lights, in their per-
fection, by reason of its tender obscure hue, when
the blueness of the other would diminish them.
This method of glazing blue is the general rule
for all glazing.
The greatest fault in colofing draperies of any kind,
 painting the shadowed parts with strong slarins

tndliy
colors, which destroy the beauty of the lights. This
is not only the reverse of art, but of nature, whose
beauty of color is always diminished in proportion to
the light: for this reason we should blend, and soften,

Prussian blue, hereby saving  great quantity of that

valuable color,

Though this general method of painting sattuns,

 to make the first, lay of colors, with three degrees,
 produce, two

of tints; yet, in using
 
more : for, the mixing of two different colors on the
 makes another, of  middle tint between them:
so do the lights and middle fint, and the middle and
 

ngi
shade tint: the first mixture answers to the first tint
L white sattin; and the last is  sort of gradation, or
half shade.
If the lights and middle tint mix to  beautiful
clean color, of  middle hue between both, there

will be no occasion for  color to go between them,
as in the blue sattin,: but if in mixing, they produce
 tint inclining to  dirty warm hue, then there must
be another made of  sympathizing nature, to be
 between them, to preserve the beauty of the




lights.
 is necessary to understand these principles of
the first lay of colors, as comprehending the general


rule of coloring, and that on which the practice of

 
excellent coloring depends.

between scarlet and crimson, is, that the high lights
 crmson, are whiter, and the middle tint is made
darker. Their reflexions are made with light red and
vermition. The high lights should be laid and ma-
naged in the same manner as those of the blue, for
fear of dirtying them; and sometimes they require to
be touched over  second time, before we glaze them.

directly.
The other method is, to make the high lights with
carmine and white; the middle tint with lake, white,
and  little carmine; and shadows with lake and
Indian red, with  little vermition for the reflexions.
But the shadows require to be broken with some
tender obscure tint.

The ground for yellow should be  yellowish

There are the same number of tents in the yellow,
as in the white, sattin; the method of using them is
the same. The lights are made with King' yellow,
ground with clean, good, drying oil. The first tint

made


 of the dark shade and white: which should be
laid, and managed, as the first tint in white sattin.
The middle tint is,  mixture of the light and brown
ochre, softened with the pearl fint. The shade tint
is made with brown pink and brown ochre. These
belong to the first lay.
The reflexions are light ochre; sometimes, in the
warmest parts, mixed with  little light red; the

shadows are strengthened with brown pink and burnt

 The proper ground for green is,  light yellow
 made of light ochre,  little white, and Prus-
 blue, for the lights; and the ochres, brown
pink, and Prussian blue, for the shadows.
 The finest green for drapery, is made of King'
yellow, Prussian blue, and brown pink. The high
lights are, King' yellow and  very little Prussian
 the middle tint has more Prussian blue; the
shade tint is made with some of the middle tint,
brown pink, and more Prussian blue: but the darkest
shadows are brown pink and  little Prussian blue.
The lights and middle unt should be managed in the
same manner as those of the blue sattin. The shade
tint should be kept entirely from the lights, because
the brown pink that is in it, will, in mixing, dirty
them, as the black does those of the blues; they dry
 little darker than they appear when wet. The
King' yellow should be ground with good drying
oil; for, the longer it is in drying, the more it will

CRANGEABLE COLORED SILKS.

ls 

Changeable colors have four principal tints; viz.
the high lights, middle tuit; shade unt, and reffect.

ol hndly ae is 
edtint.
The art lies in finding the exact color of the mids
dle tint, because it has more of the general hue of
the silk than any of the others. The shade tint
is of the same hue with the middle tint, though

dark enough for the shadows. The high lights,
 often very different from the middle tint,
should be of  clean, friendly, working color, that
will, in mixing with it, produce  tint of  clean
Sympathizing hus.
The method of painting silks is to make out the
folds with the chade unt, and then fill them up in the
lights with the middle tint. This first lay should be
done to satisfaction before any other colors are added;
the stiffer the middle tint is used, the betier the high
lights may be laid on it. The reffected tint falls
generally on the gradating half shades, and should be
laid with tender touches, sparingly, for fear of spoil-
ing the first lay.
This method of painting answers to all the colored
silks, as well as changeable, with this difference only,
that the plain colors require not so much art as the
changeable do in matching the tints. The last part

The method of painting black is very difterent
from that of other colors; for, the principal thing in
them, is to leave the lights clean and brilliantâ€”but
in black, it is to keep the sbadows clear and transpa-

finishing colors: the lake in the lights takes off the

than  transparent warm hie, the shadows would

be  few reflexions in sattin, which should be added
as those of other colors; they should be made of
strong colors, such as burnt umber, or brown ochre,
 with  little of the shade tint.
Though these grounds mentioned for draperies, are


necessary for the principal, and nearest, figures, in

 colors used in painting linen are the same as
those in white sattin, except the first tint; which is
made of white and ultramarine ashes, instead of the

black, mixt to  very light blucish tint.
In the dead coloring care should be taken that
the grounds be laid white and broad in the lights:
the shadows are composed of black, white, and 
little Indian red, like the middle fint of white sattin.
These should be left very light and clean, to support
the finishing colors.

character, with free light touches, without softening.
Then with  large long pointed pencil, and fine
white, lay the high lights very nicely, at  touch.
After this the fine light blucish tint, mixed light,
is laid in the tender gradations very sparingly and
lightly, without filling them up.
The first lay should be left clear and distinct: the
more it appears the better. It is the overmixing and
jumbling all the colors together, which spoils the
beauty of the character; therefore it is better to let
it dry before we add the reflexions and finishing
tints.
This inethod of letting the beautiful cledr colors
dry, before we add the warm, reflecting, and har
monizing tints, prevents them from mixing with,
and dirtying, each other.
The principal blending colors used in the reflexions
are the yellow tint, green unt, and rose tint; which
last is made of lake, Indian red, and whice. The
dead coloring should be as white as we intend the
finishing colors to be, by reason they will sink
 little, in proportion to the color of the cloth, which
the glazing with pure white, only, will recover.

OF
  DEAD COLORING.
Let the first lay, or dead coloring, be without
Any bright, glaring, or strong, dark; colors; so that
the effcet is made more to receive and preserve the
finishing colors, than to shew them in the first
painting
The sky should be done first; then the distances,
working downward to the middle group, from that
to the fore-ground, and to the nearest parts; all parts
of each group, as trees, buildings, &. should be
painted with the group they belong to.
The art in dead coloring, is, to find the two colors,
which serve for the ground of the shadows in general,
the sky excepted, and the method of using them with
the lighrs: the first of which is, the dark shade with
 litile lake in it; the other is, burnt umber: these
should be changed  little to the naiural hue of the
objects, and then laid and drove with drying oil, in
the same manner as we shade with Indian ink, which

should be left; otherwise they will be dark and heavy,
and would be epurely spoiled for the finishing glaz=
ing. Both these colors mix and sympathize agreeably
with the lights, but should be laid before them.
When the landscape is designed, begin with the
sky, which should be laid with  good body of
Colors, and left with  faint resemblance of the prin=
cipal clouds; more in the manner of claro obscuro,
than with finishing colors; the whiter it is left, the

 should be made out faint and uncertainly with
the dark shade, and some of their lights, in different
degrees; and laid so, as best to find and shew their
principal parrs. Advancing into the middle group,:
we introduce, by degrees, the burnt umber in the
shades: all the grounds of the trees being laid, or
rubbed in, enough only to suggest an idea of their
shapes and shadows faintly. The grounds of their
shadows must be clean, and lighter than their finish-
ing colors, such as will support their character, and
seem easy to finish on.
In painting the lights, it is better to incline more
to the middle unt, than to the high lights; and to
leave them with  sufficient body of clean colors,
which will receive and preserve the finishing colors.
the better; which may be done with  few tints.
SECOND PAINTING.
Begin with the sky; lay in the azure and colors
of the horizon; then soften them; after that, lay in
the general unt of the clouds, and finish on it with
the high lights, and the other tints that are wanting
 light, tender, touches; then, soften the whole
very lightly. The finishing of the sky should be
done at once painting, because the tender character
of the clouds will not match so well when dry, as
when the whole is wet. The stiffer the azure, and
colors of the horizon, are laid, the better the clouds
may be painted upon them.

The greatest distances are chiefly made with the
color of the sky; as they grow nearer and darker,
flaze and scumble the parts very thin, with such

ral hue of the group the objects are in. so that the

 and as the distances come nearer, with the
purple. As we get more into the middle group, the
terra-vert and Prussian blue may be varied with some
of the green tints, made without white, for white is
the destruction of all glazing colors. As we approych
the first group, there is less occasion for changing
them; but the fore-ground and its objects require all
the strength, and force, of glazing, which the coleys
are capable of producing.
After this glazing ground, we should follow with
strengthening the same in the shadows and darkest
places, in such manner as will seem easy to finish.

Ifoiling be necessary, lay the least quantity that
can be, with  stump tool, or pencil, proportioned to
the place that is to be oiled; then wipe the place that
is diled with  silk handkerchief, leaving no more
:oil than is proper for the purpose.
When finishing any objects, we should use  great
variety of tints, all nearly the same color, but most
of all, when finishing trees; as this gives  richness
to the coloring, and contributes to produce harmony.
As the greens will fade, and grow darker; it is neces-
sary to improve, and, in some degree, to force them,
by making an allowance in using them so much the
lighter; the same reasonn applies to the glazing;
which, if over loaded; will be dull and heavy, and
consequently will grow darker.
The method for painting near trees, is, to make
the first lay very ear to nature, though not quice so
Hark, and to follow it with strengthening the shadows;
then the middle tints; and last of all, lay the high
:lights and finishing colors: but all this cannot be
:done, as it should be, at once painting. The best
way is to do no more than the first lay with the faint
shadows, and leave it to dry. Then improve the
uddle tints and shadows, and let them dry.
: The conclusion is, adding all the lights and finish
ing colors, in the best -manner. This method of
leaving the first and second part to dry separately,
not only makes the whole easier, and thore agreeable,
but leaves the colors in the greater perfection;

because, most of the work may be done with scums.

The lights also, may be laid with  better body of
color, which will, not be mixed and spoiled with the
wet ground : what is said of trees, answers to all
Kinds of shrubs, and bushes.
The figures in  landscape are the last work of the
picture; those in the fore-ground should be done
before those in the distances; the shadows of the
figures should be of the same hue, or color, with

The shadows, if large, may approximate nearly to
the same tone according to their situations, and may

bold, spirited, and will not suffer, even if loaded

In general, colors look more brilliant while wet
with oil, than when they are dry;  little observa-

It is usually the too great quantity of oil (espe-
cially of the grosser Kinds) which occasions the
decay of the colors: and, it is observable, that pic.

in the glazings, where the color is thin; the lights

. color cannot have  worse property than that
of  tardy dryer, as it holds what dust unavoidably
falls on it, and consequently sullies the beauty of the
fints; some artists, aware of the bad qualities of the
oils in use, make too free with turpentine to work
thin, but this not only leaves the picture dead, but
carries off part of the force in evaporation.
To know when an oil pieture is dry, breathe
firmly upon it; if it take the breath, it is safe. 
is proper to let the first coat of color be thoroughly
dry, before  second is applied; this should be care-
fully attended to in winter.
The pencils, when done with, should be cleaned
by spirits or oil of turpentine; or, if meant to be
laid by for  time, they may be washed with soap.
The pallette should be constantly cleaned.


 
  CLEANING OF PICTURES.
Water is the first material and of the most general
use in cleaning pictures. This will remove many
Kinds of glutinous bodies, and foulnesses; such as
sugar, honey, glue, and many others; and it will
also take off any varnish of guim arabic, glair of eggs,
or isinglass, and is therefore the greatest instrument
in this work; it may be used without any caution
with respect to the colors, as it will not in the least
affect the oil which holds them together.
Olive oil, or butter, though not generally applied
to this purpose, through an ignorance of their effi-
cacy, will remove many of those spots or foulnesses,
which resist even soap, as they will dissolve or cor-
rode pitch; rosin, and similar bodies, and they may
be used very freely, not having the least effect on
the oil of the painting, nor the dangerous effects of
spirit of wine and oil of turpentine.
Wood ashes, or (what will better answer the pur-
Pose, when used in . proper proportion) pearl ashes,
being melted in water, make  proper dissolvent for
most kinds of matter which foul paintings, but they
must be used with great discretion, as they will touch
of corrode the oil of the painting, if there be no
varnishing guin or resin over it, by very little rub-
bing; the use of them, or scope is, however, in
many cases unavoidable, and in general they are the
only things employed for this purpose.
Spirit of wine, as it will dissolve all the gums and
gum resins, except guin arabic, is very necessary
for
F the taking off from pictures varnishes composed
of such substances; but it corrodes also the oil
of paintings, and softens them in such  manner
as to render all rubbing dangerous, while they are
under its influence.
Oil of turpentine will dissolve likewise some of
the gums used for varnish, but spirits of wine will
in general much better answer the purpose: there
are, however, sometimes spots of foulness which will
gave way to the spirit of turpentine, but resist most
other substances used for this purpose; It may,
therefore, be tried where every thing else appears to
fail, but even then very sparingly,, and with great
caution, as it will very soon act even on the dry off
of the painting;
Essence of lemons is of the same dangerous tenr
dency with oil of turpentine, but is  much stronger
dissolvent, and should therefore only be used in the
most desperate cases, where spots seem indelible by
all other methods; spirit of lavender and rosemary,
and other essenrial oils, have the same dissolving
qualities as essence of lemons, but they are in general
dearer, and some of them too powerful to be trusted
near the colors.
When paintings appear to have been varnished
with those substances that will not dissolve in water,
(which is seldom done by painters who are acquaintr
ed with the present practice, as they destroy the
more delicate tints and touches of the painting,
they are, however, very easily and safely removed by
the following method:
of Place



 Place your picture or painting in an horizontal
situation, and moisten, or rather ffood by means of
 sponge the surface of it with very strong rectified
spirits of wine; but all rubbing beyond what is ne-
cessary must be avoided. Keep the painting moist
by adding fresh quantities of the spirit for some
minutes, then flood the surface copiously with cold
water, with which the spirit and such part of the
varnish as it has dissolved may be washed off; but
in this state of it all frietion, and the slightest vio-
lence to the surface of the painting, would be very
detrimental. When the painting is dry; this opera-
tion may be repeated at discretion, until the whole
of the varnish is taken off.
To prepare the pearl and wood ash ley, used in
gleaning pictures, let an ounce be dissolved in  of water, to be stirred frequently for half  day;
then to be decanted from the settlings.
. . This mixture is said to epliven the Brazil
WWash.
To make  stronger ley of the same, let two
pounds of wood-ashes and three quarts of water, be
managed as just directed, and evaporated (or even
boiled) to one quart; or  less quantity, as you find
it acrid to your. taste.  strong ley is made by
pouring hot water on  quantity of ashes, and when
It has filtered through them, collect it for use.â€”
These leys are to be used warm with  sponge, and
with the caution just directed. When thick spots
are nnot easily removed,  strong soap-lather may
te of use, not suffering it to touch any other part
of the pieture but the spot it is to be engaged with.

For


 
For using spirits of wine and other dissolvents,
the picture is to be laid on  table, and flooded with
the liquor, or well dabbed with  sponge, so as to
keep the picture very morst. Add fresh ley, &&. as
wanted, then with cold water wash off the whole.
All dissolvents must be washed off with plenty of
water, and should it be necessary to use any of them
again, take care that the painting is quite dry; this
must be attended to at every repetition.
All spots, ec. of dirt are attached to  picture,
either before it is varnished, or during its being
varnished, (in which case they dry with the varnish)
of after the varnish is dry. If the latter, plenty of
warm water generally succeeds; but if it be damaged
while varnishing, or before that operation, the coat
of varnish must be removed ; then the spot cleaned,
and the whole picture be re-vaynished.
It appears, from this observation, that it is of
consequence to set pictures, while drying, in  place
free from dust, &cc. since whatever dries with the
colors cannot be removed.
It sometimes happens that  picture grows dull
and obscure, and it may be necessary to revarnish
it; this may be very safely done, after inspecting
whether the first varnish be clean, &.


  TRANSPERRING PICTURES.
The art of removing paintings in oil from the
cloths on which they are originally done, and trans-
ferring them to new ones, is of great use. The me-
thod is as follows:
Let the decayed picture be cleansed of all grease
that may be on its surface, by rubbing it very gently
with crum of stale bread, and then wiping it with 
very fine soft linen cloth. It must then be laid, the
face downwards, on  smooth table covered with fan
paper, or India paper; and the cloth on the back
must be well soaked with boiling water, till perfectly
soft and pliable. Turn the pieture face upwards,
and having stretched it evenly on the table; pin it
down with nails at the edges. Having melted 
quantity of glue, and strained it through  flannel
cloth, spread part of it on  linen cloth of the size.
of the painting; when this is set, lay another coat
over it; when this is become siff, spread some of
the glue, moderately heated, over the face of the
picture, and lay over it, in the evenest manner pos-
sible, the linen cloth already prepared, and nail it
down to the picture and table. Then expose the
whole to the heat of the sun, in  place secure from
gain, till the glue be perfectly dry and hard; when
this is the case, remove the picture and linen, cloth
from the table. Turn the pieture with the face
downwards, and let it be stretched and nailed to the
table as before; then raise round its edge  border of
WVaE
  as in biting of copper-plates, into which pourd
corroding fluid, as oil of vitriol, aqua-fortis, of
spirit of sali; but the last is to be preferred; dilute
either of these with water, to such  degree, that
they may destroy the threads of the original canvas,
or cloth, of the picture; without discoloring it.
When the corroding ffuid has answered this pur=
 
Pose, draim it off, and wash away the remaining paiv
by quantities of fresh water. The threads of the
cloth must be then carefully picked out till the whole
be taken away. The reverse surface of the painting
being thus wholly freed from the old cloth, must be
well washed with water, and left to dry.. In the
mcan time, prepare  new piece of canvas of the
size of the painting; and having spread some: hot
glue, purified as before, and melted with  little
brandy or spirit of wine; over the reverse of the
painting; lay the new canvas evenly upon it; while
the glue is hot, and compress them together with
thick plares of lead, or flat pieces of polished mar=
ble. When the glue is set; remove these weights,
let the cloth remain till the glue is become perfectly
dry and hard. Then the whole must be turned the
other side upwards, and the border of wax being re
placed, the linen cloth on the face of the painting
must be destroyed by means of the corroding fluids
because the face of the painting is defended only by
the coat of glue which cemented the linen cloth to
it. The painting must then be freed from the glue
by washing it with hot water. The painting may
afterwards be varnished, and if the operation be well
 conducted,


( it will be transferred to the new cloth in
 perfect state.
When the painting is originally of wood, the sur-
face of it must be covered with  linen cloth, ce-
mented to it by means of glue, as glready directed.
 proper table being then provided, and overspread
with  blanket, of thiner woollen cloth, laid on in
several doubles; the painting must be laid upon it
the face downwards, and fixed sready; the board or
wood on which it was done, must then be planed
away; till the shell remains as thin as it can be made,
without damaging the paint under it. The process
is the saime as already given for the front.
When  picture is by accident torn, or otherwise
injured, it is repaired, by placing the separated parts
as nearly in their first state as possible, then attach-

ihig, by  strong glue,  piece of cloth, of  proper
shape and size, to which the threads of the torn
Parts firrmly adhering; retain their situations. The
place in the preture where the rent is, must then be

Miss GREENLANDs Method of making  Composition
for Painting in imitation of the Ancrent Crecian
Manner
Put into  glazed earthen vessel  o of gum
arabic and So of cold spring water; when the gum
is dissolved, stir in  of gum mastich, which has
been first washed, dried, picked, and beaten fine,
which is very soon done: set the earthen vessel,
containing the gum water and gum mastich, over 
moderate fire, continually stirring and beating them
hard with  spoon, in order to dissolve the gum
mastich. When sufficiently boiled, it will no longer
appear transparent, and will be stiff, like  paste; so
soon as this is the case, and that the gum water and
mastich are quite boiling, without taking them off
the fire add  of white wax, broken into small
pieces, stirring and beating the different ingredients
together till the wax is perfectly melted, and has
bailed
 then take the composition off the fire, as boil-

ingitlongerthan necessary would only harden the wax,

and prevent its mixing so well afterwards with water;
the composition is taken off the fire, and in the


 
glazed earthen vessel, it should be beaten hard, and
while hot, but not boiling, mix with it, by degrees,
 of cold spring water; then strain the compo-
Sition, as some dirt will boil out of the gum mastich,
and put it into bottles.
 composition, if properly made, should be
like  cream, and the colors, when mixed with it, as
smooth as if with oil. The method of using it; is
mixing the colors with ir, as with oil; then paint
with fair water. The colors may be used by putting
 little fair water over them, but it is less trouble to
put some water when the colors are observed to be
growing dry.
In painting with this composition the colors blend
without difficulty, when wet, and even when dry the
tints may easily be united by means of  brush and 
very small quantity of fair water.

When the painting is finished, put some white
Wax into  glazed earthen vessel over  slow fire;
and when melied, but not boiling, with  hard brush
cover the painting with the wax; and, when cold,
take  moderately hot iron, such as is used for iron-
ing linen, and draw it lightly over the wax; when
the picture is nearly cold rub it with  fine linen
cloth to make it entirely smooth; and, when quite
cold, rub it again to make it shine.
Painting might be executed in this manner upon
wood, or plaster of Paris, without requiring any
other preparation than mixing some fine plaster of
Paris in powder with cold water to the thickness of 
cream; then put it on  looking-glass, and, when
dry, take it off, and there will be  very smooth
surface for painting upon.
Paintings may also be done in the same manner
with only gum water and gum mastich, prepared the
same way as the mastich and wax; but instead of
putting  of mastick, and, when boiling adding
 of wax, mix  of gum mastich with the
sum water before it is put on the fire, and when

sufficiently boiled and beaten, and is  little cold,
stir in  of cold spring water, and afterwards
strain it.
It would be equally practicable painting with
wax alone, dissolved in sum water, in the following

Mmanner:
Weigh  of cold spring water and  of
put them into  glazed earthen vessel,
guin arabic
and, when the gum is dissolved, add  of white
wax. Put the earthen vessel with the guin water and
wax upon  slow fire and stir them till the wax is
dissolved and has boiled  few minutes; then take
them off the fire, and throw them into  bason, as,
 remaining in the hot earthen vessel the wax
might become rather hard; beat the gum, water and
wax till quite cold.. As there is but  small propors
tion of water, in comparison with the gun and wax,
it would be necessary in mixing this composition
with the colors, to put also some fair water.
It should be observed that the water used by Miss
reenland in these preparations came from  chalk
fock, and was remarkably soft: possibly any other
water might answer equally well.
nother Recipe by Miss CREENLAwD for the Incient
Grecian Method of Painting in War.
Take an ounce of white wax, and the same weight
of gum mastich in lachryme (tears) that  as it
comes from the tree, which must be reduced to 

fine



 powder. Put the wax in  glazed earthen
vessel, over  very slow fire, and when it is quite
dissolved strew in the mastich,  little at  time,
stirring the wax continually, until the whole quantity
is perfectly melted and incorporated; then throw
the pasts into cold water, and when it is hard take it
out of the water, wipe it dry, and beat it in one of
Mr. Wedgwood' mortars, observing to pound it at
first in  linen cloth to absorb some drops of water
that will remain in the paste, and would prevent the
possibility of reducing it to  powder, which must
be so fine as to pass through  thick gaure. It
should be pounded in  cold place, and but  little
at  tine; as after long bearung, the friction will
in  degree soften the wax and gum, and, instead of
their becoming  powder, they will return to  paste.
Make some strong gum arabic water; and, when
you paint, take  litrle of the powder, some color,
and mix them together with the gum water. Light
colors require but  small quantity of the powder,
but more of it must be put in proportion to the body.
of darkness of the colors; and to black, there should
be almost as much of the powder as color.
Having mixed the colors, and no mare than can
be used before they grow dry, paint with fair water,
as is practised in painting with water colors; 
ground on the wood being first painted of some
Proper color, prepared in the same manner as  for the picture. Walnut-tree and oak,
are the sorts of wood commonly made use of in Italy
for this purpose. The painting should be highly
finished,


  otherwise, when varnished, the tints wilf
not appear united.
When the painting is quite dry, with rather  hard
prush, passing it one way, varnish it with white
wax, which is put into an earthen vessel, and kept
melted over  very slow fire, till the picture is var.
ished, taking great care the wax does not boil,
Afterwards hold the picture before  fire, near
ehough to melt the wax, but not make it run; and,
when the varnish is entirely cold and hard, rub it
gently with  linen cloth. Should the varnish
blister, warm the picture again very slowly, and the
pubbles will subside.

When the picture is dirty it need only be washed
with cold water,

you, in what this new method consists. You melt,
or rather dissolve some good white wax in naphtha
petroler without color, till such time as the mixture
has acquired, by cooling, the appearance and con-
Sstence


 of an oil beginning to freeze by the cold.
You mix your colors with this, and then keep them
in small tin boxes. You dilute them more or less
with the same naphtha, according as they dry, or as
you wish to use them. This painting allows time
enough to give all the finish you desire, and if you
wish to work in  hurry, you may dry it as fast as
you please; by exposing it to heat. When the pic-
ture is finished, it is of that fine tone, which is pre-
ferable to every varnish, or if you choose  varnish,
you need only warm the pieture, and all the naphtha
will evaporate. When this is done, you must wast till
the picture cools, when you must polish it, by run-
ning it over neatly with  cloth, as the ancients used
to do. If you wish to have it still brighter, you
must melt white wax on the fire, without suffering
itto boil; mix  little naphtha with this, and draw
 layer of it over the picture already heated, by
means of  brazier, which you hold under, if the
picture i small, or before it, if it is large. The
colors at first appear spoiled, but you restore them to
their first beaury, if, when the layer of was is
cooled, you polish it by rubbing with  cloth. It is
then that the colors take the high tone of oil. If
you fear the effects of fire for your picture, you are
to make  soap of wax, which is to be done by boil-
ing white wax in water, in which you have dissolved
 twentieth part of the weight of the wax of marine
alkali, or sel de souda very pure. Rub your picture
with this soap, and when it is dry, polish it as above.
If you do not choose either of these methods, give
your painting its usual varnish of sandarac and spirit

assured that this is the true tmethod of painting in wak
There is likewise much to hope for the duration of
pictures paitited in this manher, as wax is much less
liable to alteration than oil; and does not so essily part
 its phlogiston.

Colours, or Crayohs, and fix the colours by gradually
advaficing the pieture to the fire, till the wax; being
melted, had absorbed them; then equally gradually
withdrawing the piece. The thought was ingenious;
but should seem to be more troublesome than that of
Nir. Lewis, as above.
After all, it may justly be doubted; whether some
bitumen, of  still more exalted and spirituous nature;
was not the vehicle which compounded those colours
whose brilliancy has remained from the remotest ages:

good for sprains, bruises, &ec. (This at least is the
sort sometimes imported into England). It is very
spirituous and volatile.

 ETCHING.
This is one branch of the art of Engraving, and
possesses some qualities in which it is superior to
others; being executed with the utmost ease and
ffeedom, and when well managed, expressing many
ubjects with great truth, and character.
The first preparation for etching, is to lay  ground
vide GROUND) over the plate, which operation is
thus performed.
At the most convenient part of the plate, as well
for holding it, as for the work which is to be executed
on it, is tightly fixed  hand-vice; then, the plate
is heated, till the copper shews  small change of
color; or, till the back part of the plate, being spit
upon, rejects the spittle. The ball of ground, which
Istied in  thin covering of silk, is now passed gently
over the plate so as to distribure the ground evenly
to all parts, the heat of the plate melting it through
the silk: then with the dabber, which is nothing
more than  small quantity of cotton tied in silk, the
ground is beat, of dabbed, to  perfect thinness and
evenness; (in this part of the business much address
is required, since, if the ground, when finished, is
thicker in some places than in others, it will deceive
VOL. II. Edit.   point employed upon it) the ground is then
smoked, till thoroughly black, for the clearer dis-
cerning the strokes of the etching
 wax taper, twisted together four, or five, or
more times, is the most convenient candle to smoke
with; but any will serve for this purpose.
The plate must be perfectly clean, and free from
grease; as greasy spots, &cc. prevent the ground from
holding in those parts. To clean the plate, scrape 
little whiting on it, and wipe it off with  clean rag;
which will carry the grease with it.
While the plate is cooling, after the ground is laid,
Scrape some fed chalk on the back of your print,
tracing, or drawing, and rub it in all over with 
clean rag. Then place the reded side on the plate,
making it fast at each corner with soft wax. Lay the
etching-board under your hand, to prevent brussing
the ground; and, with  blunt etching-needle, trace
lightly the cutlines, and the breadths of the shadows,
till the marks of them appear on the ground, which
you must take care not to penetrate by tracing too
heavily
It will be proper at intervals to lift up  corner of
and to examine whether every part be
the tracing
perfectly traced before you take it off; as it will be
extremely difficult to lay the paper down again ex-
actly in its former position, if once removed.

Having completed the tracing, the off-track, or
drawing traced, is removed; and the subject is ready
for etching.
The practice of etching is easily attained by profi-
gients in design; since it is little more than drawing,
in
 strokes, with  point, on the plate, what is other-
wiss drawn with  pen, pencil, ec. on paper.
The etching-board (by some termed  bridge) is 
thin piece of board, generally of mahogany; of 
proper length and width, raised by small supports at
each end, to  convenient height for the hand to rest

Oh It.
The points, or needles, are almost similar to sewing
needles, but are stronger, and are inserted into han-
dles four, or five, inches long, for the convenience
of being properly held.
The best way to begin  subject, is; by forming
the outlines very carefully, then inserting the shadows,
beginning first in the darkest places.
Lines drawn in etching may be crossed by others,
if wanted.
Two lines drawn, by the side of each other closely,
will unite into one under the operation of biting,
whereby this line will become of great breadth, and
color: this mode is very usefulfor dark fore-grounds
in landscape, and has  good effect in architecture,
&. but the use of etching in historical subjects,  to prepare the figures, to be afterwards treated
by the graver.
The characteristies of etching, are,  certain rough-
ness (compared with performances of the graver
which does not suit glossy, and shrning, objects, but
which applies with good effect to coarser parts; such
as, in landscape, the barks of trees, the broken, and
looser touches of fore-grounds, &. In architecture,
it represents very happily the ravages of time in old
buildings, mouldering walls, exc. Another charac-
Feristic
  of etching is, its freedom; for which reason,
it suits well the leaves of trees, light clouds, ec.;
and, beside these properties, it is of great service
where  true, even, and uniform color is wanted, as
it is not only much quicker, but also more certain
than simple graving, in general : hence it suits the
blue parts of skies, the even teints of (new) archi
fecture, back-grounds to portraits, &. which are
conducted by  parallel-ruler.
It is evident from the services required, that the
points to be used, must vary in their fineness, some
:lines being made broad, others very thin. To whet
. point with perfect truth, free from angular projec.
tions, &. requires time, patience, and practice.
The plate being etched, the next process is to ex-
cavate the lines drawn, by subjecting them: to, the
action of aqua-fortis; which operation is termed
biting.
DIRECTIONS FOR BITING.

First, examine your work carefully, to see that
nothing be omitted, or any thing redundant; if any
Scratches appear on the ground, or any mistakes be
committed in the etching, they are to be stopped
out; which is done, by covering them with  mix-
ture of lamp-black and varnish, laid on with  pencil,
which, when dry, will resist the aqua-fortis. But it
to.
 soimetimes best to stop out these, as they occur in
the course of the work, for by this means they will
beless liable to escape notice among the mulaplicity
 other lines and parts; and when the varnish is dry,
you may etch over it; if necessary.
The next thing  to surround the work with 
rim, or border, of soft wax, about half an ich high,
forming the wax into  spout, at one corner, by
which to pour off the aqua-fortis: and that it may
not jun out at any other part, take care to press the
wax close and firm to the plate.
Having poured the mixture, of aqua-fortis on the
plate, let it continue  short time corroding the lines
drawn; wipe off the bubbles, as they rise, with 
feather, which may remain on the plate during the
biting; after  proper time, pour off the aqua-fortis,
and wash the plate, carefully, with fair water, pour-
ing it on and off; then let the plate dry, and, by
scraping off part of the ground from the faintest part
of the work, try if it be sufficiently bitten; if not,
stop out the part you have tried with lamp-back and
varnish; and when that is dry, pour on the aquas
fortis again, for  further operation.
When the faint parts of your work are bitten
enough, stop them out with the varnish, erc. and
proceed to bite the stronger parts, stopping them
out, as occasion requires, till the whole work is suf
ficiently bitten: then, warm the plate, and take off
the soft wax; after which, heat the plate till the
ground is melted; pour on it  little oil, and wipe
the whole off with  linen rag. When the ground is
taken off, rub the work well with the oil-rubber, and
wipe the plate clean; then proceed to finish with the
raver what parts of the subject require that process.
The wax for the border, is made, by mixing with
 pound


 pound of bees-wax; one quarter, or one third, of
 pound of Burgundy pitch, to soften it. As for any
color added to it, it is useless; because, after  little
while, the wax becomes black.
II is to be observed, that in biting  plate, much
attention is required. If  plate be under-bitten, ..
if the parts have not attained their proper color and
force, there is usually no remedy; but by following
every line with the graver, in order to blacken it.
 on the other hand, if very much overbitten, 
plate cannot be rendered neat and delicate; let never
so much time and skill be wasted on it. If bitten
but little above the color wanted,  few strokes of the
burnisher will lower it at pleasure.
If the air rising from the copper and forming bub-
bles kisses very much, ipn biting, it may be suspected
that the aqua-fortis is too strong; or acts too sud-
denly on the copper, which for tender work is
Injurious.
OF ENGRAVING STROKES.
The tools necessary for Engraving are, an oil-
Tubber, burnisher, scraper, and oil-stone, also needles,
or points; also gravers, compasses,  sand-bag, pa-
Tallel ruler, eic.
Gravers are of different shapes; square, and lo-
 several of each should be provided. The
Square is used in cutting the broad strokes; the
lozenge for the fainter and more delicate parts.
Gravers should be in length five inches and  half,
of thereabouts, the handle included.
The


 sand-bag is used to lay the plate on, for the
conveniency of turning it about to follow winding
lines. The oil-stone must be of the Turkey sort;
and, while in use, must never be kept without oil.
Great care is required to whet  gravernicely, par-
ticularly the belly: lay the two lower angles of the
graver flat upon the stone, and rub them steadily till
they are polished like  irror; and till the belly rises
gradually; so that, when you lay the graver' edge
on the plate, you may just perceive the light under
the point; otherwise, it will dig into the copper, and
it will be impossible to execute work with freedom.
When the belly is whetted: to whet the face, place
the flat part of the handle in the hollow of your hand,
with the belly of the graver upwards; on  moderate
slope, and rub the face on the stone, till it has an
exceeding sharp point, which you may try upon
your thumb-pail.
For tempering the graver, if too hard, vide
GRAVER.
Cut off that part of the handle which is on  line
with the belly of the graver, to make that side flat.
Hold the handle in the hollow of the hand, and
extend the fore-finger toward the point, resting it on
the back of the graver, that you may guide the tool
with more ease.
Take care that your fingers do not interpose be-
tween the plate and the graver, but let the whole
machine slide, as it were, along the plate; and trust
to the resistance of the copper for its stegdiness,
Delicacy of feeling is  prme quality in  good
Chgraver.
Let


 the table or board you work at, be firm and
steady.
For strait strokes, let the plate lie flat on the table.
For circular or crooked strokes, place the plate on
the sand-bag, and hold the graver firm, noving
your hand, or the plate, or both, as you see, or rather
feel convenient.
Learn to carry your hand with such dexterity, that
you may end your stroke as finely as you began it;
and, if you have occasion to make one part deeper,
of blacker, than another, do it by re-entering that
Stroke.
In the course of the work, scrape off the barb, or
roughness, which arises, with the scraper; but be
careful, in doing this, not to scratch the plate. Ne-
ver scrape directly acress  line, but always at an easy
angle along the course of the stroke.
Mistakes, or scratches in the plate, may be rubbed
out with the burnisher, if of no great depth, and the
part afterwards cleared with the scraper; polish, it
again at last lightly with the burnisher.
When you wish to examine what work you have
done, rub it with the oil-rubber, which, by filling
the strokes with black, will shew them, when the
plate is wiped, to advantage. Too much oil-rubbing
injures the finer work; as does (very materially) too
Mruch scraping.
Engraving in strokes, or hatches, as it is the most
ancient, so it is the most noble, manner of engraving:
it requires most skill, affords most scope for judg-
ment, and genius, as well as for manual dexterity;
  is, accordingly, more difficult to execute in 
masterly, and superior, manhner.
It is evident, that any line drawn, may be crossed
by another line; or any number of lines, by  second
number of lines; but it is equally evident, that not
every such crossing can be graceful. If it follows
too nearly the course of the original lines, it will
form, by its intersections,  number of areds, of too
sharp, and disagreeable lozenge; shapes; if the first
lines are crossed at right angles, the areas formed
will be so many squares, which, by possessing  Kind
of hardness in their appearance, apply only to certain
subjects. The medium admits an infinity of degrees.
If we examine any Clarge) well-executed print, we
observe, in some places; ( single lines, or strokes;
of considerable length, according to the drawing;
( lines crossed at an agreeable lozenge; ( lines
crossed at right angles, where  kind of obscurity is
wanted; ( two lozenge lines, crossed with  third,
isually much softer, and more tender than the two
former, but following, or rather attending their course;
 lines at right angles, crossed by  third at  lo-
zenge, to divest the squares of their hardness and
stifiness; ( lines at  considerable distance from
each other, and of  firm color, with  thin line be-
tween them; this is called interlining; ( the same,
sometimes crossed in the saime manner; ( round
dots, in the flesh; ( long dots, for the same pur-
bose; ( long dots, crossing each other; ( thin
lines crossing lines of dots; ( very thin lines,
made by the dry point, in the lights, &cc. and many
other contrivances for producing variety. These,
applied
 
VOL. II. Edit.   according to the indications of the design, or
 the taste, and skill, of the artist, impart to capital
prints  richness and character, which no other man-
er of engraving can boast of; and which is yet far-
ther angmented, by  judicious introduction, and
mixture; of etching, engraving, and dry point lines,
The dry point is so termed, because used without
 ground,, consequently not bitten; the burr, or
 rising from the copper, by the use of it, is very
strong, and must be scraped off carefully. The whole
point, and  handle, is stronger than an etching

point, to sustain greater pressure when in use.
It appears from this mode of reasoning, that to at-
tain considerable excellence in this style of engraving,
i  easy matter; and indeed, of the many who are
brought up to it, few arrive at superior hohpours; of,
if they obtain skill in one branch (etching for in
stance), they fail in others: yet, as much of the
Progress, even of the best of plates, is little more
than mechanisim, and patience, abilities of all degrees
are useful in the course of  long work:
It is proper to caution-those inclined to attempt
any of the branches of engraving, against  cramp
posture, or, leaning the stomach against the table, or,
poring with their eyes too close to the plate, &.
while at work. In very delicately. finished works,
the artist always has recourse to  magnifying glass;
but as our readers certainly will not undertake such
Works, we proceed to another species of Engraving.

INNGRAVING



 ENGRRVING IN CHALkS.
 his manner of engraving has lately highly ex-
cited the public attention, and, indeed, has deserved
it, by the beauty of many specimens which it has
produced.
The process for preparing the plate, . . laying the
ground, tracing, &. is the same as before. The
principles adopted in the etching, differ only, in that,
instead of fines, the drawing, shadows, eec. are in-
serted in dots, as freely as may be, yet carefully.
The biting is the same; with this difference, that
whereas, in biting lines, no two should be suffered
to unite; unless previously intended, and prepared
for that purpose; in biting chalks (provided they do
not by their union form  hard spot, or too consi-
derable  black) this accident is not of equal conse-
quence; if the subject be large. In small subjects,
the more delicate and important parts should not be
colored in the etching, but wholly inserted with the
graver; being less hazardous, and much more ac-
Clirate.
The plate bitten, and the ground removed, the
effect of the subject represented, remains to be
worked up with the graver. For small subjects, or
such as are to be neatly finished, this is the only tool
to be depended on. The best manner of preparing
the graver for firm work, is, by changing its situa-
tion in the handle, so that the belly part of it, which
was lowermost, becomes uppermost; then, by turn=
ing the handle in the hand, the point acts on the
Copper
.     from  greater elevation, which for strong
dots is preferable; as only dots, not strokes, are re-
quired, the tool is, in this position, manageable with
much greater facility, and speed.

The remaining part of the progress of  plate con-
sists only in covering the copper with dots, in  man=
her lighter, or heavier, proportionate to the color,
and to the drawing, required. When one covering
of dots is scraped off, another must be inserted, and
so on; by this repetition,  proper grain of dots, and
the general masses of shade are procured.. This pro-
cess is tedious; but in return, it requires no great
skill in the operator; . little practice, and proper.
attention, attains the whole mystery.
In larger subjects, or those which are to be slighted,
some persons use tools of various sorts, such as
wheels, with single, or double, rows of teeth, or
cradles resembling  mezzotinto grounding tool (but.
made with teeth), or, others constructed to their
minds; but, these, tools, though more expeditious
than the graver only, are seldom so accurate, of so
pleasing in the effect they produce.

These Kind of tools, and  variety of others
(amounting in the whole, when  set is perfect, to
nnear forty), have been very much used in France,
where the manner of engraving in chalks was first
practised; they very frequently produce an effect
more closely resembling an original drawing in
chalks, than English performances finished selely
with the graver; but, on the other hand, the neat-
ness and accuracy, as well as  certain mellowness of
style which distinguish English productions, are not.
only


  )
ohly vastly superior to those of the French artists,
 are universally esteemed so, throughout Europe.
The chief merit of plates; engraved in chalks, is.
inserted by the artist who finishes the subject. Care
and attention is requisite, and  good habit of design.,
indispensable; every requisite in the manual practice
is easily acquired.
The French have very well imitated drawings on
 paper, by using two plates; one of which printed
the black-chalk effect,, the other the white-chalk:
on, the same idea, chalk plates printed in black, on
blue paper, may afterwards be touched with white-
chalk, to  very pleasing effect.
OF RE-BITING.
When the parts of  subject which were intended
to be dark, have failed of their proposed effect, they
may be re-bitten, by the following process (which
applies to all kinds of erching, and is among the se-
crets of the superior engravers): at  convenient
part of the plate, being properly heated for the pur-
Pose, melt  quantity of ground; then with  dabber,
carefully, by degrees, transplace as much of the
ground thus melted, as is necessary, to the part pro-
posed, by beating it gently, so that the surface, only,
 the copper may be covered, and the hollows, or
excavated lines of the work may remain free and
clean. When this ground is cold, it may be re-
bitten with aqua-fortis as before. It is frequently
better not to smoke it, lest the heat of the taper

should melt the ground into the work; in which
case, wherever the ground covered the plate the
aqua=fortis could not act.
. . Re-biting is sometimes used both to strokes
and dotes, to strengthen  part which has not acquired
all the color it should have; even after it has been
laid in with the graver.
To clean strokes, erc. engraved, use  little spirits of
turpentine, and rub the plate with crumbs of bread;
if the dirt is of long standing, soap lees poured on
the plate, while warming, is very effectual: but as
this is  corrosive liquor, it must be immediately
washed off the plate by plenty of cold water; and it
 too stong for mezzotinto plates (especially) unless
it be very carefully used.
OF MEZTOTINTO.
Me is said to have been first invented by
Prince RUPERT, about the year  who took the
hint from seeing  soldier file his rusty musket; and
Mr. EvELyN, in his Ilistory of Chalcography, gives
us  head, performed by that Prince, in this way;
but Mr. LE BLOND is said to have introduced it
most successfully into practice.
The Prince laid his grounds on the plate with 
channelled ruler; but one SHER WIN, about the same
fune, laid his grounds with  half -round file, which
was pressed down with  heavy piece of lead. Both
these grounding tools have been laid aside, for many
years; and  hand-tool, called  cradle, resembling
 shoe-








 


. Thoemakers ecutting-board Knife, with  fine cre=


 on the edge, was introduced by one EDiar,

 smith by trade, who afterwards became  mezzo-
Iinto printer.


As it is much. easier to scrape off, or to burnish
"
away, the parts of  dark ground corresponding with
the outlines of any design sketched upon it, than to
form shades upon  light ground, by an infinite num-

ber of hatches, strokes,, and points, which must all
terminate with exactness on the outline, as well as
differ in their force, and mapnner, the method of
 as it is called, in mezzotinto, becomes, con-
sequently, much more easy and expeditious, than
any other manner of ENGRAVINs. The instruments
used in this Kind of engraving are CRADLES, SCRAF-
ERS, and BURNISHERS. The scrapers for delicate
York are much like  surgeon' lancet in shape and
in fineness, but others are much stronger, for greater
speed, and riddance.
To lay  ground, the cradle is to be passed for=
wards uniformly in the same direction; being kept
 steady as possible, and pressed upon with  mode-
tate force; till- the instrument has passed over the
whole surface of the plate. This first course of
grounding must be crossed, at right angles, on the
same principle. New lines must then be drawn dia-
gonally,, and the cradle passed along them as before;
when the first diagonal operation is performed, these
lines must then be crossed at right angles. The plate
having undergone the action of the cradle, accord-
ing to this disposition,  second course of cradling

must be commenced: and the same must be re-
peated,


 regularly, changing the direction of the lines
made by the tool. When the whole of this opera
tion is finished, it is cailed one turn; but, in order
to produce  very dark, and uniform, ground, the
plate must undergo the repetition of all these opera-
tions many times.
ing
 the plate is prepared with  ground, the


skeich must be traced on it, by means of the paper

rubbed on the back-side with chalk, as mentioned
before. It is also proper to over-trace the lines, and
drawing, afterwards with black lead, or rather, which
i much better, with Indian ink, to secure the out-
   


lines. The scraping is performed; by partuse
 away, the grain of the ground; in various
degreess so that none preserves its original state; ex
cept the touches of strong shadow. The general
manner of proceeding is like drawing with white up-
on black paper. The masses of light are first begun;
and those parts, which lighten upwards but are in
shade below. the reflections are then touched; after
which the plate is blackened with  printers black-
ing-ball, made of felt, in order to view; the effect:
the whole is then gradually brought to effect by
scraping over the parts till they are sufficiently
lightened.
Observe always to begin with the strongest lights.
It is easy to scrape more off any part if it be too
dark; but, if  part be too much scraped away, it is
troublesome; for it must undergo the action of 
small cradling tool, proportioned to the size of the
part, and the additional ground thus procured is not
always  correct march to the original ground, which
has

has an unpleasant effect, unless very skilfully ind-
raged. Me plates are therefore proved, long
before they approach toward finishing, if the subject
be in any degree intricate, or considerable.

OF AAUA TINTA.
This manner of producing on copper the effect of
 drawing washed in Bistre, or Indian ink, is altoge-
ther  modern invention; it was attempted in   by Mr. . SaNDEy and Mr. DALTON, but
it then failed of that success it has since met with.
 first person whose productions were not only
imitations of drawings, but were capable of printing
any considerable number of copies, was Mons. LE
PRINCE of Paris; whose early performances appeared
in his & Modes  Usages de Russic. Mons. LE
PRINCE, by degrees, improved his discovery, till
at length it was thought, by the Honourable Mr.
Greville, (brother to the Earl of Warwick)  secret
worth purchasing at the expence of thirty guineas.
This gentleman communicated the process to Mr. .
SANDBY, whose attention and genius carried it to
great excellence. Since its importation into EngÂ¬
land, it has been the subject of repeated and conti-
nued investigation; and as it was impossible to pre-
vent the inquisitive essays of many ingenious engrds
vers, who thought this article worth their acquisi-
 so it has happened, that more ways than one of
producing this effect have been discovered. Each
person thinks his own method the best; and all
 
VOL. II. Edit.   
stadiously conceal their principles; we may there.
fore claim the ment of being the first, in England
at least; who communicated the secret to the public.
We shall report several modes of procedure.
 FIRST wAY we shall mention of producing

on copper the effect of tinted drawings, is, by grind-
ing  quantity of sulphur in oil, and with this mix-
ture painting the plate; then, by placing the plate
over  gentle fire, the vitriolic acid contained in the
sulphur is set at liberty, and acts as  Corrosive on
the copper, forming  color lighter or deeper, in
roportion to the heat of the fire, the time of its

exposure to it, and to the strength of the acid em-
ployed in the mixture.
 SECOND way of producing the same effect,  on the well-known different affections of
the same menstruum to different metals; and pro-
ceeds thus; saturate  quantity of aqua=fortis of 
due strength, with shreds of silver; this liquor poured
on copper, will quit the silver it contains, in order
to act on the copper, by which it is more attracted;
the silver will precipitate in the form of  subtle
Powder, and thereby occasion irregularities on the
surface of the plate, which will hold the ink when
printed.
Of these manners of procedure, the first is very
offensive in its process, the fumes of the composition
being highly disagreeable. The second, is chieffy
applicable to very slender parts, and to add  color
to places which are not of importance sufficient to
require , fresh ground, or much trouble; such as
leaves of trees, light fiying clouds, erc. as it does not
 much force, without great good fortune, or
very close attention.
  THIRD wAY proceeds on the principles, that
minute interstices, alternately black and white, will,
when viewed at  little distance, produce the effect
of all black, according to the tone to which they are
adapted : therefore, whatever will so fix irself to the
plate, as to prevent the action of aqua-fortis where it
 in contact, and yet will pertit the aqua-fortis to
corrode all around it, will produce alternarely blacks
and whites. This was first attempted with rosin
finely pulverized; but that was apt (if too fine, or
t much warmed) to form  coat, or superficies, over
considerable parts of the copper, thereby resisting
the menstruum on all sides. Sal ammoniac, pulve-
rized with the rosin, and antimately mixed with it,
was found to preserve interstices; but this applies
only occasionally.
There are several guins which possess nearly simi-
lar properties; but the following appears superior to
all others, and is (excepting the change of gum junt-
per, for guin copal) the method followed by Mions.
HE PRINCE.
Grind  sufficient quantity of gum copal; divide
it by sifting, into three or four parcels at pleasure,
according to the fineness of each parcel: the first or
finest powder serving for the lighter parts of the sub-
jeet to be treated, such as distances, sky, erc.. The
second or grained powder for middle tints; the coarser
grains of powder for fore-grounds, and other very
dark places; where strong biting is required by the
subject. To accomplish this separation, the sieyes
Milst
.  vary in fineness. Sift on the plate  suffic
crent quantity of the finer powder; the plate will
now appear of an uniform tender white, unless closely
examined, when the interstices between the particles
of gum will be very discernible; heat the plate very
gently, only till the sum changes from its white
color, and is so far melted as to fix on the plate, from
which it is scarcely to be distinguished by iis color,
When cold, the plate is ready for receiving the aqua-
fortis. Stop out the lights, &cc. as in common
biting.
When the biting is over (which does not last long,
 minute, perhaps, to the fine powder), wash the
plate with water, as before directed for biting, and
examine the effect produced, and the state of the
ground; if some parts only are done, stop them out,
and proceed to bite the other parts; if the whole be
done of which this ground is capable, clean the plate
by heating it, and apply  little oil, to remove the
gum easily, if necessary. Those parts which are of
the just color required, must then be secured, by
stopping them out; the second powder must next be
treaied as the first has been, and the coarser powders,
or rathergrains of gum, must be treated in the same
manner, to procure the bolder strengths: but these

may endure proportionately stronger biting.
It is necessary to have more powders than one, be-
cause the hold the powder, or grains, has of the cop-
per will permit only  certain degree of action in the
aqua-fortis. The grosser the grains, the stronger
hold they take of the copper; they will bear more
heat to fix them, and will suffer more copper to be
COf-





 away from around them: but then, they
would make very staring whites, were not  ground
previously laid by the others; or, if they were mis-
placed on  subject, they would greaily disfigure it.
Sometimes  finer tint may be laid over  Coarser
to good advantage.
Sometimes  larger grain of whites may be pro-
cured, by melting the finer powders more than usual,
which, by spreading each particle of gum, makes
each grain cover  greater surface, which it protects
from the action of the aqua-fortis.
It requires some patience, and facility with the
pencil, to prepare the plate by stopping out; which
operation is not only to be attended to at first, to
preserve the whites, but may be repeated at any time,
provided the grains of powder attached to the plate
appear able to sustain the biting necessary to produce

the color proposed.
Every manner of engraving by aqua tinta has
much of uncertainty connected with it; and requires,
ot only good judgment, but great attention, and
some, perhaps  good deal, of good luck, to succeed
happily. If, therefore, any mode of practising it
could be reduced to  certainty of producing the
effect required, and could be so conducted as to be
under command, it would be  fortunate discovery.
The first difficulty in aqua tinta is, to get the
ground perfectly even, and uniform; to accomplish
this, we have two objects in view; the first is to
compose  ground which shall be properly divided
into (  material which may produce grains
to resist the aqua-fortis, (  material which
will





 produce interstices to admit the aqua-fortis. The
best way, at present Known, is, to bruise, grind,
break, and sift together, repeatedly, till the com
pound powder appear of one uniform color, the gum
copal, with  proportionate quantity. of asphaltum;
which will make  powder of pretty nearly equal fine-
ness. Now, the gum copal will be fixed on the plate,
by being melted, by means of so gentle  degree of
heat as will not affect-the asphaltum: this powder,
then, being loose, admits the aqua-fortis to surround
the grains of gum.. . . Other powders may be
discovered to answer the same purpose: and, indeed,
whatever is near the specific gravity of the guin,
nay succeed in practice.
The second object we have in view  to lay the
grounds perfectly uniform, and evenly distributed,
over the surface of the copper. It is true, that 
steady hand may sift  powder through  fine sieve,
very evenly, if the eye follow it closely, and this
tnethod is not to be despised; but, almost every
body must have observed, that, powders of all Kinds
are precipitated when at rest in water, very evenly,
and uniformly; if then,  quantity of water, having
 proper proportion of powder diffused in it, be
poured on  plate, the water may be drained from it,
by  proper inclination of it, while the powder re-
mains behind : when the water has entirely quitted
the plate, the ground, thus obtained, may be set by
being warmed as before.
 menstruum, in which the grains of gum are
dissolved and intimately mixed, may be yet better.
Tum or rosin dissolved in spirits of wine, the liquer
being


(  
being poured on the plate, the spirits will evaporate;
and the rosin becoming dry, will form itself into
grains, which being fixed on the plate, allow inter-
stices for the action of the aqua-fortis.
As the time necessary for putting  border of wax
round  plate, is more than is engaged in the biting
of  light ground, some artists make use of  trough,
properly painted, and secured from the action of the
aqua-fortis, into which, when filled with aqua-fortis,
and after having stopped out all that is to be left
white on the plate, not forgetting the margin), they
plange the plate and suffer it to remain there, only
so long as they judge necessary to produce the color
wanted; if upon examination the plate be not bitten
enough; they plunge it again, till they are satisfied.
Do
This they do to every ground, till the plate  of these modes of practising aqua tinta; sup=
poses  good deal of trouble in stopping out the parts
which are to be left white: there have been, there-
fore, other methods suggested, which for some sub-
jects answer better.
First, lay  ground of gum copal grain, all over
the surface of the copper when this is cool, and
ready for use, paint, with the shadowing composition
mentioned below, in the same manner, and with the
same freedom, as with Indian ink, the shadows of
the subject (if it be  landscape, the foliage of the
trees, Ecc.) let it be thoroughly dry; then, with 
large, soft, camel' hair pencil, cover over the whole,
with the asphaltum varnish : and when that is thos
roughly dry, plunge the plate into water: in  short
Space

space of tithe, the water penetrating through this
vainish, will dissolve the sugar, or the treacle, which
forms its composition; and that, rising, will part
from the copper, and bring with it all that covers
it, leaving the copal ground unaffected by the wa-
rer, and still adhering firmly to the plate. This bite
 before.
The ASPHALTUM VARNISH is made; by dissolving
four ounces of asphaltum in about eight ounces of
spirits of turpentine; using  very gentle heat: pour
off the liquid, and add more of either ingredient, as
the varnish may be thought too thick, or too thin.
The SHADOWING COMPOSITTON is made, by tak.
ing any quantity of treacle, and grinding it into 
Paste with whitening; or, by taking, of coarse sugar
about two ounces, of whitening about one ounce,
and grinding them with  sufficient quantity of wa-
ter, to form  paste proper for use by the pencil.
If any hard edges occur in aqua tinta, they may
be softened by the burnisher, or the burnisher may
insert lights or slight touches of drawing, Exc. occa:
sionally, to advantage.
The aqua-fortis used in this method of engraving
should not be too strong; because, as its operation
 always rapid, if too strong, it will break up the
ground, and do other mischief, before it can be pre-
vented. It is not  bad way to try the strength of it,
before it be used, on  separate piece of copper.
 very great disadvantage attending re-tinting of
any part is, the nicety required to match  color; in
fact, it is hardly possibly to lay two grounds so pre-
crsely alike as is requisite for that purpose: nav, it

frequently happens that  second ground obliterates,
or at least damages, the first over which it is laid.
Aqua tinta is  method of engraving (if it may de-
serve that title) so very rapid, that it will produce on
 large plate, in one week, the effect of  months
labour at some other Kinds of engraving: it is in ge
neral, however, but shallow on the copper, yet,
when well managed, is sufficiently lasting. Its merit
consists much in  very even colour, smooth, and

free from blemishes. It applies well to architecture,
to landscape, and to back-grounds.
Though  do not think much use can ever be
made of the invention, yet  think proper to insert
here the mode of etching upon glass. or, rather,
the discovery of  solvent which acts upon glass, as
aqua-fortis does upon copper.
The acid for this purpose is procured from sparry
fluor, or Derbyshire blue John, powdered, and by
means of concentrated vitriolic acid. submitted to
distillation by  gentle heat; what comes over, and
unites with  proper quantity of water in the receiver
(which is of lead as well as the retort) is the acid;
It must also be kept in  leaden vessel. This will
corrode lines, ec. drawn upon glass through  varnish.
Explanation of the Method of printing in CoLOUns.
The plate being warmed in the usual manner, the
colours are applied by means of stump camel-hair
pencils, to the different parts, as the subject sug-
gests; it is then wiped with  coarse gauze canvas,
 
VOL. II. Edit.  other being improper; after this, it is wiped
clean with the hand, as in common practice; and
being again warmed, is passed through the press.
The colors are mixed with burnt linseed oil, and
those generally used by painters are proper.
The little finger generally supplies the place of
pencils. This art succeeds best in chalk engravings.
The prints, if touched up with colours, after they
are printed, will approach very beautifully toward
the effect of pictures.
OF CUTTiNG IN WOOD.
This business is, properly, neither scuipture, nor
engraving, but, being applied to many of the pur-
poses of engraving, it claims affinity to that art. The
smoothest grained woods are the best; such as pear-
tree, or beech, but above all box. The surface
being prepared by smoothening,  thin coat of white
lead, tempered with water, is passed over it, the
outlines of the design are traced with  black lead
pencil, or ink, and the design is laid on the block;
then wetted, and carefully rubbed on the back, till
the lines traced are transferred to the white lead,
which shews them plainly; the blank parts are then
cut away with sharp Knives, small chissels, or gravers,
as required. This kind of work differs from engrav-
ing on copper; in that, the parts of the copper
which are out out hold the ink, and form the impres-
sion; in this, the parts which remain, being promi-
nents


 perform the same business. The blocks are
printed as letter-press.
This Kind of work has been made to produce an
effect resembling washed drawings, by using several
blocks, correspondent to the several colors of the de-
sign: the ink, being accurately mixed to the color
wanted, is applied all over the surface of the
block, and the darker colors printed after the lighter.
Aqua tinta has superseded the use of this method;
but one similar to it is practised at Paris, only using
copper plates instead of wooden blocks, and printing
the separate parts of the design in their proper colors,
by which they are very prettily tinted.
In delicate works, or parts expressive of distances,
to slope away the surface of the wood gently in those
parts produces  good effect; because, in the print-
ing, they less hold the ink, and less ink is pulled off
them by the paper; consequently, they appear
fainter.

OF MODELLING.
This is one branch of the art of the sculptor, and
in many cases,  very important one; being, to all
works of considerable size, an indispensable requi-
site previous to cutting the marble; being also, the
usual mode in which young sculptors study the prin-
ciples of their profession, academy figures, ecc.
The tools for this purpose are usually slender sticks
of wood, made by the artist himself, and therefore
of  shape at his pleasure; but, whatever other im-
plements may occasionally be employed, the thumb
and fingers generally perform the major part. The
clay to be used should be fine, soft, free from stones,
dirt, &cc. and be carefully examined before it is used.
In London, this Kind of clay is procured from
about Vauxhall.
To model  Bas Relief: on  strong board, of suf-
ficient size, sketch the dimensions of the subject in-
tended, then place the clay, which is morst and ad
hesive, laying  greater quantity on the parts which
are to be raised, to give them thickness, and follow-
ing the course of the drawing proper to the subject.

To model  figure, it is sometimes requisite to in
sert little sticks into the limbs, and other parts which
will not support themselves without props; but this
requires care. It is  liberty very allowable in mo-
delling, to support the figure with beds of clay in
convenient places, where they do not injure the com-
position, since these Kind of models are to be consi-
dered as little more than sketches, or preparatory
studies.

 the model is quitted, if not finished it must
be kept cool, and morst, by being covered with 
wet cloth.
If  model is intended to be preserved, it must be
set by, to dry very thoroughly; then, taken. to  where it must be gradually hardened, and
baked. There are many risks attending this process;
if the clay be not dry within, however it may appear
without, sudden heat will spoil it; or, if there re-
main any stone concealed in it, when the heat of the
fire reaches that stone, it will explode, and crack the
piccc.
If the colour of the clay used is not approved of,
it may be painted in Distemper, after being burnt;
oil colors, having  glossiness, are seldom employed.

which  copy in marble is to be taken, the original
part of the business being over.
To MODEL IN WAx.â€”The process is much the
same as with clay. To temper the wax, some add to
 pound of wax half  pound of colophony; some
add turpentine, melting the whole with olive oil;
some insert  little vermilion, or other color, to give
it  tint. Wax will readily take every color added
to it; and is accordingly sometimes used to imitate
life; in which procedure cleanness of tint must be

Mr. BacoN having communicated to the public,
in the Cyclopedia, some remarks on that profession
in which he excels, to offer it to our readers, re-
quires, we presume, no apology. They are as
follows:
  is probable that sculpture is more ancient than
painting; and, if we examine the style of ancient
painting, there is reason to conclude, that sculpture
stood first in the public esteem: as the ancient paint
ers have evidently imutated the statuarles, even to
their disadvantage: since their works have not that
freedom of style, more especially with respect to
their composition and drapery, which the pencil
might easily acquire to  greater degree than that of
the chissel; but, as this is universally the case, it
cannot be attributed to any thing else besides the
higher estunation of the works on which they formed
themselyes. Which is the most difficult art has been
 question often agitated. Painting has the greatest
number of requisites, but, at the same time, her ex-
pedients are the most numerous; and, therefore, we
may venture to affirm, that, whenever  sculpture
pleases equally with  painting, the sculptor is cer-
tainly the greatest artist. Sculpture has indeed the
honour of giving law to all the schools of design,
both ancient and modern, with respect to purity of
form. The reason, perhaps,  that being divested
of those meretricious ornaments by which painting is
enabled to seduce its admirers, it is happily forced to

 for its effect in the higher excellencies of the
art: hence elevation in the idea, as well as purity
and grandeur in the forms, are found in greater per-
fection in sculpture than in painting. Besides, what=
ever may be the original principles which direct our
feelings in the approbation of intrinsic beauty, they
are, without doubt, very much under the infiuence
of association. Custom and habit will necessarily
give  false bias to our judgment; it is therefore na-
tural, and in some measure, reasonable, that those
arts which are temporaneous, should adapt them-
selves to the changes of fashion, &cc. But sculpture,
by its durability, and consequent application to works
of perpetuity, is obliged to acquire and maintain the
essential principles of beauty and grandeur, that its
effect on the mind may be preserved through the
various changes of mental taste. It is conceived,
that it will scarcely admit of  question, whether the
ancients or moderns have most excelled in this art;
the palm having been universally adjudged to the
former. To determine in what proportion they are
superior is too difficult an attempt. Wherever there
  real superiority in any art or science, it will in
time be discovered; but the world, ever fond of ex-
cess, never stops at the point of true judgment, but
dresses out its favourite object with the ornaments
of fancy, so that every blemish becomes  beauty.
This it has done by ancient sculpture to such  de=
gree as not to form its julgment of that by any rules,
but to form an opinion of rules by the example. As
long as this is the case, modern art can never have 
fair comparison with the ancient. This partiality to
the


( ancients is so strong as to prevent almost all dis=
crimination; and is the sole reason, why many an-
Liques, that now stand as patterns of beauty in the
judgment of most connorsseurs, are not discovered
to be copies. This is not more important than it is
easy to be perceived by  judicious eye; for where-
ever there is  grandeur or elegance to an eminent
degree in the idea and general composition of  sta-
tue, and when the execution of the parts (called by
aftists the treating of the parts) betrays  want. of
faste and feeling, there is the greatest reason to con-
clude, that the statue is  copy, though we were ever
so certain of its antiquity. And surely, if evidence
of  pictures being  copy proportionably diminishes
 value, the same rule of judgment may may be no
less properly applied to  statue. Modern and ancient
art can never, therefore, be fairly compared, till both
are made to submit to the determination of reason
and nature. It may be observed, that the anciepts
have chiefly confined themselves to the sublime and
beaunful; and, whenever  pathetic subject has
come before them, they have sacrificed expression
to beauty. The famous groupe of Niobe is one
instance of this Kind; and, therefore, however
great our partiality to the ancients may be, none
can hesitate to affirm, that, whenever the moderns
shall unite great expression with great beauty, they
 wrest the palm out of their hands.
In Sculpture the first thing done, is, out of  great
block of marble to saw another of the size required;
which is performed with  smooth steel saw, without
teeth; casting water and sand thereon, from time to
ties


( then, by taking off what is superfiuous with
 steel point and  heavy hammer of soft iron, it is
brought near the measure required; and still nearer
with  finer point; they then use  flat cutting instru-
ment, having notches in its edge, of teeth; and then
 chissel to take off the scratches the other has left;
till, at length, taking rasps of different degrees of
fineness, they gradually bring the work into  con-
dition for polishing.
To polish, or make the parts smooth and sleek,
they rub them with pumice-stone and smalt; then
with tripoli; and when  still greater lustre is re-
quired, they use burnt straw.
To proceed the more regularly, on the head of the
model, some place an immoveable circle, divided
into degrees; with  moveable ruler, or index, fast-
ened in the centre of the circle, and divided likewise
into equal parts. From the end of the ruler hangs 
thread with  plummet, which serves to take all the
points to be transferred thenteito the block of marble,
from whose top hangs another plummet like that of
the model. But other excellent sculptors disapprove
of this method; urging, that the smallest motion of
the model changes their measures; for which reason,
they rather choose to take all their measures with the
compasses, though reckoned more tedious.
In large figures, the first part of the business
being labour, and not skill, it is committed to under-
orkmen: and indeed the whole of this part of the
profession being to copy the model, the mdster seldom
troubles himself to work at it, at least, till the close
of the process.

admits of being laid flat, they endeavour to bring
the copy to cast the same shadows as the original.
Sculpture has been in England rather  monumen=
tal art, than, as it is in many other countries,  de=
corative profession. Of late, we have had many
elegant chimney-pieces of sculpture, but very few
large figures, except fortombs. Our best specimens
in public are, the statues of Phrenzy and Melancholy,
On the piers before Bethlehem Hospital, which de-
serve to be ranked among the first performances in
this art; they were executed in the reign of Charles
II. by GARRTEL CIEEER, father of the poet-laureat.

Westminsterâ€”Abbey is the most famous repository
of sculpture in England, and it contains many fine
specimens; but the fighres lose much of their effect
by being crowded together without order; whereby
one groupe injures another.
St. Pauls Cathedral has lately received further em-
bellishments by sculpture; and more is intended. It
affords many noble opportunities and situations for
capital groupes, &&. in all parts, but especially in the
circumference beneath the dome.




 following colors being nerwly discovered and made
public, have been ounted in their proper places: ws.
give them here for the satisfaction of our readers.

BRUNSWICK GREEN.â€”This is  very valuable
and newly discovered color, and is prepared by two
brothers, of the name of Gravenhorst, at Brunswick.
Hithereto it has been kept  secret; but it is conjec=
tured to be  precipitate of copper which has been
dissolved in tartar and water by coetion, and which,
 evaporation of the lixivium, is deposited in the
form of  cupreous tartar.  similar color is sold by
MMessrs. Brandran and Co. in Sise-lane, London,
which possesses many, if not all, the rare qualities of
that prepared at Brunswick.

EARTH, WHITE.â€”Many ingenious men have
employed their talents in discovering  more whole-
some, and cheaper, pigment, than white lead;
and, perhaps, the finer and whiter sorts of EARTH
might be usefully substituted. The Terra Goltber.
gensis is of  white color, which is dug up in se-
veral parts of Germany,, more particularly at Golts
berg, whence its name, and Strigaw, and at Lignitz
in Silesia. At this time, it is procured in the neigh-
bourhood of Ifasselt, in the bishoprick of Liege, in
the circle of Westphalia, where it is usually sealed
with the impression of an eagts, and the words
 Goltbergensis. â€” Oftobacco-pipe clays there
are also several sorts that appear convertible into pig=
ments, especially one of this class which is found near.
Lymington in Hampshire, which is not at present
But the earth termed Melimim
turned to much use,
   MELINUM), has ever been famous in the annals
of painting, being the principal white of the painters
of antiquity. It is still found in the same place from
whence the painters of old had it, viz. the island of
Wilo, called Melos by the Greeks, whence its hname,
and is common in all the adjacent islands. It is not
quite so bright  white as white lead; but as it never
turns yellow, as white lead does, it is far preferable
to that article in the course of time. Besides, as
most of the discoloring substances of earths may
be attributed to iron, if it were treated with marine
acid, the brightest might be improved.
ORANGE LAKE.â€”This may be prepared by boil.
ing four ounces of the best Spanish annotto, and one
pound of pearl ashes, for the space of half an hour;
in one gallon of water. Strain the tincture, and mis
it gradually with  solution of  pound and  half of
alum in six quarts of water, desisting when no ebul-
lition ensiues. Treat the sediment as is usual in com-
thon lake, and dry it in square bits, or rolls; &cc.

PATENT VELLow.â€”This color, for which the
ingenious Mr. Turner has  patent, is prepared by
triturating red lead and common salt together in 
mortar, and then exposing them in  crucible (made
of tobacco-pipe clay) to  certain heat. The sait is
decomposed, the marine acid uniting with the cals
of lead, forms the patent yellow; and the basis of
the salt, which must be carefully washed out, is the
mineral alkali, of so much consequence in the soap,
glass, and other manufactories.
SUGAR OF LEAD.â€”Lead and its calces may be
dissolved by the acctous acid, and will afford  cryss
tallizable
 salt, called sugar of lead, from its extreime
sweetness. This, like all the preparations of fead,  deadly porson. It has the property of rendering
oils thicker, and causing them to dry more rapidly.
TO MAKE WHITE PRECIPITATE OF EEAD.
If  small quantity of strong nitrous acid be poured
on litharge (which see), the acid unites itself to the
metal with considerable effervescence and heat. Some
water being now poured on, and the glass vessel con-
taining the mixture shaken,  turbid solution of the
litharge is made. If  small quantity of acid of viz
triol be now added, it throws down  beautiful white
precipitate; and the acid of nitre being left at liberty
to act upon the remainder of the litharge, begins
anew to dissolve it with effervescence.. When it  saturated, which will be known by the discon-
finuance of the bubbles, more acid of vitriol is to be
dropped in, and  white precipitate is again throwis
down. If any of the litharge remains undissolved,
the nurous acid being set at liberty  second tiime,
attacks it as at first; and by continuing to add acid
of vitriol, the whole of the litharge may be converted
into  most beautiful and durable white. Unfortu=
pately, this color cannot be used in ofl, though in
ater it seeims superior to any.
.. If the process be well managed, an ounce
of nitrousacid may be made to convertseveral poands
of litharge into  white of this Kind.
k has been strongly recompmended to paper::
 and others, who use water-colors in large quang
tities, to prepare their lakes, and the colors now pre-
pared of chalk, on the basis of the above precipitate
of lead.â€”For instance: if the color required be 
very fine one, suppose from cochingal, the coloring
Thatter is to be extracted by spirit of wine, without
heat. When the spirit is sufficiently impregnated,
It is to be poured by little and little upon the cals:
the spirit soon evaporates, and leaves the calx, co-
lored with the cochineal. More of the tincture  to be poured on, rubbing the mixture con-
stantly; and thus, by proper management, many
beautiful colors, not inferior to the best carmine,
may be prepared. When only  small quantity of
color, for the more exquisite touches of, the miniag
ture painter, is required, we would recommend the
process to be conducted on the basis of white precipi-
tate, or cale of tin, pursuing the same method of
rubbing in the coloring tincture as when whice pre-
cipitate of tead is used. If, instead of cochincal,
Brazil-wood, turmeric, legwood, exc. be substiruted,
different kinds of red, yellow, and purple, may be
produced.





 way of conclusion to this part of our Work, we
shall add some MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS, ex-
tracted from  small work by the late ingenious Mr.
RORERTSON; which being only distributed among
his private friends, and never published, is in few
hands: and being the result of the experience of
many artists, communicated to him, as well in Italy,
as in England, and written down by him, will, we
hope, be acceptable to our friends; as certainly many
of the ideas and hints are very good.

that means leares the greater brilliancy in the colors;

this will bear out and retain more force, delicacy,
and clearness, than any oil-painting whatever, and
will even last as long, and is also  method made use
of by some of the finest colorists in their best works.
It is of great importance in our first and second
painting, whether of flesh, drapery, landscape, &.
to paint only with earths, reserving the most clear
and brilliant colors for the last painting and glazings,
by which means  greater truth and force will always
be preserved in our works, and they will also last the
longer for it. It may reasonably be supposed, that

which will make them last and bear out the befter.
whilst, on the contrary, if earths are used upon the
clear and brilliant colors, the effect must be both
stull and heavy. Besides, if in dead or second co-
foring the finest and brightest tints are used, what
colors can be found to brighten or finish with 
The method used by Pietro Bianchi, who was 
very ingenious and general painter, and whose pic-
 still maintain  great clearness and freshness,
though done forty, fifty, or sixty yearsâ€”is this: he
took one half of drying oil, and the other half of
clear nut oil; these he mixed well together, and his
picture being dry, he rubbed (with  sponge of
brush) these ixed oils upon the pieture, leaving it
only damp therewith, after which he re-painted of
fe-touched


  at pleasure.) This method was given by
an old scholar of John Baptista Bougieuty who was
well acquainted with the said Prerso Branchi. The
same person also informed me, :that his own master,
Baptista Bougicur, made use of the thick white var-
nish sold in the color-shops for re-touching and re:
painting; but the consequence was, that, after some
years, all his pictures becarhe covered with  stuff
like  mildew, which after being cleaned off would



shortly-return.

Signior. Gaspar Scarmouchi, who is. also an
ingenious; man, and  scholar of Lucatelli; recoms
mends the use of poppy oil for according; re-touchs
ing, or re-painting  picture, which, he says; will

never change, and dries much sooner than nut;ous
The method of applying it is by letting the picture
be well dried, then rub, with  small sponge dipped
in the oil, the part of the painting; which you intend
to re-touch, after that spread the oil with the palm
of the hand, which will make the colors spread and


Work; very agreeably.
Mr. Andrews says, that, if you would unite, any
part of  picture in water colors; whether sky, face,
drapery, or any other part, you must wer the picture
on the back, with  clean sponge moderately, so as to
damp the colors, after which you may re-touch,
scumble, or re-paint, as often as you please, pro=
vided the size with which you mix your colors is
neither too weak nor too strong, and that the preture
be painted on an unprimed fine cloth of silk.â€” This

In order to prevent your colors from ever chang-
ing, and to maintain their original beauty; force, and
vigor, the cloth should be primed with peach-stone
black and whice; that us to say, the second going
over the cloth, or the last hand, as it is termed,
should be done with this black and white, and the
picture will maintain itself without the least danger.
According to Mr. West, when you intend to re-
paint, re-touch, or glaze your picture; let it first be
tolerably dry, then give the whole, or the part which
you intend to paint,  coat of varnish  day or two
before, after which you may mix some of the same
Farnish with the colors you put on, which will make
them bear out with great force and clearness, inso
much that there will not be the least occasion for
varnishing those parts when the whole is finished,
only covering the other parts that appear dull or


Sunk in.
According to Mr. Jenkins, when the varnish is
very dry on the pietare, the best method is to rub
on the part to be painted, or re-touched, &.  little
purified nut oil, which must be wiped clean off, so
as to leave only  little dampness on the place, which
assists the fresh colors in uniting with the old without

any sinking in.
Mastic, with ut oil, is very good for re-touching
to be used instead of the white varnish sold at the
color-shops.
For re-touching or bringing out pictures when
sunk in, take purified nut oil, and mix it with oil of
lavender
 in equal quanuties: rub it on the part, or,

it the part is too fresh, mx the oils, with the color
on the pallet, or dip the pencil in it.
This oil of

picture may be painted on, day after day, until it is.
finished, without the least inconveniency or bad
effect.

 fine glazing liquid for the more delicaty
parts of  pilture may; be thus made: first grind

the most delicate glaze that can possibly. be, and
which may he put on, any part of the picture;. it will

mellow it in the finest manner, without leaving the
least smuddled effect, or even the appearance of
being glazed at all.
The finest brown used by Mr. West in glazing is
the flesk of mummy; the most fleshy are the best
Partss the threads of the garments, or any dirt which
may prevent its grinding, must be murely cleared
 afterwhich: it must be ground up with nut oil
very fine; and may be mixed for glazing with ultra=
marifie, lake, blue, or any other glazing colors; when
 used,  little drying oil must be mixed with the
Farnish, without which it will be longer in drying,
which is the only defect it has, as it may be used in
any part of  picture without fear of its changing.
The
 finest brown next to that of mummy is the
Prussian blue burned, which is to be used in the
same manner for glazing as the former; with this
difference, from its being  better drier, there is no
occasion to use drying oil with the varnish. In some
respects, this has the advantage of the mummy,
being very little, if at all, inferior in point of color;
it dries better, is obtained with less difficulty, and


ground with greater ease.
 good glazing brown is made of gumbouge
burned; it is very similar in color to asppalrum, but
much inferior to the mummy, or blue.
To obtain  very lively and beautiful green, paint
the object, whether tree, drapery; &. quite:blue,
afterwards glaze it over with brown pink, which will
"  the wished-for effect.

The finest green may be produced by painting the
ground white, and glazing over it with verdigrease
 
mixed up with varnish.

  OIL is expressed from the seed of line or
Rax. It is the principal oil used in all Kinds: of
paintings, or, indeed; the only Kind,; except for
some very nice purposes, where: its brownhess ren-
ders it unfit The principal defects of linseed:oil
are these,  brown color,, and  slowness in drying
both of which are in  much greater degree. in some
Parcels than in otlrers, arising sometimes from an
accidental mixture of seeds growing with it, which
make it partake of the nature of olive oil, which can
nOt


( be brought to dry by any art or means whatever.
The excellence therefore of linseed oil consists in its
hear approach to  colorless state; and its soon drying.
With respect to the first quality, it may be distin-
guished by inspection only; but the second can only
be Known by trial, for there is no particularappearance,
of other immediately perceptible mark attending this
last quality. Linseed oil is in general used without
any other preparation than the mere mixture of it
with the proper dryer, but to keep it  considerable
time before it is used will always be found to im=
prove it. It is nevertheless used sometimes after it is
wrought into the state of drying oil (not to mix and
make other unprepared parcels dry) but alone, as the
sole vehicle of the colors. The convenience of this
is the speedy drying of the paint so composed; but
 cannot be practised when the beauty of the color
 of the least consequence; for, in this case; the
oil imparts  strong brown to the mixture.
NoT OIL is the oil of walnuts pressed out of the
Kernels by means of  screw-press; it is used for the
purpose of mixing with flake white, or other pis-
ments, where the clearness of the color is of great
consequence, and would be injured by the brownness
of linseed oil. It is used without any other prepara-
tion than keeping, which is ever found to improve it
with regard to iis color and quality of drying. The
adventitious faults of nut oil are turbidity, slowness
in drying, and not being perfectly colorless; inspec-
tion points out the first, but the remaining two must
be examined by trial: if, however, there is no adul-
teration in the case, time will generally cure it of all
defects.


( )
defects: Whoever would have nut oil perfectly
good should paal the skin of the Kernels before they
press them, for the skin contains an acidoil of  very

different hature from that, of the Kernel, and is ex-
tremely. subject to turn brown, or even black, and
consequently tinges the other when expressed with it.
PoPPy-erl is expressed from ripe seeds of poppies;
in the same manner as put oil from walnuts: its
qualities and uses, defects and remedies, are also
much the same; only when it is perfectly- good it is
much clearer, and will also dry better than the best
put oil.
Oils of SPIKE OF LAVENDER are essential, or dis=
killed oils, obtained by distilling spike, or any other
Eavender, with water. It is used in painting, only as
the vehicle for laying on the composition formed of
the flux, and colors in enamel painting, which its
fuidity renders capable of being worked with 
pencil, its volatile nature afterwards rendering it
wholly dry, without leaving any marter that might
affect the substances of the enamel, which an essen-
fial oil is only capable of. Oil of spike and lavender
is subject to be adulterated by the oil of rosemary.
