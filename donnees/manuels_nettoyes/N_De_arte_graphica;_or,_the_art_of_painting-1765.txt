Dryden had but caft his eyes on the Latin text, would be
have suffered this to have passd, the sense being, if the

ealy to those, who are content to pass over many places with
out understanding them. The copy,  am bold to say, will
afford some light even to persons converfant in the language,
but not the subject of the poem; and such will know alfo, that
this translation could not be done by the intermediation of
an interpreter, and will make some distinction between
barely understanding an author and theroughly feeling

For the poetry, it is  fort of idleness, to which  bace

many others infected in like manner with the Cacoethes
Leribendi, that it was as eafy to let alone as to make verfes.
But engaged in this work,  often wifh’ it was as casy to
make them, especially on so dry  subject, as to let it alone.

ever blaming the efforts of beneft men in this art, could cha-

Jcholars, or any thing, or even in their own professions, in-
fead of reprebending our want of them. But want of me-

  ES Alphonfo du Frefnoy was born
at Paris in the year  His father, who was
an eminent apothecary in that city, intending
him for the profeffion of phyfic, gave him as
good an education as poffible. During the firft year,
which he spent at the college, he made  very consider-
able progress in his fudies : but as foon as he was raifed
to the higher claffes, and began to contract  tate of
poetry, his genius for it open’ itfelf, and he carried all
the prizes in It, which were propoted to. excite the -
mulation of his fellow-ffudents. His inclination for it
was heightened by exercife; and his earlieft perfor-
mances thew’, that he was capable of becoming one
of the greateft poets of his age, if his love of painting,
which equally poffels’ him, had not divided his tune
and application. At laft he laid afide all thoughts of
the Rudy of phyfic, and declared abfolutely for that of
painting, notwithflanding the opposition of his parents,

who, by all kinds of feverity, endeavoured to divert him
from purfuing his paffion for that art, the proteffion of
which they unjuftly confidered in  very contemptible
light But the ftrength of his inclination defeating all
the meafures taken to fuppress it, he took the firft op-
portunity of cultivating his favourite ftudy.
He was nneteen or twenty years of age when he be-
gan to learn to defign under Francis Perier; and having
Ipent two years in the fchool of that painter, and of
Simon Vouet, he thought proper to take  journey into
Italy, where he arrived in the end of  or the be-
ginning of  he had, during his fludies, applied himfelf very
much to that of geometry, he began, upon his coming
to Rome, to paint landlkips, buildings, and antient
ruins. But for the firft two years of his refidence in
that city he had the utmoft difficulty to support himself,
being abandoned by his parents, who refented his hav-
ing rejected their advice in the choice of his profeftion;
and the little flock of money, which he had provided
before he left France, proving fcarce fufficient for the
expences of his journey to ltaly. Being deftitute there-
fore of friends and acquaintance at Rome, he was re-
due’ to fuch diftress, that his chief fubfiftence for the
greateft part of that time was bread and  small quantity
of cheefe. But he diverted the fenfe of his unealy cir-
cumftances by an intenfe and indefatigable application to
painting, till the arrival of the celebrated Peter Mignard,
who had been the companion of his fiudies under Vocict,
fet him more at eafe. They immediately engaged in the
Rricteff friendship, living together in the fame houle,
and being commonly known at Rome by the name of
the Inpparables. They were imploy’ by the cardinal
of Lyous in copying all the beft pieces in the Farnefe
Palace. But their principal ftudy was the Works of
Raphael


VI The LIF  of Mont. du Frefney.
Raphael and other great mafters, and the antiques; and
they were conftant in their attendance every evening at
the academy in defigning after models. Mignard had
the superior talents in practice : but du Frefnoy was 
greater mafter of the rules, hiffory, and theory of his
profeffion. They communicated to each other their
remarks and fentiments, du Frefnoy furnishing his friend
with noble and excellent ideas, and the latter instructing
the former to paint with greater expedition and eafe.
Poetry shard with painting the time and thoughts of
du Frefnoy, who, as he penetrated into the secrets of
the latter art, wrote down his observations, and having
at laft acquired  full knowledge of the subject, form’
 defign of writing  poem upon it, which he did not
finith till many years after, when he had confulted the
beft writers, and examined with the utmoft care the
moft admird pictures in Italy.
While he refided there he painted feveral pictures,
particularly the Rums of the Campo Vaccino, with the
city of Rome in the figure of  woman;  young wo-
man of Athens going to fee the monument of  lover;
SEneas carrying his father to his tomb; Mars finding La.
vinia fleeping on the banks of the Tyber, defcending
from his chariot, and lifting up the veil, which cover’
her, which is one of his beft pieces; the birth of Venus;
and that of Cupid. He had  peculiar efteem for the
Works of Titian, feveral of which he copied, imi-
tating that excellent painter in his colouring, as he did
Carrache in his defigns.
About the year  he went with Mignard to Ve-
 and travell’ throughout Lombardy; and during
His

his Hay in that city painted  Venus for Signor Mark
Paruca,  noble Venetian, and  Madonna, an half
length.
Thefe pictures thew’, that he had not
ftudied thofe of Titian without fuccess. Here the two
friends feparated, Mignard returning to Rome, and du
Frefnoy to France. He had read his poem to the beft
painters in all places, thro' which he pass’, and parti-
cularly to Albano and Guereino then at Bologna; and
he confulted feveral men famous for their skill in polite
literature.
He arrived at Paris in  where he lodged with
Monf. Potel, Greffier of the council, in the street Beau-
treillis, where he painted  small room; afterwards  pic-
ture for the altar of the church of St. Margaret in the fub-
urb St. Antoine. Monl. Bordier, intendant of the finances,
who was then finithing his houfe of Rince, now Livry,
having feen this picture, was to highly pleas’ with it,
that he took du Frefnoy to that houfe, which is but two
leagues from Paris, to paint the falon. In the ceiling was
reprefented the burning of Troy; Venus is flanding by
Paris, who makes her remark how the fire confumes
that great city; in the front is the god of the river, which
runs by it, and other deities : this is one of his beft per-
formances, both for difposition and colouring. He af-
terwards painted  confiderable number of pictures for the
cabinets of the curious, particularly an altar-piece for
the church of Lagni, reprefenting the affumption of the
virgin and the twelve apoftles, all as large as life. At
the hotel  Erval (now  Armenonville) he painted fe
veral pictures, and among them  ceiling of  room with
four beautifullandskins, the figures of which were by vlig
nard. As he underffood architecture very well, he drew
for Monf. de Vilargeic all he defigns of  houfe, which
that gentleman built four leagues from Avignon; as like-
wife those for the hotel de Lyonne, and for that of the
grand

grand prior de Souvre. The high altar of the Filles
Dieu in the Street St. Denis was alfo defign’ by him.
Tho he had finish’ his poem before he had left ltaly,
and communicated it, as has been already mention’, to
the left judges of that country; yet after his return to
France, he continued ftill to revife it, with  view to
treat more at length of some things, which did not feem
to him fufficiently explain’. This employment took up
no fnall part of his ume, and was the reafon of his not
having finithed to many pictures as he might otherwife
have done. And tho' he was defirous to fee his work in
print, he thought it improper topublith it without  French
tranflation, which he deferd undertaking from time to
time out of diffidence of his own skill in his native lan-
guage, which he had in some meature loft by his lone
refidence in Italy. Monl. de Piles was therefore at laft
induced, at his defire, and by the merit of the poem, to
tranllate it into French, his verfion being revifed by du
Frefnoy himself. And the latter had begun  commen-
tary upon it, when he was feiz’ with  palfy, and after
languithing four or five months under it, died at the
houfe of one of his brothers at Villiers-le-bel, four leagues
from Paris, in  at the age of fifty-four, and was
interr’ in the parith church there. He had quitted his
lodgings at Monl. Potels upon Mignard' return to Paris
in  and the two friends lived together from that
time till the death of du Frefnoy.
His poem was not publish’ till three years after his
death, when it was printed at Paris in  with the
French verfion and remarks of Monl. de Piles; and has
been juftly admird for its elegance, and perfpicuity.

os of his crimes has excited in us, adds &tuch in Painting are the warts

duty, Mr. Dryten had converted with Raphael, Corregio, the Carracbes or their
icholars, Pouffin, Le Seur, or Carle Marat, he would have had other concepti-
ons of the art, or if he had had alfo  proper intelligence of the author,
that lay before him.
However, the love of nature, one common principle, infpires in both
theie arts; and whether the little Painter, impelled by his imitative genins,
fcrawls what he fees, or the infant Poetbreathes his impaffion’ mind in
artless numbers, it is the same object Hill; and if the means were equally
cafy, the purfuit would be alike continued. The mother, the nurfe, the play-
fellow furnish language; but the imitation of objects requires time and in-
itruction. Verfe-making is practiced without  matter, by genius only; but
drawing, even with one, is hard and laborious: this exercites his talent with
facility, the other with pain finds his inability, and at length gives it ip.

Nok need  the Picrian choir invoke,
Or on Apollo call to swell the strain,
And grace with founding elegance my verfe,
To rules ill-fuiting; clearnels my fole aim.
For ornaments with precepts ill agree,
Their end and purpofe only to be taught.
Nok is it my intent to check, or stay
 artiff' hand, which ufe alone directs,
By  huge heap of rules; to bound, perplex’,
His fancy fails, his native fire is quench’;
But to aid him with knowledge, by degrees
His mind to ftrengthning, capable of truth,
That fcrence may itfelf with genius blend,
 with fcience; practice make them one.
FIRST,

dawned, then Greece where thofe foundations of fcience were laid, which
extift at this day, Rome continued what the had eftablifhed.
The effects were in Greece, that men of genius mutually affifting each
other, raifed human nature almoff above itfelf. Liberty, philofophy and va-
lour never were more confficuous and that small number of people, fcanty
tract of land, and thort space of time, have yielded more benefit and glory
to mankind, than the mighty Affrian and Perfian monarchies; mere names
to us, while we reap hourly folid advantage and pleature from thofe.
The perfons, who promored thefe arts, or were imployed in them, were
the firft of mankind. The greateft philofopher, Secrates, was  fculptor. The
moftrapid conqueror was  patron of, and had  perfonal friendshipfor Spolles.
The beft men, the moft important of the antients, have left us fuch reffi-
monies in their writings, as fufficiently evince their effimation of it.
How pleafing mull it have been to  people form’ as well to tafe as to
produce fine things, when thofe admirable fculptures, which yet remain.
came warm from the chiffel, and thole celebrated pictures now lolt, and of
which we can form no idea, appeared  What converfation among such statef-
men, generals, philofophers, poets, painters, fculptors, architeds! Every
thing mult have been adequare and refined to the higheft degree of rational
unjoyment.
But now let us change the feene, and tarn oureyes on thofe times and places,
where no arts fournh’. There immerted in ignorance, unaquainted with the
proper exercife of reafon, forming nothing but abfurd and rude notions of the
deity, ignorant of natural rights; fubmitting, and flaves to the lawlefs will of

mulating wickedness, heaping mifery, luft the entertainment, ambition the
purfuit and violent death the end; the country walte, barren, the people
dejected, retaining the form, bur loff to all the comforts of humanity.
Such is the prefent state of some countries ffored by providence with
vaft natural bleffings; and the same caufes we may infer ever have, and
ever will produce the same effects.
Let us look among the wild trabs, the wandring Tartars, or the fa-
vages of America,  ftraggling vagrant people, who prey, fight and pro-
create in common with other animals, roaming about in small parties,
full of horrible superftitions, bufied in revenges, and delighted with put-
ting their enemies to the moft excrutiating deaths.
Whence that good order fo confpicuous in the great cities of Enrope, par-
ticularly in this, where near  million of people live in perfect harmony
with the moft oppofite interefts, opinions and inclinations. What could effect
this miracle but employment ? What fuftem of government fufficient, were
they idle; or what employ them but things, which regarding our national ne-
ceflities (to good is previdence) might be fpared ? Such are the productions of
art; and they do not only employ men, but divert their paffions. Ambition is
innocent, when it puts men on excelling in an art. Avarice is profitable to
the publick, when it induces men to earn and deferve better, in order to en-
grots cuffom. The pastion moll apt to miflead is fubdued by labour it leaves
either time nor spirits for adventure; marriage is thought of;  healthy race
chriches the publick, and extends it felf to pofterity.
Eivery workshop is  lutle fyftem of government, and renders men more
tibfervient to the greater; mischievous tempers are bound down by carious
kinds of attention; and he, who would fir up  rebellion, propagate 
ralfe religion, or otherwife diffurb the peace of  flate, is perhaps condem-
iod, from Ex to fix, to pore on some curious piece of difficult mechaiim.

FiksT, chief, and moft important is, to know

ideas than by Pictures, and fuch other forms as had  known fignification.
Ir muft neceffarily therefore have been their care, in order to arord mittakes
in publick records, laws, (Gc. to have had the objects to fartruely delincared,
as that one thing should not be taken for another;  horfe for  dog,

plying to the real objects, and comparing the reprefentations with the things
to be reprefented; to correcing them, ifneed were, as to leave nothing im-
perfect that might render the fenfe dubious of what they intended to express.
Hence  think, with great probability we may conceive imitation arofe
and what dexterity prattice might give, and how it would by gradation con-
finue advancing itfelf, till men of reffection and fcience, luch as were the
Greeks, tranfplanting it, made it their fudy, and raifed it to the urmoft degree

antients excelled the moderns in Painting, yet  think it will fcarce admit
 conteff; for Sculpture and Painting having ever kept an equal pace, as we
muff own their fuperiority in one art,  think, according to this Known truth,
there can be little reafon for denying it in the other.  may be alfo allowed
without prejudice to the moderns, or imputasion on them as wancing abiliries;
for let it be considered, that their gods, which were innumerable, all pait
thro the rculptors hands; that their illutrious men and heroes alto fought
 kind of immortality from them; that fames were decreed as rewards, and
medals ftruck, by publick order, not on great occitions, or to great per-
fons only, but to all fach as remarkably dillinguisked themfelves, or did ary
eminent fervice to the late. The boy plucking the thorn from his foot, the
Knife-grinder, the mother enquiring of her fon what was done in the fenae,
are intlances on what occafions the arts were called in : the itland of Rictes
alone is faid to have had thirty thouland molt rare ftatues in it; what num-
hers mull Rome, olitens, Cerinth, then have contained; or any of thote
places where the arts ffourithed, or were eitcemed ? From hence we
may judge what  prodigious employ there was, and conclude, that
tuch an immenfe prattice would awaken, roufe and put in action, thote
noble faculties, which languith, he dormant in mankind, and are loft for

IN Egypt firft, this art, found formless, rude,
The Greeks, with ftudy, nervous fenfe, improv’,
And to at length matur’ that nature feem’,
 their great mafters wondrous skill furpass’,
THESE of their (chools were held in moft efteem,
The Athenian, thofe of Sycion, Corinth, Rhodes,
Nor much unequal, or in choice, or file,
As yet from antient ftatues we may judge;
 churches abroad are the only props, to what of art can exift .
mong the moderns; but here, in this country, notwithstanding the wild
walle of expence, and the vaft profution, which for some years palt hath been
laid oar in buildings, Painting, their nobleft ornament, has had no share;
by Painting  mean Hillory-Painting. The five orders only have engroffed
all.

It is certain, that an elegant choice of objects,  fine disposition of them,
with  judicious handling, the refult of an elevated genius, juft reafoning
and long practice, prefent us with beauties, we were not aware of. Agree-
ments and harmonious affemblages, that firike and furprize us, and fuch as
the dull thoughtlefs mere imitator never dream’ of, but that nature
is then excelled, or can be, no one who has ever fiudied, or been truly at-
rentive to its beauties,  hope will allow.  regard not the affertions of
ignorant enchufiatts, who like thofe in religion ever confound truth with
abturdiries. What Mr. Pope has faid, with respect to poetry, holds alfo
true in this art,
Tis netere all, but nature methodized.
The beft aniques are moff fcrupulous imitations of it; nor can we per-
ceive that the anrients artifls dared to deviate from it, or that they took any
liberties: all was warranted by it; nothing done on their own authorifi, for
that becomes manner, the effect of ignorance, floth, and fuch  felf-fuffi-
cience as deserves contempt.
When people talk of mending nature, they should be confidered as per-
sons who have but  very fuperticial knowledge of it. Thefe nature-menders
are of the same species with thofe, who cat off the ears of dogs, and cats, and
dock hories tails, marring thereby the divine workmanship in the form,
and its goodnets to the animal, by depriving it of that ate the pait was
intended for.

repetitions of the same forms feen together, pall, diffult the fight; they mult

of  rofe tree, except in fize, differ not, but are all of the same shape, yet by the
various turns and direction of them, make very different quantities in
their reprefentations; one is feen full and frenting, another shortened, and-
ther fide-ways; one perks up, another finks, all vary.
Nature is fo fond of variery, that in  pavement of real (quares, not one ap-

only leave their true form, but every (quare varies in its appearance from
the next to it, and one and all from each other, except  line of any of
them be perpendicular to the eye, and the point of fight be in the centre of
the picture, then one fide only has this variation.
The leffening of objects alfo, as they remove from us, is  thing in
nature that gives vall variety; thus in the profile of  building, all the
lines feemingly tend to the horizon, and give us  graceful diverfity; for
tho the diffant part of the building is as high as the near, yet not appearing

the difficulty lay only in dividing one with  Hill lefs, who can believe 
Were this the fact, they could not have been feen at any diftance; yet the

Afelles inatch’ up  Pencil, in order to give fuch  specimen of tranfcendent

without which many objects cannot be reprefented ar ail, and is to far from

Architedure, and all forms terminated by right lines are exntirely repre-

beurdaries of all other objects, whether ia.viire.. mi:ed, or multiform,
may be to determined, tho' the interredace parts be tippiied, and the figures

It is to be regretted that our author did not accomplith his intentions; and,
after having given us fundamental principles of the art, branched and en
larged on the particulars part by part, especially if he had done it with the
prescription he fets to himfelf, and avoided too great an enumeration of
rules; for maxims not concife enough for the memory produce litle. Very

Let such teach otbers who themfelves excell.
