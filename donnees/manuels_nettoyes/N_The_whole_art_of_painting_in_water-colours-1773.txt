which has been encouraged by the Inhabitants
of Palaces eminent for their Titles, but more emi-
nent for their Virtues; and no Wonder, fince no

WHITES.
 beft White for painting in Water Colours,
is Flake White: But fome recommend  White
made of Pearl and Oyfter-Shells, brought to an im-
palpable Powder: This is called  Pearl White, an
If you ufe Whit
vill mix well with any Colour.
Lead, clarify it with White Wine Vinegar; an
after the White is fettled, pour off the Vinegar, an
 it with Water. The Method of wathing it
is thus: Put the Powder into  Glats of Water, Hir
it abeut, and prefently pour the Water off while it
is white, into another clean Glafs, and when it is
fettled pour off the Water,, and you will have an ex-
cellent White, to which add as much Gum, as is
neceffary to give it  Gloss.
It has been often neticed that White Lead will
turn black, if mixed with Water that comes from
Iron or Clay; to that in the Space of  Month of
two, you may perceive it, and it will alfo change
any Colour, with which it is mixed.
It is recommended by some to take the Powder of
Egg-Shells, of the brighteft and whiteff Sort: Let it
be well ground with Gum-Water, to the State of
an impalpable Powder, to which you may add one
twentieth Part of White Sugar-candy, and then
ufe it; though others efteem it moft when clarified
in Spirits of Wine, and then ufe it with Gum-
Water.
It has been found by repeated Experience, that
this Egg-fhell Powder is extremely ferviceable as 
White in Water-Colours, and that this, and the
Oyfter-shell Powder rectified, and well bruifed, will
make an excellent Mixture with other Colours, and
will keep them from changing.
 fine White for Water-Colours may be made by
diffolving Filings of Silver, or Silver Leaf, in Aqua
Fortis. Then evaporating the Aqua Fortis, till it
appears like Chryffal in the Bottom of the Glals:
Decant the other Part of the Aqua Fortis, and wath
the Silver four or five Times in pure Water, till it is
entirely cleaned from the Aqua Fortis, which may
be known by tafting it; then dry it for Ufe. It
muft be ufed with the Waters of Gum and Sugar-
Candy.
 make  good WHTTE for Water-Colours proper for
Miniature.
Take  Pound of the Shreddings of Glovers Lea-
ther, and let them steep in Water, and boil them in
 Kettle with twelve Cuarts of Water, till it shrinks
to two; then ffrain it through  Linen Cloth, into
 well-glazed earthen Pan: This is called Glue
or Size; and to know if this be firong enough,
when it has got its Confiffence, feel if it is ffiff and
firm under your Hland.
The Glue being made, reduce fome White Chalk
to  Powder; then melt the Glue, and while it is
Hot, add fuch  Quantity of Chalk, as will bring it
to the Confiftency of  Pafte; then letting it fteep
warter of an Hour, ftir it with  Brufh
for  
made of Hog' Briftles.
Then, in order to make this White brighter, add
more Glue, for the firft or second Lay; this muft
be applied, by beating it with the End of  Bruth.
Be careful to obferve that every Layer be dry, be-
fore you puton another. If you work upon Wood,
you muft put on  Dozen; but fix or feven is fuffi-
cient, if your Paper is thick. When this is done,
dip  foft Bruth in fome Water; then draining it
with your Fingers, rub the Work with it, in order
to make it the fmoother. When your Bruth is full
of Whice, you muft wath it again, and alfo change
the Water, when it is too white. Or you may ufe
 wet Linen Rag inflead of  Brush.
Of XELLows.
In Come Objects, there may be feen  fhining like
that of Gold, through Colours of Red, Blue, or
GGreen, fuch as fome Sort of Flies, or Beerles, and
the Cantharides. This Gold Tranfparency may be
very well imitated, by laying fome Leaf-Gold on
the


 shaded Side of the Drawing, giving  little to the
light Side. To lay on the Gold Leaf, press it
fmooth and clofe with Cotton, after you have
wathed it with ffrong Gum-Water. But in this
Part of the Performance, care muft be taken that
in laying on the Gum, you do not exceed the Li-
mits, through which you would have the Gold ap-
pear. In this Cafe, the Gold is only to thine
through the tranfparent Colour, which is to be laid
Over it.
As Leaf Gold will not receive Water-Colours re-
gularly, it is neceffary that the Student should be
prepared with Water of Ox-Gall, and with this Li-
quor to Htroke over the GGold Leaf; by which means
it will receive any Colour you are defirous of laying
over it, and will alfo retain it. The Reds may be
Lake, or Carmine; the Purples, Lake, and fine In-
digo. The Greens, Verdigreafe, or Sap-Green;
and for the Blues, Indigo on the dark Side, and 
little Ultramarine on the Light (all which Colours
shall be defcribed in their proper Places).
In June and July, there may be found upon Rofe-
Trees,  Kind of Beatle, of  Gold and Crreen Co-
lour, which may prove extremely serviceable in this
Kind of Painting; but in ufing your Gold, it will be
beft to polish it, which may be done after the follow-
ing Directions.
In some Manuscripts there may be feen Gold Let.
ters, which feem to rife above the Surface of the
Paper. The Compofition which raifes them thus,
is made of Vermilion, and the White of an Egg,
beat to the Confiffence of an Oil, and then fixed to
the Paper with Gum Arabic: On this figurative
Letter, wath fome ffrong Gum-Water, with 
Camel’ Hair Pencil; then lay on the Gold Leaf,
clofe with fome Cotton, and when it is dry, rub it
 with Cotton, and burnish it with  Dog'
Toothy

 and it will by this Means appear as if it
was really caft in Gold.
There is alfo another Way of working in Gold,
which is performed by Shell-Gold (but then it muft
be pure, and not that brought from Germany,
which turns green in  few Days). You muft cover
the fhady Parts with Vermilion, before you ufe this
Gold; and when you have rectified it with Spirits of
Wine, lay it on, and when dry, burnith it as be-
fore directed.
In laying on this Gold, it is beft to leave the
Lights without it, as it will appear to  much greater
Advantage, than if all the Object was covered : But
providing the whole Performance should chance to

be covered, the beft Way of fetting it off, is to trace
over the fhady Parts with Gall-ftone, or the Fellow
made of French Berries (of which we shall treat
hereafter) and heightened with Minium.
Having treated thus much upon Gold, we shall
ow peak of Fellows in general. Gamboge is, be-
youd Doubt, one of the melloweff Colours Nature
has produced : it is of fo mild  Temperature, that
when it is touched with any Fluid, it inflantancoufty
diffolves; to that confequently it wants neither
summing nor grinding: It is productive of  Va
riety of the moft agreeable and pleafant Vellow
Pints, that Fancy or Art could ever imagine; it
wrill generally shade itfelf; though you will fome-
times find in the Description of Flowers it requires
Help.
Gall-Rone is  very rich deep Yellow, tending to
wards  Brown: it is exceeding ufeful in many
Lafes, and the Painters hold it in great Effeem; it
reeds but little gumming
or grinding,: it works
free, but will not shade itfelf.
We have  Recipe for making the following Yel-
low from Mr. Boyle, who fays, that if you cut the
Roots





Roots of Barberries, and put them into  frong
Lixivium made of Pearl—Affies and Water, from

them will proceed  very agreeable Vellow: This
Experiment has often been made, and as often at-

tended with Success,
He alfo gives an Account of another fine trant-
parent Fellow, made by boiling the Root of 
Mulberry-Tree, well cleanfed; in the foregoing
Lixivium. This will produce  yellowith Juice,
from which  Liquor much deeper than the former
may be extracted.
Fellow Oker makes  very good Pale Yellow; and
being ground with Gum-Water, will prove ex-
tremely ufeful.
Another very ufeful Vellow, may be made by in-
fuling the Plant Celandine in clear Water, and
gently preffing it, and adding to the Liquor some
Allum-
Water, and then let it boil.
The Virtues of the Yellow made of French Ber-
ries is fo well known; that we need not difcourfe
upon it, but only give the Student the following

Directions for preparing it.
Quart of the preceding Lixivium, boil two.
In   of French Berries till the Liquor is of  fine
Fellow; then ffrain it from the Yellow Berries,
and when it is cold it is fit for Ufc. Then to the
Berries put  Pint of the fame Lixivium, and boil it
till the Liquor is as ffrong as Gall-ftones, with which
you may shade any Yellows: This you may boil
till it comes to  Brown, and will, with the Addition
of  little Ox-Gall, ferve to shade the Gold Leaf.
You may likewife make  Yellow, by infufing
Saffron in pure Water, which produces  bright Rich
Fellow. When this is ffeeped in rectified spirits of
Wine, there is nothing higher; but it is very apt to
Hy, unless it is high gummed.
  good Yellow for the Illumination of Prints may
be extracted from the Roots of Ginger, which makes
 good Green, when mixed with tranfparent, Verdi-
greafe.
Thofe Yellows, called English and Dutch Pinks,
are made with French Berries ground to  fine Pow-
der, and then boiled.

OF ORANCE COLOUR.

This Colour is made of  Mixture of Vermilion
and Gamboge; the latter moft predominant; in
which you are prefented with  pleafant and service-
able Colour in painting Lillies, and all other Orange-
Colour Flowers. What induced us to introduce this
Colour, was to encourage thofe Young! Beginners,
who may have grown weary of working in Red Lead,
that they may divert themfelves with this foft, eaty,
and agreeable Colour, as they will find no Difficulty
in the uting it, and it will reprefent the Flowers in

the moft lively Manner imaginable.





Of REDS.

As Minium, or Red Lead, is  ftrong heavy Co-
Jour, Mr. Boyle has given us the following Direc-
sions for preparing it : Put four Ounces of this Co=
Your in  Glals, to  Quart of Rain-Water, and
when it has been thoroughly firred, pour off the
Water; and by  frequent Repetition of this, there
vill remain at the Bottom of the Glass  beautiful
ed when it is dry, which is to be ufed with Crum-
Water. When the Colour has been thus prepared,
you muft not expect above twenty Grains to remain
out of four Ounces.
Carmine affords the brighteff and moft perfect
Crimfon, and is the moft beautiful of all Reds; for
with


 this Colour and Lake you may make the Shades
as frong as you pleafe. But we think it neceffary
to inform the Student, that this Colour should never
be purchafed but by Day-light; for if it is not good,
it will but fpoil your Work.
Lake is  fine Tranfparent Colour, not much in-
ferior to Carmine: but in painting with Carmine on
that Part of the Print, on which the Light is fup-
poted to ftrike, you muft lay on to light  Tint, as
is fcarce vifible, working it fironger as it grows
darker, and touch it in the darker Parts with Lake.
Lake may be bought at moft Colour(hops ready
prepared in Shells for Water-Colours But if you are
lefirous of making it yourfelf, it is neceftary to ad-
here to the following Directions.
Having prepared  Lixivium made with the Afhes
of Vine-Tvigs, to three Pints of it, add  Pound of
he beft Ground Brazil Wood, and boil it till half
he Lixivium is evaporated, and then ftrain it. off,
which being done; boil it again with the Addition of
our Ounces of freth Brazil Wood, two Ounces of
Cochineal, half an Ounce of Terra Marita, and  of fair Water, and let it evaporate as before:
Then add half an Ounce of calcined Allum (re-
luced to an impalpable Powder) and  Quarter of 
Drachim of Arfenic. Diffolve them in it, by ffirring
 with  Stick, and when it is fettled ftrain it off.
To give this  Body, reduce two Cuttle-fith Bones
  Powder, and putting it in; let it dry leifurely.
Then grind it in  Quanrity of fair Water, in
which you may let it ffeep: Then ftraining it through
Cloth, and making it into  few Cakes, fet it by
or Vfe, after drying it on  Piece of Marble.
If you would have this Lake redder, add fome of
he Juice of  Lemon; and to make it deeper, add
Dil of Tartar.
Another


 Lake may be made in the following Man-
her: Boil the Shreds of fuperfine Scarlet Cloth in  made of the Afhes of burnt Tartar, and when
it has fufficiently boiled add fome Cochineal, pow-
dered Maftich, and Roch—Allum; and then boil this
Composition again; and while it is quite het, ftrain


 imes. The firft Time, the
it thro'  bag feveral
Bag muft be ffrained from Top to Bottom, and the
remaining grofs Matter being taken out, let the Bap
be well wathed; after this, ftrain the Liquor thro
the Bag again, and you will find  Pafte remaining
on the sides, which you may divide into fmall Cakes,
and fet it by for ufe.
To make another Lake: Steep four Ounces of the
beft Brazil Wood in  Pint and  Half of the fineft
diftilled Vinegar, for three Weeks at leall, tho' the
Longer it remains the better it is; after which feethe
the Whole in Balneum Marie, till it boils up three or
four Times; then let it fettle for  Day or two, after
which put to it an Ounce of powdered Allum, and
put it into  clean Pan with the Liquor, and let it
remain fo for twenty-four Hours; then heat the Com-
pofition, and fir it till it is cold; and when it has
food about twelve Hours, frain it, and add two
Cuttle-fith Bones, prepared as before.
But  liquid Colour of  very good Crimfon may
be made as follows. In twelve Ounces of pale ffale
Beer, boil one Ounce of ground Brazil Wood (which
may be had at moft Druggifts) till the Colour is as
frong as you defire; then ftrain it thro'  Linen
Cloth, and bottle it up for ufe. If you want to

bring this Colour to  Body, take fome dried Ox
blood reduced to  Powder, and mix it with the
Colour.
We have the following Directions from Mr. Boyle,
for extracting  fine Crimfon from the Berry-bearing
Spinach, which being preffed, affords  very agree-
able


I Juice; to which add  fourth Part of Allum,
Doil it, and when it is cold it is fit for ufe.
Or you may extract  very beautiful Red, from

the Red Beat-root, baked with  little ffrong Vine-
gar and Allum, and when it is cold it is fit for
ife.
Another way to make  Crimfon Put twenty (or
more) Grains of bruifed Cochineal into  Gallipot,
with as many Drops of the Ley of Tartar, as will
make it give forth its Colour, and then immediately
add to this Mixture about Half  Spoonful of Water,
or more, and you will have  very agreeable Purple;
then reducing fome Allum to  very fine Powder,
put it to the Purple Liquor, and you will have as
beautiful  Crimfon: ftrain it thro'  fine Cloth, and
ufe it as foon as poffible; for tho' this is  Colour
which if foon ufed looks extremely well, yer by
long flanding is subject to decay.
Of PURPLES in General.
To Extratt  Purple from Legweed.
Take of Logwood eight Ounces, to which add 
Pint of Rain-Water, and an Ounce of Allum, and
let it be well infufed over  flow Fire in  well-glazed
Pan, or Pipkin, for about twenty-four Hours; then
add to it  Quarter of an Ounce of Cum Arabic;
let it fand for  Week, and ffrain it thro'  Piece of
fine Cloth. Keep it clofe, or it will mould.
Or vou may make  redder Purple by adding to
one Ounce of the above, four Ounces of Brazil
Wood, and  Pint of Htale Beer, and boiling it till
the Liquer is as ftrong as you defire. It may be
made darker by adding more Logwood.

Tho' the richeft Purple is made by blending Car-
mine and Pruffian Blue, or Indico, to what Shade
you pleafe.
Of



 BivEs.
 the Ultramarine is the beft and brighteff Blue,
we shall begin with its Temperature. The Method
of preparing it is by divefting the Lapis Lazuli of its
Gold, and reducing it to the State of an impalpable
Powder, which muft be done as follows: Heat fix
Ounces of the Lapis Lazuli till it is red; cool it in

Rrong
Vinegar, and grind it with  Stone and Mul-
ler, prepared for that Purpofe; then make  Com-
poficion of Bees-Wax, Rofin, Linfeed Oil, and
Purpentine, of each three Ounces; incorporate the
Whole together over  flow Fire, till it is near boil-
ing, and then pour them into  Pan well glazed.
This is called the Pafte of UUltramarine. The Lapis
Tuantity
Lazuli being prepared, add to it an equal 
of the Paftil, or Pafte; mix them together thorough-
ly, and let them remain twelve Hours; and to ex
tract the Ultramarine from the Pafte, pour clear
Water upon it, and prefting the Pafte with your
Hands, the UUltramarine will come out; for the Re-
ception of which, place  Glass Tumbler, (or what
you chufe) under your Hland, and let it fettle in this
Water till the Ultramarine finks to the Bottom.
If your Colour feems foul, you may cleanfe it
thus: Diffolve fome Tartar in Water, and add as
much of it to the Ultramarine as will cover it; in
which let it fland for twelve Hours; then wath it in
warm Water, and you will have your Colour well
clarified and perfectly clean. Let your Ultramarine
be of  high Colour, and care muft be taken that it
be well ground. Next to Ultramarine in Beauty is
Pruffian Blue, when ufed in Oil, tho' it will not
sand fo long,
on account of its not having the
Body of the Ultramarine. The Pruffian Blue does
hot grind Kindly with Water, on account of its oily
Subftance.
Blue


  Bice is  Colour of  very good Body, and
fows very agreeably in the Pencil; but it muft be
wathed according to the Rules laid down for UI-
framarine.
Blue Verditer is  very bright pleafant Blue, of 
good Body, and works very well when ground with
Gum-Water. It is  little inclinable to  Green,
and makes  very good one, when ground with
Gamboge, or French Berries. This Blue is moftly
ufed for  Sky, or Garment.
Saunders Blue is extremely serviceable in the Shad-
ing of Ultramarine, where no very dark Shades ap-
pear, which when they do, you may add  little
Indigo to it.
The Lirmas is  very agreeable Blue, and may be
had at moft Druggifts; the following Direction for
preparing it we have of Mrs. Mariana, (as it cannot
be bought ready prepared for Water- Colours.) Take
 Quart of Small Beer Wort, in which boil two
Ounces of Litmus, till the Colour is as flrong as
you require; then pour the Liquor into  glazed
Pipkin, and it will foon congeal.
Indigo is the darkeft Blue, is  foft free Colour,
and runs very warm in the Pencil; it requires to be
well wathed and ground, and may be made darker or
lighter by the Addirion of more or less Gum-Water.
Care is required in the ufing this Colour; for, as we
before hinted, its running to free may be  means of
deceiving the Student, and it may prove too dark
for the Completion of his Defires.
Mr. Boyle has given us the following Directions
for making  very fine Colour of the blue Leaves of
Rue, by preffing and bruifing the Leaves, and in
fufing both Leaves and Juice in pure Water, for
about  Fortnight, wathing them every Day; and
then incorporate them and the Warer, till they be-
come  Pulp, and let them dry gradually.
Thele


 will produce an excellent Blue for Shadine
 has  good Body, and runs free in the Pencil;
with this you should mix the Powder of Crum Arabic,
which will be  means of making it keep; and add
of the Gum as much as you would have it more of
lefs ffiff in working.
 fine tranfparent Blue, (from the preceding
Author) equal to  Tint of UUltramarine.—The
Flower from which this Blue is chieffy extracted is
the Cyanus, or Blue Cornbottle, which is poffeffed
of two Blues in the outer and inner Leaves; the
firft of which is light, the other dark, and is held
in preference, which should be picked from the But-
tons and Cafes in which they grow, as alfo from the
outer Leaves, the fame Day they were gathered.
thefe middle
Having prepared  Quantity of
Leaves, prefs out as much Juice as poffible, and with
the Addition of  little Allum, you will be poffeffed
of  fine, durable, tranfparent Blue, little inferior to
Ultramarine.
The procuring of the Flowers, and the preffure of
the Juice, should be done with all poffible Expedi-
tion, left the Flowers should lofe of their Perfection.
It has been thought by fome, that if the Leaves
of thefe Flowers were cured as thofe of Saffron;
there would proceed from them  much greater
quantity of Colour, from which might be preffed
more Tincture, than when freth from the Field.
In the curing of which it would appear, that
each Time the Cake was turned, the Flowers would
be darker, till they became  dark Blue. Great
care is required during this Operation, that the Fire
be kept very conftant and gentle, that the Flowers
may not be fcorched, which will be an inconteftable
Way of bringing the Flowers to Perfection.
Therefore to put this Operation in Execution,  muft be procured, as for curing Saffron; the
Top


 of which is to be covered with Hair Cloth,
upon this lay feveral Sheets of Paper, afterwards 
Parcel of the inner Leaves of the Flower, two or
three Inches thick, prefting them clofe, and sprinkle-
ing them with Gum Water; after which,  small
Charcoal Fire muft be made in the Kiln, to as to
communicate Heat to the Top. Then cover the
Cake with  few Sheets of Paper, and  Board with
 fmall Weight upon it; then after  few Minutes
the Cake is to be turned, and when it is placed, take
off the upper Papers, and fprinkle the Cake again
with Grum-Water, and then lay on the Board 
Weight, as before, for  few Minutes; and to re-
peat the Turning and Sprinkling feveral Times, till
the Cake is united, and of the Thickness of  Cake
of Saffron.
For further Particulars, which we think neceltary,
we refer our Readers to  Treatife on curing Saffron,
made public by Mr. Bradly, in his Monthly Account
of Hufbandry and Gardening.
Of BLACES.
The proper Blacks for Water-Colours are as fol-
low Ivory Black, which is to be prepared in the
following Manner. Let the lvory Black be tho-
roughly ground, and there will proceed from it 
Liquor of an Oily Substance; mix as much of which
in the lvory Black, as will make it work freely in
the Pencil. It has  fine Crlofs, and is extremely
serviceable in painting of fhining Objects.
There is another very agreeable and ufeful Black
called Keating' Black, and may be had at most Co-
four-fhops ready prepared for Water-Colours.
Indian Ink is  very good Black, and of great
Service, as it may be laid on to any Shade, and will
 (hade itfelf; on which account it is often ufed
for Drawings.
Of GREENS.
Sap-Green is  Colour extremely serviceable, and
is the beft Green for Water-Colours our Age affords;
it being of fo gummy  Subftance, is  great Re-
commendation, and its dilating fo eafily in Water;
besides this produces an infinite Variety of Tints, and
has the Advantage of fhading itfelf. In the Purcha
fing this Colour, remember to obferve that it looks
very black and bright.
 Sea or Artificial Green may be made, by mixss
ing Indigo and Sap-Green, which may be made
darker or lighter by adding more or less Indigo: It
is  very serviceable Colour,, very eafily worked, and
is productive of many Tints. Let your Judgment
direct you to fuch as are neceffary in your Perform-
ance. This Colour, as well as Sap-Green, shades
itfelf. Be careful that your Indigo is well ground,
before you mix it.
Another may be made with Indigo and Gamboge
well ground together, and is extremely ufeful in
Painting of Trees, Grafs, Vegetables, &. and
with the Addition of Sap-Green is very ferviceable in
Flowers and shading of Garments.
 Tranfparent Green is made by mixing Verdi-
greafe and Yellow to various Tints, by leaving
either predominant.
Of BROWNS.
Biffre is  very good and ferviceable Colour; but
the good Sort is difficult to be found, the beft being
very bright and clofe; and as it is  Colour difficult
to work of itfelf, it will be better to mix  little Spa-
Rish



nith Liquorice with it, as that will mellow and take
off its Harthness. It requires  good deal of grind-
ing, and the higher it is gummed, the better it is
for Ofe.
Spanish Lignorice is allowed by the beft Mafters to
be productive of  great Variety of Brown Tints, of
 very agreeable Colour, but will not do for fhading
itfelf; it works as free as any Gum Colours, and
by dilaring in fair Water, is fit for Ufc.
 Brown Mixture may be made by incorporating
Sap-Green and Carmine, which is remarkable for
being of an extraordinary foft Nature. It is.  Co-
four that is extremely ferviceable, as you will find
hereafter in  Description of painting Flowers in
Water-Colours.
Another may be made, by blending Vermilion
and Biftre thoroughly; the Biftre muft be extremely
well ground, before you incorporate it with the
Vermition, and it will produce you  Brown, worthy
of your Efieem.

DREC
C for using the Colours.
four Pencils muft be faft in their Cuills, and

tharp pointed (after you have drawn them thro your
Mouth) not apt to part in the Middle.

Before you begin, you should have all your Co-
lours ready, and  Pallet for the Conveniency of
mixing them,  Paper to lay your Iland upon, as
well as try your Colours; alfo  large Brush called 

Pitch to wipe off the Duff from the Colours.
Being prepared according to the foregoing. Me-
thod, proceed in your Painting, which if it should
be  Landfcape you muft at firtt lay dead Colours all
leaving no part uncovered: And in
Ver your Piece,
this Part of the Performance there needs no great
Pains, but  mafterly Freedom is rather required;
and the Work, tho' feemingly rough, upon  clofe
Inspection, will have  good Effect, when placed at
 Diftance.
Let not the Roughness of the Work difcourage you,
nor be any Means of flopping your Progrefs, for it is
cafily to be foftened by Degrees, with the other Sha-
dows, obferving only to fweeten and mellow them,
and heighten them as the Light falls.
In some Placeslay on ftrong and mafterly Touches,
and in thofe Places bring up your Work to an equal
Roundness and Strength, tempering and fwectening
your Colours with  fharper Pencil than the firft,
that no Lumps or harth Edges may be left, but that
all your Shadows may lie disperfed, foft and fmooth,
 gently as it were into one another.
You are not to finith any one Part firff, but work
up every Part gradually alike, till you fee nothing
wanting to complete your Piece.
Having laid your dead Colours, begin firft with
the lightelt Parts, as the Sky, Sun-Beams, &. then
the Vellowith Beams (which are to be done with
Mafficot



 and White), next the Bluenets of the Sky
(with Blus Verditer alofie) : for Purple Clouds only
ix Lake and White; istaking your Colours deeper
as they go upwards from the Horizon, except in
tempeftuous Skies. The Tops of diffant Mountains
muft be worked fo faint; that they may feem to lofe

themfelves in Air.
Bring your Colours forward as your Diftance de-
creafes, painting your firft Ground next the Horizon
downwards, of bluiffi Sea-Green; and as you ad-
vance forwards, of  darker Green; till you come to
the Fore-Ground, which as it is the darkeft Part of
all, do with dark Green worked up in fuch Manner,
as to give the Appearance of Shrubbery; Eic.
In painting of Trees, having firft laid  Verdi-
greafe Green for  dead Colour; proceed with work-
ing it; to as to give  leaty Appearance; and feem to
hang free and natural, especially towards the Edges,
where you thay-touch  few Leaves clofe to the
Tree, which will give your Performance  mafterly
Eeffect. And you may alfo bring fome of your
Leaves forward with Mafficot and White: And for
the Trunk or Body; work up the Brown with Sap-
Green; and if you fhould introduce any Oak Trees
in your Defign; you should lay on some Touches, to
Express Leaves of Ivy twined about it.
All diffant Objects are to be made imperfect, as
they appear to the Eyc.
Thefe Rules are adapted to General Appearances,
but the Student may deviate from them, as Nature
and his own ripened Judgment shall dictate.
The Method of Colouring Daked Figures.
We shall begin firft with the Naked Figures of
Women and Children, and though the Life is to be
Principally followed, yet we think it necefiary to give
some

 few Directions to prepare thofe Colours seen in
Nature. Take Flake White, and  little Lake,
blend them together, and with that lay- the Ground
Colour, then proceed to shade, with Red. Oker,
Cherry-ftone Black, and  little Lake mixed toger
ther, touching the Lips, Checks,. &cc. with  Fint
of Carmine, and heighten it with White, and 
little Carmine. Remember that you are never; to
heighten it with pure White, which will rather give
it the Appearance of Fith than Flells.

For old Women, take Vermilion, White, and
Brown Oker for the Ground Colour, and shade it
with Red Oker, and Cherry-ftone Black; and to
put  little Bloom in their Faces, ufe Lake and Vers
milion, heightened as before.
Loung Women and Children deceafed, should be
coloured with Brown, White, and  little Vermis
lion shaded with Cherry-fione Black; but to old
Women you muft add more brown Oker, fhaded as
before.
In the colouring of young Men you muft add more
brown Oker, and shade them with Kearing' black
and brown Oker, touching their Lips and Cheeks
with Carmine and Lake.
For Dead Men, take Brown, with  little White
and Vermilion, and shade it with Black.

cleareft Glue; add thereto one Pint of pure

Water, and half an Ounce of the fineff Roch-Allum,
boiling them till they are diffolved; which will be pro-
ductive of  very ferviceable Liquor; with which
you may temper thofe Colours intended for  Sky;

Take of the whiteff Sort of Gum Arabic, bruife
, and tie it in  Piece of Woollen Cloth, and steep
Water till it is diffolved. If it is too
it in Spring
iff, which may be known by the fhining of the
Colours, add more Water, if too weak more Gurl.
With this Water you may temper moft of your Co-
lours, ufing fuch  Quantity of it, that the Colours
when dry being touched, will not come off if the
Colour shines the Water is too frong.
To keep the Flies from your Work.
Having prepared your Gum-Water according to
either of the preceding Directions, add  little
Coloquintida thereco, which, if your Performance
should be exposed, will keep it from being damaged
by the Flies.
To prepare Allum-Water.
Take four Ounces of Roch—Allum, and  Pint of
pure Spring Water, boil it till the Allum is tho-
roughly diffolved; then filter it through  Brown
Paper, and it is fit for Ufe. Before you lay on your
Colours, take fome of this Water hot, and with 
Spunge wet the Back of your Paper, which if it is
not good it muft be wetted three or four times.
This will not only prevent the finking of your Co-
Jours, but will alfo keep them from fading, and give
them an additional Beauty and Luftre. Remember
that your Paper muft be dried each Time before you
wet it again.

the Means of this Water you may change your Sap-
Green into Blue.
To make  Lixivium of Pearl Afpes.
Steep half an Ounce of Pearl Affes in Rain or
Spring Water for one Day at leaft, then ftrain off
the Water as clean as poffible; this Infufion will
prove extremely ferviceable in many Colours, parti-
cularly Brazil-Wood, to which it will give an ad-
ditional Beauty and Luftre.

 White Varniss from Mr. Boyls.
Melt two Drachms of White Refin in  glazed
Pipkin, adding to it by Degrees an Gunce of fine
white Amber, ground to  very fine Powder; then
put rover agentle Fire, ffirring it till it is diffolyed
when it begins to grow fliff, pour into it at feveral

  little Oil of Turpentine: Be very cautious
in



 the melling of this, as the Vapours of the Oil of
Turpentine will take fire by Heat alone, which if it
should chance to do, the beft Method you can purfue
to extinguith it, is by clapping  Board over the Poty
or  wet Blanket, which by keeping it from the Air
will suffocate and put it out.
Therefore the beft way of preparing this Varnish
is by melting the Refin in  cylindrical Glass in 
hot Sand-Bed, after the Glals has been well warmed
in the Sand, under which you muft keep  gentle Fire.
The Varnish being melted, pour it into  coarfe
Linen Bag, and prefs it between two hot Cak
Boards, and receive the clear Part into  warm
glazed Pan; it is then fit, and may be ufed with
any Colours, as well as to varnish them after they
are painted.
 

 
   
OF PAINTING ON GLASS.
AINTING on Glass is an Art which. has

been efteemed by the generality of Mankind

an Amufement attended with many Difficulties; yer
nothing can afford us  more (plendid and magnifi-
cent Reprefentation of Nature, thanca Painting in
this Manner well executed: As there is given all
the Softness imaginable, being no Outlines to draw
nor Shades to make; but is eafy to work, and may
 
be decorated with Colours without either.


Metzotinto Prints are generally ufed for this Puri
pofe; the Shades and Lines not being to harth and
abrupt as thofe of Engraving; as they are blended in
each other, and have the appearance of  Drawing
in Indian Ink.

Water, and let it remain on the Surface till it finks.;

then take it carefully out with its Face downwards;
and dab it between some Papers till no Water ap-
pears, yet fo as the Print remains damp.:
Then proceed with laying the damp Print on its
Back upon  Hat Table; hold the Glats over it
without touching the Turpentine, till it is exactly.

gently on it, carefully prefs it down with your
Curpentine
Kingers in different Parts; to that the

Glass towards you, preffing the Print from the
Centre towards the Edges till no Eliffers reinain,
Lx
 wet the Back of your Print with  Spunge,
till the Paper will rub off with your Fingers, then

We think it neceffary to inform the Student, that.
the Reafon of our not mentioning the Carmine (for
Red) and the Ultramarine (for Blue) in the Liff.
prefixed, as on account of its being moft proper

to purchafe them in Powder, they being to liable to
be loft; and as  small Touch of thefe will give the
Painting an enlivening Caft, what you require for
prefent Ofd, mix with  . Drops of Nut-Oil upon
your Pallet.
The Pallets and Pallet-Knives may be had at the
aforementioned Colour-Chops.
Cut  Hole at the Bottom of each Bladder you
want to get the Colourout of, and press out no more
pon your Pallet than you intend for immediate Ife,
ecaufe the Colours are apt to dry and IKin over.
Thenlaying  Sheet of White Paperon the Table,
ake the Glats in your left Hand, the Turpentine

and upon the White Paper) and the Outlines and

ints of the Prints will appear on the Glafs, and
en decorate it as follows.
Tbe






 Manner of Working the Colours.
 the Lights and Shades are difperfed on your
 Picture, you muff be careful in difpoting of
your Colours accordingly, and to do fo lay on the
light Colours on the lighteff Parts of your Print, and
the darker over the shaded ; and the brighter Colours
being laid on properly, it is not of any material con-
fequence if the darker ones should by accident run
over them, for the upper Colour cannot be feen
through that which was laid on firft; for inftance:

TREENS.
Firff lay on some Verdigreafe, and then mix that
and Dutch Pink for the next; this Colour may be
made darker of lighter by adding more or lets Dutch
Pink.
BLUES.
For the Lights, lay on Ultramarine or Blue Bice

for the firft fhade Saunders Blue, and for the darkeff.
Indigo.
REDS.
For the firft ufe Minium, of Red Lead (tho
roughly ground); fhade it with Lake, and in the

higheft rarts touch it with Carmine, which will en-
liven your Painting, and fet it off to  great Advan-
 the lighteff Yellow lay on Mafticot, and for
the Shade ufe Dutch Pink.
Any of thefe Colours may be darkened by adding
to them  darker Shade of the same Colour on your
Pallet; or lighten them, if too ffrong
by mixing
shem with White.

 you find the Colours thick and troublefome,
they are to be made thinner, by mixing with them  Drops of Turpentine Oil, for they muft never
be ufed thick, as you will be in Danger of fpoiling
your Piece.
You muff have  Pencil for each Colour; and be
careful that you never put  Bruth which you have
afed with one Colour into any other, before you
have washed your Bruth well in Turpentine Oil,
particularly Green, as that Colour will appear pre-
dominant when dry.
Obferye that when you have dane uling your
Bruthes, they are to be thoroughly wathed in the
Oil of Turpentine.
When your Glats is painted, you muft let it re
main three or four Days free from Duft, before it is
fit for framing,
The Student who is defirous of amuling himfelf
with this beautiful Art, would find it very conve-
pient, was he to provide himfelf with  Box upon
the following Conftruction; in Length two Feet fix
Inches, in Width one Foot four Inches, and in
Height five Inches, with Partitions. See the En-
graved Plate.
, muft be  Box made of Tin, and fixed in the
great Box, to contain Turpentine Oil for wathing
your Pencils after you have done, before you lay
them by.
Between  and  upon the Tin, is the Place for
preffing the Colour out of the Bruth after you have
dipped it in the Oil of Turpentine to clean it: the
Colours which fall into the Box , will with their
Oils make  very good Size for Gold.
The Box  is for the Reception of your Pencils
after you have cleaned them, where they will be
ready whenever they are wanted. It is to be ob-
served,


 that fome of the Pencils are fuch as are to be
ifed in laying on your Colours, while the others are
to be thofe of White Hair for the foftening and
blending your Colours in each other as foon as laid
on, that if the Student should leave off harth and
abruptly, the Place may not be diftinguithable.
The Profeffor in this polite Art, should not have
lets than two or three dozen Camels Hair Pencils
of Various Sizes, with Sticks to each, about ten or
tweive Inches long, which are made of Cedar, and
may be procured at Mr. Drake' in Long Acre.

The Box  is to be divided into feveral Parts for
keeping your dry Colours diffinet, and thereby from
(poiling each other; in which Place you may keep
your Ultramarine of Carmine.
:. If you have any Occafion to grind your Colours,
you muft provide yourfelf with  Stone, which may.
be made of  Pebble or fine Marble thoroughly po-
lithed, and may be had at any Stone-Miafon .

If you have  large (
antity of Colour to grind,
he careful that your Oil is in Proportion, and never
overpower it with  fuperffuous 
uantity: Your
Colour being fufficiently ground (which it is not
while there are any Lumps remaining) dip  Piece of
Bladder in warm Water to mollify it, and make it
thore pliable; which being done, immediately tie up
the Colour in it, and it will be fit for ufe when re-
quired.
The Partition  is to be lined with Tin, as it is
to enclofe the Bladders of Nut and Burnt Oil (which
you should never be without), as alfo the Oils of
Turpentine and Linfeed; which was it not lined,
the frequent taking the Eladders out, would be 
Means of greating and ffaining the Wood; whereas
the Tin will preferve it free from any Stain.
The Partition  in the Middle of the Box should
alfo be made of Tin, to take out whenever it is re-
quired,


 as that is to contain the Bladders of Oil-
Colours. Over thefe should be laid your Paller,
which ought to be cleaned as foon as you have done
with Turpentine Oil, or elfe laid in Water fuf-
ficient to cover the Colours, which will be  Means
of keeping your Colours till the next Occafion, and
preventing  very great Wafte. Rub your Pallet
with  clean Cloth and Linfeed or Nut Oil, till it is
quite dry, and you will then have it clean, and fit
for the Reception of your Colours.
But though you take all the Care poftible, when
your Colours are expoted to the Air, and ufed in
small Quantities, there will be  thick hard Skin
over them in  very fhort Time, which though it
may be taken off with your Pallet Knife, will occa-
Lion  great Decreafe of your Colour. After the
Skin is taken off, the Remainder will in all proba-
bility prove too thick for Ufe, without  Drop or
two of Nut-Oil, which muft be well tempered with
your Pallet-Knife.
Once more let us caution the Artiff to keep his
Bruthes to their feparate Colours; for the mixing
of them is attended with many ill Confequences, and
will greatly endanger the whole of his Perfermance.
 PAINTING IN CRATONS.
AfIE Crayons we would recommend are thofe
imported from Switzerland, the beft of which

may be had of Mr. Drake in Long Acre; the various
Sorts are as follow.
Whice, Black, Yellow, Orange, Purple; Red,
Blue, Green, and Brown, each of which may be
ufed in thading, the two firft excepted.
Dirsctions.



 for using the same.

Rough Venice Paper is to be ufed on this Oced
fion, which is of  whiced-brown Colour, the stiffer
the better; but there is  Sort called Cape-Paper
which is preferred, as it diftributes the Colours to
the beft Advantage. By this Means, Figures may
be reprefented in their proper Colours as appearing
to the Eye, becaufe the Colours can be matched
with the Crayons, which being dry will not fades
whereas the Colours, when wee; feem deeper than
when they are dry, which perhaps may perplex 
Young Beginner.
To make farther neceffary Preparations; provide
Yourfelf with fome of the thickeff and fmootheft
light blue or other Papet, and getting  Straining
Frame from  Frame-maker, ftrain  Piece of coarfe
Scotch or Irish Cloth over it, which may be done by
drawing and faftening it with small Tacks round the
Edges till quite fmooth; or you may provide your—
self with ohe ready prepared, by applying to Mirs
Drake, Long Acre. Then damp your Paper with 
Spunge dipt in Wates, and pafte it, laying it on
the Cloth, being particular that it is even with
the Straining Frame; then laying  Piece of White
 upon the Table, put the Straining Frame with
the Blue Paper downwards upon it, keeping it feady
with one Hand, rubbing the Cloth clofe to the Paper
with the other; then turning the Frame, with 
Piece of White Paper in your Hand rub clofe the
Edges: when it is dry fet if on an Eafel (which may
be had at the Colour-thop before-mentioned) and
proceed as follows:
With Charcoal sKetch your Rough-Draught, and
with Black, White, or Red Chalk, correct your
Faults. Having thus outlined your Object com-
pletely, your Crayons may be rubbed iir; but Care is
required


 concerning the proper Coours; and then
foften or blend them together with your Finger or
Firch.
When you prepare your Crayons for Ufe, re-
member to cut the Prints from the Bottom upwards,
and take Care they are not made too fharp, the Red
Oker, Charcoal, and White Chalk excepted.
As it is  very great Difficulty to get Crayons that
are really good, we think it no way fuperffuous to
give the Student, willing to encourage the Art of
Drawing in Crayons, the Method of preparing them
after the moft approved Manner.
WHITES.
No other White is required than the beft and
fofteff French or Italian White Chalk cut into
Pieces about two Inches long, and  Quarter of an
Inch in Thickness; with your Penknife round off the
Corners, and point them as directed above.
Of thefe it will be expedient that the Artiff should
have  great Number (as they are of continual Ufe
and muft be feparated from the reft; or they will
otherwife be much difcoloured.
VElLows.
As Yellows are next to be treated of, we shall
divide them into fix or feven different Shades.
Firft Degree. Take fome Flour of Brimffone and
Grounds of Starch, and with your Pallet-Knife in-
corporate them upon  polifhed Marble, and it will
make an agreeable Straw-Colour; then bring them
to the Confiffency of  Pafte, with Milk or pale
Ale Wort, then with your Pallet-Knife (pread them
on  Piece of fmooth Cloth, till they are in Thickness
about one third of an Inch, and let them remain fo
till half dry; then with  sharp Knife reduce it into
Pieces


 about two Inches long, and one third of ad
Inch wide, and roll it between your Hlands, or two
Pieces of Board, till round as the Stem of  Tobacco
Pipe, and not much thicker; and point it as directed
for the Chalk. Or if moft convenieht, you may
ufe Ground Chalk inftead of the Grounds of Starch;
a that will work near the fame Effect.
 second Vellow is made after Yellow Oker has
been well ground in fair Water, then dried and beat;
by mixing with it fuch  Quantity of ground Chalk;
or Grounds of Starch, as will render it little darker
than the above; then mixing with it as much Milk
as will make it  Paffe, and to into Crayons as the
preceding.  little Sugarcandy may be diffolyed
in the Milk.
 third Vellow is prepared by grinding Vellow
Oker and Water upon  Stone with  Muller, and
when it is dry beating it well, and mixing it with 
very little ground Chalk to be darker than the
former, and add to it pale Ale Wort or Size, and
make it into Crayons as before. For the Method of
Preparing the Size, we refer the Reader to thofe
ufeful Receipts; publifhed at the End of the Dirsc-
tions for painting in Water-Colours.
 fourth Fellow. To prepare this, grind Englifh
Pink with Water as the former, and when it is dry
beat it in the fathe Mianner, and mix it with  little
of the Grounds of the beft White Chalk, that it
may be darker than the former Colour: Then incor-
porate with it as much pale Ale Wort as will bring it
to  Pafte, then prepare and reduce it into Crayons
a before directed.
 Fifth Yellow. For this, Englifh Pink is to be
mixed with pale Ale Wort. After being ground
with pure Spring Water, and then reduced to Paftils
or Crayons, according to the aforementioned Direc=
LiORs.
 fixths


 fixth Vellew. Dutch Pink prepared as the
former.
 feventh Fellow
Orpiment, though one of the
moft pernicious Yellows ufed, is  very beautiful
Colour.
This muft be mixed with  little ground
Chalk or Grounds of Starch well incorporated, and
brought to the Confiftency of  Paffe with pale Ale
Wort, in which muft be diffolved fome Gum Dra-
gon, and then rolled in Crayons according to the
SirRl Directions.
ORANGE COEOUR.
Firff Degree. Grind Orpiment alone, and make
it into Paftils from the foregoing Directions.
Second Degree. Grind Red Lead with pure
Water very fine, and when it is dry beat it, then
grind Orpiment, and with it mix  fmall Quantity
of Red Lead (that is, to much as will make it 
Shade darker than the preceding); then diffolve fome
Gum Dragon in Milk or Ale Wort, and with it
temper your Colour, and roll it into Crayons as
before.
Third Degree. This is prepared by grinding
English Pink with pure Water, and mixing it with
as much Vermilion as will make it agreeable to your
Defign; then boil Ale Wort till it becomes ofuti-
nous, with which bring your Colour to  Pafte,
then cut it in Lengths, and roll it as before.
Fourth Degree. Prepare English Pink and Red
Lead as before, and mix as much of them together
as will make it  Shade darker than the former.
Mix thefe with Ale Wort prepared as above, and fo
into Paftils or Crayons.
Fifth Degree. Mix as much Dutch Pink finely
ground with Red Lead as will bring it to the Shade
required, and to proceed as the former.
Be


 careful in the compounding thefe Colourss to

make as many Shades as poffible.
REDS.
Firff Red. Grind Red Lead very fine with pure
Water; and when dry beat it as fine as poffible, and
heighten it with White Chalk finely ground; then
diffolve fome Gum Dragon in Ale Wort, and make
your Compofition into Paffe, and then cut and roll
 into Crayons. Of this Compofition you may
make different Shades, by adding more or lefs
White.
Second Red. Procure fome of the beft Red Eead,
and grind it with  Multer and Stone, and proceed
as before directed.
Third Red. Red Oker, which is to be prepared
in the fame manner as White Chalk.
Fourth Red. Take some fine White Chalk, or
Whire Leadwell pulverized, and with it mix fome Ver-
milion ground to the State of an impalpable Powder.
Divide them in three or four Shades, and make each
of them into Pafte with Ale Wort boiled, and cut,
and roll them as before.
Fifth Red. Grind Vermilion very fine with 
Stone and Muller, and to mix it with pale Ale Wort
prepared as before directed, and then roll it into
Crayons.
Sixth Red. Take some Lake of the beft Sort,
and grind it with  Stone and Muller with Water,
and when it is dry, beat it to an impalpable Powder.
Divide them in three or four feparate Parcels, and
then add more or lets White to each, as will give
them different Shades; then work each Parcel into
Paffe with Ale Wort, and afterwards into Crayons.
Seventh Red. Reduce fome pure Lake to as fine
 Powder as poffible with clear Water, and after you
have dryed it, reduce it to as fine  Powder as be-
fore,




fore, then mix it with Wilk, or Ale Wort, and bring
it into Crayons according to the firft Directions.
Righth Red. Take Indian Lake, and prepare it as

the former. This alone will be  very ffrong Co-
lour, but you should make three different Shades at
leaft, by the Addition of, more or lets White.
Ninth Red. Cut Rofe-Pink into the Shape of
Crayons, and they will be fit for Ufe without any
farther Preparations. Carmine will come very ex=
penfive, as  Shilling'-worth will make but  very
little Crayon.
BLUES.
Firft Blue. Take Blue Bice, and grind it with
pure Water with  Stone and Muller, and when it is
dry, reduce it to  Powder again, and add to it
White Chalk finely powdered; divide them into
 afcels, and put to them more or lefs Chalk, fo as
to produce various Shades. Bring thefe to the Con-
fiftency of  Pafte with Ale Wort mixed with  little
Size, made according to the former Directions, and
to proceed with making them into Crayons.
Second Blue. Blue Bice alone finely ground, and
prepared as the preceding
Third Blue. Grind some Verditer with Water
upon  Stone, and then let it dry, after which beat
it into  Powder, fo fine as that no Lumps can be
feen; then divide if into four or five Parcels, to all
of which, except one, add fuch different Propor-
tions of White Chalk, as will make them Shades for
each other: Make thefe into Pafte with Ale Wort,
wherein Gum Dragon has been diffolved; and that
Blue with which no White has been mixed, make
into Paffe with pale Ale Wort and  little Size, and
to into Paffils or Crayons as before.
Fourth Blue. Take fome Pruffian Blue, and be
very careful that it is thoroughl
ground; and then
make
F it into Pafte with pale Ale Wort-boiled
and thickened with Size, and fo into Crayons, in
purfuance of the firft Directions. Then, to make
Tome lighter Shades, take some more of the Pruffian
Blue, and after you have ground it well by itfelf and
dried it, divide it into two or three Parcels, to each
of which add White Chalk, in proportion as you
would have your Shades lighter or darker; make
thefe into Pafte with Ale Wort boiled, and to into
Crayons as the former.
Fifth Bluc. Take some of the beft Rock Indigo,
and grind it with your Stone and Muller in pure
Water, dry it, then reduce it to  very fine Powder,
and divide it into feveral Parcels, to which add
Whice Chalk in different Proportions: Mix thefe
with pale Ale Wort boiled, and have at leaft four
Shades of them, and for the darkeft ufe Indigo made
into Pafte as the reft, and to into Paltils according
to the firft Directions.
PURPLES.

Firft Purple. Take Rofe Pink, and grind it as
fine as poffible, and when dry powder it, and mix it
well with  little Saunders Blue, till it appears of the
Colour you defire; then bring it to  Pafte, and fo
froceed as the former.
Second Purple. Take Lake finely ground and
wathed, add to it as much Blue Bice as will make it
of an agreeable reddith Purple, and make this of
two or three different Degrees, each lighter than the
other, and into the lighter Parts put White Chalk
or Grounds of the beft White Starch, and make
them into Pafte with Ale Wort boiled, and mixed
with Size, and make them into Paftils or Crayons as
the laft.

Third Purple. Grind fome Lake with pure
 and add as much Pruffian Blue to it, as will.
make
 it of the Purple you defire; mix thefe well
together in feveral Parcels, making fome more in-
clining to Blue, others to Red, and to the fainteff
add as much White Chalk as you fee neceffary, and
make the feparate Parcels into Pafte with Ale Wort
boiled till it becomes glucinous, and make them into
Paftils in the fame manner as the former.
BLACES.
Firff Black. The Black which is generally ufed
for Crayons, is Charcoal cut into Pieces about two
Inches long, and  Quarter of an Inch wide; the
foffeft and beft are thofe made of Willows. You
should have of thefe at leaff one Dozen, becaufe the
Contrafts Black and White are moft wanted.
Second Black. Grind lvory Black as fine  pof-
fible with pure Water, adding to it in the grinding 
small Quantity of Indigo, which will very much en-
liven the Black, and relieve it from that Deadnefs
which attends it when ufed by irfelf; make it into
Pafte with boiled Ale Wort, and fo into Paftils or
Crayons as before.
BROWNS.
Firft Brown. Take fome Fullers Earth of the
bett and pureft Sort, and after you have ground it
well with Water, add to it fome ground Chalk in
different Quantities, that may have three or four dif-
ferent Shades; mix each of thefe up with pale Ale
Wort, boiled till it become glatinous, and when
it is half dry, cut it into Pieces about two Inches
long, and  Quarter of an Inch thick, and then roll
it into Crayons.
Second Brown.
Take Some Spanith Brown,
grind it well with Water, to which add in the grind-
ing fome Fullers Earth, which will very much en-
lighten it, the Spanish Brown being of itfelf  very
dark


 Colour; this being done, when dry beat it into
 Powder again; and divide it into four different
Parcels, to three of which put rounds of Starch in
different Degrees, fo that you may preserve feveral
Shades of Colour. Mix each of thefe feparately into
Pafte with  little Size of Kinglass, or pale Ale
Wort boiled, or thick. Water-Cruel wherein Gum
Dragon has been diffolved, and to make it into Paf-
tils or Crayons, according to the former Directions.
Third Brown. Take some Indian Red and Spa-
nith. Brown, and grind them together with your
Stone and Muller, and mix them with Ale Wort
till they are as fliff as Pafte. Of this Colour you
may make different Shades, by adding more of lefs
White, which may be either of the aforementioned
Colours.
GREENS.
Firff Green. Provide yourfelf with some diffilled
Verdigreafe, and grind it with ffrong Vinegar with  and Muller; after which wath it well with
Water, the Manner of which is as follows: Pat the
Verdigreafe into Water, and let it remain there about
 Minute, then pour the Water off into  Cup, and
let it fettle; then pour that from it; and wath it
again in the same manner, and when it is dry make
it into Paffils of different Shades with ground White
Chalk.
Second Green.
Take some of the beft Verdi-
greafe, and boil it with fharp Vinegar, and while it

is boiling add to it  little powdered Tartar, which
being of fo sharp  Nature will foon diffolve the Ver=
digreafe, and you will have the Liquor of  very fine
Colour, forewhat inclinable to  Blue; then fet the
Liquor in small Gallipots, and let it be expofed to
the Airy and it will foon be congealed and become
hard, then mix it with as much Ale Wort as will
bring
  it to  Paffe, and fo into Paftils or Crayons as
before directed.
Third Green. Prepare Verdigreafe after the same
Manner as the laft, then reduce it, and divide it
into feveral Parcels, to which add Pruffian Blue in
different. Proportions, as you would have them
lighter or darker, and to the lighteff Parts add  little
White Chalk, or  little Straw Colour, to variegate
the Shades as much as poffible. Mix all thefe with
pale Ale Wort boiled, as before directed.
Fourth Green. Grind fome Blue Bice very fine,
and in the grinding add to it fome of the beft Durch
Pink. Divide them into feveral Parts, and make
them into different Shades with White Chalk; bring
them to  Pafte with Ale Wort boiled, and fo into
Paftils.
Fifth Green. Grindfome Rock Indigo very finewith
pure Water with  Stone and Muller, and after you
have dried it, reduce it to Powder, and divide it into
four Parcels at leaft; and add to some, Durch Pink, to
others Dutch Pink and Brimffone, and for the
lighteff, Flour of Brimffone only. After you have
made as many Shades as you defire, bring them into
 Paffe with pale Ale Wort mixed with Size, made
according to that Receipt prefcribed at the End of
the Directions for painting in Water-Colours, and
then cut them into Lengths, and roll them into Paf-
tils or Cravons as at firft directed.
Sixth Green. Grind Rock Indioo with Water
pon yourStone, then divide it into Parcels more or
less as you think proper, and add Dutch Pink in fuch
different Quantities as will produce feveral Shades,
after thefe are well incorporated; make them into
Pafte with boiled Ale Wort, and roll them into
Paftils according to the former Directions.
The Artiff will find thefe Crayons far preferable to
thofe generally bought at Shops, and for this Reafon,
they


 being frequently tempered to high with Gum-
Water, rendersthem fo fliff and obdurate, that they will
too often rather fcratch, than give any Appearance of
Colour upon your Paper; on the contrary, thofe
which we have here recommended, may be ufed with
all the Eafe and Freedom imaginable, and will ex-
press the Diverfity of Colours as pleafantly and agree-
able as can be defired.
When the Student is defirous of making  Draw-
ing in Crayons, either from Nature, or from  cor-
reet Imitation of Nature, he should be caseful, before
he begins, that he has every Colour that is in his
Original, as he cannot here, as in  Painting either
in Water er Oil Colours, prepare  Colour at  Warning; which Confideration it was
that induced us to direct to many Shades to be made
from each Colour.
The Arciff, in order to keep his Colour feparate,
(for if they mix, it will, on account of their Soft-
ness, be very prejudicial to them) should be prepared
with  Box which contains as many Partitions as will
Keep each Shade by itfelf.
