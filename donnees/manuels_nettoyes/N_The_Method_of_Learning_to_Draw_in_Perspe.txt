CHAP. .


Short Rules for Drawing in Perspective
which will prove of great Use to all De
signers.


WHEN  observe the Faults daily
committed in the Designing of
Landscapes, or Drawing Views
and Prospects,  more and more
find the Necessity of knowing 
little Perspective, to correct and
avoid such Errors ; for, under
standing that Art will render any one capable of
Drawing any Thing with mathematical Truth
and Certainty.











But  conceive that the Reason, why so many ,
Mistakes are commonly made in Drawings, pro
ceeds from the Apprehensions that some have of
the Length of Time it will take up, to render
themselves Masters of Perspective, and from being
frightned at the Difficulties they conceive are in
that Study; particularly imagining, that one must
be first well grounded in the Mathematicks: This
 know has discouraged many from engaging
in the Rules relating to this Art ; but for their
Sakes  undertake, in this Tract, to instruct them
in the following Lessons how to lay any Plan in
Perspective, and raise Pillars or Buildings to due
Heights according to their proper Distances.


Lesson .
Of the Plan.
FIG.  we have  square Piece of Pavement,
as in Figure , consisting of twenty five Pieces
of Marble, each  Foot square, it must be mea
sured exactly, and laid regularly down upon Pa¬
per: You may likewise, for your better Obser











vation, mark every other Stone or Marble black,
which will better inform you how every parti
cular Square will appear, when we have  true
perspective View of them; or else you may num
ber every one, and, when the following Lesson
is done, number those in the perspective Plan,
with the same Figures as are marked on the first
Plan,


Lesson II.


Of laying Figure in Perspective.


It is to be understood in Perspective that there
are two Points to be considered ; the first we call
the Point of Sight, that is, what relates to every
Thing in our View from the Place where we
stand; and it matters little where we stand to
take our View, for the Perspective will still be
true, according to the Appearance of the Plan
to our Eye: If we stand at  Corner, or in the
Middle, or at any Point, the Method  shall pre
scribe presently will lay pur Plan justly before
us as it will appear.


The other Point is called she Point of Distance,
because it governs the Distances, and the Pro
portions of every Thing we can truly see of the
Plan, in whatever Position we happen to be.








FIG. II.





At , you see the Plan of Fig. . This is di
vided into Squares, as mentioned in that Figure;
the three at the Bottom, marked , , , in both;
and the Squares in, the Plan , marked    are those which are marked in perspective with
the same Numbers.


Now, to lay your Plan in perspective, fix your
Point of Sight as you observe in the Figure, or
more or less to the right or left as you think
proper; then draw the Line , , parallel to,
and at what Distance ypu will from, the Line











,  ; then raise  Line on each Side from 
to , to form the Figure you see, as  Frame
to your Picture; then draw  Line from the Cor
ner , which is the Point of Distance, to , and
this Line will regulate your Work.


Then draw Lines, from the Squares of your
Plan to the Point of Sight, as exactly as possible ;
and wherever your Line of Distance cuts those
Lines, which are drawn from the Squares of your
Plan to the Point of Sight, that marks where
your Squares in perspective ought to be; then
draw Lines parallel to the Line , , where the
Line of Distance cuts, and that will give you
the true Figure of every Square: So , in the
perspective Plan, answers to , in the measured
Plan ; and     answers to the others in the
same.


When you have done this, the next Rule you
are to know is, how to raise either Pillars, Trees,
Houses, or any other Bodies, according to their
respective Heights, at different Distances and Pro
portion, on the Plan you have laid down.














How to raise Pillars, or any Bodies of 
certain Proportion, in Perspective.


You have now your Plan measured out in
perspective, into Squares of  Foot; one of these
Squares in this Lesson serves for the Base, or Bot
tom, of  pillar  Foot thick. This Figure III.
is exactly of the same Dimensions of the Plan
laid in perspective at Figure II. First mark the
Line ,  in equal Proportions, by the qame
Scale of the Ground-plan, Figure II; as, , , ,
, which are so many Feet in height; and they;
standing on the Base of the first Figure, are Up
rights, not in perspective : Then draw  Line
parallel with ,  from Number  which gives
you the Front of the Body you are to raise, and
if it is to be only three Feet high, draw  Line
cross from  to the Line raised from No.  and
that determines the Height, which you will then
find to be  Foot wide, and three Feet high by


Measure:








Measure: Then from the Top of the Line  draw
 Line, with  Black-lead Pencil, to the Point
of Sight, and raise another Line from  parallel
to the Line  till it touches the pencil’ Line,
passing from  to the Point of Sight, which gives
you the Side-appearance of the Column, or Body,
as you will fee it from the Place where you stand.


[The Line from Point  should be drawn with 
Pen, because it is to remain.] Then with  Pen
cil draw  Line from  to the Point of Sight,
which will determine the other Line, to make
the Shape of the Top df the Column ; and,then
raise  Line parallel With ,  with  Pencil,
from the Point  till it touches the Tine from 
to she Point of Sight; draw then  parallel Line
to ,  at   and you will have the Square
of the Top of the Pillar, or Column, as you can
observe it from the Place where you stand, which
 suppose to be at . [You must remember,,
that the Line drawn from  to  is only an ima
ginary Line, to be rubbed out; for it cannot be
seen from the Place Where you stand, and there
fore must not appear in the Drawing; but you
should not leave it out, because it shews you
where to regulate the Top of your Column, and
teaches you how to place your Column upon its
Base with Certainty.] By this means you may
see the Front and one Side of your Column: And
the Line from  to  must also be rubbed out,
because it can’ be seen.


Then finish your Column only with the Lines


from  to , from , to   to  from  to  and


from  to   from  it will be drawn without any Imperfection,
and appear as follows in Figure IV.











FIG. IV.


When this is done, you may place another
Column on any one of the Squares erected in the
same Manner, observing to fling your Shades all
on one Side, and then you cannot err : But espe
cially mind where the dotted Lines are in Fi
gure III.


When you can master these few Lesions, which
you may gain with very little Pains, you will
be capable of doing any Thing in this Way, that
will be regular and certain, and know the Faults
of the Ignorant and Unskilful.


CHAP. II.


Of Painting upon GLASS.


PAINTING upon Glass is an Art which
has generally appeared so difficult, that few
have succeeded in the Attempt; and yet there
is no Representation of any Portrait can appear
more elegant, than in  Picture done well in this
Manner: For you have all the Softness and all
the Tenderness that can be desired in  Picture,


and








and it is easy too for any Person to work upon ;
for there are no Out-lines to draw, nor any
Shades to make, but you put on the Colours
without the Trouble of either.


The Pictures, which we use on this Occasion,
are those done in Mezzo-tinto, or what we call
Mezzo-tincto Prints, for their Shades are rubbed
down with an Instrument on the Copper-plates ;
so that the several Lines, which are forced to be
drawn to represent the shady Part of any common
Print, are by this Means scumbled together, and
appear as soft and united as in any Piece done with
Indian Ink.


When you are provided with such Prints as you
like, cut off the Paper of the Margin, so that
none be left but the Print itself; then take some
of the finest Crown-glass, and have it cut exactly
to the Size of your Prints, and, when you have
cleaned your Glass very well, lay on one Side of
it some fine Venice Turpentine, as thin as possible,
with  Brush made of Hog’-hair; and, if you
perceive the Turpentine to lie unequally, pass 
Piece of Wood, made like  fiat Ruler, over it
till it lies equal in every Part; then wet the Back
of your Print with  Sponge and Water, and
lay the pictur’ Side upon the turpentin’ Side of
the Glass, taking Care that every Part of it lies
close to the Glass, and that there are no Bubbles
or Blisters to be seen; then you may roll it.
over with  Wooden Roll, made like  Cylinder
of two Inches diameter, to fix it close to the
Glass ; and when that is done, wet the Back of
the Print again with  Sponge and Water, till
the Paper will rub off with your Fingers; then
rub it gently till there remains only the Picture
itself upon the Glass; so will you have all the
Lines and Shades very visible, as if it was  fine
drawing in Indian Ink : Then let it remain till the









next Day to dry, for else the Colours would not
take, because they are ground in Oil.


   . . Colours for Painting on Glass with
the Necessaries for such  Work.


At most Colour-shops of note in London, we
may meet with Colours of several sorts ground
in Oil, and tied up in little Bladders to be fold
at. Three-pence,  Groat, or Six-pence  Piece,
according as they are more or less valuable : Of
these provide as follow.


Whites.


Flake White,
White-Lead.


Yellows.


English Pink,
Yellow Oaker,
Dutch Pink,
Yellow Orpiment.


Reds.


Rose Pink,
Vermillion,
Red-Lead,


Indian Red,


Lake,


Carmine.


Verditer,


Prussian Blue,


Sander? Blue,


Indigo.


Blacks.


Lamp Black,


Ivory Black.


Greens.


Verdigrease distill’,
Verdigrease and Yellow
Oaker mixt,
Verdigrease andEnglisti
Pink mixt,


Verdigrease and Dutch
Pink mixt.


Blues. 


Ultramarine,


Blue Bise,


Browns,


Spanish Brown,


Umber.


When you are provided with. these Colours,
you may mix them one with another to what
Degree of Colour you think proper upon  Pal
let,








let, with  smooth Knife with  tender bending
Blade, adding  little more of one Colour to ano
ther, mixing them well till you have what you
want.


To get the Colour out of the Bladders, prick
 Hole at the Bottom of each Bladder you de
sign to use, and press the Bladder till you have
Colour enough upon your Pallet for your present
Use; for in  Day' Time the Colours will dry,
and ean never be recovered.


Provide on this Occasion  Box about two
Foot and  half long, about five Inches high and
sixteen Inches wide, with Partitions in it as
follow.








The Use of this Box, which is to keep all your
painting Things together, and preserve them
clean,  shall here very particularly explain.


At Number  must be  Box of tinned
No.  Iron to be placed in the wooden Box, be
cause it must hold Oil of Turpentine to
clean your Pencils when you have done work.


When you paint you must take care to use on
ly one Pencil in  Colour, or, in other Words,
to have  Pencil for each Colour; and as soon
as you have done using them for the Day, clean
them from the Colours, by dipping them into
the Oil of Turpentine, and laying the hairy part
of the Pencil on the tinn’ Division, be-
No.  tween Number  and Number  press
your Finger hard on the Hair, and draw
it four or five times oyer the Tin, then will the
Colours, which came out of the Pencils, -fall into
the Tin-box, number  and by that Means the
Pencils will be clean, and the several Mixtures
of Colours, that fall there with their Oils, will
become  good Size for Gold.


Then lay your Pencils with their Sticks
No.  in the Box No.  and they will be fit for
Use another Time.


Note, the Pencils should be of two Sorts, that
is, some of Camel’-hair to paint with, such as
will come to  Point when the Colour is in them,
and some dry Brushes of white Hair, never to be
dipp’ in Colour, but used only to scunjble or
join one Colour in another when they are just laid
on, so that they appear soft, atod you cannot di
stinguish where any one leaves off abruptly.


You ought at least to have three Dozen of Ca¬
mel’ Hair-pencils of all Sizes, and  Dozen and
half of rough Brushes, with Sticks to each about
ten Inches or  Foot long; the Sticks may be
bought ready made at the Colour-shops; they









are commonly made of Cedar or Brazil-wood,


. but some nice Persons have them turn’ in Ivory.


At numb.  you should have  Case di
No.  vided of Wood in several Parts to keep
your dry Colours in, such as Carmine and Ultra
marine, with others that you may keep by you to
grind when you want them, for sometimes you
may have Occasion in the Country to grind ,
Colour that you want.


The Reason of having Divisions made in this Box
is to keep these Colours from mixing with each
other, and thereby spoiling one another; for if
there were no separate Apartments, sometimes
in  hasty taking out or putting in of these Co
lours you may disturb the Papers they are com
monly wrapped in so much, that some of the Co
lours will be spilled. The fine or rich Colours,
such as Ultramarine or.Carmine, may rather be
bought in Powder than ground in Oil ; for the
first is worth near four Pounds an Ounce, and
she Carmine, if ’tis good, worth about twenty
Shillings ; therefore it is better, to have these in
Powder, than to have them ground in Oil at
the Colour shops; for by Degrees they will dry,
though in the Bladders, and you will have so
much Loss from them.


The Method to grind these in Oil, is to put
 little of either of them upon,  polished Marble,
and with  Drop or two of Oil mix them well
with  soft bladed Knife, and lay it on your Pal
let but of the Ultramarine aud Carmine  very
little will serve, for the least Touch on the light
Sides of your Drawing, will give  Lustre, to
your Picture; and if it be Ultramarine it will be
lasting, whereas  have  great deal of Reason to
suspect, that the Pruffian Blue will not, if it is
exposed to the Weather, at  have observed in
some Sign-paintings of two, Years standing an









there  find that Colour to change into  dirty
Yellow : But if we mix the Prussian Blue with
Varnish, it will hold and last like Ultramarine ;
in short, the Air must be kept from it to pre
serve it.


If we want to grind any other Colours coarser
than these in their Powder, we must have  Mul
ler, which must be made of one of the hardest
Stones we can get, and finely polished ; Porphyry
would be the best, made in the Shape of  Sugar-
loaf, if one could get it: But for the Shape, the
Sugar-loaf Figure is the easiest fof any One to
turn with their Hand, and every Painter knows the
Way. Marble is good, or any Stone that Will
polish; nay, even Glass, or Crystal, or any such
like Thing; but, if you hive  great Quantity
of Colour to grind, you must consider, that you
must have  large Quantity of Oil, but never so
much as to overcome the Quantity of Colour.
In the Grinding-part you may observe, that the
Colour will frequently turn from under the Mul¬
der, then with  thin Knife scrape it up, and place
it under the Muller again, till 'tis as fine as you
desire it : Then immediately put it into  Piece
of Bladder, first having che Bladder immerged
in warm Water, to soften it ; tie it up, and let
it remain to be used as  have directed the others.


Number  may in its Use be explain’
No.  thus. Let that Partition be lined with Tin,
or Iron tinn', because this is to enclose
the Bladders of Oils, which you should always
keep by you, as Oil of Linseed and Turpentine,
Nut-oyl, and burnt Oil; and in the taking of
these in and' out, the Apartment would be greasy,


and stain the Wood, whereas the Tin will pre-
serve it from any Stain from the Oils.


Number  is in the middle of the Box,


No.  And should be made of tinh’ Iron like











wise, to take out. and put in at pleasure, for 'tis to
contain all the Bladders of oiled Colours; and,
as some of them will be frequently used, the Re
servoir for them must in Time become greasy ;
and over them is to be laid the Pallet, Which,
every Night after you have done your Work,
should be cleaned of the Colours you have put
upon it; or else covered with its Colours in War
ter, to keep them useful till the next Day. To
keep your Pallet clean, rub it with  coarse Lin-
nen-cloath with Oil of Turpentine, and then rub
it till 'tis dry (as one may call it) with Nut or
Lin seed-oil.


But take what tare you will of your Oil-co
lours in small Quantities, when they are exposed
to the Air, there will be  Coat of thick hard
Scale over them in  Day or two, which indeed
one may take off with  Knife ; but we lose much
of the Colour, and some of them are very costly.
When you take off the scaly Part, the rest of the
Colour is fit to use ; and, if it is too thick, then
put  Drop or two of Linseed-oil to it, and mix
it well with your tender Knife. Some People
when they use Ultramarine and Carmine, because
of their great Price, only put  Drop of Oil on
their Pallets and put as much Colour to it as they
think will be enough, only working them together;
with  Knife ; which indeed is more saving, than
to mix it on the Stone.


   . II. How to use the Colours in Painting 
on Glass. 


As the Lines and Shades of your Picture hap
pen to (open, so you ought to dispose your Co
lours, that is, lay on the lighter Colours first on
the light Places of your Prints, and the darker
over the shaded Places; and, if you have once









laid on the brighter Colours, 'tis no great Mat
ter whether the darker Sorts are laid  little over
them : For the first Colour laid on will hide those
you lay on afterwards; as for Example:


YELLOWS.


The lightest Yellow may be laid on first, and
the Dutch Pink Will shade it.


REDS.


The Red-lead may be laid on first, as the bright
est red Colour, and to shade it with Lake or Car
mine, will bring your Picture to  beautiful Scar
let, equal to any Tincture of the finest Dye of
Cochineal.


BLUES.


Lay on first the blue Life, and shade it with
Indigo; or else take Ultramarine, and lay it on
in the Lights, and lhade it with Indigo.


GREENS.


Lay on first some Verdigrease, and then the
Mixture  have mentioned of that and the Dutch
Pink: But you may make this Green as yellow
as you please, by adding more Dutch Pink, as
you see Occasion.


It is to be noted, that, when any of these Co
lours are too strong, they may be lightened to
any Degree, by mixing White with them upon
your Pallet ; or you may darken them, by mix
ing them with the deeper Colours: But they must
be well mixt with the Knife, before you use them.


When you have painted your Glass, it must
stand three of four Days, before it will be dry
enough to put in  Frame.

in sharp Vinegar, and add to it, when it boils, 
little Tartar powdered; which will dissolve the
Verdigrease so* that the Liquor will be of  fine

 Green. Grind some Rock-indigo with Wa ¬
ter, and add to it, in several Parcels, as much
Dutch-pink as you fee convenient, to make your
Greens of various Shades  when these are well
mixr, put to them some Ale-wort thickened by
boiling, and make them-into Pastes, and, when
they will roll, make them into Crayons.


Memorandum. The Reason why these Crayons
are better than commonly those which are bought
at the Shops is, because they are generally made
too stiff with Gums, and so will hardly touch
the Paper; but all these will Work freely, and
express the several Colours you desire.


We must consider, that the Reason why we
make five or six Shades of each Colour is,
because in this Cafe we cannot mix any when we
use them ; whereas in Oil-painting, and painting
in Water-colours, we may make what Mixtures
we please in an instant : And when we set about
any Painting or Drawing in Crayons, which hap¬
pens to have  great Variety of Colour in; it, we
ought not to be without every Sort of Colour that
can be thought on. iVbte, These Colours should be
kept in  Box partitioned, every Sort by itself,viz.-.
' ThtWhite.


Tellows. Lay the brightest Sorts in one, and the
deeper Sorts in another, till'you come towards
the Orange-colours. * . - ''


Orange-Colour^ The lighter Sorts of Orange-co-
lours in Apartment, and the deeper in another.


- Reds. The paler Sorts, or Flesh-colours,- in one


Apartment, the brighter Reds in another, the
stronger Reds in another, and: the .deepest Reds in
another, every one with its proper Shades, till we
Come towards Purple. - . - * .


- Purples. The paler Sorts inclining to red in one
Apartment, the next Sorts, more inclining to blue;
in another, with their Shades; and these which are


 next

  ]


niext to blue with their Shades, in  Part by them¬
selves. -


Blues should follow the Purples. Put the light¬
est Preparations in the first Apartment the next
Degree' into another,  third into another, and
the fourth, to the last, into others : But keep the
Pruffian-blue quite by itself, and its Mixtures by
themselves; it'serves very well in this Way to
supply the place of Ultramarine; and, as it is
much cheaper,  forbear to mention the Use
of Ultramarine-blue in this Cafe, which is ex¬
travagant in the Price ; for  Crayon of it could
not be made under half  Guinea': And be¬
sides, in this Way of Crayon-drawing, the'Pre¬
paration of Pr«flian-blue does very well an¬
swer the fame End though ' that Colour will
not do in Water-colours, nor even last in
Oil-colours, if it comes to be exposed to the
Weather- for in either Case it changes to  dirty
Yeliow-colour ; but  find that the Crayons hold,
by being imbodied as  have directed.


Greens should be divided into three or four
Sorts, and, with their Shades, be laid in several
Apartments.


Browns should be likewise put in three or sour
Parcels, with their .proper Shades, ’ to be laid in
each Apartment of one great Box. And you should
never be without Crayons of Charcole in ano¬
ther Cafe. With all these you will be compleat-
ly.furnished -, and, when you go out to take any
View, have one of every Sort in  little Bo*, di¬
vided as the foregoing, to carry in your Pocket.


The Paper, which you should use on this Oc-
casion/^hould be Venice rough Paper, almost like
our whitest brown Paper,or even the whitest brown
Paper which they fell at every Chandlers-shop;
the stiffer it is the better;' that which they call
Cap-paper is the best, as  have found by Expe-
  rience

rience ; for upon such the Colours easily distri¬
bute themselves. And by this Means every one
may take Figures in their proper Colours as they
fee them ; for they may match the Colours as
they appear with the Crayons they have by them »
and, as the Crayons arc dry, they will not alter
their Colour, but the wetted Colours will appear
deeper when they are wet, than when they arp
dry, which will deceive the Eye of  Beginner.


Instructions for the Use os Crayons. -
Remember when you use these Crayons, that
you point them front the bqttom upwards, and
make not the Points too sharp, unless in thfc
white Chalk, the red Qker, and the Charcole.
One may make  pretty Drawing on blue Pa-


: with only Chalk and Charcole -, the strong
ights and the dark Shades make  sine Contrast,


. and  pleasant Appearance in  Drawing.

The part of the Metal which we design to
japan in Colours should not be polished; but
'disparts of the Metal, which ought to be polisli-
ed, should be done first, or else, if we poliih
them after the painting, some of the Colour may
be disturbed or taken off. The first Proof  saw
of this Work was  Pair of Scizzars, where, from
the' Blades to the Rings, there were the Figures
of Storks holding the Rings ih their 'Mouths,
which Rings were of Silver;' do hot know that:
 ever saw any thing so genteel;' and the Gentle-*

   IX. The Method of Glazing Prints with
•white Varnish, so as to bear Water, and the Polish.


It is best in this Way, first to paste your Print
on  Board, or  Piece of Shock-cloth strained
on  Frame ; to do this well, prepare some stiff
Starch, and with  Sponge, dipt in Water or thin
Starch, wet the back of your Print, and, if
you ‘design to lay it on  Board, dip  large
Brush in the thick Starch, and brush it over the
Board as even as possible, and let it dry ; then 
second Time repeat the same Work, and so con¬
tinue till the Veins or Grain of the Wood is quite
filled: In the last Operation, when the Starch is
just laid on, lay upon it your wet Print as equal¬
ly as possible, so that there appear no Bubbles in
it, press it close every where till it lyes smooth,
and so let it dry. In this Operation your Hands
must be very clean,.or else you will foil the Print;
in about twenty four Hours it will be dry
enough to varnish with the following, viz.


IVbite Varnish for Prints.


Take of Iflhyocolla, or Isinglass, or Fi/-glue, as
some call it, four Ounces, and pull.it into small
Pieces, boil this in  Quart of Brandy, or strong
Spirits, in  glazed Pipkin; and when, by taking
out  little, you find it will make  strong Glue,
by being  little exposed to the Air, it will do
for your Purppse ; but be sure to make it as
strong as you can ; and, while it is hot, with 
large Brush, wash over the Print as quick as
possible, and as smooth as may be -, let this
stand  Day, and then brush it over again with
the same, Varnish, or Glue, and let it dry very


well ;


Digitized byCjOO^lC


  •  then brusti it over with white Varnish, at
such  Distance from the Fire that it may not be
too hot, or else it will blister, and do this two or
three times over ; then set it by for  Day or
two, and brush it over with white Varnish again
three or four times, and let it stand  Day or two ;
then varnish it  third Time with two or three
Passages of the Brusti, and in three or four Days
polilh it with  soft Linnen-clotb and some fine
Tripoli, rubbing it very gently, till it remains
as smooth as possible, and clear it with Flour
and oil; it will then appear aS bright as Chrystal;
and, if it should at any time be annoyed by Flies,
you may wassi it with  Sponge and Water, which
will clean it.


The white Varnijh.


Take Gum-fandarack of the clearest and whitest
Sort onePound, Gum-mastickof the clearest Sort
one Ounce, Gum Sarcacolla the whitest one Ounce
and half, Venicc-Turpentine three Ounces, Ben¬
zoin the clearest half an Ounce, white Rezin
half an Ounce, Gum-animæ an Ounce and half ;
these must be dissolved and mixe in the follow¬
ing Manner :


Put your Sarcacolla, and Rezin into  little
more Spirits than will cover them to dissolve;
then put your Gum-animæ, Benzoin, and Venice
Turpentine into  Glass, or glazed Vessel, and
pour on as much Spirit as will cover them an Inch,
then provide  glazed Vessel, or Glass, for your
Gum-mastickand Sandarack, and pour on them'
strong Spirits, enough to cover them about an
Inch, to dissolve them rightly ; then, in  distinct
Vessel, of the fame Sort as before, put your Gum-
elemi, and cover it with Spirits to dissolve. {In this
  Pro-


Digitized by GOOglC


 »»]


Process, you need only pulverize the Gums AnL
mat, Sarcacolla and Benzoin, and you may break
the Rczin  little.] While these are dissolving,
for three or sour Days, shake the Bottles twice or
thrice each Day, then put all these togejther in 
glazed Vessel, stirring them well, and strain the Li¬
quor and Gums gently, beginning with the Gums,
through  Linnen-cloth ; [This will prevent any
Dirt getting into your Varnish] then put it into
 Bottle, and let it stand  Week before you use
ir, and pour off as much of the clear only, as you
think you shaH want for present Use.


To paste Prints upon Cloth for Varnishing.


If you put your Print upon Shock-cloth well
strained in  Frame, brush over your Cloth with
strong Paste, made with Flour and Water, and
immediately brush over the back of your Print
with well prepared Starch ; and then as readily
brush the Cloth over again with the same Starch,
and lay on your Print as equally as possible, with-
, out letting any Bubbles or Blisters appear in
the Paper ; but you must observe, tba^, when
you lay on your Paper upon the Cloth, $ both
the Cloth and the Paper are then wet, however
close you lay the Paper to the Cloth, they will
both together appear slagging, and unstrained,,
yet, as soon as they are dry, all will Bp smooth,.
£ either was at the first : Let them remain so in
 dry, warm Place for  Day or two, and then.
varnish ypur Print,, as before directed, with Glue:
ryade of jcthyocolla, and then with the white Var-'

let these stand together two Days, shaking them
often  therr take  Jelly-bag, or  Flannel-bag
made like what is called Hippocrates'^ Sleeve, and
pass it through, letting the Liquor drop into 
Receiver, and squeezing the Gums every now
and then ; when the Varnish is almost but of the
Bag, add more, and press it gently, till all is
strained, and the Dregs remain dry ; [Take care-'

idly, Lay on your Colours ? smooth as possi¬
ble, and, if-the Varnish .has any Blisters in it,’take
them off by  Polish with Rushes,


Digitized by GOOglC


[J When you varnish, keep your Work
warm but not too hot.


 In Laying on of your Varnish, begin in
the Middle, and stroke the Brush to the Outside,
then to another extreme Part, and so on till all
is covered ; for the Brush if you was to begin at
the Edges would leave Blots there, and make the
Work unequal.


Stbly, In fine Works, use the finest Tripoli to '
polish ; do not polish your Work at one Time,
but, after the first polishing, let it dry two or
three Days, and polish again for the last Time.


 In the first Polishing you must use 
good deal of Tripoli, bur in the next  very lit¬
tle will serve ; wash off your Tripoli with 
Sponge and Water ; dry your Varnish with  dry
Linnen rag, and clear your Work with Oil,
Whiting, and Lamp-black.


SECT. . To take ‘off the Figure from any
Piete of China-Ware, though the Person has not
be'tn acquainted with Drawing.


When-you have any Figures to your liking
upon any China-difh, Cup, Plate, or luch like,
you must lay  Piece of oiled Paper over them,
so as to hold the Piece steady, till you can trace
out the Lines of the Figures; then lay the oil¬
ed Paper on  Paper blacked on one side,
and the blacked Paper on  clean Paper ; then
trace the Lines with  Pen, or blunted Point
of  Needle, till the Lines are all impressed on
the white Paper, and draw them over with  black
Lead-pencil, and mark the Shades, where they
separate from the light Parts of the Colour, that
so you may lay on your Colours as you lee them
painted on the China-ware; then cut out your
Figures close to the Out-lines, and fix them upon

your Ground of Whiting and Size, of Si? with
ground Chalk, with thick Gum-arabick and Wa¬
ter, and, when they are quite dry, paint them,
the lighter Parts in Water-colours, and the shady
Parts with Varnilh mixed with the darker Co¬
lours ; when these are dry, walh all over with the
white Varnilh before  Fire, but not so hot as
to make the Varnilh rife in Blisters ; when the
Varnilh is dry, lacker it again with the fame
Varnish, and repeat it  third Time; theft
scrape some Tripoli very fine, and with  soft
Rag, dipt in Water, take up  little of the
Tripoli at  time, and polilh it, by gentle rub¬
bing, till ’tis smooth, then walh off the Tripoli
with  soft Sponge and Water, and then, with 
dry fine Cloth, wipe off the Tripoli, and, when
that is dry, clean it with Whiting and Oil, if it
is  white Varnilh; or, with Oil and Lamp¬
black, where the Varnilh is black.


But the common Way is to cut out Prints, and
paste them on such Parts as we think fit, and
then colour them with Water-colours, and var¬
nilh them with white Varnilh. ’Tis an easy Way
of Painting, because the Shades of the Prints,
when you lay on  transparent Water-colour,
will give the Light and Shade that Colour to your
purpose, without using  dark and light Colour.


SECT.. XI. Some remarkable Directions in


Colouring of Draughts or Prints in Japanning,


‘' as Flowers, Birds, Fruits,, &.


If you have Prints or Drawings in black and
white of Flowers ; if the Centre of the Flower
is rising, just touch the Edges of the Lights with
 thin Tincture of Gamboge, and lay on some
- ' Dutch-*


Digitized by CjOO^lC





  ]


Dutch-pink, or Gall-stone, over the Shades, so
as to ran into the Lights . very little.  fay this
because the Thrums in the Middle of Flowers
arc generally Yellow, but if of any other Colour,
as by Observation  find they are sometimes Blue,
sometimes more light, and sometimes darker,
then touch on the Verges of the Lights  little Ul* .
tramarine-bkie, and over the Shades either some
Sanders.-blue, to run  very little into the Ultra¬
marine, or else shade with Indigo; and, some of
the White of the Print being left void of Colour,
will then give  Life and Spirit to the Colours
so disposed..


All Flowers should be tenderly touched in the
Lights, just co give  little Glare into the light
Parts of the Colouryou would give to the Flower-
Lcaves', and, if you- have  natural Flower to
paint by, yomwiil presently see, that on the shady
Side you must lay on the most shady Part,
such.  Colour as will force the rest to appear
forward ; but do not dawb over the Shades with
too heavy  Colour, let it be such as may be
transparent, if possible, and scumble it into the
light Colour, which Was laid on before; use your
Pencil lightly on this Occasion, with  very little
Gum-watcr in it, and use it before the Colours
are quite dry.


In the Painting of the Leaves of Herbs or
Plants, we ought to have regard to the Colours
of the Greens; the brightest is the Verdigrease-
green, described in my former Book relating to Paint¬
ing in Water-colours; we should touch that Colour
 little into the light Parts of the Leaf; .from the
Place where the lighter Parts of the Shades end 
and then lay oh some Sap-green, on the shady
Parts, so as to unite with, the Verdigreasc-green ;
and if the natural Leaf should be of  darkish


Colour,

   touch the lighter Sides of the Leaves
with  little Verdigrease-greep, and Dutch yel¬
low Pink mixt together, or with  Tincture of
French Berries, .bat fq . as ,to Jet phe Verdigrease

The Leaving the Lights;'tvhehwe coteut -'
Print, has two Advantages,’ #/?.'' - <


If we leave the Lights on this Oscafwo, the
Whiteness of; the Paper serves'instead of thWLse
of white Paint, which is an heavy Colour, and
would rather iconfaund the ,E qftthe' CpJfOiifis,*
which  have prescribed tpj bp laid op, ch^ do

enough to hide both the Lights and the ^ade^
and then it remains like  Ppnny picture, where .

In  Word, when you are about such Pieces
of Work, scumble the Lights into the Shades of
every Colour, and save the Middle of the Lights
open on the Papers, for, as the Paper is white of
itself, it makes  Light.
