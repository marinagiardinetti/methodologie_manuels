DIRE CTIONs for preparing the following Singls
Ciolours.
WHIT ES.
The beft White for painting in Water-Colours,
is Flake Whife. Some recommend  White made
of Pearl and Cyffer-Shells, brought to an impalpable
Powder, called  Pearl White, which will mix well
with any Colour. If you afe Whice Lead, clarify
  .
at: with White Wine Vinegar; after the Whise is
fettled,
pour off the Vinegar, and wath it with
Water, thus:: Put the Powder into  Glats of
ater, fir it and prefently pour the Water off while
it is white, into another clean Glafs, when it is

settled pour off the Water, and you will have an exe
cellent White; to which add as much Gum, as is
neceffary to give it  Gloss.
: It has been often noticed that White Lead will
turn black, if mixed with Water that comes from
Iron or Clay; to that in the Space of  Month or
TWo, you may perceive it; and it will alfo change
any Colour, with which it is mixed.
It is recommended by some to rake the Powder of
Egg- Shells, of the brighteft and whiteft Sort,
well ground with Gum-Water, to the State of
 impalpaple Powder, to which add one twenrieth
Part of White Sugar-candy; others efteem it moff
when clarified in Spirits of Wine, and then ufe it
with Gum-Water.
It has been found by repeated Experience, that
 Egg-shell Powder is extremely ferviceable as  in Water-Colours: and thatithis, and the
Oyfter-shell Powder rectified; and well bruifed, will
make an excellent Mixture with other Colours, to
keep them from changing.
 fine White for Water-Colours may he made
by diffolving Filings of Silver, or Silver Leat, in
Aqua-Fortis, evaporating the Aqua;Fortis, till it
appears like Chryffal in the Bottom of the Glass:
Decant the other Part of the Aqua-Fortis, and walls
the Silver four or five Times in pure Water, till it is
entirely cleaned from the Aqua-Fortis, drying it
for Ufe. It muft be afed with the Waters of Cum
and Sugar-candy.
 good Whire for Water-Colours proper for Mi-
slature is made thus: Take  Pound of the Shred-
dings


 

 of Glove-Leather, and ffeep them in Water,
Boil them with twelve Quarts of Water, till it waltes
so two; ftrain it through  Linen. Cloth, into
 well-glazed earthen Pan: This is called CGlue
or Size, and proper to ufe with Colours in Candle-
Light Pieces; to know if this be ffrong enough,
feel if it is ftiff and firm under your Hand.
The Glue being melted, reduce fome White
halk to  Powder; and while it is hor, add fuch
 of Chalk, as will bring it to the Con-
Liftency of  Pafte; leiring it fleep for  Quarter
of an Hour,, fir it with  Bruth made of Heg'
Briftles.
In order to make this Whire brighter, add more
Eylac. Be careful to obferve that every Layer be dry,
before you put on another. If you work upon Wood,
you muft put on  Dozen; but fix or feven is fuffi-
crent, if your Paper is thick. Afterwards dip  foft
 in fome Water, draining it with your Fin=
gers, ruh the Work with it, in order to make it the
Smoother. When your Bruth is full of White, you
muft wath it again, and alfo change the Water,
exhen it is too white. Or you may ufe  wet Linen
Rag. intlead of  Bruth,
    .
In some Objects there may be seen  fhining, like
That of Gold; through Colours of Red, Blue, or
GGreen, such as some Sort of Flies, or Beetles, and
the Cansharides. This Grold Tranfparency may be
very welk imifared, by laying some Leaf-Gold on
the shaded Side of the Drawing, giving  little to the
light Side. To lay on the Gold Leaf, press it
Tmrooth and clofe with Cotton, after you have
walked it with trong Gum-Water. But Care muff
be taken that in laying on the Gum, you do not

exceed the Limits through which you would have
the Gold appear. In this Cafe, the Gold is only to
thing

 through the tranfparent Colour, which is to
be laid over. it.
As Leaf-Gold will not receive Water-Colours re-
fularly, it is necelfary to be provided with Water
of Ox-Gall; and with this Liquor to froke over the
Gold Leafs by which it will receive any Colour
you are defirous of laying over it, and will alfe
Tetain it.
In June and July, there may be found upon Rofe=
Trees,  Kind of Beetle, of  Gold and Green Co=
Jour, which may prove extremely serviceable in this
Kind of Painting; but in ufing your Gold, it will be
beft to polith it, in this Manner.
In Tome Manufcripts there may be feen Gold
Letters, which feem to rife above the Surface of
the Paper.
The Compofition which raifes them

is made of Vermilion, and the White of an Egzs
beat to the Confiffience of an Oil, and fixed  Paper with Gum Arabic: On this figurative
Letter, wath fome flrong Gum-Water, with  Hair Pencil; lay on the Gold Leaf clote
with fome Cotton: and when dry, rub it again with
Cotton, and burnifh it with  Dog' Tooth; and
it will appear as if it was really caft in Gold.
There is alfo another Way of working in Gold,
which is performed by Shell-Gold (but then it muft
be pure, and not that brought from Germany,
which turns green in  few Days). Cover the
Shady Parts with Vermilion, before you ufe this
Gold; and when you have rectified it with Spirits of
Wine, lay it on; when dry, burnifh it as before
directed.
In laying on this Gold, it is beft to leave the
Lights without it, as it will appear to  much greater
Advantage, than if all the Object was covered: But
providing the whole Performance should chance to
be covered, the beft Way of fetting it off, is to trace
DVeF



 the fhady Parts with Gall-Stone, or the  of French Berries (of which we shall treat
hereafter), heightened with Mlnium.
Having treated thus much upon Gold, we shall
now Speak of Yellows in general. Gambodge is, be-
youd doubt, one of the melloweff Colours Nature
has produced: It is of to mild  Temperature, that
when it is touched with any Fluid, it inftantly
diffolves; to that confequently if wants neither
gumming nor grinding: It is productive of  Va-
riety of the moft agreeable and pleafant Yellow
Fints, that Fancy or Art could ever imagine; it
vill generally fhade itfelf; though you will fome:
simes find in the Description of Flowers it requires
Felp.
Gall-Rone is  very rich deep Fellow, tending

towards  Brown. it is exceeding ufeful in many
Cafess needs but little gumiming or grinding; works

 but will not thade itfelf.
RIT. Boyle fays, if you cut the Roots of Ber-
)
Beriies, and put them into  ffrong Lixivium made

of Fearl-Afhes and Water, from them will preceed

& FD&
SVary agreeable Fellow:  his Experiment has often
been made and as often attended with Succels.
Ffe alfo gives an Account of another fine tranf-
Barent Yellow, by boiling the Root of  Mulberry:
 well cleanfed, in the foregoing Lixivium.

 Fellow-Ochre makes  very good Pale Yellow;

and being
ground with (um-Water, will prove ex.
treiely ufeful.
Bnother very ufefyl Yellow, is made by in-
fufing the Plant Celandine in clear Water, gently

preing it, adding to the Liquor fome Alum-Water,
letting it boil.

Ounces of French Berries gill the Liquor is of  fine
Fellow; strain it from the Yellow Berries, and
when cold it is fit for iIfe. To the Berries put  of the Jame Lixivium, and boil it till the
Liquor is as Rrong as Gall-fones, with which
you may fhade any Yellows. This you may boil
till it comes to  Brown, and will, with the Addition
of  little Ox-Gall, ferve to fhade the Gold Leaf.
You may likewife make  Yellow, by infufing
Saffron in pure Water. When this is, steeped in
reclified Spirits of Wine, there is nothing higher;
but it is very apt to fy, unless it is high-gummed.
 good Fellow for the Illumination of Prints may
be extracted from the Roots of Cringer, which makes
 good Green, when mixed with tranfparent Verdi-
grife.
Thole Vellows, called Englifh and Dutch Pinks,
are made with French Berries ground to  fine Poty-
ter, and then boiled.
OR ANGE COLOUR.
This Colour is made of  Mixture of Vermilion
and Gambodge, the latter moft predominant; in
which you are prefented with  pleafant and service-
able Colour in painting Lillies, and allother Orangeâ€”
Colour Flowers.
 ED .
Minium, or Red Lead, is  flrong heavy Co-
lour, Mr. Boyle has given us the following Di-
rections for preparing it Put four Ounces in
 Glais, to  Quart of Rain-Water, and when
it has been thoroughly firred, pour off the Wa-
fer; and by  frequent Repetition of this, there
will





 remain at the Bottom of the Glats  beautiful
Red when dry; which is to be ufed with Gums
Water. When the Colour has been thus prepared;
you muft not expect above twenty Grains to remain
Sut of four Ounces.
Carmine affords the brightelf and moft perfect
Crimson, and is the moft beautiful of all Reds; for
with this Colour and Lake you may make the Shades
 ttrong as you pleafe. This Colour should never
be purchafed but by Day-light; for if it is not good,
it will but fpoil your Work.
Lake is  fine tran(parent Colour, not much in-
ferior to Carmine but in painting with Carmine on
That Part of the Print, on which the Light is fup-
pofed to ftrike, lay on fo light  Tint, as  fcarce
vifible; working it fronger as it orows darker, and
souch it in the darker Parts with Lake.
Lake may be bought at moft Colour-fhops ready
repared in Shells for Warer-Colours: But if you
are defirous of making it yourfelf, it is necefiary to
adhere to the following Directions.
Having prepared  Lixivium made with the Afhes
of Vine-Twigs, to three Pints of it, add  Pound of
the beft ground Brafil Wood, boil it till half the
Lixivium is evaporated, ftrain it off; boil it again
with the Addition of four Ounces of freth Brafil
ood, two Ounces of Cochineal, Half an Dunce
of Terra Marita, and  Pint of fair Water, let it
evaporate as before: Add half an Ounce of calcined
lum (reduced to an impalpable Powder)  Quarter
of  Drachm of Arfenick: diffolve them in it, by
stirring it with  Stick, when fettled ftrain it off.
To give this  Body, reduce two Cutle-fith Bones
to  Powder, and putting it in, let it dry leifurely.

drying it on  Piece of Marble.
If you would have this Lake redder, add fome of
the Juice of  Lemon; and to make it deeper, add
Oil of Tartar.
nother Lake. Boil the Shreds of Cuperfine Scar-
let Cloth in  Lie made of the Afhes of burnt
Tartar, when fufficiently boiled, add fome Cochi-
eal, powdered Maftich, and Rocheâ€”Alum, boil this
again  while it is quite hot, ftrain it through  Bag

feveral Limes. The firft Time, the Bag muft be
Rrained from Top to Bottom, and the remaining
grofs Master being taken out, let the Bag be well
wathed; after this, ftrain the Liquor through the
Bag again, and you will find  Paffe remaining on
the Sides, which divide into small Cakes, and fet by
for ufe.
Another Lake. Steep four Ounces of the beft
Brafil Wood in  Pint and  Half of the fineft
diffilled Vinegar, for three Weeks at leaft, tho' the
longer it remains the better it is; feeth the Whole
in Balneum Marix, till it boils up three or four
Times; let it fettle for  Day or two, put it to an
Ounce of powdered Alum, and into  clean Pan with
the Liquor, let it remain for twenty-four Heurs;
heat the Compofition, and fir it till it as cold whern
it has ftood about twelve Hours, ffrain it, and add
two Cuttle-fish Bones, prepared as before.
 Liquid Colour of  very good Crimfon may
be made as follows. In twelve Ounces of pale ftale
Beer, boil one Ounce of ground Brafil Wood till the
Colour is as firong as you defire; frain it through 
Linen Cloth, and bortle it up for Ofe. If you want
to bring this Colour to  Body, take some dried Ox-
blood reduced to  Powder, and mix it with the
Colour.



 have the following Directions from Mir. Boyls,
for extracting  fine Crimfon from the Berry:bearing
Spinach, which, being preffed, affords  very agree-
able Juice; to which add  fourth Part of Alum,
boil it, and when cold it is fit for Ufe.
Or you may extract  very beautiful Red, from
the Red Beetreot, baked with  little frong Vine-
gar and Alum, when cold it is fit for tIfe.
Another Way to make  Crimfon Put twenty (or
more) Grains of bruifed Cochineal into  Gallipot,
with as many Drops of the Lne of Tartar, as will
make it give forth its Colour; add to this Mixture
about Half  Spoonful of Water, or more, and you
evill have  very agreeable Purple; reducing fome
Alum to  very fine Powder, put it to the Purple
Eiquor, and you will have as beautiful  Crimfon:
Strain it through  fine Cloth, ufe it as foon  for though this is  Colour, which if foon
sifed looks extremely well, yet by long flanding is
subject to decay.
PU. PL  .
Take eight Ounces of Logwood,  Pint of Rain.
Warer, and an Ounce of Alam, infufe it well over
allow Fire in  well-glazed Pan, or Pipkin, for about
Quarter of an Ounce of
swenty-four Hours; add  
sum Arabic; let it fland for  Week, ftrain it
through  Piece of fine Cloth. Keep it clofe, or it
vill mould.
Or you may make  redder Purple by adding to
one Ounce of the above, four Ounces of Brafil
Wood, and  Pint of Htale Beer, boiling it till the
Liquor is as ffrong as you defire. It may be made
Larker by adding more Logwood.
The


 richeft Purple is made by blending Carmine
and Pruffian Blue, or Indigo, to what Shade you
pleafe.
    .
Titramarine is the beft and brighteff Blue prepare
fix Ounces of the Lapis Lazuli till is
it by heating
is red; cool it in ftrong Vinegar; grind it with 
Stone and Muller to an impalpable Powder; then
make  Composition of Bees-Wax, Refin, Linfeed
Dil, and Furpentine, of each three Ounces; in-
corporate the Whole together over  flow Fire, till
it is near boiling; pour them into  Pan well glazed.
This is called the Pafte of Ultramarine. The Lapis
Lazuli being prepared, add to it an equal Quantity
of the Paftil, or Pafte; mix them together thorough-
ly, and let them remain twelve Hours; to eka
tract the Ultramarine from the Pafte, pour clear
Water upon it, preffing the Pafte with your Hlands,
the Ultramarine will come out; for its Reception
place  Glats Tumbler under your Hland; let it
fettle in this Water till the Ultramarine finks to the
Bottom.
If the Colour feems foul, cleanfe it thus. Dif-
folve fome Tartar in Water; add as much of it to
the Ultramarine as will cover it; let it sland twelve
Hours; wath it in warm Water, and you will have
your Colour well clarified and perfectly clean. Ler
your Ultramarine be of  high Colour, and well
ground, Next to Ultramarine in Beauty is Pruffiam
Blue, when ufed in Oil, though it will not fland fo

long, its not having the Body of Ultramarine. The
Pruffian Blue does not grind Kindly with Water, on
account of its oily Subltance.
Blue






-
 Bice is  Colour of  very good Body, and
fows very agreeably in the Pencil; wath it aca
cording to the Rules laid down for Ultramarine.
Blue Verditure is  very bright pleafant Blue, of
 good Body, and works very well when ground with
Gum-Water. It is  little inclineable to and makes
 very good Green, when ground with Gambodge,
or French Berries. This Blue is moftly ufed for  of  Garment.
Saunders Blue is extremely serviceabie in the Shad=
ing of Ultramarine, where no very dark Shades ap-
pear; when they do, you may add  little Indigo
 it.
Litmofe is  very agreeable Elue; to prepare it,
Quart of Small Beer Wort, in which boil
Lake  
two Ounces of Litmofe, sill the Colour is as frong
 you require; pour the Liquor into  glazed
Pipkin, and it will foon congeal.
Indige is the Carkeff Blue, is  foft free Colour,
and runs very warm in the Pencil; it requires to be
well wished and ground, and may be made darker or
lighter by the Addition of more or leis Gum-Water.
Care is required in the ufing this Colour; for, as we
before hinted, its running to free may be  Mleans of
deceiving the Student, and prove too dark for the
Completion of his Defires.
Mr. Royle has given us the following Directions
for making  very fine Coloer of the blue Leaves of
Rue, by prefting, bruifing, and infsfing both Leaves
and Juice in pure Water, for  Fortnight, washing
them every Day; incorporating them and the Wa-

The pracuring of the Flowers, and the Preffure of

in curing of which it would appear, that each
Time the Cake was turned, the Flowers would
be darker, till they became  dark Blue. Great
Lare is required during this Operation, that the Fire
be kept very conftant and gentle, that the Flowers

Way of bringing the Flowers to Perfectim.

 proper Blacks for Water Colours are a fol=
low; Lvory Black, which is prepared in the fol=
lowing Manner: Let the lvory Black be tho-
roughly ground, and there will naturally proceed
from it  Liquor of an oily Subftance; mix as much
of it as will make it work freely in the Pencil. It
has  fine Glofs, and is extremely ferviceable in
painting of fhining Objects.
There is another very agreeable and ufeful Black
called Keating' Black, and may be had at moft Co-
four- Shops ready prepared.
Indian Ink is  very good Black, and of great
Service, as it may be laid on to any Shade, and will
always fhade itfelf, on which Account it is often
ifed for Drawings.

to
Sap-Green is  Colour extremely ferviceable,
and the beft Green for Water-Colours our Age
affords; being of  gummy Subftance, and dilating
eafily


 
eatily in Water; it produces an endlefs Variety of
of
Lints, and has the Advantag
ge of thading itfelf., In
the purchafing this Colour, remember to obferve,
That it looks very black and bright.
 Sea or Artificial Green is made, by mixing
Indigo and Sap-Green, which may be made darker
or lighter by adding more or less Indigo: It is 
very serviceable Colour, eafily worked, and pro-
ductive of many Tints. This Colour, as well as
Sap-Green, fhades itfelf. The indigo muft be well
ground, before you mix it.
Another is made with Indigo and Gambodge
well ground together, extremely ufeful in painting
of Trees, Grats, Vegetables, &ic. with the Addition
of Sap-Green it is very ferviceable in Flowers
and shading of Garments.
 tranfparent Green is made by mixing Verdi-
grife and Yellow to Various Tints, by leaving
either predominant.

Biffre is  good and serviceable Colour; the beft
Sort is very bright and clofe; as it is  Colour diffi-
cult to work of itfelf, mix  little Spanish Liconce
with it, that will mellow and take off its Harthness.
It muft be well ground, and the higher it is gummed,
the better for Ufe.
Spanith Licorice is allowed by the beft Mafters to
be productive of  great Variety of Brown Tints, of
 very agreeable Colour; it will not shade itfelf, but
works as free as any um Colours, by dilating it
in fair Water.
 brown Mixture is made by incorporating Sap-
Green and Carmine, which is of an extraordinary foft
Nature. It is  Colour extremely ferviceable, as you

DIRECTIONS for using the Colours.
wills; and
Your Pencils muft be fatt in their 
sharp pointed (after you have drawn them thro' your
Mouth) not apt to part in the Middle.
Before you begin, have all your Colours ready,
and  Pallet for the Conveniency of mixing them,
 Paper to lay your Hand, as well as try your
Colours upon, alfo  large Bruth called  Fitch to
wipe off the Duft from them.
Being prepared according to the foregoing Mc-
thod, proceed in your Painting, which if  Land-
Icape, lay on firft dead Colours all over your Piece,
leaving no Part uncovered: And in this Part of the
 there needs no great Pains, but  mat-
terly Freedom is rather required; and the Work,
though


  feemingly rough upon  clofe Inspection,
vill have  good Effect; when placed at  Diftance,
Ler not the Roughness of the Work difcourage you,
for it is eafily fofsened by Degrees, with the other
Shadows, obferving only to fweeten, mellow, and
heighten them as the Light falls.
In some Places lay on ftrong and mafterly Fouches,
and in thofe Places bring up your Work to an equal
Roundnets and Strength; tempering and sweetening
your Coloars with  sharper Pencil than the firft, shat
no Lumps or harth Edges be left, but that all your
Shadows may lie differted, foft, and Limooth, gliding
gently into one another.
You are not to finith any one Part firft, but
work up every Part gradually alike, till you fee no-
thing wanting to complete your Piece.
Tlaving laid your dead Colours, begin next with
 lighteff Parts, as the Sky, Sun-beams,
 the yellowith Beams, with Mafficet,
Blese
Whice; next the Blueness of the Sky with
Verditure alone: For Purple Clouds mis only
your Colours deeper as
Lake and White, making
they go upwards from the Horizon, except in tem-
peftuous Skies. The Tops of diftant Rhountains
muft be worked to faint, that they may feem to lofe
Themfelves in the Air.
Bring your Colours forward, as your Diftance de-
creafes; painting your firft Ground next the Hori-
 downwards, of bluith Sea-Green, and as you
advance forwards, of  darker Green, till you come
so the Fore-Ground itfelf, which as it is the darkeff
Part of all, with dark Green, worked in tuck  as to give the appearance of Shrubbery,
E painting of Trees, having firft laid  Verdis
grife Green for  dead Colour, proceed with work-
 it, to as to give  leaty Appearance; feeming is
hang





 free and natural, especially towards the Edges;
where you may touch  few Leaves clofe to the
&
Tree, which will give your Performance  mafterly
Kiffect. Bring some of your Leaves forward with
Mafficot and Whice: For the Trunk, work the
Brown with Sap-reen; if you should introduce
Oak Trees, lay on fome Touches, to exprets Leaves
of Ivy twined about it.
All diffant Objects are to be made imperfect as
they appear to the Kye.

 with one Pint of pure Water
and half an
Ounce of the fineff Roche-Alum, till diffcived. This
is  very ferviceable Liquor, with which you may
temper thofe Colours intended for  as it will
prevent them from cracking.
To make  Selution of Gum.
Diffolve an Ounce of the beft Whice Gum Arabic,
and half an Ounce of double-refined Sugar, in  of Springâ€”Water, ftrain it through  Piece of
Muffin; then bottle it off for Ufe, keeping it free
from Duft.
Another Method.
Take the whiteff Sort of Gum Arabic, bruife and
tie it in  Piece of Woollen Cloth, feep it in Spring
Water till diffolved. If too fiff, which is Known by
the fhining of the Colours, add more Water, if too
weak more Gum. With this Water you may tem=

not come off.
To make Sixe for Candle Light Pieces. See Fage   keep the Flies from your Work.
Having prepared your Gum-Water according to
either of the preceding Directions, add  little Con
loquinteda, which, if your Performance should be
expoted, will keep it from being damaged by the
Flies.
To prepare Alum-Water.
Take four Ounces of Roche-Alum, and  Pint
of pure Spring Water, boil it till the Alum is tho-
roughly diffolved; filter it through  Brown Paper,
and it is fit for Ufc. Before you lay on the Colours
take some of this Water hot, and with  Spongs wet
the Back of the Paper, which if it is not good muft
be werted three or four times. This will not only
prevent the finking of the Colours, but will alfo
keep them from fading, and give an additional Beauty
and Luffre. Remember that the Paper muff be dried
each Time before you wet it again.
To make Lime Water
Put some unlaked Lime in  well glazed Pan,
cover it with pure Water, one Inchabove the Lime,
let it remain fo for one Day; then ftrain off the
Water and keep it for ufe by the Means of this
Water you may change Sap-Green into Blue.
To make  Lixivium of Pearl Afpes.
Steep half an Ounce of Pearl Affies in Rain of
Spring Water for one Day, frain off the Water as
  as poffible; this Infulion will prove extremely
ferviceable in many Colours, particularly Brafil-
Wood, to which it will give an additional Beauty
and Luffre.
To recover decayed Colours.
Take double-diftilled Refemary-Water, or pure
Effence of Rofemary, and with  few Drops temper
your Colours, which however dead and faded will
recover their primitive Brilliancy; this Effence will
prevent the Bubbles which are troublesome in grind-
ing White and Umber.
To prepare Liquid Geld for Vellum-Painting, Fans, EsC.
Hlaving procured fome of the finelt Leaf Gold,
grind it with frong Gum-Water, adding more
Gum-Warer as you fee requifite; when thoroughly
ground, temper it with  small 
uantity of Mercury
Dublimate, kinding it in the Shell with  little dif-
folved Gum; (pread it equally over the Shell, and
ife it with fair Wateronly.
 Liquid Silver, for the same Use.
The Manner of making this is the same as that of
Liquid Gold, only remembering to temper it with
the Glaire of Eggs, and not Water.
To make the Glaire of Eggs.
Beat the Whites with  Spoon, till they rife in 
Foam; let them fand twelve Hours, and they will
beclarified into good Claire.

Lake the new Shreds of Parchment (they being
preferable to Glove Leather) boil them in  Quart
of Spring Water till confumed to  Pint; Itrain
the Size from the Shreds, and put it into  well-
glazed Pan; ufe it before it is cold; be careful when
you lay on your Silver or Gold, that your Size is not
 moift nor too dry, for in either cafe you will
be in Danger of impairing your Performance.
To take the Impression of the Wings of  Butterfly in all

hard, let them remain under Preffure for an Hours
afterwards take off the Wings of the Butterffy, and
you will find  perfect Imprestion of them with all
their various Colours remaining on the Paper. Draw
between the Wings of the Impreftion the Body of
The Butterffy, and colour it after Life.

EDA IN TING on Glats is an Art which has
 efteemed by the Generality of Mankind an
fmatement attended with many Difficulties; yet

Afterwards lay the damp Printon its Backupon 
Hat Table; hold the Glats over is without touching
the Turpentine, till it is exactly even with the
Print, then letting the Glats fall gently on it, care-
fully prets it down with your Fingers in different
Parts, to that the Turpentine may stick to the
Print; then taking it up, hold the Glats towards you,
presting the Print from the Centre towards the
Edges till no Bliffers remain.
Next wet the Back of your Print with  Sponge,
till the Paper will rub off with your Fingers, rub
it gently, and the white Paper wiil come off, leaving
