any Man (at your Age) has yet been

And  congratulare my Countrymen
upon the happy Prospect they have,
of laving themfelves the Trouble

Nor is it  Wonder that your

MY LORD,
Ir is not for common Purpofes
that Heaven has entrufted thefe rich
Talents in your Ilands. You fland
accountable for them to your Prince,
your Country, and your noble Rela-
tions. Nay, every true Briten claims
an Intereft in them; and affures him-
felf, that You are born for his Ad-
Vantage. You have already given
them an Earneft of it, by your gloe
rous Conduct in the North, upon the
late unhappy Difturbances that threa-
tened your Province; and by that
exemplary Moderation and Genero-
fity, which moved Fou to intercede
for the Lives of thofe, againft whom
You food prepared to hazard your
own. But this, my Lord, will be
Matter for our British Chronicles; or
will better become fuch Pens, as have

Poetry. Confcious therefore of my

Work, which Fou have permitted me
to lay at your Feer.
The Repuration of Mont du Fref
noy is eftablifhed all over Earope; and
his Poem allowed to be the moft com-
plete and methodical Syftem, that
has yet been publifhed of the Art of
Painting. And to the Character of
Mr. Dryden, if any thing can be
added,  is, that he is one of your
Lordship’ favourite Authors; and,
 fuch, it will be expected  should
account for some Liberties that have
been taken with his excellent Trant
lation.
The Misfortune that attended him
in that Undertaking, was, that for
Want of  competent Knowledge in
Painting, he fuffered himself to be
mifled by an unskilful Guide. Mont.
de Piles told him, in his Preface, that
his French Verfion was made at the
Requeft of the Author himself; and
altered by him, till it was wholly to
his Mind. This Nir. Dryden taking
upon Content, thought there was no-
thing more incumbent on him, than

alfo not fet it in the moft advanta-
geous Light; to do Juftice to Mont.

Critick in the Language, as well as in

Firft then, the Reader may be pleafed to
Know, that it was not of my own Choice
that  undertook this Work. Many of our
moft Kilful Painters, and other Artiffs, were
pleafed to recommend this Aurber to me, as
one who perfectly underffood the Rules of
Painting; who gave the beff and moft con-
cife Intructions for Performance, and the
fureft to inform the judgment of allwholoved
this noble Art: That they who before were
rather fond of it, than knowingly admired
it, might defend their Inclination by their
Reafon: That they might underftand thofe
Excellencies which they blindly valued, to
as not to be farther imposed on by bad Pieces,
and to know when Nature was well imitated
by the moft able Mafters. It is true indeed,

and they acknowledge it, that, befides the
Rules which are given in this Treatife, or
which can be given in any other, to make  Judgment of good Pictures, and to
value them more or less, when compared
with one another, there is farther required 
long Converfation with the best Pieces, which
are not very frequent either in France or
England; yet some we have, not only from
the Hands of Holbein, Rubens and Vandyke,
(one of them admirable for Hiftory-Painting,.
and the other twd for Portfaits) but of many
Flemist Mafters, and thofe not inconfidera-

if  copy from Belfor: ( moft ingenious Au-
thor) some Part of his Idea of  Painter,

which cannot be unpleating, at leaft to fuch
who are converfant in the Philofophy of
Plaro. And to avoid Tedioufnets,  will not.
tranflate the whole Difcourfe, but take and
leave, as  find Occafion.
God Almighty, in the Fabric of the Universe,
first contemplated himself, and reffected on his
own Excellencies; from which be drew and
constituted those first Forms, which are called
Ideas. So that every Species which was after-
wards expressed, was produced fr.  that first
Idea, forming that wonderful Centexture of all
created Beings. But the celeftial Bodies above
the Moon being incorruptible, and not subject
to Change, remained for evar fair, and in per-
petual Order: on the centrary, all things which
are sublunary, are subject to Change, to Defor-
mily, and to Decay. And though Nature al
aways intends  confummate Baauty in her Pro-
dubtions; yet, through the Inequality of the Mat-
ler, the Ferms are altered; and in particular,
human Beauty suffers Alteration for the werse,
as we see to our Mertification, in the Deformi-
ries and Disproportions which ars in us. For
which reason, the artful Painter, and the Sculp-
fer, imitating the divine Maker form to them-
selves, as well as they are able,  Model of
the superier Beauties; and, reflecting on them,
endeavour to correct and amend the common Na-
ture, and to represent it as it was first created,
without Fault, eirber in Cowur or in Linea-
MCHt.
This Idea, which ave mey call the Goddess of
Painting and of Sculpture, defiends , on the
Marble and the Cloth, and becomes the Origi
nal of these Arrs; and, being measured by the
Compass of the Intellect, is irself the Measure
of


      .
of the performing Hand; and, being animated
by the Imagination, infuses Life into the Image.
The Idea of the Painter and the Sculptor is un-
doubtedly that perfect and excellent Example of
the Mind, by Imitation of which imagined Form,
all Things are represented which fall under bu-
man Sight : Such is the Defimtion which is
made by Cicero, in his Bock of the Orator to
Brutus. co As therefore in Forms and Figures,
 is somewhat which is excellent and
 to wbich imagined Species. all
 are referred by Imitation, wbich ars
 Objects of Sight; in like manner we be-
 the Species of Eloquence in our Minds,
 Effigies, or actual Image of wbich ave
 is
feek in the Organs of our Hearing
 confirmed by Procius, in the Dia-
 of Plato, called Timeus: If; fays he,
 take  Man, as be is made by Nature,
cc and compare him with another who is the Ef-
& fect of Art; the Work of Nature will at
co ways appear the less beautiful, because Are
& is more accurate than Nature." ButLCuxis,
who, from the Choice which be made of frve
Virgins, dreaw that wenderful Picture of He-
lena, awhich Cicero in his Orater before-men-
tioned sets before us, as the mest perfect Exam-
ple of Beauty, at the same time admonisbes 
Painter to contemplate the Ideas of the most na-
tural Forms; and to make  judicious Cbeice of
several Bodies, all of them the most elegant
which be can find. By avbich ave may plainly
understand, that he thought it imposfible to find
in any one Body all those Perfections awbich be
fought for the Accomplishment of  Hiclena;
because Nature in any individual Person makes
notbing that is perfect in all its Parts. For
this Reason, Maximus Tyrius alfo Jays, that
the








      .
the image which is taken by  Painter from se-
veral Bodies, produces  Brauty, which it is
impossible to find in any single natural Body, ap-
proaching to the Perfection of the faireft Sta-
sues. Thus Nature, on this account, is so much
inserior to Art, that these Artifts awbo propose
to themselves only the Imitation or Likene) of
such or such  particular Person, without Elec-
tion of those ideas before-mentioned, bave often
been reproached for that Omisfion. Demetrius
was taxed for being too natural; Dionyfius
was also blamed for drawing Men like us, and
was commonly called Audcareyeagee, that is, 
Painter of Men. In our Times, Michael -
gelo da Caravaggio was effeemed too natural.
He drew Persons as they were; and Baaboc-
C and meft of the Dutch Painters, have
drawn the averft Likeness. Lylippus of old
apbraided the common Sort of Sculptors, for
making Wen such as they avere found in Wa-
ture; and beafted of himself, that be made
them as they ought to be; which is  Precept of
riffotle, given as well to Poets, as to Painters.
Phidias raifed an Admiration even to Affonish-
ment, in these who beheld his Statues, with the
Forms which he gave to his Giods and Herces,
by imitating the Idea, rather than Nature.
And Cicero, Speaking of him, affirms, that
figuring Jupiter and Pallas; be did not conten-
plate any Object from acbence be took any Like-
ness, but considered in his own Mind  great
and admirable Ferm of Beauty, and according
to that Image in his Seul, be directed the Ope-
ration of his Hand. Sencea also seems to avon-
der that Phidias having nover tebeld eirber
love or Pallas, yet could conceive their divine
Images in his Mind. Apollonius Tyanxus
says the same in other Werds, that the Fancy
TUTC


      .
pore instructs the Painter, than the Imitation;
for the laft makes only the Things asbich it fees,
but the first makes also the Things which it
never sees.
Leon Battifla lberti tells as, that we ought
not so much to love the Likenets as the Beauty,
and to choose from the fairest Bodies severally
tbe saireff Parts. Leonardo da Vinci inftructs
the Painter to form this idea to himself; and
(Raphael, the greateft of all modern Mafters,
tavrites thus to Caltiglione, concerning his Cra-
Matea: To paint  fair one, it is neceffary
 me to See many fair ones; but because
 is so great  Scarcity of lovely Women,
 am constrained to make use of one certain
 ashicb  bave formed to myself in my
 oun Fancy. Guido Reni fending to Rome
his St. Nichael, which be had painted for the
Church of the Capuchirs, at the same time
wrote to Montignor Maffane, asbo avas the
Maettro di Cafa (or Steward of the Hause) to
Pope Urban the Righth, in this manner. co 
wish  bad the Wings of an Augel, to bave
ascended into Paradife, and there to bave te-
beld the Forms of those beatified Spirits, from
which  might bave copied my rchangel.
But not being able to meunt so bigb, it was in
vain for me to fearch his Resemblance here be-
low; so that  was forced to make an Intrespec-
tien into my own Mind, and into that idea of
Eeauty, which  have formed in my own Ima-
gination.  have likewiss created there the
contrary idea of Deformity and Ueliness; but
 lave the Consideration of it, till  paint the
Devil; and in the mean time, bun the very
Thought of it, as much as poffiely  can, and
am even endeavouring to blot it avholly out of
my Remembrance.  here was not any Lady in

all Antiquity, who was Mistress of so much
Beauty, as was to be found in the Venus of
Guidus, made by Praxiteles; or the Minervs
of thens, by Phidias; which was thereson
called the beautiful Form. Noitber is there ay
Man of the present Age, equal in the Strength,
Proportion and Knitting of his Limbs, to the
Hercules of Farnefe, made by Glicon; or any
Woman who can juftly be compared with the
Medicean Venus, of Cleomenes. And upon
this account, the nobleft Poets and the beft Ors-
tors, when they defired to celebrate any extraor-
dinary Beauty, are forced to bave recourse to
Statues and Pittures, and to draw their Per-
Jons and Faces into Comparison. Ovid, endea-
vouring to express the Beauty of Cillarus, the
faireft of the Centaurs, celebrates him as next
in Perfection to the most admirable Statues.

      .
The Idea of this Beauty is indeed various,
according to the several Forms which the Tainter
or Sculptor would describe: As one in Strength.
another in Magnanimity; and sometimes it con-
fifts in Chearsulness, and sometimes in Delicacy.
and is always diversified by the Sex and Age.
The Beauty of Yove is one, and that of June
another: Hercules and Cupid are perfect Beau-
ties, though of different Kinds; for Beauty is
only that which makes all Things as they are in
their proper and perfect Nature; which the best
Painters always choose, by contemplating the
Forms of each. We ought famber to consider
that  Pitture being the Representation of  bu-
man Action, the Painter ought to retain in his
Mind the Examples of all Affections and Pas-
sions; as  Poet preserves the idea of an angry
Man, of one who is fearful, fad or merry, and
so of all the rest. For it is impossible to express
that with the Hand, which never entered into
the Imagination. In this manner, as  bave
rudely and briefty shewn you, Painters and
Scuiptors, choofing the most elegant, natural
Beauties, perfectionate the Idea, and advance
their Art, even above Nature itself, in ber in-
dividual Productions, which is the uimeft Ma-
stery of buman Performance.
From bence arifes that Aftenishment, and al-
mest Adoration, awhich is paid by the Knowing
to those divine Remains of Annquity. From
bence Phidias, Lyfippus, and other noble Sculp-
tars, are fill beld in Veneration; and Apelles,
Qeuxis, Protogenes, and ofber admirable Pain-
ters, though their Works are perished, are and
vill be eternally admired; awho all of them
dreaw after the ideas of Perfection; awhich are
the Miracles of Nature, the Providence of the
Underslanding, the Exemplars of the Mind, the

Light of the Fancy; the Sun, which, from its
vifing, inspired the Starue of Niemnon, and the
Fire which warmed into Life the Image of Pro-
metheus. It is this which causes the Graces
and the Loves to take up their Habitations in
the bardeft Niarbie, and to subfift in the Emp-
tiness of Light and Shadows. But since the
Idea of Eloquence is as inferior to that of
Painting, as the Force of Words is to the Sight;
 must here break off abruptly, and, having con-
ducted the Reader as it were to  fecret Walk,
there leave him in the midft of Silence to con
template these ideas, which  have only sketched,
and which every Man must finish for himself.
In thefe pompous Expreffions, or fuch as
thefe, the Iralian has given you his Idea of 
Painter; and though  cannot much com-
mend the Stile,  muit needs fay, there is
fomewhat in the Matter: Plaro himfelf is ac-
cuffomed to write loftily, imitating, as the
Criticks tell us, the Manner of Homer; but
furely, that inimitable Peet had not to much
of Smoke in his Writings, though not less of
Fire. But in thort, this is the prefent Ge.
nins of Italy. What Pbileffraras tells us, in
the Proem of his Figures, is fomewhat plainer;
and therefore  will tranflate it almoft Word
for Word. oo He who will rightly govern the
. Art of Painting, ought of Neceffity firft to
ce understand human Nature. He ought like-
co avise to be endued with  Genius, to express
ot the Signs of their Pattons wbom be repre-
so sents; and to make the Dumb as it were to
so Speak: He must yet farther understand what
io is contained in the Constitaution of the Cbeeks,
as in the Temperament of the Eyes, in the Na-
so turalness (if  may so call ir) of the Eye-
 brows;


      .
 and in sbert, awbatfeever belongs to
 Mind and Thought. He who thoroughty
 all these Things, will obtain the whole;
 the Hand vill exquifitely represent the
 of every particular Person. If it
 that he be either mad or angry, me-
 or chearful,  Sprightly Touth, or
 languishing Lover; in one Word, he will
 able to paint wbatfoever is proportionable
 any one. And even in all this there is 
 Error without causing any Shame. For
 Eyes and Minds of the Beholders being
 on Objects which have noreal Being,
 if they were truly existent, and being in-
 by them to believe them jo, what Plea-
 is it not capable of giving? The Ancients
 otber wise Men, bave writtenmany  bings
 the Symmetry, which is in the
 of Painting; constituting as it avere
 certain Laws for the Proportion of every
 not thinking it possible for  Pain-
 to undertake the Expression of those Mo-
ations which are in the Mind, without  con=
&:current Harmny in the natural Measure.
& For that which is out of its own Kind and
 Measure, is not received from Nature, whose
 is always rigbt. On  serious Con-
is sideration of this Matter, it will be found,
ce That the Art of Painting bas  wonderfid
 Affinity with that of Poetry; and that there
it is betwixt them  certain common lmagina-
 tion. For as the Poets introduce the trods
 Heroes, and all those Things which are
 majeftical, boneft, or delightful; in like
 manner, the Painters, by the virtue of their
 Outlines, Coleurs, Lights, and Sbadows, re-
 present the same Things ann Persons in their
 Pictures.

on without him. He has begun to peak of
the great Relation betwixt Painting and Pee-
try, and thither the greateft. Part of this Dif
courfe, by my Promife, was directed.  have

 will take my Rife from Belfori, before  pro-
ceed to the Aurbor of this Book.
The Bufiness of his Preface is to prove,
that  learned Painter should form to himself
an Idea of perfect Narure. This Imags he
is to fet before his Mind in all his Undertak-
ings, and to draw from thence, as from 
Storchoufe, the Beauries which are to enter
into his Work; thereby correcting Wature
from what actually the is in individuale, to
what the ought to be, and what the was
created. Now as this Idea of Peefection is of
little fe in Pertrairs (or the Refemblances
of particular Perfons); fo neither is it in the
Charatters of Comedy and Tragedy, which are
never to be made perfect, but always to be
drawn with some Specks of Frailty and De-
ficience; fuch as they have been deferihed to
us in Hiffory, if they were real Characters;
or fuch as the Poer began to thew them, at
their firtt Appearance, if they were only fic-
Citious,


     :
titious, or imaginary. The Perfection of
fuch Stage-Characters confifts chiefly in their
Likenels to the deficient faulty Nature, which
is their Original. Only (as it is obferved
more at large hereafter) in fuch Cafes, there
will always be found  better Likeness, and
 worte; and the better is conflantly to be
chosen;  mean in Tragedy, which reprefents.
the Figures of the higheff Form among Man-
kind. Thus in Pertrairs, the Painter wilt
not take that Side of the Face which has
some notorious Blemish in it; but either
draw it in Profile (as Apelles did Astrgonuss
who had loft one of his Eyes) or elfe shadow:
the more imperfect Side. For an ingenious
Flattery is to be allowed to the Profeffors of
both Arts, fo long as the Likenels is not de-
Rroyed. It is true, that all manner of Im-
pertections muft not be taken away from the
Characters; and the Reafon is, that there
may be left fome Grounds of Pity for their
Misfortunes. We can never be grieved for
their Miferies who are thoroughly wicked,
and have thereby juftly called their Calami=
ties on themfelves. Such Men are the na-
tural Objects of our Hatred, not of our Com-
miferation. If, on the other Side, their
Characters were wholly perfect (fuch as, for
Example, the Character   Saint, or Mar-
yr in  Play) his or her Misfortunes would
produce impious Thoughts in the Beholders;
they would accufe the Meavens of Injuftice,
and think of leaving  Religien, where Piety
was to ill requited. Ifay, the greater Part
would be tempted to to do;  fay not, that
they ought; and the Confequence is too
dangerous for the Practice. In this  have
accufed myfelf, for my own St. Carbarine.
but
       .
but let Truth prevail. Sopbockes has taken
the juft Medium in his Oedipus. He is fome-
what arrogant at his firft Entrance, and is
 inquifitive through the whole Tragedy;
yet thefe Imperfections, being balanced by
great Virtues, they hinder not our Compat-
hon for his Miferies; neither yet can they
deftroy that Horror, which the Nature of his
Crimes have excited in us. Such in Paint-
ing are the Warrs and Moles, which, adding
 Likeness to the Face, are not therefore to
he omitted; but thefe produce no loathing
in us: But how far to proceed, and where
to ftop, is left to the judgment of the Poer
and the Painter. In Comedy there is fome-
what more of the worfe Likeness to be taken;
becaufe that is often to produce Laughter,
which is occafioned by the Sight of some De-
formity; but for this  refer the Reader to
Arifforce. It is  sharp manner of instruction
for the Vulgar, who are never well amended,
till they are more than fufficiently exposed.
That  may return to the Beginning of this
Remark, concerning perfect Ideas,  have only
this to fay, that the Parallel is often true in
Epic Poetry.
The Heroes of the Poers are to be drawn

according to this Rule.
There is fcarce 
Frailty to be left in the beft of them, any
more than is to be found in  divine Narure.
And if REneas fomerimes weeps, it is not in
bemoaning his own Miferies, but thofe which
his People undergo. If this be an imperfec.
sion, the Son of God, when he was incarnate,
shed Tears of Compaffion over Terufalem;
and Lenrulus defcribes him often weeping,
but never laughing; to that Virgil is jufti-
fied even from the boly Scriptures.  have
but


      .
but one Word more, which for once  will
anticipate from the Aurbor of this Book.
Though it muft be an Idea of Perfec-
tion, from which both the Epic Poer and the
Hiffory Painter draws; yet all Perfections
are not fuitable to all Subjects; but every
one muff be defigned, according to that per-
feet Beauty which is proper to him. An
Apollo muft be diftinguished from  Tupiter,
 Pallas from  Venus; and to in Peetry, an
Eneas from any other Hero, for Piety is his
chief Perfection. Homer’ Achilles is  kind
of Exception to this Rule; but then he is
not  perfect Here, nor fo intended by the
Poer. All his Geds had fomewhat of human
Imperfection, for which he has been taxed
by Plate, as an imitator of what was bad
But Virgil obferved his Fault, and mended
it. Vet Acbilles was perfect in the Strength
of his Body, and the Vigour of his Mind.
Had he been less paffionate or lets revenge=
ful, the Poet well forefaw that Hecfor had
been Killed, and Troy taken at the firff Af-
fault; which had defroyed the beautiful
Contrivance of his Riad, and the Moral
of preventing Difcord amongt Confederate
Princes, which was his principal Intention.
For the Moral (as Bofs observes) is the firft
Bufiness of the Poer, as being the Ground-
work of his Instruction. This being formed;
he contrives fuch  Defign or Fable, as may
be moft fuitable to the Moral: After this he
begins to think of the Perfons, whom he is
to employ in carrying on his Design; and
gives them the Manners, which are moft pro=
perto their feveral Cbaracters. The Thoughts
and Words are the laft Parts, which give
Beauty and Colouring to the Piece. When
Itay,
       .
 fay;rthat the Manners of the Here ought to
be good in Perfection,  contradict not the
Marquis of Nermanty' Opinion, in that ad-
mirable Verfe, where, fpeaking of  perfect
Character, he calls it
ATaukless Monster, which the World ne er knew.
For that excellent Critic intended only to
Speak of Dramatic Characters, and not of
Epic. Thus at leafl  have thewn, that in
the moft perfect Porm, which is that of Vir-
Fil,  perfect Idea was required, and followed;
and confequently, that all fucceeding Poers
ought rather to imitate him, than even Ho-
mer  will now proceed, as  promifed, to
the Author of this Book. He tells you, al-
moft in the firft Lines of it, that the chief
End of Painting is to please the Exesz and it
is one great End of Pectry to please the Mind.
Thus far the Paraltel of the Aris holds true;
with this Difference, that the principal End
of Painting is to please, and the chief Defign
of Pceiry is to inffracl. in this, the latter
teems to have the Advantage of the former.
But if we confider the rriffs themfelves on
both Sides, certainly their Aims are the very
same; they would both make fure of pleafing,
and that in Preference to Instruction. Next,
the Means of this Pleafure is by Deceit. One
impofes on the Sight, and the other on the
Inderftanding. Fretion is of the Effence of
Peetry, as well as of Painting; there is  Re-
femblance in one, of human Bodies, Things
and Actions, which are not real; and in the
other, of  true Story by  Fiction. And as
all Stories are not proper Subjects for an
Epic Peem or  Tragedy, to neither are they
for


      .
for  neble Picrurs. The Subjects both of
the one and of the other ought to:have no-
thing of immoral, low or filthy in them;
but this being treated at large in the Book
itfelf,  wave it, to avoid Repetition. Only
 muft add, that though Catallus, Ovid, and
others, were of another Opinion, that the
Subject of Poets, and even their Thoughts
and Exprestions might be loofe, provided
their Lives were chaffe and holy; yet there
are no fuch Licences permitted in that frr
any more than in Painting, to defign and co-
four obicene Nudities. Vita proba off; is
no Excute; for it will fcarcely be admitted,
that either  Poer or  Painter can be chaite,
who give us the contrary Examples in their
Writings and their Pictures. We fee nothing
of this Kind in Firgil. That which comes
the nearckt to it,  the Adventure of the
Cave, where Dide and Eneas were driven
by the Storm; yet even there, the Poer pre-
tends  Marriage before the Confummation;
and June herfelf was prefent at it. Neither
is there any Expreffion in that Story, which
 Roman Marron tnight not read without 
Bluth. Befides, the Poer paffes it over as
hatily as he can, as if he were afraid of Ray-
ing in the Cave ith the two Levers, and of
being  Witness to their Actions. Now 
suppofe that  Parnrer would not be much
commended, who should pick out this Ca-
vern from the whole Eners, when there is
not another in the Work. He had better
leave them in their Obfcurity, than let in 
Flath of Lightning, to clear the natural
Darkness of the Place, by which he muft dif
cover himself as much as them. The Attarn
piecrs, and holy Decorations of Painting, thew
       .
that firr may be applied to better Ufes, as
well as Peerry.

And, amongft many other Inftances, the
Farnese Gallery, painted by Hannibal Car-
racci, is  fufficient Witness yet remaining:
The whole Work being morally infiructive,
and particularly the Herculis Bivinm, which
i  perfect Triumph of Virtue over Vice; as
it is wonderfully well defcribed by the inge-
nious Bellori.
 Hitherto  have only told the Reader what
ought not to be the Subject of  Picture, or
of  Poem. What it ought to be on either
Side, our urbor tells us: It muff in general
be great and noble. And in this the Paralle)
is exactly true. The Subject of  Poer, either
in Tragedy, or in an Epic Peem, is  great
Action of some illuftrious Ifero. It is the
same in Painting; not every ction, nor
every Perfon, is confiderable enough to enter
into the Cloth. It muft be the Anger of an
Acbilles, the Piety of an Eneas, the Sacrifice
of an Ipbigenia (for Heroines as well as Heroes
are comprehended in the Rule); but the Pa-
rallel is more complete in Tragedy, than in
an Epic Poem. For as  Tragedy may be
made out of many particular Esijodes of Ho-
mer, or of Virgil; to may  noble Picture be
defigned out of this or that particular Story,
in either fathor. Hiffery is alfo fruitful of
Defigns, both for the Painter and the Tragic
Peet: Curtins throwing himself into  Gulph,
and the two Recis facrificing themfelves for
the Safety of their Country, are Subjects for
Tragedy and Picture. Such is Scipie, refor-
ing the Spaniss Bride, whom he either loved,
or may be tuppofed to love; by which he
gained the Hearts of  great Nation, to in-
tereff


      .
 themfelves for Rome against Carthape:
These are all but particular Pieces in Lizy'
Hiflory, and yet are full, cemplete Subjects
for the Pen and Pencil. Now the Reafon of
this is evident. Tragedy and Picture are
more narrowly circumfcribed by the mecha-
nic Rules of Time and Place, than the Epic
Poom. The Time of this laft is left indefi-
nite. It is true, Homer took up only the
Space of eight and forty Days for his Thiad;
but, whether Virgils Action was compre-
hended in  Vear, or fomewhat more, is not
determined by Bofn. Homer made the Place
of his Action, Trey; and the Grecian Camp
befieging it. Virgil introduces his Eneds,
Cometimes in Sicily, fometimes in Carthage,
and other Times at Cume, before he brings
him to Laurentum; and even after that, he
wanders again to the Kingdom of Evander
and fome Parts of Tuscany, before he returns
to finith the War by the Death of Turnus.
But Tragedy (according to the Practice of the
Ancients) was always confined within the
Compafs of twenty four Hours, and feldom
takes up to much Time. As for the Place
of it, it was always one, and that not in 
larger Scnfe (as for Example,  whole City,
or two or three feveral Houfes in it) but the
Market, or some other public Place, com-
mon to the Choras and all the Actors.
Which eftabliffed Law of theirs,  have not
an Opportunity to examine in this Place,
becaute  cannot do it without Digreffion
from my Subject, though it feems too drict
at the firtt Appearance, becaufe it excludes
all secret Intrigues, which are the Bcauries
of the modern Stage; for nothing can be car-
ried on with Privacy, when the Choras is
Tup-

      .
suppoted to be always prefent. But to pro-
ceed,  muft fay this to the Advantage of
Painting, even above Tragedy, that what this
laftreprefents in the Space of many Hours, the
former shews us in one Moment. The Action,
the Paffion, and the Manners of to many Per
fons as are contained in  Picture, are to be
difcerned at once in the twinkling of an Exe;
at leaft they would be fo, if the Sight could
fravel over to many different Objects all. at
once, or the Mind could digeft them all at
the same Instant, or Point of Time. Thus,
in the famous Picture of Poufin, which re-
prefents the Iaffitution of the bleffed Sacrament,
you fee our Saviour and his tavelve Disciples,
all concurring in the fame Action, after dif-
ferent Manners, and in different Poftures;
only the Manners of Judas are diffirguithed
from the reft. Here is but one indivifibe
Point of Time obferved; but one Acdion per-
formed by fo many Perfons, in one Room,
and at the fan. Table; yet the Eye cannot
comprehend at once the whole Object, nor
the Mind follow it fo faft; it is contidered at
Leifure, and feen by Intervals. Such are the
Subjects of noble Pictures; and fuch are only
to be undertaken by noble Hands. There are
other Parts of Nature, which are meaner, and
yet are the Subjects both of Painters and of
Piets.
For to proceed in the Parallel, as Comedy
is  Reprefentation of human Life, in infe-
rior Pertons, and low Subjects, and by that
means creeps into the Nature of Poerry, and
is  kind of Taiper  Shrub belonging to the
Species of Cedar; to is the Painting of Clowns,
the Reprefentation of  Durch Kermis, the bru-
sal Sport of Snick or Snee, and  thouland
other


      .
other Things of this mean Invention,  kind
of Picture; which belongs to Nature, but of
the loweft Form. Such is  Lazar in Com-
parifon to  Venus; both are drawn in human
Figures; they have Faces alike, though not
like Faces. There is yet  lower Sort of Pee-
try and Painting, which is out of Nature:
For  Farce is that in Poelry, which Grotesque
is in  Picture. The Perfons, and Action of
 Farce, are all unnatural; and the Manners
falfe, that is, inconfifting with the Charac-
ters of Mankind. Grotesque Painting is the
juit Refemblance of this; and Borace begins
his Art of Pectry; by defcribing fuch  Figure
with  Man’ Head,  Horfe' Neck, the
Wings of  Bird, and  Fith' Tail; Parts of
different Species jumbled together, accord-
ing to the mad Imagination of the Dauber;
and the End of all this (as he tells you after-
ward) is to caufe Laughter.  very Mon-
fer in  Barthelomeru-Fair for the Mob to
gape at for their Two-pence. Laughter is in-
deed the Propriety of  Man, but juft enough
to diffinguith him from his elder Brother with
four Legs. It is  Kind of Baftard-pleafure
 taken in at the Ryes of the vulgar Ga-
zers, and at the Ears of the beafly Audience.
Church-painters ufe it to divert the honeit
Countryman at public Prayers, and keep his
Ryes open at  heavy Sermon. And Farce-
scribblers make ufe of the fame noble inven-
tion, to entertain Citixens, Country Gentlemen,
and Covent-Garden Fops. if they are merry.
all goes well on the Poer’ Side. The better
Sort go thither too, but in Defpair of Senfe,
and the juft images of Nature, which are the
adequate Pleafures of the Mind. But the  can give the Stage no better than what
      .
was given him by Nature; and the AGers
muff reprefent fuch Things as they are capa-
ble to perform, and by which both they and
the Scribbter may get their Living.After all,
it is  good Thing to laugh at any rate; and
if  Straw can tickle  Man, it is an Inftru=
ment of Happineis. Beafts can weep when
they fuffer, but they cannot laugh. And, as
Sir William Davenant outerves, in his Preface
to Gondiberr, so It is the Wifdom of  Go-
ss vernment to permit Plays, (he might
have added Farces) is as it is the Prudence
cs of  Carter to put Bell, upon his Horfes,
is to make them carry their Burdens chear-
 fully.
 have already shewn, that one main End
of Poetry and Painting, is to pleafe, and have
said fomething of the Kinds of both, and of
their Subjects, in which they hear  greatRe-
temblance to each other.  muft now confider
them, as they are great and noble Arrs; and
as they are Arrs, they muft have Rules, which
may direct them to their common End.
To all Arrs and Sciences, but more particu-
larly to thefe may be applied what Hip, ocrates
fays of Phyfic, as  find him cited by an emi-
nent French Critic.  Medicine has long
 subfitied in the World. The Principles of
is it are certain, and it has  certain Way;
is by both which there has been found in the
co Courfe of many Ages, an infinite Number
se of Things, the Experience of which has
of confirmed its Ofefulness and Goodness.
. All that is wanting to the Perfection of
so this Art, will undoubtedly be found, if
of able Men, and fuch as are inftructed in
of the ancient Rules, will make  farther In=
of quiry into it, and endeavour to arrive at
of that


 .     .
 that which is hitherto unknown, by that
is which is already known. But all, who
 having rejected the ancient Rules, and
it taken the oppofite Ways, yet boaft them-
of felves to be Mafters of this Art, do but
is deceive others, and are themfelves de-
of ceived; for that is absolutely impoffible. 
This is notorioully true in thefe two Arts;
for the Way to pleafe being to imitate Na-
ture, both the Poets and the Painters in an-
cient Times, and in the beft Ages, have stu-
died her; and from the Practice of both these
Ares, the Rules have been drawn, by which
we are instructed how to pleafe, and to com-
pass that End which they obtained, by fol-
lowing their Example; for Nature is Hill the
same in all Ages, and can never be contrary
to herfelf. Thus, from the Pratice of . schy-
lus, Sopbecles, and Enripides, Ariffotle dre
his Rules for Tragedy, and Pbiloffratus for
Painting. Thus, amongtt the Moterns, the
Italian and French Crities, by Rudying the
Precepts of Arifforle and Horace, and having
the Example of the Grecian Poers before their
Eyes, have given us the Rules of modern
Tragedy; and thus the Crities of the fame
Countries, in the Art of Painting, have given
the Precepts of perfecting that  It is
true, that Poerry has one Advantage over
Painting in thefe laft Ages, that we have sill
the remaining Examples both of the Greet
and Latin Pocts; whereas the Painters have
nothing left them from Apelles, Protegenes,
Parrbasius, Leaxis, and the reit, but only
the Teffimonies which are given of their in-
comparable Works. But intlead of this, they

of the common Ruin, and are still preserved
in Iraly; and by well diftinguithing what is
proper to Sculfrure, and what to Painting,
and what is common to them both, they have
judicieutly repaired that Lofs. And the great
Genrus of Raphael, and others, having fuc-
ceeded to the limes of Barbarifm and Igno-
rance, the Knowledge of Printing is now ar-
rived to  fupreme Perfection, though the
Performance of it is much declined in the
prefent Age. The greatet Age for Poerry,
amongit the Romans, was certainly that of rn.
gufus Cirfar; and yet we are told, that Paint.
ing was then at its lower Ebb; and perhaps
Sculpeare was alto reclining at the fame time.
In the Reign of Damirian, and fome who
succeeded him, Poerry was but meanly cul.
rivated; but Painting eminently fourithed.
 am not here to give the Hiffery of the t how they were both in  manner ex-
tinguithed by the Irreption of the barbarcus
Nations; and both reffored about the Times
of Lco the Tenth, Charkes the Fitth, and
Francis the Firtt; though  might obterve,
that neither frieffe, nor any of his cotempo-
rary Poets, ever arrived at the Excellency of
Raphael, Tirian, and the reft in Painting.

many Countries, Poerry is better pradifed

nificence and Encouragement of the prefent
King of France may carry Paiting and Sculp-

before the War in which he is engaged, we
may expect what he will do after the happy
Conclufion of  Peace : which is the Prayer
and With of all thofe who have not an inte-
rest to prolong the Miferies of Enrege. For
it


      .
it is meft certain, as our Husbor, amongit
others, has obferved, that Reward is the Spur
of Virtue, as well in all good Arts, as in all
laudable Attempts; and Emulation, which is
the other Spur, will never be wanting either
amongtt Poets or Painters, when particular
Rewards and Prizes are proposed to the best
Defervers.  But to return from this Digref-
fion, though it was almoff neceffary, all the
Rules of Painting are methodically, concife-
 and yet clearly delivered in this present
Treatife which  have tranflated. Beffis has
not given more exalt Rules for the Exic Poem,
nor Dacier for Tragedy, in his late excellent
Tranflation of Ariffotle, and his Notes upon
him, than our Frefney has made for Painting;
with the Parallet of which  muft refume my
Discourfe, followingmy furbor’sTert, though
with more Brevity than  intended, becaufe
Virgit calls me. cs The principal and moft
ct important Part of Painting, is to know
io aubat is moft beautiful in Nature, and moft
 proper for that Arr. That which is the
molt beautiful, is the moft noble Subject; fo
in Poetry, Travedy is more beautiful than
Comedy; becaute, as  faid, the Perfons are
greater whom the Poer instructs; and confe-
quently, the instructions of more Benefit to
Mankind: The Action is likewife greater,
and more noble, and thence is derived the
greater and more noble Pleafure.
To imilate Watare well in whatfoever Sub-
jett, is the Perfection of borh Arts; and that
Picture, and that Porm, which comes neareft
the Refemblance of Narure, is the best. But
it follows not, that what pleafes moft in ei-
ther Kind is therefore good, but what ought
to pleafe. Our depraved Appetites, and       .
nofance of the Arts, miflead our judgments,
and caufe us often to take that for true Imi-
tion of Narure, which has no Refemblance
of Natare in it. To inform our judgments,
and to reform our Taffes, Rnles were invented,
that by them we might difcern when Narare
was imitated, and how nearly.  have been
forced to recapitulate thefe Things, becaufe
Mankind is not more liable to Deceit, than
it is willing to continue in  pleafing Error,
Rrengthened by  long Habitude. The Imi-
tation of Narare is therefore juftly conftituted
as the general, and indeed the only Rule of
Avi-
pleating, both in Poefry and Painting.
fforte tells us, that Imiration pleafes, becaufe
 affords Matter for  Reafoner to inquire
into the Truth or Falthood of Imitation, by
comparing its Likeness or Unlikeness with
the Original. But by this Rule, every Spe-
culation in Nature, whofe Truth falls under
the Inquiry of  Philesopher, muft produce
the fame Delight; which is not true: 
should rather affign another Reafon. Truth
is the Object of our Underflanding, as Good
is of our Will; and the Underftanding can
no more be delighted with  Lie, than the
Will can choofe an apparent Evil. As Truth
is the End of all our Speculations, to the
Difcovery of it is the Pleafure of them: And
fince  true Knowledge of Narare gives us
Pleafure,  lively Imitation of it, either in
Peetry or Painting, mult of Neceffity produce
 much greater. For borb thefe Arrs, as 
said before, are not only true Imitations of
Narure, but of the beft Narure, of that which
is wrought up to  nobler Pitch. They pre-
sent as with images, more perfect than the
Life in any Individual; and we have the
Pleafure


      .
Pleafure to fee all the fcattered Beauties of
Nature united by  happy Chemiffry, without
its Deformities or Faults. They areImitations
of the Paffions which always move, and there-
fore confequently pleafe; for without Mo-
tion, there can be no Delight; which cannot
be confidered, but as an active Paffion. When
we view thefe elevated Ideds of Natare, the
Refult of that View is Admiration, which is
always the Caufe of Pleafure.
This foregoing Remark, which gives the
Reafon why Imitation pleafes, was fent me
by Mr. Walter Moyle,  moft ingenious young
Gentleman, converfant in all the Studies of
Humanity, much above his Years. He had
alfo furnished me (according to my Request)
with all the particular Paftages in Arifforte and
Horace, which are ufed by them, to explain
the Arr of Pestry by that of Paintings which,
if ever  have Time to retouch this Esay,
shall be inferted in their Places. Having thus
shewn that Imitation pleafes, and why it
pleafes in both these Arts, it follows, that fome
Rules of Imitation are neceffary, to obtain the
End; for without Rales there can be no Arr
any more than there can be  House without
 Door to conduct you into it. The principal
Parts of Painting and Peetry next follow.
Invention is the firft Part, and abfolutely
neceffary to them both; yet no Rule ever
was, or ever can be given how to compats
it.  happy Gearas is the Gift of Nature:
It depends on the Influence of the Stars,
fay the Affrologers; on the Organs of the
Body, fay the Naturaliffs; it is the particu-
lar Gift of Heaven, lay the Divines, both
Ctriffians and Heathens. How to improve
it, many Books can teach us; how to ob-
tain

out it, all agree,
Tu mbil irvitd dices faciefos Minerva.
Without Invention  Painter is but  Copier,
and  Poet but  Plagiary of others. Both are
allowed fometimes to copy and transtate; but,
as our furbor tells you, that is not the beft
Part of their Reputation. Imitators are but
 servile kind of Cattle, fays the Poet; or at
beft, the Keepers of Cattle for other Men:
 have nothing which is properly their
wivn; that is  fufficient Mortification for me,
while  am tranflating Virgil. But to copy
the beft Author is  Kind of Praife, if  per-
form it as  ought; as  Copy after Rapbed
is more to be commended, than an Orsginal
of any indifferent Painter
Under this Head of Investion is placod its
Dispesition of the Work, to put all Things in 
Beautiful Order and Harmony, that theawhole
may be of  fiece. The Composisions of the
Painter should be conformabte to the fras
of andient Hurbors, to the Cuttoms, and the
Times. And this is exactly the Hame in
Poeiny: Homer and Vingilare twhe our Guides
in the Epic; Sepbocles and Eurtpides McFra
pedy: In all Things we are to imitate the
Culloms and the Times of those Persons and
Things which we reprefent. Not to make
new Rule of the Drama, as Lopex de Vega
has attempted unfuccessfully to do; but to
be content to follow our Mafters, who un
derffood Natare better than we. But if the
Story which we treat be modern, we are to
vary the Cultoms, according to the Time and
the Country, where the Scene of Action:lids;

for this is Hill to imitate Nature, which is al-
ways the fame, though in  different Dress.
As in the Composition of  Picture, the
Painter is to take Care that nothing enter
into it, which is not proper or convenient to
the Subject; to likewife is the Poes to reject
all Incidents which are foreign to his Poem,
and are naturally no Parts of it: They are
Wens, and other Excrescences, which belong
not to the Body, but deform it. No Per-
fon, no incident in the Piece, or in the Play,
but muft be of Ufe to carry on the main De-
fign. All Things elfe are like fix Fingers to
the Hand; when Natare, which is fuperffuous.
in nothing, can do her Work with five. 
Painter muft reject all triffing Ornaments;
to muft  Poer refufe all tedious and unnecer-
Sary Defcriptions.  Robe, which is too
heavy, is less an Ornament than  Burden.
in Poetry, Horace calls thefe Things,
Verjus inopes verum, ugaque canorx.
Thefe are alfo the lacus  ara Diane, which
he mentions in the same Arr of Poetry. But
fince there muft be Ornaments, both in Paint-
ing and Poerry, if they are not neceffary, they
muft at leaft be decent; that is, in their due
Place, and but moderately ufed. The Painter
is not to take to much Pains about the Dra-
pery, as about the Face, where the principal
Refemblance lies; neither is the Poer, who
is working up  Paffion to make Similes.

Monrexuma dies with  fine one in his Mouth,

Figures to be lert; becaufe the Picture has no
Ole of them. So  have feen in some modern
Plays above twenty Acfors, when the Action
has not required half the Number. In the
principal Figures of  Picture, the Painter is
to employ the Sinews of his Art; for in them
confifts the principal Beauty of his Work.

the Rules which he gives concerning the Pof=

sion of his Heroes in the Performance of fuch
or fuch an Action; as of Acbilks, juft in the
Act of Killing Hecfor; or of Eneas, who has
Turnus under him. Both the Poct and the
Painter vary the Pokures, according to the
Action or Paffion, which they reprefent of
the fame Perfon. But all muft be great and
praceful in them. The fame Eneas muft be

pofition of his Enemies. And therefore in
the Pofture of  retiring Man, who avoids
the Combat, he tretches out his Arm in Sign
of Peace, with his right Foot drawn  little
back, and his Breaft bending inward, more
like an Orator than  Soldier; and feems to
diffuade the young Man from pulling on his
Deftiny, by attempting more than he was
able to perform: Take the Pafiage, as  have

were only diftinguished from the intended
Wits, by being called Coxcombs; though they

who had  great Genius for Tragedy, follow-
ing the Fury of his natural Temper, made
every Man and Woman too, in his Plays,
Stark raging mad; there was not  fober Per-
fon to be had for Love or Money: All was
tempeftuous and bluftering; Heaven and
Earth were coming together at every Word;

whatlsever is faid or done by any of them,

Poer has given them distinctly; and even the
Habits muft be proper to the Degrees and Hu-
mours of the Perfons, as well as in  Picture.

 am not fatisfied that the Comparifon be-
twixt the rve Arys, in the laft Paragraph, is
altogether fo juft as it might have been; but
 am fure of this which follows.
    .  .
The principal Figure of the Subject must ap-
ear in the midft of the Picture, under the prin-
fifal Light, to diftinguish it from the reft, which
lare only its Attendants. Thus in  Tragedy,
or an Epic Peem, the Here of the Piece mutt be
ladvanced foremoft to the View of the Reader
or Spectator. He muft outthine the reft of all
the Characters; he mult appear the Prince of
them, like the Sun in the Copernican Syftem;
encompaffed with the lets noble Planets. Be-
caute the Hero is the Center of the main Ac-
tion, all the Lines from the Circumference
tend to him alone; he is the chief Object of
Pity in the Dramo, and of Admiration in the
Epic Peem.
As in  Picture, befides the principal Fis
gures which compofe it, and are placed in the
midft of it, there are less Grouges, or Knots
of Figures difpofed at proper Diftances, which
are Parts of the Piece,and feem to carry on
the fame Defign in  more inferior Manner.
So in Epic Poetry, there are Efisodes and 
Cborus in Tragedy, which are Members of the
Action, as growing out of it, not inferted
into it. Such, in the ninth Book of the
Encis, is the Epifode of Nisus and Euryalus;
the Adventure belongs to them alone; they
alone are the Objects of Compaffion and Ad-
miration; but their Bufiness which they carry
on, is, the general Concernment of the Tro-
jun Camp, then beleaguered by Turnus and
the Latines, as the Christians were lately by
the Turks. They were to advertife the chief
Hero of the Diftrefies of his Subjects, occa-
fioned by his Abfence, to crave his Succour,
and folicit him to haften his Return.

This fucceeding with the People, more  added, to make the Variety the greater
and in Process of Time, the Cboras only fung
betwixt the Acts; and the Corypbons, or chief
of them, fpoke for the reft, as an Afor con-
cerned in the Bufinets of the Play.
Thus Tragedy was perfected by Degrees,
and being arrived at that Perfction,, the
Painters might probably take the Hint from
thence, of adding Groupes to their Pictures.
But, as  good Picture may be without 
Groupe; to  good Tragedy may fubfift with
out  Chorus, notwithflanding any Reafons,
which have been given by Dacier to the
Contrary.
Monfieur Racine has indeed ufed it in his
Epber, but not that he found any Neceffiy
of it, as the French Critic would infinuate.
The Chorus at St. Cyr, was only to give the
young Ladies an Occafion of entertaining the
King with vocal Mufic, and of commending
their own Voices. The Play itfelf was ne-
ver intended for the public Stage; nor, with
out any Disparagement to the learned  could poffibly have fucceeded there, and
much less in the Tranflation of it here. Mr.
Wycberley, when we read it together, was of
my Opinion in this, or rather  of his; for
it becomes me to to speak of to excellent 
Peet, and fo great  Judgs. But fince  am

To make  Sketch, or  more perfect Mo-

No draw up the Scenery of  Play; and the
Reafon is the fame for both; to guide the

The moft beautiful Parts of the Picture and
the Poem mull be the moft finished; the Co-
lours and Words moft chofen; many Things
in, both, which are not deferving of this
Care, mult be shifted off; content with vul.
far Exprestions; and thofe very thort, and
left, as in  Shadow, to the Imagination of
the Reader.
We have the Proverb, Manum de tabula,
from the Painters; which fignifies, to know
when to give over, and to lay by the Pen-
cil. Both Hemer and Firgil practifed this
Precept wonderfully well; but Virgil the
better of the two. - Homer knew that when
Hefor was Hlain, Trey was as good as al-
ready taken; therefore he concludes his Ac-
tion there: For what follows in the Fune-
rals of Patroctes, and the Redemption of
Hecfor' Body, is not (properly (peaking) 
Part of the main Actron. But Virgif con-
cludes with the Death of Tarnus; for, after
that Difficulty was removed, Eneas might
marry, and eltablifh the Trojans when he
pleated. This Rule  had before my Eyes in
the Conclution of the Spanish Friar when
the Difcovery was made that the King was
living; which was the Knot of the Play un-
tied: The reit is shut up in the Compass of
some few Lines, becaufe nothing then hin-
dered the tlappinefs of Torifmond and Leo-
era. The Fauits of that Drama are in the
Kind of it, which is Tragi-comed. But it
was given to the People; and  never writ
any thing, for myself, but Anrbony and CRo-
Paira.

but it will hold for both. As the Words,

of the Thoughts in the same Senfe as Co-

MoNS. DE PILE 
THE FRENCH TRANSLATOR.
AMONG, all the beautiful and delight-
  Jul Arts, that of Painting bas always
found the moft Lovers; the Number of
them almoft including all Mankind. Of whom
great Multitudes are daily found, awbe value
themfelves on the Knowledge of it; either be-
cause they keep Company with Painters, or that
they have seen good Pieces; or laftly, because
their Gurto is naturally good: Which notwith-
fanding that Knowledge of theirs (if we may
so call ii) is so very superficial, and so ill
grounded, that it is impaffible for them to de-
scribe in what confifts the Beauty of those Works
which they admire; or the Faults, which are in
the greateft Part of those awhich they condemn.
And truly it is not bard to find that this pro-
ceeds from no otber Cause, than that they are not
furnished with Rules by which to judge; nor
have any solid Foundati us, which are as so
many Lights set up to clear their Understanding
and lead them to an entire and certain Know-
ledee.  think it superfluous to prove, that this
is necesary to the Knowledge of Painting. I sufficient tl at Eainting be acknowleiged for
anArt; for that being granted, it follows with-
out Disfute, that no Arts are without rbeir Pre-
cepts.  shall satisfy myself with telling you.
that this little Treaufe avill furnish you with
infallible

      .
infallible Rules of judging trulys since they are
not only founded upon right Reafon, bat upon
the beft Pieces of the beft Wiakers, wbich our
Ruthor bath carefully examined, during the
Space of more than thirty Vears; and on which
be has made all the Reffestions awbict are necef-
sary to render this Eysatife worthy of Posterity;
which, though little in Bulk, yet contains most
judicious Remarks; and suffers nothing to escape,
that is effentied to the Subject which it bandles.
If you will please to read if with Attentio, you
will find it capable of giving the most nrce and
delicate fort of Knowledge, not only to theLovers,
but even to the Profeffors of that Art.
It would be too long to tell you the particular
Advantages, which it has above all the Books
that have appeared before it in this Kind; you
need only read it, and that avill convince you of
this Trurb. All that  will allow myself to Jay,
is only this, that there is not  Word in it which
carries not its Weights. whereas, in all otbers,
there are tawo confiderable Faulis which lie ; en
to the Sight, (viz.). That faying too much,
they always fay too litele. Faffure myself,
that the Reader avill own it is  Work of re-
neral Profit; to the Loversof Painting, for their
Instruction bow to judge knowingly, from the
Reafon of the Thing; and to the Fainters them-
fetves, by removing their Difficulties, that they
may avork auith Pleajure; becarse they may be
in some manner certain that their Productions art
good. It is to be used like Spirits and precious
Liquers; the lass you drink of it at  Time, it
is with the greater Pleasure. Read it often,
and but little at once, that you may digeft it bet-
ter, and dwell particularly on these Pasfages.

Hs for the Profe Trantlation, which you

 must inform you on what Occasion and in what
Manner it was performed. Tbe Love rsbick 
bad for Painting, and the Picature which. 
found in the Exercite of that noble Art, at my
Leisure Hours, gave me the Defire of being ac-
quainied with the late Mons. du FKEsNOY
who was generally reputed to bove  thorough
Knowledge ex ir. Our Acquaintance at lengtb.
proceeded to that Begree of Intimacy, that be
entrufted me with his Feem, which be believed
me capasle borb of Underitanding and Trant-
tating; and accordingly defired me to undertake
it. The Frath is, ave bad conversed so often.
on that Subject, and be had communicated bis
Thoughts of it so fully to me, that  had not the
leaft remaining Difficulty concerning it.  under-
took therefore to tranflate it, and employed my-
seif in it with Pleajure, Care and Affiduitys
after which  put it into his Hands, and be af=
tered in it awbar be pleased, till at laft it was
avbolly to his Mind: And then be gave his Con-
ent that is sould be publiped; but his Death
preventing that Delign,  thought ir  Wrong to

bis Memory to deprive Mankind any longer of
this Trantatuon, which  may safely affirm to be
done according to the true Senfe of the Author,
and to his Liking; since be himself has given

of bis Friends. And they who vere acquainted
with him, know his Humour to be such, that
he would never conftrain himself fo far, as ta
courmend what be did not really approve.  myself abliged to say thus much in Vin-
dication of the Faithfulness of my Work, to these
who underffand not the Latin; for as to those
who are converfant in both the Tongues, 
leave them to make their own Judgment of it.
The Remarks which  have added to his

Rions; and  am certain that he would not bast

have confined them also to the narroweff Com-

they are not to the Tatte of Some Readers (as

by long Exercife and Cuffom, may perfectly
poffess all the Rules and Secrets of that Art.
& The principal and moft important Part
of Painting is to find out, and thoroughly to
underftand, what Nature has made moft beau-
tiful, and moft proper to this Art;  and
that  Choice of it may be made according
to the Tafte and Manner of the Ancients:
&Without which all is nothing but  blind
and rash Barbarity; which rejects what is.
moff beautiful, and feems with an audacious
Infolence to defpife an Art, of which it is
wholly ignorant; which has occafioned thefe
Words of the Ancients : & That no Man is
 bold, fo rath, and fo overweening of his
 Works, as an ill Painter, and  bad
Poet, who are not confcious to themfelves
of their own Ignorance.
& We love what we undersland; we defire
what we love; we purfue the Enjoyment of
thofe Things which we defire; and arrive at
laft to the Poffeffion of what we have purfued,
if we warmly perfiff in our Defign. In the
mean time we ought not to expect that
blind Fortune should infallibly throw into our
Hands thofe Beauties; for though we may
light by Chance on some which are true and
natural, yet they may prove either not to be
decent, or not to be ornamental. Becaufe it
is not fufficient to imitate Nature in every
Circumstance, dully, and as it were literally
and minutely; but it becomes  Painter to
take what is moft beautiful, as being the
fovereign Judge of his own Art; co what is
 less beautiful or is faulty, he shall freely
 orret by the Dint of his own Genius,
and permit no tranfient Beauties to efcape
his Observation.

The Art of Painting.
Painting in Eggpt was at firff rude and im-
perfect, till being brought into Greece, and
being cultivated by the Study and Jublime
Genius of that Nation, & it arrived at length
to that Height of Perfection, that it feemed
to furpats even original Nature.
Amongt the Academies, which were com-
posed by the rare Genius of thofe great Men,
thefe four are reckoned as the principal;
namely, the Afbenian School, that of Sicgon,
that of Rbodes, and that of Corintb. Thefe
were little different from each other, only in
the Manner of their Work; as it may be feen
by the ancient Statues, which are the Rule of
Beauty and Gracefulness; and to which fuc-

Profficution, thefe falfe Colours, and this De-
ceit, difhonoured Painting, that on the con-
trary, they have only ferved to fet forth her

 and to make her Merit fartherknown;
and therefore it will be profitable to us to
have  more clear Underftanding of what we
call Colouring.
& The Light produces all Kinds of Co-
lours, and the Shadow gives us none. The
more  Body is nearer to the Eyes, and the
more directly it is opposed to them, the more
it is enlightened; becaufe the Light lan-
guithes and leffens, the farther it removes
from its proper Source.
The nearer the Object is to the Eyes, and
the more directly it is oppofed to them, the
better it is feen, becaufe the Sight is wea-
kened by Distance.
It is therefore neceffary io that thofe Parts
 of round Bodies, which are feen directly
 oppofite to the Spectator, should have the
 Light entire;
and that the Extremities
turn, in lofing themfelves infenfibly and con-
fafedly, without precipitating the Light all on
the fudden into the Shadow, or the Shadow
into the Light. But the Paffage of one into
the other muft- be common and impercepti-
ble; that is, by Degiees of Lights into Sha-
dows, and of Shadows into Lights. And it
is in Conformity to thefe Principles, that you
ought to treat  whole Groupe of Figures,
though it be compofed of feveral Parts, in the
Lame Manner as you would do  fingle Head:
Or if the Wideness of the Space, or Large-
"ness of the Compofition, requires that you

 sharper and rougher than what is
 to them, more diffind by  firm Light
 Shadow, and with more folid and fub-
 Colours; that, on the contrary,
 finoother and more tranfparent may be
 off to  farther Diftance.
We are never to admit two equal Lights in
the same Picture, but the greater Light muft
rike forcibly on the middle; and there ex
tend its greateff Clearness on thofe Places of
the Picture, where the principal Figures of it
are, and where the Strength of the Action is
performed, diminifhing by Degrees as it comes
nearer and nearer to the Borders; and after
the fame Manner that the Light of the Sun
languiches infenfibly, in its preading from
the Ealt, from whence it begins, towards the
Welt, where it decays and vanifhes; fo the
Light of the Picture being diftributed over
all the Colours, will become lets fenfible, the
farther it is removed from its Original.
The Experience of this is evident in thofe
Statues, which we fee fet up in the midtt of
public Places, whofe upper Parts are more
enlightened than the lower; and therefore
you are to imitate them in the Distribution
of your Lights.
Avoid Hrong Shadows on the middle of
the Lumbs, left the great Quantity of Black
which compofes thofe Shadows should teem to
enter into them, and to cut them; rather take
Care to place those Shadowings round about

tions drawn from 
Pure or unmixed White either draws an
Object nearer, or carries it off to farther Dif-
tance; it draws it nearer with Elack, and
throws it backward without it.  But as for
pure Black, there is nothing which brings the
Object nearer to the Sight.
The Light being altered by some Colour,
never fails to communicate fomewhat of that
Colour to the Bodies on which it ftrikes; and
the same Effect is performed by the Medium
of Air, through which it paffes.
The Bodies which are clofe together, re-
ceive from each other that Colourwhich is op-
pofite to them; and reffect on each other that
which is naturally and properly their own.
It is alfo confonant to Reafon, that the
greatef Part of thofe Bodies which are under
 Light, which is extended and diffributed
equally through all, should participate of each
others Colours. The Venerian School having
 great Regard for that Maxim (which the
Ancients called the Breaking of Colours) in
the Quantity of Figures with which they fill
their Pictures, have always endeavoured the
Union of Colours; for Fear, that being too
different, they should come to encumber
the Sight; & therefore they painted each Fi-
 gure with one Colour, or with Colours of
near Affinity, though the Hlabit were of
different Kinds, diftinguithing the upper

CHARLES ALPHONSE DU FRESNOY
AINTING and Poesy are two Sifters,
&. It is  received Truth; that the
Arts have  certain Relation to each
other. Thire is no Art (Laid Terfullian, in
his Treatife of Idolatry) which is not eitber
the Father or the near Relation of another
And Cicero, in his Oration for Archias the
Roet, fays, that the Arts which bave respect
to buman Life, have  kind of Alliance amongtt
themfelves, and hold each other (as we may say)
by the Hand. But thofe Arts which are the
nearell related, and claim the moft ancient
Kindred with each other, are Painting and
Pectry; and whofoever shall thoroughly exa-
mine them, will find them to much refem-
bling one another, that he cannot take them
for lets than Siffers.
They both follow the same Bent, and fuffer
themfelves to be rather carried away, than
ted by their secret Inclinations, which are fo

many.

Imitation. Both of them excite our Paffions;
and we fuffer ourfelves willingly to be de¬

our Eyes and Souls are to fixed to them, that
we are ready to perfuade ourfelves, that the
painted Bodies breathe, and that the Fic-

both endeavour to eternize them. Both of

For both these Arts that they might advance,
&. Poetry by its Hymns and Anthems, and
Painting by its Starues, Atar-pieces, and by
all thole Decoraions which inspire Respect
and Reverence for our facred Myfferies, have
been serviceable to Religion. Gregory of Nice,
after having made  long and beautiful De-

quent Vifits: Infomuch that we might shortly
fee the ge of Apelles reviving in our Coun
try, together with all the beauteous Arts, if
our generous Nobility, who follow our in-
comparable King with to much Ardour and
Courage in thofe Dangers, to which he ex-
pofes his facred Perfon, for the Greatness
and Glory of his Kingdom, would imitate
him in that wonderful Affection, which he
bears to all who are excellent in this Kind.
Thofe Perfons who were the moft confider.
able in ancient Greece, either for Birth or
Merit, took  moft particular Care for many
Ages, to be instructed in the Art of Paint-
ing; following that laudable and profitable
Cuffom, begun and eftablifhed by the great
Alexander which was, to learn how to de-
fign. And Pliny, who gives Teltimony to
this, in the tenth Chapter of his  Book,
tells us farther ((peaking of Pumpbilus, the
Matter of Apelles) that it avas by the Aurbority
of lexander, that firff at Sicyon, and after-
wards through all trreece, the young Gentlemen
learned before all otber Things to design upon  
blets of boxen Wood; and that the firft Place
among all the liberal Arts was given to Paint
ing. And that which makes it evident, that
they were very knowing in this Art, is, the
Love


Art of Painting.
Love and Efteem which they had for Painters.
Demerrius gave high Tertimonies of this, when.
he befieged the City of Rbodes; for he was
pleafed to employ some Part of that Time,.
which he owed to the Care of his Arms, in
vifiting Profogenes, who was then drawing the
Pilture of Lalyjus. This Lalyfus (Lays Pliny).
bindered King Demetrius from taking Rhodes,
out of Fear left be should burn the Pictures; and
not being able to fire the Town on any other Side,
he was pleased rather to spare the Painting, than
to take the Victory, awhich was already in bis
Hands. Prorogenes, at that Time, had his
Painting-reom in  Garden out of the Town,
and very near the Camp of the Enemies,
where he was daily finifhing thofe Pieces which
he had already begun; the Noife of Soldiers
not being capable of interrupting his Studies:
But Demerrias caufing him to be brought into.
his Prefence, and alking him, Whatmade him
to bold, as to work in the midft of Enemies ?
He antwered the King, that he underffood the
Warawbick be made was againft the Rhodians,
and not againff the Arts. This obliged Deme-
trius to appoint him Guards for his Security;
being infinitely pleafed that he could preserve
that Hand, which by this Means he faved
from the Barbarity and Infolence of Soldiers.
Aexander had no greater Pleafure than when
he was in the Painting-room of Apelles, where
he commonly was found: And that Painter
once received from him  fenfible Teftimony
of Love and Efteem, which that Monarch had
for him; for having cauted him to paint naked
(by reafon of her admirable Beauty) one of
his Concubines, called Campaspe, who had the
greatell Share in his Affections; and berceiv-
ing that Apelles was wounded with the fame
fatal


 on the
fatal Dart of Beauty, he made  Prefent of her
to him. In that Age, fo great & Deference was
paid to Painting, that they who had any Maf
tery in that Art, never painted on any thing
but whatwas portable from one Place to ano-
sher, and what could be secured from burning.
They took  particular Care (Lays Pliny, in
the Place above cited) not to paint any thing
againft  Wall, which could only belong toone
Mafter; and muft always remain in the same
Place; and for that Reafon could not be re
moved in cafe of an accidental Fire. Men
were not suffered to keep  Picture, as it were
in Prison, on the Walls: It dwelt in common
in all Cities, and the Painter himfelf was
respected as  common Good to all the World.
See this excellent uthor, and you shall find,
that the roth Chapter of his  Book is filled
with the Praifes of this Art, and with the He
nours wbichwere ascribed to it. Vou will there
find, that it was not permitted to any but
thofe of noble Blood to profefs it. Francis the
Firft (as Vasari tells us) was in Love with
Painting to that Degree, that he allured out of
Iraly all the beft Mafters, that this Art might
flourith in his own Kingdom; and, amongt
others, Leonardo da Vinci, who, after having
continnued for some Time in France, died at
Fontainblean, in the Arms of that great King
who could not behold his Death, withoutfhed
ding Tears over him. Charkes the Fifth has
adorned Spain with the nobleft Pictures which
are now remaining in the World. Ridelpbi,
in his Life of Titian, fays,  hat Emperor onn
Day took up  Pentil, which soll frim the Hand
of that Artiff, who was then drawing bis Pic
Firidn
tare; and, upon the Compliment which
Wordss
made him on this Occasion, be said these
Titias

Titian has deferved to be served by Exfar.
And in the same Life it is remarkable, that
the Emperor valued himself, not so much in sub-
jecting Kingdoms and Procoinces, as that he had
beenthrice made immortal by the Handof Tiian.
If you will but take the Pains to read this
famous Life in Ridelpbi, you will there fee
the Relation of all thofe Honours which he
received from Charles the Fifth. It would
take up too much Time here to recount all
the Particulars:  will only obferve, that the
greateff Lords, who composed the Court of
that Emperor, not being able to refrain from
Some Marks of Jealouty, upon the Preference
which he made of the Perfon and Converfa-
tion of Titian, to that of all his other Cour-
tiers; he freely told them, that be contderever
want  Court or Courtiers; but he could not
have Titian always with him. Accordingly,
he heaped Riches on him; and whenfoever he
fent him Money, which, ordinarily speaking,
was  great Sum, he always did it with this
obliging Teftimony, that his Defign was nor
to pay him the Value of his Pictures, because
they were above any Price. fter the Example
of the Worthies of Antiquity, who bought
the rarelt Pictures with Buthels of Gold, with-
out counting the Weight or the Number of
the Pieces, In numme auree, menfurd accepit,
non numere (lays Pliny, (peaking of Apelles).
Puinfilian infers from hence; that there is no-
thing more noble than the Art of Painting; be-
caule other Things for the moll part are Mer-
chandife, and bought at certain Rares: Moft
Things for this very Reafon, fays he, are vile,
becaufe they have  Price: Pleraque boc ipp

treme Paffion, and have exercifed themfelves
in it with Delight. Amongft others, Lalins
Fabius, one of thote famous Romans, who, as
Gicero relates, after he had tafed Painting,
and had practifed it, would be called Fabins
Pictor: As allo Turpilins,  Roman Knight;
Labeo, Preter and Conful, Quintus Pedius; the
Poets Ennius and Pacuvius; Socrates, Plaie,
Mctredorus, Pyrrbo, Commodus, Neve, Vespa-

other Kings and Emperors, who thought if
not below their Majefty, to employ fome
Part of their Time in this honourable Art.
The principal and most important Part of
Painting is to find out, and therougbly to under-
frand, awbat Nature bath made mest beautiful,
and most proper to this Art, &. Obferve here
the Rock on which the greateft Part of the
Flemish Painters have (plir. Moft of that Na-
tion Know how to imitate Nature, at leaff as

they make  bad Choice in Nature itfelf;
whether it be that they have not feen the an.

 happy Genius, and the beautiful Nature, is
not of the Growth of their Country. And to
confess the Truth, that which is naturally
beautiful is fo very rare, that it is difcovered
by few Perfons; it is very difficult to make 
Choice of it, and to form to ourfelves fuch an
Idea of it, as may ferve us for  Model.
And that  Choice of it may be made accords

made from the Time of Alexander the Great,
till that of Phocas; during whofe Empire the
Artswere ruined by War. Thefe ancient Works
from their Beginning have been the Rule of
Beauty; and in Effect, the Authers of them
have been so careful to give them that Pers
fection, which is ftill to be obferved in them,
that they made fe not only of one fingle
Body, whereby they formed them, but of
many, from which they took the moft regu-
lar Parts, to compofe from them  beautiful
Whole. The Sculptors (Jays Maximus Tyrius,
in his  Differtation) with admirable Arri-
fice, chose out of many Bodies those Parts which
appeared to them the most beautiful; and out of
that Diversity made but one Statue. But this
Mixture is made with so much Prudence and
Propriety, that they seem to have taken but one
only perfect Beauty. And ler us not imagine
what ave can ever find one natural Beauty,

in it with Delight. Amongft others, Eelins

Cicero relates, after he had taked Painting,
and had practifed it, would be called Fabins
Pictor: As alfo Turpilins,  Roman Knight;
Labeo, Preter and Consid, Quintus Pedius; the
Poets Ennius and Pacuvius; Secrates, Plate,
Mctrodorus, Pyrrbo, Commodns, Nero, Vespa-
fian, Alexander Severus, Anteninus, and many
other Kings and Emperors, who thought it
not below their Majelty, to employ fome
Part of their Time in this honourable Art.
The principal and most important Part of
Painting is to find our, and thoroughly to under-
fand, awbat Nature bath made most beautiful,
and most proper to this Art, &. Obferve here

Flemish Painters have (plic: Moft of that Na.

they make  bad Choice in Nature itfelf;
whether it be that they have not feen the an.
crent Pieces, to find thofe Beauties; or that
 happy Genius, and the beautiful Nature, is
not of the Growth of their Country. And to
confess the Truth, that which is naturally
beautiful is fo very rare, that it is difcovered
by few Perfons; it is very difficult to make 
Choice of it, and to form to ourfelves fuch an
Idea of it, as may ferve us for  Model.
And that  Cboice of it may be made accord:

made from the Time of lexander the Great,
till that of Phocas; during whofe Empire the
Artswere ruined by War. Thefe ancient Works
from their Beginning have been the Rule of
Beauty; and in Effect, the durbors of them
have been fo careful to give them that Per-
fection, which is still to be obferved in them,
that they made Ufe not only of one fingle
Body, whereby they formed them, but of
many, from which they took the moft regu-
lar Parts, to compofe from them  beautiful
Whole. The Sculptors (Tays Maximus Tyrius,
in his  Differtation) with admirable Arti-
fice, chose out of many Bodies those Parts which
appeared to them the moft beautiful; and out of
that Diversity made but one Statue. But this
Mixture is made with so much Prudence and
Propriety, that they seem to have taken but one
only perfect Beauty. And ler us not imagine
that ve can ever find one natural Beauty,
which can dispute awith Statues that Art, which

 It is alfo to be prefumed, that in the
Choice which they made of thofe Parts, they
followed the Opinion of the Physicians, who
at that Time were very capable of inftruct-

Beauty and Health ordinarily follow each
other. For Beauty (Jays Galen) is nothing
elfe but  juft Accord, and mutual Harmony of
the Members, animated by  healthful Confir-
tution. And Men (Tays the fame Author)
commend  certain Statue of Polycletus, avbich

and that Nature will ever be beautiful
which refembles those Beauties of Anriquity.
It is now evident upon what Account none
have prefumed to conteft the Proportion of
thofe ancient Pieces; and that, on the con
trary, they have always been quoted as Mo.
dels of the moft perfect Beauty. Ovid, in
the  Book of his Meramorpboses, where
he defcribes Cyllaras, the moft beautiful of
all the Centaurs, fays, that he had so great 
Vivacity in his Countenance, bis Neck, his Shout
ders, his Hands and Stomach were so fair, tha
it is certain the manly Part of him avas as braw
tiful as the most celebrated Statues. And Phi-
leffratus, in his Heroies ((peaking of Profe
plans) and praifing the Beauty of his Face,
Lays, that the Form of his Nose awas squary
as if it had been of  Statue: And in another
Place, peaking of Euphorbys, he fays, that
bis Beauty had gained the Affections of all ih
GGrecks, and that it resembled so nearly ihn
Brauty of  Statue, that one might have takn
him for Apollo. Afterwards alfo (freakinf
of the Beauty of Neoprolemns, and of his
Likeness to his Father Acbilles) he fays, that
in Beauty his Farher had the same Advantag
over him, as Stotues bove over the Bedary of
living Men.

monious in the Distribution of their Parts,
which makes it evident, that at that Time
they wroughton common Principles, and that
every one of them availed himfelf of thofe
Principles, according to his Capacity and
Genius. Thofe Starues were the greateit
Ornaments of Greece; we need only open the
Book of Pausanias, to find the prodigious
Quantity of them, whether within or without
their Temples, or in the croffing of Streets,
or in the Squares and public Places, or evern
the Fields, or on the Tombs. Statues were
crected to the Muses, to the Nympbs, to He-
roes, to great Captains, to Magiffrates, Pbi-
losopbers and Poers; in thort, they were fet up
to all thofe who had made themfelves emi-
pent, either in Defence of their Country, or
for any noble Action, which deferved  Re-
compence: For it was the moft ordinary and
moff authenric Way, both amongft the Greeks
and Remans, thus to teffify their Gratitude.
The Romans, when they had conquered Gre-
cis, transported from thence not only their
moff admirable Statues, but alfo brought
along with them the moft excellent of their
Sculptors, who indructed others in their Art,
and have left to Pofterity the immortal Ex-
amples of their Knowledge, which we fee
confirmed by thofe curious Starmes, thofe
Vases, thofe Baso Relievo', and thofe beau-
tiful Columns, called by the Names of Trajan
and Antonins. Thefe are thofe Beauties which
our Author proposes to us for our Models,
and the true Fountains of Science; out of
which both Painters and Starsaries are bound
to draw for their own Ofe, without amufing
themfelves with dipping in Streams which are

thic Manner, which is not conducted by any
Rule, but only follows  wretched Fancy,
which has nothing in it that is noble. We
are here to obferve, that Painters are not
obliged to follow the Anrique as exactly as the
Sculptors; for then the Picture would favour
too Rrongly of the Starme, and would seem to
be without Motion. Many Painters, and some
of the ableff amongt them, believing they
do well, and taking that Precept in too literal
 Senfe, have fallen thereby into great incon.
veniencies; it therefore becomes the Painters
to make Ufe of thofe ancient Patterns with
Difcretion, and to accommodate the Nature
of them in fuch  Manner, that their Figures,
which muft feem to live, may rather appear
to be Models for the Antique, than the Antigue
 Model for their Figures.
It appears that Raphael made  perfect Ufe
of this Conduct; and that the Lombard Scheol
have not precifely fearched into this Precept,
any farther than to learn from thence how to
make  good Choice of the Nature, and to
give  certain Grace and Nobleness to all
their Works, by the general and confuted
Idea, which they had of what is beautiful.

who was Cotemporary to that Lncas, has had

Manner, becaufe he had never feen any thing
that was beautiful. Obferve what Vasari

Coul and Reason, which are the three Parts
neceffarily confirtuent of  Man. How there-

the Works of others, who therein employ
their whole Indufiry; and with that only

you, that it had been their better Courfe

have not thereby done themfelves much He-

Part of their Reputation. Let us then con-
ciude, that all Painters ought to acquire
this Part of Excellence; not to do it, is to
want Courage, and not dare to thew them-
selves. It is to creep and grovel on the

leave them liable to Cenfure for fifteen Vears,

 begin early to do fomewhat of his own,

Thus it is neceffary, that they who are de-
frous of  Name in Painting, should read
at Leifure-Times thefe Books with Dili-
fgence; and make their Observations of fuch
Things as they find for their Purpofe in
them, and of which they believe they may
ome Time or other have Occafion. Let
the imagination be employed in this Read-
ing; and let them make Skerches, and light
Touches of thofe Ideas, which that Read-
ing forms in their imagination. Quintilian,
acctes, or whoever was the Author of that
Dialogue, which is called, in Larn, De Cau-
is corruptce Eloquentie, lays, that Painting
&fembles Fire, which is fed by the Fuel, in-
flamed by Motion, and gathers Strength by
Burning: For the Power of the Gemus is ony
augmented by the tundance of Matter to sup-
bly it; and it is impossible to make  great and
 guificent Work, if that Matter be wanting,
 not dispased rightly. And therefore  Pain-
fer, who has  Crenius, gets nothing by
ong Thinking, and taking all imaginable
:re to make  noble Compofition, if he be
bit affitied by thofe Studies which  have
pentioned. All that he can gain by it, is,
only to weary his Imagination, and to travel
Ever many vall Countries, without dwelling
 any one Thing which can give him Satit-
aition.

for the Oeconoimy, or Ordering of the Whole
together, none but only the Painter can un-

pleafingly to deceive the Eyes, which he can
never accomplish, if this Part be wanting to
him.  Picture may have an ill Effect,
though the Invention of it be truly underftood,
the Design of it correct, and the Colours of it
the moft beautiful and fine that can be em-

behold other Pictures ill invented, ill defigned,

Decorum, to mark them by Folds, but with
great Difcretion; for what concerns the Feet,

to subjsct themfelves to retouch any thing

Without sitting too frait upon them, &.
Painters ought not to imitate the Ancients in
this Circumftance. The ancient Statuaries
made their Draperies of wet Linen, on Pur-
pofe to make them fit clofe and frait to
the Parts of their Figures; for doing which,
they had great Reafon; and in following
which, the Painters would be much in the
Wrongs and you shall fee upon what Grounds:
Thofe great Geniufes of Antiquity; finding
that it was impoffible to imitate with Marble
the Finenets of Stuffs or Garments, which it
not to be difcerned but by the Colours, the
Reffexes, and more especially by the Lightt
and Shadows; finding it,  fay, out of their
Power to difpofe of thofe Things, thought
they could not do better, nor more pruden
tially, than to make Ife of such Draperies, ai

the Delicacy of the Fleth, and the Purity of
the Outlines; Things, which truly speaking;
they poffeffed in the laft Perfection, and which
in all Appearance were the Subject of their

fee that thofe who have made the neareft
Imitations of Nature, have made Ofe of fuch
Stuffs, or Garments, which are familiar to our
Sight; and thefe they have imitated with to
much Art, that, in beholding them, we are
pleafed that they deceive us; fuch were  Paul Veronese, Tintoret, Rubens, Vandyke,
and the reft of the good Colouriffs, who have
come neareff to the Truth of Nature. In-
Read of which, others who have fcrupuloufly
fied themfelves to the Practice of the An-
cients in their Draperies, have made their
Works crude and dry; and by this Means
have found out the lamentable Secret, how
to make their Figures harder than even the
Marble itfeif; as Andrea Mantegna, and Pie-
tre Perngino have done; and Raphael alto
had much of that Way in his firft Works, in
which we behold many small Foldings often
repleated, which look like fo many Whip-
Cords. It is true, thefe Reperitions are feen
in the ancient Starses, and they are very pro-
per there; becaufe they who made Ule of
wetLinen, and clofe Draperies, to make their
Figures look more tender, reafonably forefaw
that the Members would be too naked, if
they left not more than two or three Folds,
tuch as thofe Sorts of Draperies afford them,
and therefore have ufed thofe Repetitions of
many Folds; yet in fuch  Manner, that the
Figures are always foft and tender, and there-
by teem oppofite to the Hardness of Marble.
Add to this, that in Scalprure, it is almoft
Impoffible that  Figure, cloathed with coarfe
Draperies, can make  good Effect on all the

of what Kind foever they be, are of fres

the Groupes; or to give fuch  Ground; is
one would with to unite, or to feparate; of
farther, to produce fuch Reffectrons as fr
off; or for filling void Spaces; or in shot,
for many other Advantagess which help to
deceive the Sight, and which are no ways
eceffary to Sculgrers, fince their Work is al
Ways of Relievo.
Three Things may be inferred from whail
have faid, concerning the Rule of Draperies
Firtt, that the ancient Sculprors had Reafon to
cloath their Figures as we fee them. Second
ly, that Painters ought to imitate them in the
Order of their Folds, but not in their Ous
lity, nor in their Number. Thirdly; thai
Seulprors are obliged to follow them as much
as they can, without defiring to imitate un
profitably or improperly the Manner of the
Painters, by making many ample Fold,
which are infufferable Hardneffes, and look
more like  Rock, than  atural Gor
ment. See the  Remart about the
Middle of it.

somewhat too much multiplied the Foldsz.
becaufe being with Reafon charmed with the
Graces of the Ancients, he imitated their
Beauties fomewhat too regularly; but hav-
ing afterwards found, that this Quantity of
Folds glittered too much upon the Limbs,.
and took off that Repofe and Silence, which
in Painting are fo friendly to the Eyes; he
made fe of  contrary Conduct, in the
Works which he painted afterwards, which
was at that Time when he began to underftand:
the Effect of Lights, of Groupes, and the
Oppositions of the Lights and Shadows; fo
that he wholly changed his Manner (this was.

he always gave  Grace to whatfoever he

As supposing them to be Magiffrates, their
Draperies ought to be large, &cc. Vet make
not your Draperies fo large, that they may
be big enough to cloath four or five Figures,.
as some there are who follow that Method.
And take fleed that the Foldings be natural,.
and to difpoted, that the Eye may be direcied

It is eafy for every one to judge, that betwint

young Mards, there muft be fome Mediocrity
of Folds, fuch as are moff commonly feen
and obferved; as in the Draperies of  Cbrif.

pleafe, that the light and tender Draperies

the ancient Scaptors have avoided, as much
as they could, to cloath the Figures of Men,

 very bad Effeel. There are almoff  Examples of this Truth; as amongt
 of Painting.

 will name only that of Laocoon, which, ac-
cording to all Probability, ought to have

hood can there be, that the Son of  King;
and the Prieft of Apollo, should appear naked
in the actual Ceremony of Sacrifice ? For
the Serpents paffed from the Ile of Tenedos
to the Trogan Shore, and furprized Ldocoon,
and his Sons, while they were facrificing to
Neptune on the Sea-sbore, as Virgil witneffes
in the second of his Eneids. NotwithRand-
ing which, the Sculptors  who were An
thors of this noble Work, had well confi-
dered, that they could not give Veftments
faitable to the Quality of the Perfons repre-
fented, without making, as it were,  Heap
of Stones, whofe Mats would rather be like
 Rock, than thofe three admirable Figures,
which will ever be the Admiration of all
Ages. And for this Reafon, of two Incon-
veniencies, they judged that of Draperies to
be greater than that which was againft the
Truth itfelf.

bits, are destructive to each other, becaute
they draw the Sight to feveral Places at the
Same Time, and hinder round Bodies from
turning, and making their due Effect; it is
the very Quantity which often makes us
judge that they are falfe. And befides, it is
to be prefumed, that precious Things are al

By this Rule we plainly fee, how neceffary

have not altogether received from Heaven
this precious Giff, cannot acquire it without
great Labour; neverthelets ir is needful, in
my Opinion, that both the one and the

All the ctions of the sensstive Appetite
are in Painting called Passions, becaute the
Soul is agitated by them, and becaufe the
Body fuffers through them, and is fenfibly
altered. They are thofe divers Agitations
and different Motions of the Body in gene-
fal, and of every one of its Parts in parti-
cular, that our excellent Painter ought to
underftand; on which he ought to make
his Study, and to form to himself  perfect

Cophers admit eleven; Love, Hatred, Defire,
Shunning, Toy, Sadness, Hope, Despair, Bold-

sucb Lines in the Parts of the Face, formed
of such or Juch  Fasbion, or even the one
and the other both together; for the Parts
of the Body feparately, make Known the
Passions of the Sonl, or elfe conjointly, one
with the other: But of all the Parts, the
Head is that which gives the moft of Life;
and the moft of Grace to the Passion, and
which alone contributes more to it, than all
the reft together. The orbers separately can
only exprets fome certain Passions, but the
Head exprefies all of them; neverthelets there
are some which are more particular to it;
 for Example, Humility, which it ex-
preffes by the Stooping or Bending of the
Head. Arragance, when it is litted, or, as
We fay, tofied up. Languishment, when we
hang it on one Side, or lean it upon one
Shoulder. Obffinacy (or, as the French call
I Opiniarrere) with  certain Rubborn, un-
ruly, barbarous Humour, when it is held up-
right, Riff and poifed betwixt the Shoul-
ders. And of the reft, there are many
Marks, more eafily conceived, than they can
be exprefied; as Bashfulness, Admiration, In-
dignation, and Doubr.. It is. by the Head that
 make Known more vifibly our Supph-
cations, our Tbreatnings, our Mildness, our
Haughtiness, our Love, our Harred, our Jey,
our Sadness, our Humilty; in fine, it is
enough to fee the Face, and to underfland
the Mind at half  Word. Blaping and Pals-
 on the
ness fpeak to us, as alfo the Mixture of the
Doth.
The Parts of the Face do all of thes
contribute to expofe the Thoughts of on
Hearts; but above the reft, the Eyes, which
are, as it were, the two Windows, through
which the Soul looks out, and thews it
felf. The Passions which they more part
cularly exprets, are, Plecsure, Languissment,
Disdain, Severity, Sweetness, Admiration ad
Anger.

the servants of the Head, they are his Wea-
pons and his Auxiliaries; without them the
Altion is weak, languithing, and haif dead.

make innumerable Expreffions. It is not
by them, that we defire, that we boge, that
we promise, that we call rewards us, and
What we rejecr. Befides, sbey are the Intru-
ments of our Tbreats, of our Petitions, of the
Hrror which we shew for Things, and of the
Praifes which we give them. By them we
fear we aft Questions, we approve, and we
resuse, we shew our Tey and our Sadness, our
Douhts and our Lamentations, our Cencern-

it may be faid, that they are the Language

Now to tell you how thefe Parts are to

is impostible; no precife Rales can be given
of it, both becaufe the Talk itfelf is int

Conduct of his own Genins, and to the Frint
of his former Studies; only remember to be
careful, that all the Actions of your Figurs

explained by the Words of an excellent Mat

Rudied Motions of the Soul are never so naw

expreffed, and be much more natural, if we
enter into the fame Thoughts, become of the

the same Circumstances with thofe whom wel
would reprefent. For Nature (Tays Horad

to ourselves the Visions and  of absent
Things, as if they avere in Reality before our
Eyes; and he who conceives these Images with
the greateft Strength of Imagination, shall pos-
fess that Part of the Passions with the most
Advantage, and the greateff Ease. But we
mutt take Care (as  have already faid) that
in thefe Vifions, the Motions may be natu-
ral; for there are fome who imagine, they
have given Abundance of Light to their Fi-
gures, when they have made them do violent
and extravagant Actions; which we may more
realonably call the Convulsions, or Contersions
of the Body, than the Paffions of the Mind;
and by this Means they often put themfelves
to much Pains to find  Hrong Paffion, where
no Paftion is required. Add to all that 
have faid concerning the Paffions, that we
are to have  very ferious Regard to the Qua-
lity of the Perfons who are to be expreffed in
Pasions. The Joy of  King ought not to re-
temble that of  Serving-man; and the Fierce-

The Cromatic Part, or Colouring, &&. Te
third and latt Part of Painting is called ihs
Cromatic, or Colouring. Its Object is Cr
lour; for which Reafon, Lights and Shadons
are therein alfo comprehended, which are ne.

and by Confequence have their Place among
the Colours. Phileffratus fays, in his Lifey

We may add to what Phileffratas has faid,
that with two Colours only (the Light and

the Dark) there is no Sort of Stuff or Ha-
bit, but may be imitated. We fay then,
that the Colouring makes its Observations
on the Maffes or Bodies of the Colours, ac-
companied with Lights and Shadows, more
or less evident by Degrees of Diminution,
according to the Accidents Firft, of  lu-
minous Body; as for Example, the Sun or

the Knowledge which it has of the Virtue of
Colours, and the Friendship which they have
with each other, and alfo their Antipathies,
comprehends the Strength, the Relievo, the
Brikkness, and the Delicacy, which are ob-
terved in good Pictures; the Management
of Colours, and the Labour, depends alfo on
his latt Part.

Pleafure. Thefe Repofes are made two fe
veral Ways, one of which is natural, the
other artificial. The natural is made by an
Extent of Lights or of Shadows, which na
turally and necefiarily follow folid Bodies;
or the Maffes of folid Bodies aggroupedf
when the Light trikes upon them. And the
artifcial counfts in the Bodies of Coloury
which the Painter gives to certain Things
such as pleafes him; and compofes them inf
such  Manner, that they do no injury to ids
Objects which are near them.  Drapery

take Occafion, as much as poffibly we can,
to make Ife of the firft Manner, and to find
the Repofe of which we speak, by the Light
and by the Shadow, which naturally accom-
pany folid Bodies. But fince the Subjects
on which we work, are not always favourable
to difpote the Bodies as we defire;  Painter
in fuch  Cafe may take his Advantage by
the Bodies of Colours, and put into fuch
Places as ought to be darkened, Draperies,
or other Things, which we may fuppofe to
be naturally brown and fullied, which will
produce the fame Effect, and give him the
same Repofes as the Shadows would do, which
could not be cauted by the Dispolition of the
Objects.
Thus an underftanding Painter will make
his Advantages both of the one Manner and
the other. And if he makes  Defign to be
graved, he is to remember that the Gravers
dispofe not their Colours as the Painters do;
and that by Confequence, he muft take Oc-
cation to find the Reafon of his Design in
the natural Shadows of the Figures, which
the has dispoted to caufe the Effect. Rubens
thas given us  full information of this, in
thofe Prints of his, which he caufed to be
engraved; and  believe that nothing was
terer seen more beautiful in that Kind: The
Whole Knowledge of Groupes, of the Lights
and Shadows, and of thoie Maffes which
Wilian calls  Bunch of Grapes, is there ex-
poted to clearly to the Sight, that the View
of thofe Prims, and the careful Obfervation
of them, might very much contribute to
the Forming of an able Painter. The bett
hnd fairell of them are graven by Vafterman,
Pintins, and Bolfvert; all of them admira-
ble
  on the
ble Gravers, whofe Works Rubens himfel
took Care to overfee; and which, without
Doubt, you will find to be excellent, if you
examine them. But expect not there the
Elegance of Defign, nor the Correctness of the
Outlines.
It is not but the Gravers can, and ought
to imitate the Bodies of the Colours by the
Degrees of the Lights and Shadows, as much
as they shall judge that this Imitation may
produce  good Effect. On the contrary, it
 impoffible, in my Opinion, to give mach
Strength to what they grave, after the Works
of the School of Venice (and of all thofe who
have had the Knowledge of Colours, and
of the Contraff of the Lights and Shadows
without imitating in fome fort the Colourof
the Objects, according to the Relation which
they have to the Degrees of Whice and Black.
We fee certain Prints of good Gravers dif-
ferent in their Kinds, where thefe Things
are obferved, and which have  wonderful
Strength. And there appears in public, of
late Years,  Gallery of Archduke Leopold;
which, tho' very ill graven, yet shews fomb
Part of the Beauty of its Originals, becaute
the Gravers who have executed it (though
otherwife they were fufficiently ignoranl)
have obferved in almoft the greateff Parts of
their Prints, the Bodies of Colours, in the
Relation which they have to the Degrees of
the Lights and Shadows.  could with the
Gravers would make fome Reffection upou

be well performed.
As in  consex Mirror the collected Rays
frike fronger, &cc.  convex Mirror alters
the Objects which are in the Middle, to that
it feems to make them come out from the
Snpersicies. The Painter mult do in the same
Manner, in respect of the Lights and Shadows
of his Figures, to give them more Relievo
and more Strength.
While the Goings off are more and more
broken and faint, as they approach to the Ex-
tremities, &cc. It is the Duty of  Painter
even in this alfo, to imitate the convex Mir-
rer, and to place nothing which glares, ei-
ther in Colour or in Light, at the Borders of
his Picture; for which there are two Rea-
sons: The firtt is, that the Eye, at the firft
View, directs isfelf to the midft of the Object,
which is prefented to it; and by confequence,
mull there neceffarily find the principal Ob-
sell, in order to its Satisfaction: And the
other Reafon is, that the Sides or Borders
being overcharged with  ffrong and glitter-
ing Work, attract the Eyes thither, which
are in  Kind of Pain, not to behold  Con-
linuity of that Work, which is on the fudden
interrupted by the Borders of the Picture;
intead of which, the Borders being ligh-
tened, and cafed of to much Work, the Eye
continues fixed on the Center of the Pic-
ture, and beholds it with greater Pleafure.
 is for the same Reafon, that in  great
Composition of Figures, thofe which com-
ing moft forward, are cut off by the Bot-
tom
   on the
tom of the Picture, will always make an ill
Effect.
 Bunch of Grapes, &cc. It is fufficienty
pranifeft, that Tiran, by this judicious and
familiar Comparifon, means, that  Painter
ought to collect the Objects, and to dispole
them in fuch  Manner, as to compofe one
Wholes the feveral contiguous Parts of which
may be enliohtened, many fhadowed, and
others of broken Colours to be in the Tum-
ings; as on  Bunch of Grapes, many Grapes,
which are the Parts of it, are in the Light,
many in the Shadow, and the reft faintly co.
loured, to make them go farther back.  once told Tintoret, that, in his greatef
Works,  Bunch of Grapes had been his princ-
pal Rule, and his sureft Guide.
Pure or unmixed White either draws an Ob.
jeet nearer, or carries it off to farther Diffanct.
It draws it nearer with Black, and throws it
backward vitheut it, Ec. All agree: that
White can fubfiff on the Fore-ground of the
Picture, and there be ufed without Mixture:
The Queftion therefore is to know if it can
equally fubfiff, and be placed in the same
Manner upon that which is backward, the
Light being univerfal, and the Figures fup-
pofed in  campaign and open Field.
Our Aurbor concludes affirmatively; and
the Reafon on which he eftabliffies his Rule,
is this. That there being nothing which
partakes more of the Light than Whiteness,
and the Light being capable of fubfiffing
well in Remoteness (or at  long Dillance, as
we daily fee in the Rifing and Setting of the
Sun) it follows, that White may fubfiff in the
Same Manner. In Painting, the Light and  Colour are but one and the fame Thing.

that we have no Colour which
Add to this,
more refembles the Air than White, and by
confequence no Colour which is lighter;
from whence it comes, that we commonly
fay, the Air is heavy, when we fee the Hea-
vins covered with black Clouds, or when 
thick Fog takes from us that Clearness, which
makes the Lightness or Serenity of the Air.
Titian, Tintoret, Paul Veronese, and all thofe
who beft underftood Lights, have obferved it
in this Mianner; and no Man can go againft
this Precept, at leaft without renouncing any
Skill in Landicape, which is an undoubted
Confirmation of this Truth. And we fee that
all the great Maffers of Landscape have fol-
lowed Trian in this, who has always em-
ployed brown and earthly Colours upon the
fore Part, and has referved his greatest Lights
for Remoteneffes, and the back Parts of his
Landscapes.
It may be objected againft this Opinion,
that White cannot maintain itfelf in Remote-
neffes, becaufe it is ordinarily ufed to bring
the Objects nearer on the advanced Part. It
is true that fo it is ufed, and that to very
good Purpofe, to render the Objects more
tentible, by the Opposition of the Dark, which
mult accompany  and which retains it, as
it were by Force; whether the Dark ferves
It for  Ground, or whether it be combined
t it: For Example, if you would make 
white Horse on the Fore-ground of your Pic-
ture, it is of abfolute Neceffity thatthe Ground
muft be of  mixed Brown, and large enough,
or that the Furniture muft be of very fenfible
Colours; or laftly, that fome Figure muft be
fet upon it, whofe Shadows and the Colour
may bring it forward.

But it feems (fay you) that Efue is the

Heavens and Mountains, which are at the
greateff Diftance, are of that Colour. Iis
very true, that Blue is one of the lightef

that it poffeffes thefe Qualities to much the

your Memory that Theerem, which tells you,
that the nearer  Body is to the Light, and
the more directly it is opposed to us, fo much
the more it is enlightened, becaufe the Light
grows languifhing, the farther it removes
from its Original.
You may alfo extinguith your White, if
you suppofe the Air to be fomewhat thicken

But as for pure Black, there is nothing that
brings the Object nearer to the Sight, &cc. Bc.
caute Black is the heavieft of all Colours, the
moft earthy, and the moft fentible. This is
clearly underffood by the Qualities of White
which is oppoted to it, and which is (as wt
have faid) the lighteft of all Colours. Then
are few who are not of this Opinion; and vl

Brown Red is one of the moft earthy and
moft fenfible Colours.
Pint is in its Nature an indifferent Colour,
that is, very fufceptible of the other Colours
by the Nixture: If you mix brown Red with
it, you will make it  very earthy Colour;
but, on the contrary, if you join it with
White or Blse, you shall have one of the moft
faint and tender Colours.
Terre Verte, or green Earth, is light; it
is  Nican betwixt yellow Oker and Ultrama-
ViRe.
Umbre is very fenfible and earthy; there
is nothing but pure Black which can difpute
with it.
Of all Blacks, that is the moft earthy,
which is mott remote from Blue. According
to the Principle which we have eftablifhed of
Whire and Black, you will make every one
of thefe Colours before-named more earthy
and more heavy, the more Black you mingle
with them; and they will be lighter, the
more White you join with them.
For what concerns broken or compound
Colours, we are to make  judgment of
their Strength by the Force of thofe Co-
lours which compofe them. All who have
thoroughly underffood the Agreement of
Colours, have not employed them wholly,
pure and fimple, in their Draperies, un
less in fome Figure upon the Fore-ground
of the Picture; but they have ufed broken
and compound Colours, of which they made
 ffarmony for the Eyes, by mixing thofe
which have fome kind of Sympathy with
each other to make  Whole, which has an
Union with the Colours which are neigh-
bouring to it. The Painter, who perfectly
underftands

lours, will afe them moft fuitably to his pre=
fent Purpofe, and according to his own Dif
cretion.

And if by this Mixture, they make  gra-
cious and fweet Colour, which is pleafing
to the Sight, it is  Sign that there is an
Usion and  Sympathy betwixt them; but
if, on the contrary, that Colour which is
produced by the Mixture of the two, be harth
to the Sight, we are to conclude, that there
is  Contrariety and Antipathy betwixt thefe
two Colours. Green, for Example, is  Colour, which may come from .
Blue and  Fellow mixed together; and by
confequence, Blue and Fellow are two Co-
lours which fimparbixe: nd, on the con-
Hary, the Misture of Blue with Vermilion,
produces  sherj. harfh, and unpleafant Co-
lour; conclude  an that Elae and Vermilion
are of  contrar Nature. And the same may
be said of other Colours, of which you may
make the Experiment, and clear the Matter
once for all. (See the Conclufion of the
 Remark, where  have taken Occafion
to speak of the Force and Quality of every
capital Colour.) Vet you may neglect this
Precept, when your Piece confifts but of one
or two Figures; and when, amongtt  great
Number, you would make fome one Figure
more remarkable than the reft. One,  fay,
which is one of the moft confiderable of the
Subject, and which otherwife you cannot
diltinguith from the reft. Titran, in his Tri-
umph of Bacchus, having placed friadne on
one of the Borders of the Picture, and not
being able, for that Reafon, to make her re-
markable by the Brightness of Light, which
he was to keep in the middle of his Picture,
gave her  Scarf of  Vermition Colour upon 
the Drapery, as well to loofen her from his
Ground, which was  Ghee Sea, as becaufe the

the Sight to that Figure.

Let your Colours be licvely, and yet not look
(according to the Painter’ Proverb) as if they
had been rubbed, or Sprinkled with Meal, &.
Denner dans la farine, is  Phrafe amongit
Painters, which perfectly exprefies what it
which is to paint with clear or bright
Means;
Colours, and dull Colours together; for being
tomingled, they give no more Life to the
Figures, than if they had been rubbed with
Meal. They who make their Fleth Colours
very white, and their Shadows grey, or in-
clining to Green, fall into this Inconvenience.
Red Colours in the Shadows of the moft de-
licate or fineft Flefh, contribute wonderfully
to make them lively, shining, and natural;
but they are to be ufed with the fame Dif-
exetion, that Titian, Paul Veronese, Rubens,
and Vandyke have taught us, by their Ex-
ample.
To preserve the Colours fresh, we muft
paint by putting in more Colours, and not
by rubbing them in, after they are once laid;
and if it could be done, they should be laid
jut in their proper Places, and not be any
more touched when they are once to placed;
becaufe the Freshness of the Colours is tar-
nithed and loft, by vexing them with the con-
finual Drudgery of Daubing
All they who have coloures well, have had
yet another Maarm to maintain their Colours
freth and flourithing, which was to make Ufe
of wbite Grounds, upon which they painted,
and oftentimes at the firft Stroke, without re-
touching any thing, and without employing
new Colours. Rubens always ufed this Way;

Way, the different Tints are fimply laid on,

it is, that White, with other frong Colours,
with which we paint at once that which we
intend to glaze, are, as it were, the Life, the
Spirit, and the Luffre of it. The Ancients
moft certainly have found, thatwhite Grounds

On the Works of the
PRINCIPAL AND BEST PAINTERS
OF THE TO LAST ACES.
AINTINC was in its Perfection amongft
the Greeks. The principal Schools were
at Sycion, afterwards at Rbodes, at Atbens,
and at Corinth, and at laft in Rome. Wars
and Luxary having overthrown the Roman
Empire, it was totally extinguiffed, together
with all the noble Arts, the Studies of Hu-
manity, and the other Sciences.
Ii began to appear again in the Vear  fome Painters of Florence, of which
DOMENICO CHIRLANDAlO Was one, who
Was Mafter to Michael Angelo, and had fome
kind of Reputation, though his Manner was
Gotbic, and very dry.
MICHAEL ANCELO, his Difciple, ffourish-
in the Times of Julius the Second, Lco the
Tenth,


 Judgment of
Tenth, and of feven fucceffive Popes. He
was  Painter  Sculptor, and an Archiied,
both civil and military. The Choice which
he made of his Atticudes was not always
beautiful or pleafing; his Cufto of Defigh
was not the fineff, nor his Outlines the mot
elegant; the Folds of his Draperies, and the
Ornaments of his Habits, were neither noble
nor graceful. He was not  little fantaffical
and extravagant in his Compofitions; he was
hold, even to Rafhnets, in taking Liberties
againft the Rules of Perspective; his Colcur
ing is not over true, or very pleafant: He
Knew not the Artifice of the Lights and Sha-
dows; but he defigned more learnedly, and
better underffood all the Knittings of the
Bones, with the Office and Situation of the
Mufcles, than any of the modern Painters.
There appears  certain Air of Careatness and
Severity in his Figures; in both which he
has oftentimes fucceeded. But above the rel
of his Excellencies, was his wonderful Skill
in Archifecture, wherein he has not only far
paffed all the Moderns, but even the Ancients
alfo; the St. Perers of Reme, the St. Jolns
of Flovence, the Capitol, the Palazse Farniff
and his own House, are fufficient Tefimonies
of it. His Difciples were, Marcelle Venuft
 Reffe, Georgie Vasari, Fra. Baffiane (Who
commonly painted for him) and many other
Florentines.
PIETRO PERYewo defigned with fuff.
cient Knowledge of Nature; but he is dry,
and his Manner little. His Difciple was
RAPHAEL SANTYo, who was born of

furpaffed all modern Painters, becaufe he pof-
feffed more of the excellent Parts of Painting
than any other: And it is believed, that he
equalled the Ancients, excepting only that he
defigned notnaked Bodieswithfomuchlearnr
ing as Michael Angelo; but his Gufto of De-
lign is purer, and much better. He painted
not with fo good, fo full, and fo graceful 
Manner as Correggio; nor has he any thing of
the Contraff of the Lights and Shadows, or fo
brong and free  Colouring as Tirian; but he
had  better Difpofition in his Pieces, without
Comparifon, than either Tirian, Correggie,
Michael Angelo, or all the reft of the fucceed-
ing Painters to our Days. His Choice of At-
Hudes, of Heads, of Ornaments, the Suitable-
ness of his Drapery, his Manner of Defigning;
his Varieties, his Contrafts, his Expreffions,
were beautiful in Perfection; but above all,
he poffeffed the Graces in fo advantageous 
Manner, that he has never fince been equalled
by any other.. There are Portraits (or fingle
Figures) of his, which are finifhed Pieces.
He was an admirable Architect.
He was
handfome, well-made, and tall of Stature,
civil and well-natured, never refufing
toteach
another what he Knew himfelf.
He had
many Scholars; amongtt others,
Tulio Ro-
mano, Pelydore, Gaudenxio, Gievanni
 Udine,
and Michael Goxis. His Graver
Was Mark
Antonio, whofe Prints are admirable for the
Correctness of their Outlines.
JULlo ROMANO was the moft excellent of
all Rupbact’ Difciples: He had Conceptions
which were more extraordinary, more pro-
found, and more elevated than even his Maf
ter himfelf; he was alfo  great Archicecd.;
his Guflo was pure and exquifite. He was

bules, and Portices, all Terrastyles, Liftes, Thea

Ofe. He was wonderful in his Choice of At
titudes. His Manner was drier and harder
than any of Raphael' School. He did notex
actly understand the Lights and Shadows, or
the Colours. He is frequently harth and un
graceful; the Folds of his Draperies are nei.
ther beautiful nor great, eafy hor natural
but all extravagant, and too like the Habis
of fantallical Comedians. He was very know.
ing in humane Learning. His Disciples were
Pirro Ligorio (who was admirable for ancient
Buildings, as for Towns, Temples, Tombs,
and Trophies, and the Situation of ancient
Edifices) Eneas Vice, Bonasone, Georgie Mar
Tuano, and others.

figned admirably well as to the practical Part,
having  particular Genius for Freezes, as we
may fee by thofe of Whice and Black, which
he has painted at Rome. He imitated the
Ancients, but his Manner was greater than
that of Tulio Romano; nevertheleis Tulie feems
to be the truer. Some admirable Groupes
are feen in his Works, and fuch as are not
elfewhere to be found. He coloured very
feldom, and made Landicapes of  reafons

of any Confideration at Venice, painted very

He was very knowing both in Archirecture
and Perspective. He was Tilian' firft Maf
er; which may eafily be obferved in the firft
Painting of that noble Disciple; in which we
may remark that Propriety of Colours which
his Master has observed.
About this Time GEoRcrowE, the Co-
Hemporary of Tirian, came to excel in Por-
traits (or Face-Painting) and alfo in great
Works. He firft began to make Choice of
glowing and agreeable Colours; the Perfec-
tion and entire Harmony of which were af-
Herwards to be found in Tirian’ Pictures. He
deffed his Figures wonderfully well: And
it may be truly faid, that but for him, Tinan
had never arrived to that Height of Perfec-
tion, which proceeded from the Rivalship
and Jealoufy of Honour betwixt thofe two.
TITlAN was one of the greateff Colouriffs
who was ever Known: He defigned with
much more Eafe and Practice than Georgions.
There are to be feen Women and Children
of his Hand, which are admirable both for
tthe Defign and Colouring; the Gufto of
them is delicate, charning and noble, with
 certain pleafing Negligence of the Head-
Dreffes, the Draperies, and Ornaments of
Hlabus, which are wholly peculiar to him.
As for the Figures of Men, he has defigned
them but moderately well. There are even
ome of his Draperies which are mean, and
havour of  little Gulto. His Painting is
Wonderfully glowing, swect and delicate.
He made Portraits, which were extremely
noble; the Atticudes of them being very
graceful, grave, diverfified, and adorned after
ta very becoming Futhin. No Man ever

are of  dry and mean Manner. He lived
ninety nine Vears. His Difciples were, Paulf
Veronese, Giacomo Tintoret, Giacomo da Pord
BaJano, and his Sons.
PAULOVERONESE was wonderfully gracef
ful in his Airs of Women, with great Varicy
of fhining Draperies, and incredible Vivaciy
and Eafe; nevertheless his Compofition in
fometimes improper, and his Defign is und
correct: But his Colouring, and whatfoered
depends on it, is to very charming in his fict
tures, that it furprizes at the firft Sight, and
makes us totally forget thofe other Qualitin
which are wanting in him.
TINTORET was the Disciple of Tiiard
great in the practical Part of Delign, by
tometimes alfo fufficiently extravagant. Hf
had an admirable Genius for Painting, if 
had had as great an Affection to his And
and as much Patience in undergoing
Difficulties of it, as he had Fire and Virf

Compofition, and his Dreffes, are for the
mol part improper; and his Outlines are
not correct : But his Colouring, and the De-
pendencies of it, like that of his Mafter, are
mot admirable.
The BASSANs had  more mean and poor
Cuto in Painting than Tinterer; and their
Deligns were alfo less correct than his. They
had indeed an excellent Gufto of Colours,
and have rouched all Kinds of Animals with
an admirable Manner; but were notoriously
imperfect in the Compofition and Defign.
CORREGGlO painted at Parma two large
Cupola' in Frefco, and Tome Altar-Pieces.
This Arufl found out certain natural and
hnaffected Graces for his Madonna’, his
Baints, and litrle Children, which were pecu-
great,
iar to him. His Manner is exceeding
Both for the Defign and for the Work, but
Withal is very uncorrect. His Pencil was
both eafy and delightful; and it is to be
Ackhnonledged, that he painted with great
Strength, great Heightening, great Sweet-
ness, and Liveliness of Colours, in which
hone furpaffed him.
He underftood how to distribute his Lights
in such  Manner, as was wholly peculiar to
himfelf; which gave  great Force and great
Roundness to his Figures. This Manner
centills in extending  large Light, and then
making it lofe itself infenfibly in the dark
Ghadowings, which he placed out of the
Maftes: And thofe give them this great
Roundness, without our being able to perceive
from whence proceeds fo much of Force, and
to vall  Plcafure to the Sight. It is proba-
Ole, that in this Part the relt of the Lombard
bibeel copied him. He had no great Choice
Of


 Judgment of
of graceful Attitudes, nor of Diftribution for
beautiful Groupes. His Defign oftentimes
appears lame, and the Pofitions are not much
observed in them : The Aspects of his Ri
gures are many Times unpleafing; but his
Manner of defigning Heads, Hands, Feet,
and other Parts, is very great, and well de¬
ferves our Imitation. In the Conduct and
Finishing of  Picture, he has done Wonders;)
for he painted with to much Union, that his 
greateft Works feemed to have been finished
in the Compats of one Day; and appear asf
if we faw them from  Locking-Glass. His
Landscape is equally beautiful with his fi
Fures.
At the fame Time with Correggio, lived and
Hourifhed PARMECLANO; who, befides hif
great Manner of well Colouring, excelledd
alfo both in Invention and Defign, with  Cet
nius fuil of Gentleness and of Spirit, having
nothing that was ungraceful in his Choiceof
Attitudes, and in the Dreffes of his Fighress
which we cannot fay of Gorreggio; there ar
Pieces of his to he feen, which are bot

much Candour, that Guide, the Scholar of
Hannibal, did afterwards imitate him with
great Succets. There are fome of his Pic-
tures to be feen, which are very beautiful,
and well underftood. He made his ordinary
Refidence at Bologna; and it was he who
put the Pencil into the Hands of Hannibal
his Coufin.
Hannibal, in  little Time, excelled his
Malter in all Parts of Painting. He imi-
tated Correggio, Titian, and Rapbael, in their
different Manners as he pleafed; excepting
only, that you fee not in his Pictures the No-
bleness, the Graces, and the Charms of Ra
sbacl; and his Outlines are nerther fo pure,
nor to elegant as his. In all other Things,
he is wonderfully accomplifhed, and of an
niverfal Genius.
AUOUSTINE, Brother to Hannibal, was
alfo  very good Painter, and an admirable
Graver. He had  natural Son, called Aw-
TONTO, who died at the Age of thirty five;
and who (according to the general Opinion)
would have furpafied his Uncle Hannibal.
for, by what he left behind him, it appears
that he was of  more lofty Genins.
Gvino chiefly imitated Indevice Carracbe,
yet retained always fomewhat of the Manner
which his Mafter, Denis Calvert the Fleming,
taught him. This Calvert lived at Bologna,
and was Competitor and Rival to Enrovico
Carrocbe. Guido made the fame Ufe of  Durer, as Virgil did of old Ennins;
borrowed what pleated him, and made it af-
tewards his own; that is, he accommo-
dated what was good in Alters to his own
Manner; which he executed with to much
Lo  Judgment of
Gracefulness and Beauty, that he alone got
more Money and more Reputation in his
Time, than his own Mafters, and all the
Scholars of the Carraches, though they were
of oreater Capacity than himfelf. His Heads
yield no manner of Precedence to thofe of
Raphael.

the firtt Form of Painters, had they travelled
into fiaty; for nothing can be laid to their
Char,, but only that they had  Gothic Guffo.
As for Holbein, he performed yet better than

were made in Lombardy, atter the Works of
Pitian, Paul Veronese, and Tinteret; whofe

 whom, and in what particular Age,
 the Art of Painting was firft invented
 in Greece, ancient Authors are not
agreed. Arifforls afcribes the Honour of it
to EUcHIR,  Kinfman of the famous Dec-
dalus, who fourithed, Anno  before the
Birth of Chrift: Theopbraffus gives it to Po-
LYCNOYUs the Athenian; Athenagoras to
SAURIAs of Samos. Some will have it be-
long to PHILOCLEs the Egyptian; and others
T CLEANTHEs of Corintb. But, howfoever
the Learned may differ in their Opinions
touching the Inventer they are all unani-
mous in this, that its firft Appearance among
the Greeks, was in no better  Drefs, than
what ferved juft to reprefent the bare Sba-
dow of  Man, or any other Body; which was
done merely by circumscribing the Figure they
had  Mind to express, whatever it was, with
 single Line only. And this fimple Manner
of Drawing was by them very properly called
Sciagraphia; and by the Latines afterwards,
Pittura Linearis.
The

The firff Step made towards the Advance
ment of Painting, was by Anvices the Co
rintbian, and TELEPHANES of Sicgon, of
CRATo of the fame City. Thefe began to
add other Lines (by way of Shaderwing) to
their Figures; which gave them an Appear-
ance of Roundness, and much greater Strengib.
This Manner was called Graphice. But the
Advantages it brought to its Inventers were
to inconfiderable, that they Kill found it
neceffary to write under every individual
Piece, the Name of whatever it was defigned
to reprefent, left otherwife the Spectators
should never be able of themfelves to make
the Difcovery.
The next Improvement was by Cizo-
PHANTUs of Corrnrb, who firtt attempted to
fill up his Ourhines. But as he did it with
one single Colour, laid on every where alike,
his Pieces, and thofe of HYCIEMON, Di
NiAs, and CHARMAs, his Followers, from
thence got the Name of Monocbromata, Viz.
Pictures of one Colonr.
EUMARUs the Hibenian began to paint
Men and Women in  Manner different
from each other, and ventured to imitate all
Sorts of Objects; but was far excelled by
his Disciple,
CIMON the Giconcan, who found out the
Art of Painting brfforically, defigned his Fi-
gures in Variety of Poftures, diffinguished the
feveral Parts of the Body by their Joints; and
was the firft, in whofe Pieces there was any
Notice taken of the Foids of Draperies.

in what Century the Mafters above-men-

of the Foundation of Rome, Anno  ante

and dillingurthed from each other in that
Piece.

fiter Clympins was by the Ancients etteemed
one of the feven Wonders of the World; as
his Minerva, in the Citadel of Arbens, made
of ivory and Gsold, was (by way of Emi-
Nence) called the beautiful Form. He was
very intimate with Prrictes, the Arbenian Ge-
heral; and to much envied upon that Ac-

Works, that his Encimmes could never be at

brought the Bass Relievo to Ferfection, is
commended for divers admirable Pieces of
Work; but chiefly for being the Auther of
that moft accomplifhed Niedel, called the

moll eminent Artits then in being, as well
Painters as Sculptors, was handed down to
Potterity, for the Standard or infiltiole Rul

PROTOGENES of Caunus,  City of Caria,
subject to the Rbodians, was by the Ancients
efteemed one of the four beit Painters inf
Greece; but lived miferably poor, and venf
little regarded in his own Country, till Apelled
having made him  Vifit, to bring him into
Reputation, bought up feveral of his Pidures
at greater Rates than he alked for them; and
pretending that he defigned to fell them again
for his own Work, the Rbodians were glad id
redeem them upon any Terms. Whole Diff
ciple he was, is not certainly known; but if
is generally affirmed, that he spent the greatef
Part of his Life in painting Ships and Seat
Pieces only : Vet applying himfelf at latt  Subjects, he became an Arriff to well
accompliffied, that Apelles confeffed he uas
in all Respects (at lead) equal to himfelf
excepting only that never knowing when it
leave off, by overmuch Diligence, and   Correctness, he often dispirited, and
deadened the Lifs. Hle was famous allo fof

attained  perfect Knowledge of expreffing
the Paffions and Affections of the Mind. And
though his Colouring was fomewhat hard,
and not fo very beautiful as could be withed,
jet notwithflanding to much were his Pieces
admired, that after his Deceafe, Artalus King
of Persamus gave an hundred Talents ( for one of them.
His Cotemporary was AscLEPIODORUS

poor ordinary Painters, fent for by the Go-

foon furpaffed, both in Drawing and Co-
louring, and gave fomething of Strength
and Freedom to his Works; to which they
could never arrive. And though he wanted
the Art of mannaging his Lights and Sha-
dows, was but litile acquainted with the
Rules of Perspective, and in divers other
Particulars but indifferently accomplifhed;
yet the Foundtion which he laid for fu-
ture improvement, entitled him to the Name
of the Fmber of the firft Age, or Infancy of
Modern Painting. Some of his Works are

draw after the Lye, and to express the dif

come up to the Liveliness of the Eyes, the
Tenderness of the Flefh, or the Strength

admired for his Warks, but principally for
his Ship, of Mefaic Work, over the Gates
of the Pertice, in the Entrance of St. Pater'

such extraordinary Proofs of his Attachment

Flemisss Tafle never engaged him; but his

small Figures, are very correct and well

vice, honoured him with feveral obliging
Testimonies of his Elleem, and withal gave
this Character of his Works, that he painted
both Inside and Ourfide. Upon the ccettion
of King William and Queen Mary to the
Crown, he was fworn their Majefties prin¬
cipal Painter; which Place he had not en-
joyed in the preceding Reign, though King
James and his Queen were both pleafed to
be drawn by his Hand. He was very dili-
gent in the Imitation of Nature; and, by
Rudying the Life, rather than following any
particular Manner, arrived to  pleafant and
moft agreeable Stile of Painting. But that
which eminently diffinguithed him from all
his Cotemporaries, was his peculiar Excel
lence in  Head, and especially in the colour-
ing Part; wherein some of his Pieces were

felf was the only Perfon who was not charf:-

Every Subject of Hiffory that rofe in his Ima-

per, and often coloured his Designs while he
was at the fcademy; but after some Time
he very confiderably improved himself, and
was much admired for his great Tafte in
painting his Glouds, Sty, Ground and Trees:
for the admirable Freshness of his Tints, the
Hermony of the whole, and the tender
Union, and great Force of his Colouring:
Thefe Excellencies gained him very con-
fiderable Reputation, which was now raifed
to  great Height. The mott eminent Men
in Irab, and feveral crowned Heads, ho-
houred him with their Protection, and even
Friendship; nor was he unworthy of it, for
it is affenithing how Solimens fucceeded in
every Undertaking; his Pictures have equal
Merit, both great and small, in Orl and
Frisce, in Hiffory, Portrait, Landscape, Ani-
mals, Flowers, Fruit, Perspective and Archi-
seclure. His extenfive Talents prevented
his ever being under  Neceffity of calling
in the Affittance of another Hand to his

niufes that furmounted the common Courfe

flectrons on what he obferved, which turned

But this Manner difgufting him, he en-
tirely attached himself to the painting of

nithed to  furprizing Height; his Pencil
is tender; his Figures have an admirable
Roundness and Relief; his Defign  fuf-
ficiently correct; but the Carnations of his
Figures are not lively; they refemble Ivory,

Landicape, and fometimes Flowers; but his
Experience teaching him, that to work in
every Branch was to excel in none, he con-
fined himfelf to Flowers, Fruit and Land-

made fome Progrefs in the Art during his
Apprenticeship, he profecuted it with inde-
fatigable Diligence, till at length he ac-
quired  complete Miaftership therein, and
that without any foreign Affiftance. His
uncommon Tafents brought him into the
Notice of Sir James Tbornbill, whofe Daugh-
ter he married  litile before her Father'
Death. In the mean Time, not content
with mere Drawing, he proceeded to finifh
his Defigns with Colouring, in which he like-
wife fucceeded to Admiration. He had oc-
cafionally been  Benefactor to his Parish,
and prefented that Hospital with  capital
Piece, the Pool of Bethefda, in  when
he was chofen  Governor of it. The De-
pon of this Piece furnifhed him with an Op-
portunity of difplaying his particular Ta-
lent in Expresion. The Difeafes of the Af-
flicted attending that Pool, are marked in
the Rronged Manner; nor is the Figure of
Chrill less dillinguished by the Son of Man.
When the Foundling-Hespital was finithed,
our Painter enriched it with another Piece,

to Pharacb’ Daughter. Hitherto he was feen
in grave Hiffory-paintings,  Walk in which
he had many Competitors; but in the mean
Time he launched out into an unbeaten
Track, in which he became inimitable. It
is faid, that the firff Inlet to his Excellence
in Burlesque, was the being employed to
draw Defigns for  new Edition of Huditras:
However that be, it, is certain, that in co-
mic Life-painting, he exceeded all that went
before him ; though it is unjuft to give his
Life-pictures of this Kind the Character of

bot dn Bes has often complained, that no
Hiffory-painter of his Time went through
the Series of Actions and Misfortunes of an
Hero, from his Cradle to his Grave: What
du Bos withed to fee done, Hogarth per-
formed. That Work in this Tafle which
firff appeared, was his Harlor’ Progress;
where he launches out his young Adven-
turer,  fimple Girl, upon the Town; and
conducts her through all the Viciffitudes of
Wretchedness, to  premature Death. This
was painting to the Reafon and to the Heart;
none had ever before made the frr fubler-
vient to the Purpofes of Morality and Inffruc
sion.  Book like this is fitted to every Soil
and every Obferver, and be that runs may
read. The Rake' Progress fucceeded the for-
mer; which, though not equal to it, yet
came thort only of that fingl. Excellence, no
other could come near him in that Way.
His great Excellence confifted in, what we
may term, the Furnisure of his Pieces: For,
 Masters.
in Subjects and Hiffory Pieces, the fewer little
Circumftances there are to divide the Spec-
tator’ ttention from the principal Figures,
is reckoned  Merit; to in Life-painting, the
greater Variety there is of thofe little do-
meftic lmages, it gives the whole  greater
Degree of Force and Refemblance. Thus,
in the Harlor’ Progress, we are not difpleated
with James Dalson'’ Wig-bex on the Bed-teafter
in her Lodgings in Drury-Lane; particularly
too, if it be remembered, that this James
Dakon was anoted Highwayman of that Time.

Soon after the Peace of Hix-la-Chapelle, he
went to Paris; the Confequence of which

Friar While our Painter was sketching,
for this Purpofe, one of the Gates of the
Town here introduced, he had like to have
been taken into Cuffody as  Spy; in Re-
membrance of which he has inferted his own
Face in  Corner of the Print, with  Serjeant
clapping him on the Shoulder. About the
Veari he publifhed his Analysis of Beauty,
in Gyarre; which, though rongly attacked
in Regard to fome of his Notions, yet is re-

not without vifiting occafionally his Houfe
in Leiceffer-Fields. About the Year  he
complained of an inward Pain in some of his
Vitals; which continuing, brought on  ge-
neral Decay, that proved incurable. On
October   he was brought from Chij-
wick to Leiceffer-Fields, in  very weak Con-
dition, yet was remarkably chearful; and,
receiving an agreeable Letter from  Friend
in Pensylvania, he drew up the rough
Draught of an Answer to it; but going to
Eed, he was feized with  Vomiting, upon
which he rung his Bell, and was found in
fuch  Condition, that he expired two Hours
after, in the  Vear of his Age; his
Corple was afterwards conveyed to Chifwick,
and interred there. He left  very confider-
able Fortune behind him, which is come
into the Poffeffion of his truly mournfal Wi-
dow; who had, during their Marriage, lived
with him in the utmoft Harmony and Hap-

his Friends and Acquaintance. The follow-
