\f0\fs24 \cf0 ceive theirlight; as the middle piece  has it fronting. Over the summer-house\
and wall appear the tops of the hind-buildings . Now the question is, What\
subject is proper for ,  visto or  bass relief;  green prospect, such as \
woody country, or slower-garden, would have no good effect in this green sum-\
mer-house, when seen from without, where it ought to be viewed ; because \
mixture of green with green affords neither variety nor delight.  sea haven, or\
 court, adorned with statues, fountains, cascades, and such like elegancies,\
would appear exceedingly fine, viewed from within (for those colours look well\
among the green), but seen at its proper distance without, they will be found to\
be false and contrary to nature, by reason of the tops of the houses , which,\
being behind, and rising above them, discover  general stoppage : whence it\
follows, that nothing is more proper for the middle piece than  bass-relief.\
Let us now consider what is best for the two side-pieces seen from within; the\
one, as said, receiving its light from the left, and the other from the right. \
bass-relief cannot, in my opmnion, be decorous there, because the eye must not\
be so closely confined. They ought to be vistos, as not having the inconvenience\
which attends the middle piece to hinder their naturalness: the summer-house\
heing roofed in, the light therefore falls more advantageous on these two places than\
the middle one, as being without the glare of it : wherefore vistos must be best\
there; and even the fainter and bluer, the better, as before intimated. An haven\
with shipping,  court with fountains, islands with hills,  street-view of fine\
buildings, temples and galleries, together with  blue off-scape, &. These are\
very delightful objects, and produce, -between the greens,  variety and deco-\
rum : now, we ought to observe that the two pieces  and , though they re-\
ceive their light from the place, yet, if we please, may be lighted otherwise ;\
because they are without-door prospects, having no communication with this\
within-door place, as th\'e9 bass-relief has, which is confined to it. Thus much as\
that to side; the same observations are proper for the sides  and .\
The second exampl\'e9, in plate LIl. aforesaid, exhibits  garden with parterres,\
also walled in. In the middie is  gate of letticed work; and, on each side, \
shallow letticed seat covered. over with greens, noted  and . In the back of\
each seat is  circular representation; and over them appear the tops of trees,\
as of  large orchard, marked . Now let us consider what subjects will be most\
proper for the seat  and . First the observe the distance whence the work is\
to be seen, which is from without, on the near-side of the parterres. Here, af\
in the preceding example, vistos are not proper; and, because the place is so\
full of green, more green would not look well : wherefore, half raised bas-re-\
liefs would be best. As for the colour, we have before prescribed it. The sides\
may also be adorned as before in the last example, observing what objects rise be-\
hind and above them. Here, on one side, are houses, and on the other  green\
wall.\
Behold now  third sketch in plate LIII. discovering  walk with trees ; at the\
end of which stands the painted object . Her\'e9in you have great liberty, and\
may use your pleafure ; since the design stands free from any obstruction. This\
only is to, be noted in it, that, because it is  long walk, and, in nature\
itself\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
itself we are oftentimes tired with travelling such an one, we have no occasion to\
make it longer by perspective and other views, but rather stop the walker by\
 sine prospect, and invite him to  little contemplation and reft, that he may\
afterwards the better go forward : wher\'e9fore, we here suppose,  beautiful\
imagery, fountain-like, of white marble, placed in  grotto or niche arched\
with green, and therein painted, in full proportion, and with all strength,\
Cephalus and Aurora, Zephyrus and Flora, or Venus and Adonis, and such like : or,\
you may represent there, in  rock, having several holes discovering the sky,\
(udmus killing the dragon; or,  Diana with her nymphs; or  term or faunus,\
accompanied by bacchanals or satyrs, with their instruments, some of which\
spout water; or else you may exhibit  sleeping Silenus, with the nymph Egle,\
squeczing mulberries on his face. All these are proper subjects for the place,\
and suitable to the occasion.\
You may also paint some terms on boards cut away, and place them against .\
green wall on both fides of the niches, windows,\
or circular hollows; wherein\
may be set busts or casts, as you see in the second\
example; of fuch colours as\
before mentioned, and which appear lovely among the green : thefe terms may\
represent bacchanals, satyrs, gods and goddesses, some naked and-others dressed,\
according to the season and place.\
CH AP. XII. Tables or Ordonnances of Venus and Adonis, for the\
Embellishment of Landscapes.\
HAT  may conceal nothing from. the artists, but as much as possible\
rouze and enrich their genius,  have pitched on this subject far the or-\
nament of landscapes : and, though it be common, yet  question whether it\
was ever handled in such  manner.   divide it into three ordonnances.\
The firft is, Venus\'92 making love to him.\
The second, his taking leave of hee, to go  liunting, or rather to be killed.\
And,\
The third, her finding him dead.\
The fable is this. Venus was, according to the Poets, very much enamoured\
with the youth Adonis, notwithstanding his coldness and insensibility : and yet he\
refrained not from kissing and caressing her for  season ; which much incensed\
Aiars, and raised his jealousy and rages as often as he saw the youth in her lap-\
The first Ordonnanse.\
The place opens,  pleafant and agreeable country, stored with every thing\
that can delight the eye, woods, hills, valleys; rivers, and stone-work, except\
houses\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
houses and temples. Iset th\'e9 point of sight in the middle of the piece.\
Be-\
tween it and the left side, on an hillock,  place the goddess and her spark, at-\
tended by the three Graces, who are to adorn her ; one of these is twisting  wreath\
of flowers, another is crowning her with  chaplet of them, and the third is\
bringing  basket of fruit. Some Cupids are toying about her; one especially is\
fitting at her feet, blowing Adonis\'92 horn: at whom he smiles; when Venus, with\
her arm about his neck; with her hand presses his against her breast, or kisses it.\
Behind the aforesaid hillock, against the off-scape,  place some thick-leaved\
trees; the highest in the middle of the piece, and those to the left somewhat\
lower and thinner. Behind them we discover the remains of  colonade, rising\
and appearing:half behind the hillock, and running towards the point of sight.\
On the same side forwards,  set  crofs low wall, which the hillock stems.\
Against this wall, which is but three or three feet and an half in rise,  place \'e0\
water-god fitting asleep by his vase, and encompassed with greens : and in the\
corner, against the frame of the piece,  place  large willow tree, or-one and an\
half. And thus half the piece is filled. On the right side forwards,  plant \
knobby mossy body of  tree, about six or seven feet high; and close behind it,\
 large and beautiful one fully leayed. Somewhat bevond appears an high square\
spedestal, whereon stands  large and elegant vase. These objects are in  line\
running towards the point of sight, making  way between it and the hillock,\
which is wide forwards, and diminishing at 'the end of the fore-ground; where the\
second begins, and runs out into an open field ; whence to the horizon are seen\
some faint hills.\
Let us now come-forward again. In the right side corner, Envy kindles the\
fire of war ;\'92sh\'e9 is flying with  broken stinking pitch-torch in her hand, and her\
head beset with twining serpenits, secretly fhewiing Mars the: two lovers. And\
now we see the devouring god of war an his bellys with-ione-leg over  stone,\
lurking behind the pedestal, and staring eamnestly, between it and ithe green of\
the trees, at the cause of his jealousy; nis spear and fhield lie at his feet.\
 once saw  print of Julio Romano, wherein he-has placed Mars in the off-\
scape, purfuing Adonis sword in hand ; which  think too obscure and far-fetchect.\
The sense may be tolerabl\'e9; yet it is against the fable; for Ovid dues not men-\
tion that Adonis was killed. by. Mars wath.  sword, but by . wild boar, through\
his instigation.\
In the mean time,  doubt not but this my fketch and disposition will seem\
strange : nevertheless, if well executed, it will certainly appear sine with the pe-\
destal, low wall, and- colonade ; since such things create great decorum and variety\
in  landscape.\
The light;  assign, is bright sun-shine-\
My intention her\'e9 is, to represent the month of May, or the Spring, when every\
thing is coming forth and blossoming; though  am very sensible that the green\
of the trees, by the diversity of colour, is, in the summer, more painter-like ;\
however this must not be like  summer; besides, the island of Cyprus is not like\
Holland, or other cold countries, where the greens come up late; for, otherwise,\
 should not introduce \'e0 basket of fruit.\
NOW,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Now, if it be asked because  still set on the large pedestal  vase, and that\
directly against the hillock, where Venus and Adanis are with the Graces, whether\
this would not throw  very large ground-shade over those figures ;  say it would\
not ; because  assign the sun  meridian altitude. Moreover,  do not set the\
pedestal so near the hillock as to be any obstacle to. the sigures. The foremost\
tree, because it rises so high, can also as little prejudice them, its ground-shade\
passing by them, over the willow in the corner, or at least  part of it; which\
makes the colonade, against which it spreads, fall back, though the trees behind\
the hillock can sufficiently effect the same; since  make them either dark green,\
or else in shade, and the little leafing hanging over the lovers, in the light; in\
order thus to have below some darkness for setting off the lovers: my intention\
being to place that group directly in the sun, in onder to have there the principal\
light.\
But here  may be reproved on  supposition that  act counter to my own po-\
sition; namely, that in sun-shine people do not stand talking without shading\
their eyes : which  do not deny ; but let it be considered, that the gods are not\
subject to human frailti\'e9s, and therefore they can look against the sun : and to\
solve the difficulty with respect to Adonis, who is not  god,  make his upper\
parts in shade, receiving agreeable and strong reflexions from Venas and the\
Graces.\
From whence arises another difficulty; namely, by what means this ground-\
shade can fall on him only, fince they are sitting so close together, that Venus\'92 arm\
is about his neck, and one of his hands presses her breast; and therefore she must\
needs take part of the same shad\'e9; To which,  answer, that there are means\
enough, by one thing or other, to find that shade. And as for Venus, she may be\
so disposed, either  little backward or forward, as. to receive light enough.\
Now, that Mars and Enzy, at the stone, may not draw the eye too much from\
the principals, by making them in the light,  bring not much sun into that\
quarter;  mean that  set the foremost whole stem of the tree, and  great part\
of the hindmost, with part of Mars, in  ground-shade, occasioned by something\
without the piece; and to let that shade run, on the fore-ground, just to the\
low wall ; breaking the residue here and there somewhat with bushes and shrubs :\
 might also place there  priapus-term, or other object, in order  little to fill that\
corner.\
We have before said, that neither houses nor temples must enter the compofi-\
tion. Why not they, say some, as well as the terme To which  answer, that the\
fable makes no mention of any such objects : and let me afk, who should live in\
the houses ) It is not said, that Adonis, though  man, had any houshiold, or that\
he worshipped in  temple.\
This piece may be richly embellished with ten or twelve figures, though. Mars\
and Envy are but partly figures. Some landscape-painters may possibly object\
against so great  number, for that those, well executed, would better become\
an history than  landscape: but the answer is easy; the figures are small, and\
the landscape large.\
We shall now proceed to the colours and actions of- the figures.\
We\
\
\
\
\
\
\
We represent Venus in her linen, yet with her upper parts and legs almost\
bare, under her, on the grafs, appears part of  light red garment.\
Adonis\'92 garment is greenish blue, or dark violet.\
The two Graces, standing next to Venus, are drest in light-coloured garments of\
changeable stuff and broken colours, preserving, about that group,  great mafs\
of light : for which reason,  chuse such colours as do not cause any unseemly\
reflexions in the carnation of Venus or Adonis. Her garment, who is crowning\
Venus with  chaplet, is rose-colour ;  fecond, more forward, and with one knee\
bent, is in white, and has  flower in her hand; and the third having the fruits,\
and standing on the left side, and somewhat higher on the hillock, has an aurora\
or straw-coloured garment. We need not say much about Mars and Enzy ; since\
Caesar Ripa relates enough touching them. Nothing is more proper for Mars,\
than  rusty fillemot or blood-coloured coat;, and for Envy, than  black one-\
As for the motions of Venus and Adonis, they are fronting in both; but their\
feet more or less turned to the light.\
Adonis, on the right side, inclines his upper parts towards Venus, with his right\
hand on her breast, and his right shoulder coming forwards ; his under parts are\
fronting, and his leg extended, and his right drawn in, as if he were about to\
rise; his face fronting inclines  little over his shoulder to the child who blows\
the horn. Contrarily, Venus, resting on her right thigh, applies, in some mea-\
sure, both her knees to his extended leg ; her face, in profile, turning towards\
him, fronts the sun; her breast is also seen fronting ; she draws back her left el-\
bow, in order to press his hand to her breast.\
On due consideration, these two figures will be found to have  natural and easy\
contrast or opposition, in motion; since  have endeavoured to give myself fuil\
satisfaction touching all the actions exhibited, before  set the layman.\
But  must return again to the ordonnance.  forgot to place two children be-\
hind the foremost low wall;- of whom; the one is leaning over it, and, with\
 finger on his mouth, and head sunk, is shewing the other the steeping river-\
god.  place them there, first, for decorum\'92 sake ; and, secondly, in order to\
break, in some measure, that long and stiff piece of stone-work. The water-god\
is of  brownisn yellow hue, almost as dark as the said stone-work; and for two\
reasons ; first, for the sake of repose; and, secondly, to prevent  mafs of light\
there with the children,, to the detriment of the principal : besides  further pur-\
pose ; to adorn the pedestal of the vase with  bass-relief, representing  bacchanal\
or dancing nymphs; and though it come in shade, yet  assign it strong re-\
flexions. There ought also to be added, one or two dogs afleep; of which,\
the one awaking, stares back with prick' up ears, at the sound of the horn.\
 have before said, that one of the Graces should be dressed in white; but noW,\
 cast  beautiful blue veil over it, as proper to break the strength of the white-\
 piece, thus executed, is sufficient for the production of many others ; espe-\
cially if we duly consider how many things are observed in it, which by few is\
taken notice of viz. the quality of each figure, its origin or emblematic signifi-\
cation, &. Many fictions are painted from the Poet\'92 description, but few\
people weigh the writer\'92 meaning, though attended with an cxplanation; which\
however,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
however is only general, without the addition of the circumstances, though well\
known to the writer; as the shapes, dresses, colours, paffions, and other remark-\
ables : whence we may conclude what must be the case of those men who do not\
make themselves masters of all these things; and how easily they may mistake, even\
pervert the sense of the writer or Poet. If the fact lay in the spring, they re-\
present it in summer; if in  winter morning, theys exhibit an autumn evening :\
ought the opening to be  solitary place, or wilderness, they will introduce diver-\
sions : should any person have  red drapery, as proper to him, it is made blue,\
yellow, &. We grant that the fable may be fepresented plain enough;\
and who the characters are, and what they are doing, presently conceived; but\
the drift of it is wanting.\
It is unnecessary to enlarge on this table or ordonnance further than to observe,\
that Mars here signifies vengeance ;, Adonis, the cvinter; and Venus, the spring;\
which is the reason why these two last cannot agree.\
The Poets write, that there were four who went under the name of Venus. The\
first was the daughter of Calum and the Day. The second was brought forth of\
the froth of the sea, being conceived in  mother of pearl, and conducted to Cyprus\
by the airy zephyrs : it was she who bore Cupid to Mercury. The third was the\
daughter of Japiter and Dione, who was wedded to Vulcan, chief of the cuckolds;\
and the fourth was the Syrian, called Astarte, who courted the love of Adonis, and\
to whom Solomon erected altars to pleasure his concubines. Whence we may\
judge what great disparity there is between these Venuses.\
As for the wild boar, it implies the night, ignorance, impiety, filthiness,\
lewdness, &.\
The second Ordonnance, or Sequel of the foregoing Story.\
When Adonis was now tired with kissing and flattery, or, to say better, when his\
forrowful f\'e2te drew near, and the dogs, scenting the boar, set up  cry, he, deaf\
to Venus\'92 intreaties, wrested from her embraces, and jumped up eager for sport.\
We must previously understand, that we are obliged to confine ourselves to two\
principal points; namely, the general disposition, and the light: and though,\
on  due consideration, it may possibly seem to be chosen less advantageous than\
if it were  single piece (which  willingly allow), yet, as it now serves to match\
another, it therefore requires the same light, though  reversed one might bet-\
ter become it; because then  should be at greater liberty : but even then, the\
dispofition would not be different enough from the former.\
We have, in the book or ordonnance, shewed, that when two pieces hang to-\
gether, they ought to have  certain conformity ; especially landscapes with small\
figures: as if, for instance, the heavist work be in the one on the right side, and the\
visto on the left, in the other or matching-piece it must be contrary; and yet, not-\
withstandingthat necessity or rule, which however subsists, Ifind something which gives\
me greater satisfaction, and better expresses the sense, as may appear in the sequel.\
place as in the preceding ordonnance, the point of sight in the middle of the\
.\
piece, and on the right side an eminence, ascended by three or four steps, fronting\
\
\
\
\
\
\
or parallel with the horizon. upon it, at the end against the off-scape,  represent\
an open niche, almost square and compass-headed, adornedronboth sides, with pilas-\
ters, supporting  small but elegant cornice, here and there somewhat broken. About\
the niche, hang festoons of poppies, which are fastened to the crown of the niche,\
and being buttoned up on each side, their ends intwined hang down together.\
Thro\'92 this niche, having  seat before it, we discover an agreeable view of woods,\
lawns, rivers, roads, &. This eminence takes up  third part of the piece,\
running off steep on the inner side. Forwards, against the steps, which are mostly\
in shade by trees without the piece, to the corner whereof stands the goddess, we\
place her gilt chariot drawn by two pidgeons.\
On the left side, betwen the point of sight and the frame of the piece, stand\
three or four great and beautiful trees, in  row, runing from the fore-part of the\
piece, and by the hillock towards the point of sight. In the corner, behind the emi-\
nence, rises an high and rough rock, also running towards the same point, making\
between both  narrow passage, which forwards is over-run with bushes and grass;\
and behind is bare, so as to discover, through it, the off-scape and end of the rock.\
Forwards in the rock,  make  large craggy hollow, into which the water falls\
with impetuosity. Thus much mostly as to the fore-ground: at the end of it\
runs  narrow crossing river, from the eminence to the back part of the rock ;\
along the side whereof, Ishew  plantation of high trees, in order to make the\
off-scapes, which is seen through them, apear as in  valley. On the level whereon\
stands Adonis ;  set, between two trees,  white marble basis, with  broken term,\
and its trunk lying near it.\
Thus  have shewed the general defign ; which  quistion not, will appear more\
uncommon and wood-like than the other. The third  hope to make still more\
wild than this, because the subject requires it. Some may possible think it is to\
be an agreeable and delightful ordonnance ; but the sequel will shewit to be other-\
wise; for in this,  represent the month of August, and the sun somewhat darkened\
and fiery, instead of shining brightly, the air gloomy and cloudy, as if it were go-\
ing to thunder; the wind also bloes, and every thing is shaking and in motion,\
not one way, but as in  whirl-wind, the dust, like  vapour, rising from the ground\
in some places.\
Perhaps you did not expect this fort of management, but on due consideration\
of the case, it will be found both natural and artful.\
We now proceed to dispose the characters.\
The Goddess, seeing the evening approach, doubled her courtship. The cold\
Adonis contrarily, eager for sport, hearing the noise of the dogs, hastily arises from\
the eminence. Now, all things are in an hurry, Venus follows him with intrea-\
ties ; but in vain ; Fate seizes and pulls him along with her. The Graces are in con-\
fufion ; one runs after him; another, fearful of the goddess\'92 swooning, and tum-\
bling down the steps, supports her; the third, sadly shrieking and crying, lifts\
up her open hands on high. The boys are in contention; one is hawling Adonis\
away, and the other stopping him : Cupid lies thrown on the ground : others run\
with the dogs before. Tke wild boar appears in the before-menfioned narrow pas-\
sage, between the eminence and the river; set on by Gruel Rage with  pitch-torch\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Now this ordonnance seems to have much more work than\'92the preceding; and\
yet, if considcred, it will be found\'92otherwise; and that in the former, the figtres\
are only more scattiered : besides, in hearing things related, they always seem mors\
to us, than in the picture itself.\
Venus,  exhibit as coming down the steps, as also one of ghe Graces, whe rune\
after Adonis, isince he is slipt out of the goddess\'92 hands. The youth,  represent\
running juft in the middle of the piece, between the eninenee of the trees,three\
or four paces beyond the steps, whereon the goddefs stands beseeching him in\
tears. He is almost half in the ground-shade of the eminence; for  have said,\
that the sun is setting. The children who attend the dogs, are entirely shaded by\
the stone-work on the eminence, which is so high and large, that the bodies of\
the last trees do not escape it. Venus stands with her right foot on the lowermost\
step, and with the left on th\'e9 middlemost on the inner corner, stooping ; her un-\
der parts almost fronting, and her upper parts turned siedways towards him ; pres-\
fing her folded hands, with \'92the elbows forwards against her body, and sinking\
her head, looks from him towards heaven.  place one of the Graces by her side\
as coming down, embracing the goddess about the waift with fear and concerns\
and, with amazement, looking to the left after Adonis. The other virgin, who\
runs after him, is now with one knee on the ground, with-her left hand shewing\
him the goddess, and with her right hand holding  skift ofhis coat; so that she\
is most seen from behind. The third has, as is said, her hands stretched on high,\
and her face is swelled by the violence of her outeries. Adonis, as in great haste,\
advances his right leg, turning his breast to the right to-the light; he holds  spear\
in his right hand, high close to his side, which  boy is withholding with all his\
strength; for which, another angrily strikes him with his bow. Adonis-looks downr\
wards, with his face fronting, at the virgin who is at his feet;, pointing, with\
his left hand, which is fore-shortened, at the wood; by which anm Fate is pulling\
him thither; she is flying, and has  rudder of  fhip on her shoulder; hertright\
shoulder and right breast come forward, her other parts beifg fore-shortened, and\
her face turned backwards. Before him,  represent  Cupid also flying, and pul-\
ling him towards the wood by the string of the horn which swings by. his side.\
This boy is seen quite from behind, with his feet flung out, and holding his bow\
in his right hand, with which he is threatening another, who is tumbled down, and\
lyes also fore-shortened, with his head forwards, and\'92feet towards Adonis;. he is all\
in shade, except his head, and the hand with which he scratches it;-his torch lies.\
near him extinguished.\
\
 slappet of Venus\'92 red garment comes about her right arm, and swings behiad\
over her left leg. The chaplet of iflowers falls from; her head :down, her- back-\
Fate is dressed in black, with \'e0. small\'92slying veil over-it. .\
\
 .\
Behind the broken term are iseen the arms of Mars, viz. his armour helmet,\
shield, sword and spear, lying oa the ground in shade. Now, although Mars does\
not appear in his own shape, but in that tof the boar in which he was metamor-\
phased, yet we need not wonder at it, bedause, we must not suppose, that as he was\
 god, he entered into it stoekined and fhoed. Some may possibly afk, Whether\
he could not do it in his full habbliments; and  say, he might; but then  must\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
ask again, How we should know it? The dresses of gods and men have no sen-\
sation, either-good or bad; they are even of no ocher signification than to\
make the person known; for, were they subject to the paffions arifing from heat\
or cold, thoy would also share the punishments of the body, as the head, hands,\
&. do.\
Yet it may be very reasonably afked here, in case we were to represent tho\
canicrous Aglaura, metamorphased by Mercury into  touch-stone, whether her gar\
ments should not be quite black \'e0 and  answer, that nothing but her bodv\
should be so ; for otherwise my affertions fall to the ground, though  have said,\
that the dress makes the person known : nevertheless  shall in this point fur-\
ther explain myself.\
 king Lyncus approaches the bed of his sleeping guest Triptolemus with inten-\
tion to slay him. Ceres appeared at the very instant, and took the weapon from\
the king; at the same time transforming him into  lynx,  beast like  tyger;\
for violating the laws of hospitality. This story  would represent thus. Tho\
king is. not there ; the beast  make taking to flight, shaking from himi, aboug\
the floor, the purple garment and crown. This  think most agreeable to nature\
and probability. Add to this another instance.\
Juno, says the Poet; in wrathful jealousy, beat the poor Calisto so much, that\
she was metam\'f4rphased into  fhebear. Now, How is this to be represented,\
in order to know what she was, man or woman;  would represent the frighted\
bear as taking to flight, not cloathed, but dragging her garment behind her\
along the ground. Here the bow, there the quiver of arrows, strap, and other\
ornaments-\
Yet in what  mean manner have  seen the king Lyncus represented by Testo.\
He stands with the dagger in his hand, cloathed and crowned, having for legs\
the frightful paws of  bear.\
Thus Ihave affirmed, that cloaths serve gods and men only for distinction :\
which brings to my remembrance,  print of Poussin, confirming what  have said.\
It exhibits the Elysian fields, with the happy souls at rest, and Youth, or eternal\
Spring, dancing and strewing flowers. Here we see Hyacinthus, Narcissus, Crocus,\
Adonis, Ajax, and many others, in sitting postures, as when living: whence we\
may easily perceive, how difficult it would be to know them without their partir\
cular badges: of distinction, as the spear, horn, fountain, helmet, chaplet of\
roses, &. and how impossible it was Poussin, so excellent and learned  man, to\
make sja\'e6 known; seeing he there represents him in the same rage or despair, to\
to wit, stabbing himself, as when he was before Troy.  great mistake, in my\
opinion, with respect to probability.  should rather have left it out; as also the\
chamber-pot or cistern wherein Nartissus is viewing Himself.\
 can hardly believe so strange  design to be of Poussin himself; since Ajax is\
plaged in so cruel  posture among the happy souls;  man who, being  felo de se,\
rather deserved hell. Why may not Sispphus, Ixion, Prometheus, or Tautalus, whp\
are doomed tohellish\'92punishments, be of their company ; lt is true, that Ajax\
acted only against himself, on account of the arms of Achilles, to which he had \
.\

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
claim, and the others offended the gods ; one stole the fire froin heaven, anothen\
had the impudence to trepan the goddess Juno to his lust by an ambush, &.\
Testa has, in my opinion, in many particulars, exhibited the same representa-\
tion, better and more intelligible than Poussin, as being much larger, and more\
pleasant and painter-like : but yet he runs counter to the probability of that place\
of rest; as we may perceive in the two figures of  boy and girl, where he is\
taking some flowers out of her lap, and she, in return, is ready to scratch out his.\
eyes ; being an old quarrel revived. Now, in fact, neither hatred, quarrel or\
jealousy, nothing but repose and peace should appear there.\
But methinks  hear some say, that  derogate from the worth of those two- great\
men, by thus exposing their mistakes, and that it is easier to find faults than to\
make  thorough composition; which  perfectly own: nevertheless my intention\
is not in anywise to build  reputation on their errors ; since it will appear,\
throughout this work, that  am no kinder to my own mistakes than to those of\
others; and this with  view of shewing artists  way for avoiding such common\
defects, and of making them more careful to mind probability in all parts.\
Here let us make  comparison between an architect and  painter.  good\
architect ought first exactly to know what ground is most proper for his pur-\
pose, in building  temple, palace, &. as, whether it be firm-or marshy, and\
to which quarter he must order his front; and then to proceed to- work. If \
painter intend to represent  courtship or  military exercise, offering, or any\
thing else, he will also look for  proper place whereim to lay the subject. The\
architect makes  plan of his court with all its appertunances; of  temple,\
with the choir, altar, and other particulars, &. of  fortification, with its bas-\
tions, ravelines, rendezvous, &.  painter likewise exhibits the Elysian fields,\
or the garden of Flora for canesses;  temple, for divine service ;  court, with\
the king and his retinue; or  forest for hunting. Now, if  person enter tho\
temple, during divine service, with- sword in his hand, or be stabbing himself\
in the Elysian helds, among the happy souls, in order to give his soul  second\
reniove ; Would you not conclude those things to he very improper for such\
places, and fitter for Troy ?  afk, Whether the sacred temple and fields are not\
thereby profaned \'e0 and were dogs to be hunted in the palace-court, or place of\
rendezvous, would it not be ridisulous \'e0 Ajax never entered the Elysian fields be-\
fore his soul\'92 separation, yet here he stabs himself again-: Has he another soul\
to depart from him \
Let us now proceed to the description, division, and consideration of the,\
Third and last Ordonnance.\
The goddess of love perceiving all her endeavours to be fruitless, and grow-\
ing impatient for Adonis\'92 return, took her chariot, drawn by two swans, and\
drove swiftly towards the wood, in order to seek him, leaving her Graces behind,\
as useless at this juncture, as we shall further explain at the end of this ordon-\
nance. Cupid follows her shrieking. The unhappy youth, bit by the wild boar\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
in his groin, lies gasping against' lafge oak ; where, at last, Venus finds him in\
his blood : wherefore stepping from her chariot, like  frantic, sne bewails\
hi, abhorring her godhead, and eursing the-cruel tyranny which prescribes law\
to heaven and earth. In the mean time Adonis expires, and his waving soul is\
taken by Mereury, and carried to the Elysian fields,\
This fable  represent thus.\
Adonis is lying on his left side, fore-shortened, with his neck against the trunk\
of  large oak ; and his right breast and shoulder upwards ; his left arm extend-\
ed; and the right close to his body, holding the spear which is partly un-\
der him ; his head hangs almost on his left arm,  little foreright, with the right\
check upwards ; his feet are turned towards the left corner of the piece, for-\
wards ; his left knee, resting on  fmall rising, or stone, is half drawn up; an\
hunting-horn lies at his feet. The dogs at his head, on the left side, howl and\
yelp. \'e9upid, on his right side, stoops down, and looks at Venus shrieking; at\
the same time opening Adonis\'92 garment, in order to. shew the bloody wound to\
his-mother; who, affrighted, starts-back, and raises her hands towards heaven.\
Cupid\'92 back is, by the goddess, partly in the ground-shade ;. his breast is fore-\
shortened, his feet close, and knees somewhat bent ; holding  torch in his right\
hand. Veuus, as hag. been said, raises her hands on high, putting out her right\
leg, and drawing back her left foot on  cloud, which, behind her, runs up to:\
the right under the chariot ; her upper parts incline over the said left foot ; her\
chin is\'92sunk iato her breast; and thus she beholds the wound. Her breast is-\
fore-shortened, and her right hip is fronting. Behind the aforesaid oak, against\
which Adonis is lying, the chariot is seen in profile, on some waving clouds alike\
with the horizon; which about Venus descend gradually lighter and lighter to:,\
underneath her foot. The chariot, though gilt, yet kept dark by  cloud, is\
elegaatly wrought with children, festoons and foliage; behind, on top, is  large\
star, and the chariot partly hid by the body of the oak. Forwards, between the\
middle and the left corner, stands -stone, about threc feet square, with the\
broken trunk of  term, the residue whereof, as the head and  part of the body,\
lie on the ground, among the-bushies and shrubs. This stone stands somewhat\
obliquely, with. the left corner towards the left side of the piece; close to which.\
side rises an high tree; and  little further, another, quite overgrown five or six\
feet high. Behind the stone, among the shrubs, thistles and thorns, the boar,\
attempting to fly, lies wounded in blood and dirt on its fore-legs, with its mouth-\
wide open. On the second ground, on the right side goes Atropos with her\
sciffors in her hand and distaff on her fhoulder; being, almost ta the middle, hid.\
behind the ground- and in shade, except her head and  part of one shoulder.\
The principal view is on the left side of the point of sight..  little above it-\
slies Mercury-with the soul of the youth, in order to carry-it to the Ehsian fields.\
They are both seen fore-shortened, with their right sides fronting. The youth is\
quite naked, having his arm-cross his breast, his legs close, and his left foot \
little above the other. Mercury. holds him: with his left arm behind about the\
middle, and, looking at him, with-his caduceus forwards, points to the place they,\
are:\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
are going to.  small garment; of this winged\'92mefsenger, isi slyihg behind him\
upwards.\
The ground is craggy and rocky, here and there over-run with grafs, thistles\
\
and hollies.\
The light comes from the right sido, alittie fronting, and\'92-ghe weather is rainyl\
The air is winter-like, yet calm. The trees are bat thinly kaved, except some\
which can endure the winter; as\'92 cypfeis, Jaur\'e9f, elm, briar, &. which must\
give the: most green here-: The-end of- the fore-ground, on the right side; to\
the foot of the goddess is in fhade. by \'e0 bush and some small tr\'e9es. Venus, Ca-\
pid\'92 upper parts, \'92the dead body, with tiie ground, and the tree againstwhich ie\
lies, are strongly lighted. The stone forwards, under: Aconis, is mostly shaded\
with the fore-ground, by some \'e8ypresses on the right side, quite forward in the\
corner. Some piec\'e9s of the term (whicl represents  faunus of salyr); lying some\'ac\
what further. receive  little light. The boar, whose hind-parts are hidden be-\
tween the left side of \'92the stone and the tree standing by it, paftakes also of that\
shade to almost his neck. The happy foul, flying with.the winged. mesfenger,\
just by th\'e8 tre\'eb or chariot, is, with\'92him, from the feet \'92tp the middle, shaded by\
the leaves and branches of the trees\'92; and are far above the horizon, so that the\
green of the tr\'e8\'ebs alffiost touchets their h\'e9ads. The fign Capricorn, in token of the\
first winter month, appeare in the air; very faint; and lighter than the air; it is\
\
\
just over the chariot, where the sky is darkest.\
As for the colours,  them thus. Venus is in an airy dress of pale rose-\
colour, with  blue veil over it. Adonis, with his right shoulder and breast bare,\
has  light sillemot vestment, with violet reslexions ; his checks are pale, and\
lips livid, and so are his hands and feet, yet he has  beautiful skin. Venus is\
very clear and tender skinned; her face and hands warm Cupid is of  middling\
complexion. not so clear as th\'e9 goddess, and somewhat-more rosy than Adonis.\
Venus has light hair; Adonis light chesnut, and Cupid brown hair:\
This subject requires more cyprefs and myrtle than other sorts of trees.\
The ground forward, from the right side to beyond the stone, is marshy.\
 do not introduce the Graces-here, \'92as in the preceding ordonnance, because\
they are improper; for they must not attend Venus on forrowful occasions, as ha\'ac\
ving  quite different use and meaning, as we shall here observe ; and the rather,\
since in the former ordonnance we have shewed the significations of Venus, Adonis,\
 and the wild boar.\
Hesiod testifies, that they were thre\'eb sisters, who by the painters, ar\'e9 represented,\
young, jolly and agreeable, hand in hand. That their dresses were flying, thin and\
gay, discovering their nudities. That the eldest was named Aglais; the second,\
Euphrosyne, and the youngest; Thalia. Seneca proceeds further, and shews their\
qualities and significations ; saying, among other things, in his Treatise de Bene-\
ficiis, that some by the first imply comfort itself, that the second receives, and the\
third retaliates it. Others again are of opinion, that by this triplicity, are signi-\
fied the three particular delights or kindneffes, to wit, shewing kindness, receiving\
kindness, and requitting:: But that they sheuld be-represented thas: hand in\

CHAP. XIII, The, Fabl\'e9 of- Dryope, for the Embellissment of\
Landscapes.\
\
AVING in the preceding chapter, delivered what  had to say touching \
\
fine fable, and the myfterious sense of some circumstances, . find myseff\
\
nbliged, by the-satisfaction which several of the best artifts have found therein, to\
gratify zheir. defires, and: to give- an handle for axercife, in fketching, such\
another.\
 have chofen for this purpose, the fable ofDryope, and will. adapt it as much\
\
as possible to the ornament of landscapes, making it' without-door prospect.\
The story, according to Ovid, is this. Dryope, insensible of the sorrowful\
difitster that was to befall her, on  certam time took awalk by \'e0 lake encompaffed\
with-myrtles, with intent to make the nymphs of the place, presents of garlands\
tif flowers. Stre took with-her, her little son Amphisus, not  yearold, accompanied\
by her sister Jole, with  bafket of flowens anrd wreathed garlagds. Near the lake\
stood  tree, zatled Lotos, bearingred bloffoms ; of which she trafhily broke  twig\
zo pleafigre her child ; but perceiing blood to-issue. from it, and -that the whole\
tree was thereby violently agitated, she was much affrighted ; and the more,\
when in going thence; \'92she felt her feet to fasten into the earth.-; for sne was trans-\
\
formed into  tree.\
\
lexhibit the subject (see plate LIV. ) in  delightful vallev, (according to the\
testimony of the poet) planted with myrtles, and encompassed by abrook. Inthe\
middle of the piece,  place, as the principal, tthe tree Lotos, full of red blossoms\
and thickty leaved. From this tree Dryope broke off the sprig.  make it to.\
shake and move so violently, that the trunk of it by that means-become distorted\
and winding. On\'92the left side; Iplace the raffi Dryope, of  beautiful air, and\
black haired, having her son Amphisus about the middle in her left arm. She ad-\
vances with her left fo\'f4t towards the-tveer  little drawing back the right : her\
upper parts fallhack still more. In her right hand, lifted up, sne holds the bloody\
sprig, at which she stares in confusion. Her left thigh comes forward. Her up-\
per\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
per parts sway to the left; her broast isc-ahriost fronting directly against the light;\
her face in profile more or less turns back and. her feet are by this time fixed in\
the ground. We see the child\'92 hinder parts, and its head is set off against her\
breast. Her sister, on theright side of the tree, standing over against her,  re-\
present with light hair, and in the iutmost concern, wringing her clasped hands\
against her left cheek. . Her head turned to the right, hangs over her right shoul-\
der ; her breaff heaves, and her under parts draw quite back. Her knees are bent,\
her right foot flung out, and the left drawn back, as if she were fainting away.\
She is about fourteen or fixteen years of age. The nymph who supports Dryope,\
is placed between her and the tree, holding her back with her left hand, and with\
her right uncovering the leg, and shewing to the sister, at whom she looks, that\
the foot has already taken root. Another nymph, who is taking the child, has\
her left side fronting, yet her back parts are mostly visible ; she is on her knees,\
the left forward, the other quite drawn back, pushing with her foot against \
water vessel, which at the brink of the water she overturns.  third on the right\
side, comes running, quite astonished, with  lap full of flowers; she points with\
her left hand towards the others, and looks to the left at her companions fitting\
on the banks of the river, which partly runs between the trees towards the point\
of fight. The one arises and looks forward with amazement, and makes it known\
to the other sitting towards the water, who therefore supporting herself on her left\
hand, turns her upper parts to the right, in order to look back. They have\
mostly chaplets either on their heads or lying by them.\
Thus much, as to the disposition and actions of the moveable by-ornaments,\
which consisting of virgins, each is contrasted according to her paffion. We now\
proceed to the immoveable ornaments..\
On the left side, on  rising ground, between the the trees,  place  large front-\
ing Priapas term, without arms or legs, mostly in the snade against the off-scape,\
which strongly throws off the foremost group. On the right side forwards, half\
in the water,  set  square large rough stone, whereon lies  garment or veil, and\
 parcel of leaves and flowers. In the pannel of this stone is carved  Fatality in\
bafs relief. Behind it, and between the nymph with the flowers,  place on the\
ground  basket of chaplets.\
As for the season, it is laid between summer and winter, in the ripening autumn\
and in sine weather for the time of year. The light is  side one  little fronting.\
The sun may be put in or left out, as every one pleases, because it is not men-\
tioned or insisted on in the fable.\
 shall next proceed to describe the further circumstances of this ordonnance ;\
since without shewing the light and darkness, harmony and colours, it is imperfect\
and not fike aature. It must be granted, that the harmony and shadowing often-\
times shew themselves, and that tne light is sufficiently apparent to him who un-\
derstands perspective : but whether there may not occur still something beyond the\
common guess and judgment,  very much question. As for the colours, they\
must needs be expressed ; since without it, it is impossible to know or penetrate\
mine or any other painter\'92 thoughts.\
 therefore\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Itfietefore aflign Dryope, as the principal character, ablue sattin garment; one\
flappet whereof goes over her right shoulder and comes under her girdle, and the\
dther is in her left hand, with which sheholds the naked child about the middle,\
when the remainder, with an under flap tucked in the girdie under her left breast,\
covers all her other parts down to the feet, except the left leg and foot, which is\
rooted in the ground. Her under garment, as likewise the open sleeve about her\
left arm, is yellowish white with green reflexions. Her garment next the left\
leg is open. The foremost nymph is almost naked, having no other covering than\
 sine white small scarf about her middle. The dresses of Dryope and lole are in-\
termixed with gold in order to make  difference between them and the nymphs.\
The nymph who is naked\'92from the middle,  drefs in  dark green gown, gather-\
ed at the navel, and fastened by.  girdle. lole has an airy garment close-sleeved,\
of  bright rose colour, girt with  broad girdle of dark violet embroidered with\
gold; and under it  flowered coat open below, and giving freedom tothe legs.  stone forward is greyish, and the vessel dark red.- The ground next the water,\
is grassy; and thus  variegate the whole: fore ground. The nymph, who on\
the right side of the second ground comes running, has afgreenisn. breast garment,\
loose and untied witho\'fbt sleeves, and fastened but on one shoulder, the left breast\
and legs being bare. The other sitting further behind on the edge of the river, \
\
leave quite naked Her companion has  small green scarf.. The stone Priapus\
is dark gray inclinable to violets\
As for the light,  think that the major part ought principally to fall on Dryope\
and the two nymphs next her, and on what else belongs to that group.\
The re-\
sidue may be little, and mostly foreign lighted, either from behind, before or\
sideways ; yet in such sort as that the cause thereof and the snades (as by what\
and from whence) may plainly appear; gtherwise they will be but loose fancies,\
without foundation.\
Some may possibly question, whether hereby the light will answer my purpose,\
because  assign Dryope ablue garment over  yellowish white one, judging, not\
without seeming reason, yet without knowing my intention, that the contrary\
would look more decorous ; namely, the light over the dark ; because the great-\
est and strongest mafs of light falling on her middle parts, to wit, belly and legs,\
the naked child would be more beautifully set off, if her breast or upper parts.\
were dark, than against the yellowissi white. This with respect to the light, \
willingly allow, but not as to the colour; for  designedly made the garment blue\
in order to make the naked nymph beautiful; and yer, with intention that that\
part might keep  strong and broad light : for this reason,  have chosen  stuff\
for itaccordingly, it being brown, that sattin has  gloss, and almost the same\
force as gold or silver ffuffs. The red garment of lole, as being  beautiful and\
light colour, will'be sufficiently, yet too much, set off against the dark ground :\
but the blue has,here, on account of the great mafs; more power, though having\
more light about it ; for the red is but  small spot.  have as much as possible,\
considered th\'e9 probability ofthis representation, and the harmony in the dispofi-\
tion of the eolours ; assigning each figure its particular and proper emblematic co-\
lour, not only in the draperies, but also in the nudities, giving one  fair and ten\'ac\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
der, another  more brownish sxin, and so forth. Each figure-has likewise its par-\
ticular characteristic; the head of the water-nymph is adorned with white bell-\
flowers; that of the wood-nymph with wild plants; and that of her who comes\
running forward, with field-flowers. If it be wondered, that  make mention of\
sattin, since we rarely hear it was in use among the ancients ;  say the observa-\
tion is just with respect to statuaries, but not as to painters ; because  have met\
with several old pictures wherein  have seen sattin represented : but how long\
that stuff has been known to the world \'92cannot tell, nor shall enquire. In the\
mean time, it must be allowed to be  beautiful and elegant stuff; as are also the\
changeable silks, though in  less degree, and more proper for young people.\
If any difficulty arise from my introducing into this story  Priapus-term, since\
there\'92. neither god, man, faunus, or satyr, in the whole piece, nor the least sign\
of any indecent action, Iwill give him my reason; which is, that the Poet, re-\
lating the first cause of the disaster befalling this unhappy woman, afcribes it to\
the tree Lotos ; because when  woman, and Priapus could not satisfy his lust with\
her, he, in revenge, transformed her into that tree bearing her name, laying \
curse on those who violated it; and still retains that vindictive humour; where-\
fore  place him here, as the first promoter of the accident.\
 insist largely on these fables or ordonnances, to give  handle for further\
inquiries into them ; for Ovid is not full and particular in all his fables, and we\
are obliged to fetch \'e0 great deal from ather authors,\
He gives us no right idea of the tree Lotos, (. stranger to these countries) nor\
mentions, what sort of leafing it has, or its virtues, or whether it be of  moist\
or dry nature, or where it grows most plentifully ; wherefore, as far as  have\
met with them, Ishall produce the testimonies of some authors about this tree, to-\
gether with the emblematic sense and explanations they assign :  very proper part\
of knowledge for  landscape painter; whose inclination leads hini to something,\
uncommon, and desires to pafs for learned among the curious and knowing.\
 have found, in general, that the leaves are round ; which at the rising sun-\
open, and as he goes down close, and at night double; wherefore, when we in-\
troduce no sun-shine, they must be represented doubled or shut.\
As for the misterious sense, we must know, that the Agyptians paid more ho-\
nours to this tree than any others, on  belief, that it was  mediator between.\
heavenly and earthly things. It is moreover used to represent the sun\'92 rising and\
setting; especially with the addition of  child sitting on it, by which they signified\
the morning vapours, which the sun\'92 approach dispels. And because it opens\
and shuts its leaves with the sun\'92 rising and setting, it is sacred to Apollo, as  tree\
peculiar to him, and out of respect shewing its leaves to him only.\
The rough or hairy Lotos was also much venerated by the Romans, who offered\
the vestals locks of hair to it, \'ab as they did those of young men to Apolle, or to\
his son Asculapius.\
The Gree\'e8s sacrificed their hair in the same manner\'92to the rivers of their country,\
as having  certain relation to this tree,-which they imagined had such intercourse\
with the gods, that they made it their seat : and therefore it was planted in\
morasses.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Ialblichus testifies, that these trees require much moisture; whence the ancients\
inferred, the first cause of procreation : therefore, calling the ocean the father of\
all creatures. And, observing the round leaves, round stem and round fruit,\
they would by this mofl perfect figure, intimate the perfection of the highest\
Deity, especially when  child was represented sitting on atree : which Ovid like-\
wise alludes to in this fable, when (as Mr. Pope has rendered it) he says,\
 Now, from my branching arms this infant bear,\
 Let some kind nurse supply  mother\'92 care;\
 Yet to his mother let him oft' be led,\
 Sport inher shades, and in her shades be fed ;-\
We shall now proceed to,\
 second Table or Ordonnance relating to Dryope.\
The story is this. As soon as Andr\'e6mon was advertised of the sorrowful accident\
which had happened to his wife Dryope, he hasted to the place in company with\
his father : but they arrived too late to have any speech with her before the meta-\
morphases.  rough bark had now seized her body and members, insomuch that\
she was only to be known from other trees by her shape and soft voice. Her\
arms made two branches, abounding with leaves ; besides her head attire, cover-\
ed with greens. Both the father and son hung about her neck, and wept; and\
with the child, at her request, kissed her for the last time : whereupon she was\
divested of her human shape at once.\
In the former ordonnance,  have ordered th\'e8 river forwards, and in this,\
sideways. Dryope, all but her head, transformed into  myrtle-tree,  place al-\
most in the middle of the piece, standing upright,  little to the left of the point\
of sight. Andr\'e6mon takes her about the neck and kisses her left cheek. His aged\
and sorrowful father complains of the sorrowful mishap to  nymph standing near\
him, with his right hand tearing open Dryope\'92 linen, in order to shew her the bo-\
dy ; which beholding, she raises her shoulders, turning her head away, and look-\
ing down. Another nymph, having the little Amphisus in her arms lifts him up in\
order to kifs his mother. Jole  place in great lamentation at Dryope\'92 feet; and \
step further stands the tree Lotos. On the second ground, onthe right side,  set\
the term of Priapus, cross-hung with festoons of flowers and greens tied under the\
navel ; and before it  small smoaking altar, with some people offering. On the\
left side, on the fore-ground,  place the large square stone, half under water, with\
 nymph leaning on it. These are the heads of my design. The view is on the\
left side of the point of sight, and consists of hills, and waters; and because  re-\
present an evening, the air is full of vapours and dark clouds ; and the trees, by\
reason of the wind, are in agitation.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Now, as this piece is the fellow of the former, all things should, of right, be\
equally full of work ; but because this ordonnance has the greater variety, as ex-\
hibiting some men,  have been necessitated to depart  ltttle from the original\
disposition, since what is introduced into the other must needs be seen here ; as\
we have largely treated in the zist Chap. Of Ordonnance. Wherefore  place\
Dryope fronting, with both her arms lifted up, and pretty near each other. Hef\
head loosely hangs down between them, to the left. Her arms, from the elbows\
upwards, together with her breast, and . little of her body, retain their first\
forms. Andr\'e6mon is seen, on the left side, standing on tip-toe in order to kiss\
her left cheek, which she offers him; his right arm is about her neck, and his\
left on her breast.  little forward stands the father tottering, and, near his\
side, the nymph, to whom he complains; at the same time opening Dryope\'92 un-\
der-garment, only tied on her shoulder with  ribbon, and turning his head and\
tipper-parts to the left, with his face towards heaven. The nymphs stands\
close behind him very dejected and sorrowful, raising her shoulders, and looking\
downwards with her head  little sideling off from Dryope ; her left elbow is drawn\
in, and her open hand up at her head; her breast is bare, and in the light. Her\
under parts are fronting, and her right leg flung out. Andr\'e6mon\'92 garment, fall-\
ing from his fhoulder, hangs about his heels. The nymph who, on the right\
side, where the ground is somewhat lower, is lifting un the child, falls back in\
her upper parts, with her head hanging forwards ; she rests on her right leg,\
having'the left. lifted up against the tree ; her back is fronting, and turns to the\
light, and her under parts have  contrary sway. The child, whose upper parts\
only are seen (the rest being hidden by her head), stretches out both his arms for-\
wards, towards the tree, pressing one of his feet against her body. Jole, sitting\
squat between her and the tree, leans her left shoulder against it, with her head\
coming forward, and her hand on her face, having  cloth in her lap. On the\
left fide, without the piece, at the end of the fore-ground,  place two nymphs;\
one with her legs in-the water, and resting on her right elbow, and holding her\

mon, as  man of repute, has  fhort greenish grey couloured coat, embroidered\
with gold ; his upper garment is reddishi purple, dark and warm; and his legs\
up to the hips are in the shade of the tree. The old man is dressed after the\
Persian manner, in  gown reaching to the calves of his legs, of  light sillemot\
colour, with large violet stripes and gold leaves ; his upper garment, sleeved and\
quite open, is beautiful violet ; he has shoes and wide stockings ; his cap, like \

nymph by his side is half shaded by him; that is, her whole right side, from the\
shoulder dowuwards, except her knee, which she advances ; her vestment is\
greenish blue, inclining somewhat to dark. The nymph with the child has an\
airy blue garment, girt about the middle; her right shoulder is bare, and the\
slappet of her garment ruffled about her legs by means of the wind. The virgin\
behind her, and between the tree Lotos. has  white garment. The Priapus-term\
between the trees is by them mostly shaded; and off from it, passing by the\
point of sight, the major part is filled up with small trees, which are dark or in\
shade, and brightly setting off the foremost group.\
The two naked nymphs, on the left side, receive little light. The air on the\
horizon is full of vapours and melting ; because  do not give here the sun so-\
bright and clear as in  fine morning, nor so strong as at mid-day, but more or\
less vapourish, and therefore the whole appears of  russet colour. The clouds.\
are large, thick, and heavy.\
The sky might also be properly enriched, by exhibiting in it the three Parcae or\
Fatal Sisters ; since, having done their bufinefs, they are again ascending. In\
such case Atropes, with the thread and scifsors, ought to be foremost; next to her\
Lachesis with the spindie; and behind her Clorho with the distaff.\

The late Dryope, after her fate, stands, with-the tree Lotos, at the end of the\
fore-ground.  little to the right of the point of sight, and from her to the\
left side, appears  bending way, like  crescent, coming forward ; against\
which the water from the right. side, about three feet lower, is wasning. Quite\
forwards, against the shore, lies  passage-boat. On the right side, without the-\
picture,  represent -piece of very high ground, running towards the point of\
fight. At the bottom of this ground, and almost level with the water, runs \
path, edged with some watry trees; and even. some of them in the water. The\
lecond-ground rises hill-like, against the off-fcape, especially on the right side,\

 believe it will not seem odd to the knowing, that  introduce so much high\
ground and water about so small  spot of low land, because the Poet lays the\
fact in  lake ; for which reason, and in order naturally to shew it,  exhibit that\
corner, with the way crescent-like, as being but  part of the lake.\
The question is now, Whether  painter may not take some liberty for deco-\
tum\'92 sake ,  answer, he may, so far as not to take away the property of the sub-\
ject; for what the writer lays down must pafs for  law; whetefore we may well\
conclude, that Ovid does not say any thing without reason. Some may possibly\
think  could have made  more delightful choice : but it may be observed, that\
this fact is of  contrary nature;  seek not for pleasure in the midst of sorrow,\
which here is my principal scope, as may appear by what follows.\
In the path on the right side  represent some bacchanals and satyrs trooping to-\
wards the hills. Among them, one is carrying  Priapus-term on his shoulder,\
with  large vessel in his other hand, and followed by tygers and panthers. As\
for the transformed Dryope,  let her under garment, of the colour before said,\
hang on the tree : near which stand three nymphs; of whom one embraces it\
with both hands as if she would shake it; at the same time looking upwards at\
the leaves. The two others are talking together; the one pointing forward at\
the sorrowful relations, who are departing.  place lole forward, by the boat,\
with her sister\'92 garment and  basket of flowers in her hand; which, weeping,\
sne gives to the waternian. Andr\'e6mon, coming  step further, has his son Amphi\'ac\
sus on his left arm, wrapped in his garment; he is speaking to the waterman, and\
shewing him the place whether he would be carried. Behind him follows the fa-\
ther ; who, fixing his eyes towards heaven, on the Hesperus, or evening star, seems\
to complain of the unhappy fate of his daughter.\
 shall now fully describe the figures, and their actions, and dreffes, and other\
necessary circumstances.\
The boat, tied to  post, lies somewhat sideways and fore-shortened. The wa-\
terman\'92 right side is fronting, inclining to the land, with his back directly in the\
light; he receives with extended arms the garment and basket of flowers which\
lole gives him. His vestment is light grey, girt with  large black girdle, which\
is buckled ; his right shoulder is bare almost to the middle. Jole appears with her\
left side fore-right, and her breast swaying towards him; giving him the basket of\
flowers with her right hand, on the arm whereof hangs her sister\'92 garment; her\
under parts are fronting, and her feet close, with knees  little bent; she turns\
her head to the left wiping her eyes with  fl-ppet of the veil which she has\
about her neck. Andr\'e6mon, with the little Amphisus in his arms, stands on one\
leg, and is stepping towards the boat; his upper parts turn to the left, his breast\
fronting, and his right arm put out sideways, in order to shew the waterman, as\
has been said, the place he would be carried to; the purple garment is fastened\
on his right shoulder, and from under his arm, slinging about his body, he thereby\
partly covers the child; and with another flappet of the same, which he has in\
his left hand, he supports and holds the child, on his rising hip against his left\
breast. The child holds him fast about the neck, with its left hand in the open-\
ing of his under garment, leaning back with its upper parts from him, and hold-\

further instructive,  shall handle one fable more, as also  design of my own :\

CHAP. XIV. Table or Ordonnance of Erifichton; and the Emblem\
of  Satyr  Punishment: Both serving for the Embellisbment of Land-\
scapes.\
VID relates that Erifichton, avery vile man, was, by the goddess Ceres,\
).\
whom he had highly offended by cutting down an exceeding high oak-tree,\
consecrated to her, punished with insatiate hunger; insomuch that, for want of\
food, he was obliged to sell his-own daughter. See Plate LVI.\
 represent this in  delightful landscape, or without-door prospect. The light\
comes from the right side; and the point of sight is in the middle. On tlie\
left side  exhibit  stately building. with  beautiful frontispiece, of the Dorick\
order, ascended by three steps running towards the point of sight. Beyond the\
steps  place an hand-rail, four feet in rise, running from the house by the point\
of sight. In the return of it stands  vase. On the right side is -river, with \
wooden bridge over it. By the water-side appears part of  town-wall, which the\
water walhes and runs round. The residue is an off-scape, here and there planted\
with trees. Next the hand-rail  pl\'e2ce the hungry Erisichton; who, with his cap\
in his left hand, is tumbling his told money into it with his right hand. His\
daughter Mestre stands behind him, near the steps; and the merchant stepping up\
shews her the door, with his right hand, wherein he has  bag half full of\
money;\
\
\
\
\
\
\
money ; at the fame time holding her with his left, by  flappet of her garment.\
Lean Hunger behind, between her and her father\'92 right side, pushes her forwards.\
with both hands. This is the main of the subject.\
The merchant looking proudly and gravely at the daughter, is dressed in  violet-coloured garment, reaching just below the knees ; it is girt about hia\
middle ; he has  fillet about his head, and he is loosely stockined and shoed, ac-\
cording to the Spartan custom : he is seen mostly from behind, resting with his\
right foot on the upper step, and drawing up the left from off the middle one.\
The daughter stands on her right leg, with her left foot just on the lower step, .\
little drawn back ; her under parts are almost fronting more or less from the light,\
she-sways her upper parts to the right, wishfully looking at her father, whoin she\
is unwilling to ieave : with sorrow and tears fhie seems to move the merchant\'92'\
pity, and to follow him against her will; she has an handkerchief in her right\
hand, with which, up at the left ear, sne seems to wipe her face, supporting the.\
elbow of that arm with her other hand. Her garment is pale yellow, with green,\
reffexions, and being slovenly gathered under the breast and tied with.  ribbon,\
hangs in tatters below the calfs of her legs ; she is bare-footed, has  beautiful\
mein, yet is somewhat thin ; her hair is light, twisted with small blue ribbons.\
Erifichton stands quite stooping, with bent knees ; his garment tied about the\
middte with  rope, is fillemot, and reaches behind to the calfs of his legs, being\
so open on the side as to discover his bare hip and leg; his left shoulder is also\
naked, his hair and beard grey, and he is lean and swarthy : his stick stands against\
the hand-rail. As for hunger, Ovid describes him thus; With frightful hair,\
eyes sunk in; mnouth and lips livid, teeth yellow and slimy, and  thick skin dis-\
covering the bones and entrails : he is seen almost to the middle above the back of\
Erisichton. The pillars of the frontispiece are grey, the house and steps free-stone,\
and the pavement the door is of, large blue ftone; and from thence down to the\
river, the ground is plain. In the front of the house are carved two Cornua Copi\'e6.\
The vase is of  reddisn stone. On the left side of it, behind the hand-rail; rifes .\
great spreading tree in full verdure, which gives  large shade against the house ;\
the stem of it is encompassed with ivy and other green, which take away the light\
of the off-scapebetweenit and the vase, together with the sharpness of the hand--\
rail, against which the daughter is brightly set off with decorum. Against the wing\
of the house, without the hand-rail,   vine. At the door waits  young,\
servant. Quite forward in the left corner, stands  watchful dog, tied with  chain:\
and barking.\
In this representation  have had an eye to three principal circumstances; indi-\
gency, necessaries of life, and opportunity. Indigency seeks relief where it is to\
be had; if not in town, elsewhere ; wherefore,  represent necessity in both father\
and daughter, coming for relief to the substantial man\'92 country seat, who lives in\
plenty. The further circumstances, as, the bridge, town, and horns of plenty,\
explain themselves.\
Ido not place lean hunger near Erisichton, contrary to what Ihave formerly said,\
namely, That, when  pafsion can be expreffed in the person himself, we have no\
need of an emblematic figure to make it known-: Hunger is placed here for two\
reasons :\
\
\
\
\
\
reasons : first, because want cannot be perfectly expressed here in its full force,\
through  present intermixture with something else ; as, the happiness of having\
found the means whereby to relieve it ; to wit, the money. Secondly, because\
Erifichton is not so naked, that his consumed body, according to the poet, can be\
shewed as occasion requires.\
The reason of my putting in the dog, is not only for the enrichment of the dis-\
position, but also to shew, that he who possesses much wealth, should likewise\
watch it. Moreover, it is usual for the country people, but chiefly men of sub-\
stance, to keep those creatures as well for pleasure as use.\
This fable is seldom seen in painting or exhibited in  print otherwise than in\
Ovid\'92 metamorphases, and that in so simple  manner, that without the explana-\
tion under it, it is scarce intelligible : for, What can be inferred from an old\
meagre man\'92 receiving  purse of money from  gentleman, with  young woman\
appearing between them ; How can the inequality between riches and poverty\
be conspicuous, when they as like in dress as if they were brother and sister; and\
this in  landscape, or the middle of afield, where is neither house, nor other token\
of their habitation ?\
The conclusion of  story is not all that is necessary to be red, we ought to\
know the origin, the fact and sequel of it. First, it is necessary to know the man\
and who Erisichton and his daughter were, to express this naturally in their persons\
and dresses. Secondly, we should know by whom they are, punished, and in\
what manner : and lastly, by whom, and by what means made easy. After  full\
all their circumstances, most naturally ; such as the place, &. After which, the\
enrichments and diminutions will follow of themselves. We may at least con-\
ceive, that they, who will not study the point, cannot go such lengths as to per-\
form so small  story as this, much less one of greater dignity, in  natural and ju-\
dicious manner.\
Ishall now, agreeable to my promise in the conclusion of the last chapter, give\
another embellishing example, in an emblem of my own invention, for the sake of\
those who will not inure themselves to historians or poets, nor confine their free and\
rich thoughts to such.  restriction.\
Sweet Repose disturbed by Lewdness. An Emblem.\
Here are seen three young nymphs of Diana\'92 train, tired with honting, reposing\
in the shade of the trees  little off from the road, and near  foamy water: which\
some fauni and satyrs espying, they were resolved to have some sport with them.\
Wherefore, acquainting their affociates with the matter, they silently advanced\
towards the place in abody ; bringing with them one of the largest Priapus termis\
they had, together with two panthers  vessel of wine and some grapes. Being\
arrived, and seeing the nymphs almost naked, and fast asleep, they planted before\
the place the aforesaid hideous scare-crow; and then softly ftole their hunting\
equipage, as quivers, arrows, bows, &. and hung them on its genitals, fasten-\
ing them with the straps, which they buckled. They moreover decked its head\
with\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
and adorning them with vizors. Not stopping here, they seized as many of the\
virgins garments as they could, and tossed them upon the high limbs of an ad-\
joining tree ; and to prevent the nymphs climbing up in order to regain, they\
tied the two panthers under the tree ; and after having set down the wine and\
grapes, pleased with the project, they covertly retired to  peeping place to wait\
the issue on the nymphs awaking. Each of the gang had brought with him his\
instrument, as, the double hautboy, cymbal, tabor, timbrel, &. wherewith,\
because it was evening, and they might sleep too long, to beat up their quarters.\
But the plot soon miscarried, through an unexpected accident; for another nymph,\
who was possibly seeking for her company, happened to arrive at the place, and\
seeing the panthers lying under the tree, and thinking they were wild, shot at\
them and killed one. The satyrs seeing this, came out of their lurking-hole, and\
pursued her, but she escaped by flight. They then concluded, they had waited\
long enough; and observing that it grew late, and that the aforesaid little bustle\
made the nymphs begin to stir, they in  full body of satyrs, fauni, bacchanals,\
even all the tribe of Bacchus, set up with their instruments so loud  noise, that the\
nymphs started up on  sudden; and, full of fright, looked for their cloaths: but\
being now thoroughly awaked, the term presented before them, with their hunt-\
ing equipage hanging about it. This sight, but especially that of their cloaths on\
the tree, much surprized them and put them to the blush; not knowing what\
course to take in the exigence. Not one durst approach the block in order to take\
her weapons. The vile crew all this while kept perdue, laughing at them unob-\
served. The distressed nymphs perceiving no body near them, run to and fro,\
considering how to get their cloaths again; but on their approach to the tree the\
panther arose, making so great  noise that they knew not whether to run. Cries\
and lamentations here were useless : they above an hundred times invoked the aid\
of Diana; yet in vain. The eldest, named Cleobis, at last took courage, and went\
up to the term, with intention to get the veil from it to cover Carile, who was na-\
ked ; saying,-Ahl Why are we such fools to be thus scared, and only by \
wooden black ; Why are we afhamed ; Some-body has certainly been here ;\
but now the coast is clear,  am resolved to throw it down. Come, sisters, and\
boldly give an helping hand.-\'97 But she had no sooner uttered these words, but\
all the gang appeared, mocking, scoffing and hooting : any one may determine\
who was on that overture, most dashed and concerned.  little satyr shot at the\
term, and took the quivers from it, shewing the nymphs the unseemly member,\
with an hearty laughter. This (but especially when other scoffers shewed them\
the cloaths on the tree) highly provoked them. To take to flight was not ad-\
viseable ; one pushed them this way, another that way. During this game, \
noise of cornets was heard, which suddenly put an end to the laughter ; each\
made off, leaving all things as they stood. The term of Priapus fell to the ground,\
and the panther at the tree endeavoured to get loose. Now, Diana appears, at-\
tended by her train of nymphs, who shot their arrows at the lewd crew, the dogs,\
at the same time, tearing the panther to pieces. The fearful nymphs appeared\
much afhamed, and prostrated themselves at the feet of the goddess; to whom\
they\
\
\
\
\
\
they related their misfortunes, and the affront put upon them by the gang of\
satyrs; shewing her at the same time, the term, the vizors, their cloaths on the\
tree, and what else was done in despite to them. The goddess, to shew her\
resentment, gave immediate order to pursue the rioters, and would not enlighten\
the night till she had revenged the insolence. Some accordingly made towards\
the woods, others to the brooks, and the residue took the field : in  little time,\
part of them were made captives; for of the three who pursued the nymph for\
shooting the panther, one was catched in the net, and five others, together with \
bacchanal, were hawled before Diana in irons ; whom she sentenced to be tied, two\
and two together by the feet, and whipped by the three affronted nymphs with\
thorns and holm-leaves so severely, as almost to. kill them. Three others fhe\
judged to be hung by their tails on the limbs of trees, with their heads just touch-\
ing the ground. Not yet appeased, she caused him who was taken in the net, to\
be therein plunged into the water, by two or three nymphs, till he was just ex-\
piring, and the water came out of his mouth. The bacchanal must see all this,\
on whom was bestowed an hunting knife, wherewith if she thought fit, to release\
the delinquents, to cut off their tails : which after much reluctance, she was at\
last prevailed upon to do; and then, tying their hands behind them, Diana said,\
Go now, and shew vourselves to the rest of your wanton gang, and tell them, that\
thus  will punish all those who dares to mock the chaste Diana and her retinue.\
Is not this now, though  feigned story, matter sufficient to furnisn many\
landscapes; The landscape-painter ought to observe here  representation of\
different paffions ; bashifulness in the nymphs ; wanton joy in the saytrs ; severity\
\
and resentment in the goddess and distress in the insolents.\
You see here the alluring pleasure of committing  crime, and the bashfulness\
and distress of those who suffer the evil ; but at the same time, the grievous conse-\
quences, and punishment attending wickednefs and insolence. In fine, the sweets\
and punishment of evil, and the reward and unexpected relief of virtue.\
Can it be denied, that such  representation in landscape will not generally\
please; Surely it is not impossible to make other such designs. On wnich oc-\
cafion,  hope it will not be tiresome to the reader if  now shew what is understood\
by the word (painter-like) as  very necessary point for  landscape painter.\
CHAP. XV. Of the Word Painter-like. )\
THERE is scarce any thing in the world which is not liable to  good or bad\
construction ; and judgment alone chuses in all things  medium, out of\
these two contrarities, which is certainly the most beautiful and best. This is an\
especial truth in the art of painting; which has such  power as to affect people\
two different ways : first, by virtuous and agreeable representations; and in the\
aext place, by those which. are mean, mishapen and contemptible ; both equally\
efficacious\
\
\
\
\
\
\
efficacious in contrariety.\
The former recreates and charms  judicious eye, and\
the latter is its aversion.\
It is therefore indisputable, that the painter-like, or\
most beautiful choice, implies nothing else than what is worthy to be painted ;\
and that the most mean, or what is not beautiful, least deserves that honour : as\
for instance, suppose there were brought before me  basket of ripe, unripe and\
rotten fruits mixed together;  must, having my judgment, chuse the most re-\
lishing, or those which appear most beautiful to the eye, and reject the rest.\
 landscape adorned with sound and straight grown trees, round bodied and\
finely leaved, spacious and even grounds, with gentle ups and downs, clear and\
still rivers, delightful vistos, well ordered colours, and an agreeable blue sxy,\
with some small driving clouds; also elegant fountains, magnificent houses and\
palaces, disposed according to the rules of architecture, and richly ornamented;\
likewise, well-shaped people agreeable in their action; and each coloured\
and draperied according to his quality ; together with cows, sheep, and other\
well-fed cattle. All these,  say, may claim the title of painter-like ; but \
piece with deformed trees, widely branched and leaved, and disorderly spreading\
from east towards west, crooked bodied, old and rent, full of knots and hollow-\
nefs; also rugged grounds without roads or ways, sharp hills, and monstrous\
mountains silling the off-scape, rough or ruined buildings with.- their parts lying\
up and down in confusion; likewise muddy brooks,  gloomy sky, abounding\
with heavy clouds; the field furnished with lean cattle and vagabonds of gypsies :\
such  piece,  say, is not to be called  fine landscape. Can any one, without\
reason, asfert him to be  painter-like object, who appears as \'e0 lame and dirty\
beggar, cloathed in rags, splay-footed, bound about the head with  nasty clout,\
having  skin as yellow as  backed pudding, killing vermin; or in fine, any\
fuch paltry figure  Would younot rather conclude suchthings to be the jest of\
 painter \'e0\
For my part, Ibefieve that the difference between the fine and the ugly, is too\
great not to make  distinction between them. Iam well pleased, that some call\
the works of Bamboccio, Brouwer, and Moller, and the landscapes of Brueghel, Bril,\
Bloemart Savry, Berchem, and such masters, painter-like : but  oppose to them,\
Raphael, Correggio, Poussin, Le Brun, &. and in landscape, Albani, Genouille,\
On this occasion,  shall, before  conclude, also- consider the word designer-like,\
 word which is as much perverted as the other : for instance; crooked trees\
abounding with knots and hollownesses, rugged clods of earth, bursten and sharp\
rocks, human bodies robustly and roughly muscled in Michael. Angelo\'92 manner,\
faces large featured, long nosed, wide mouthed, hollowe eyed like Tefta\'92. These\
objects we have extolled for designer-like, though as absurdly and improperly, as\
The masters therefore are very imprudent, who encourage their-disciples to\
seck and draw in so troublesome  way, after such objects, as tending to nothing\
else than learning them to make out-lines. Do they nor ehuse  round-about-\
way to bring them into the right path; Nay, How many die in the purfuit,\
who, had they taken the other way, might easily have got throught Where-\
fore,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
fore, it is more adviseable to draw after the beautiful and sedate fimplicity and\
greatness of Raphael, Poussin, and other excellent mafters, than after any of those\
other paltry and mis-shapen objects. This must be agreed, thar if the bad and\
deformed be painter or designer-like, the beautiful is not so, the case admits of\
II\
no alteration; and consequently the worst must be best, and the best worst.\
both be good, there is no room for choice ; and you may at that rate mingle\
beauty with deformity, joy with sorrow, ripenness with unripeness, gods with\
beggars : but since beauty is attracting, and deformity offensive, this certainly is\
true painter-like, which supposes the bestand most agreeable objects; which alone\
ought to be called fo, and sought for.\
Yet there are occasions, wherein both must be observed; either that the story\
requires it, or that, by means of deformity, we are to set off what is beautiful,\
and make it predominate : but theu the painter who understands beauty, may\
more easily abate, than the other exalt himself above his knowledge and capacity.\
Wheresore  conclude, that beautiful nature is the best choice, and the most\
painter-like.\
 shall now for the benefit of such artists as are not rich in invention, give \
compendious description of variety of objects in  fictitious view.\
CHAP. XVI. Of Painter-like Beauty in the open Air.\
HE dav was almost shut in, and the agreeable western sun giving long and\
charming ground-shades, when  purposed to divert myself with  walk ;\
not without reflecting, how many fine observables-are overlooked, which if hand-\
led according to rule, would be of service :  carlessnefs often proceeding from\
too superficial and groundless  method of study, which will not permit the\
thoughts to six on things of most importance.\
where nothing was-wanting which could tend to the repose of the mind; every\
thing was beautiful and orderly. Blind chance had no hand in this-  could\
plainly perceive with- what ardour and pleasure Nature and Art had mutually be-\
stowed their benefits upon it. The roads or passages were so neat and level, that\
in walking you hardly seemed to touch the ground.  sweet and refreshing wind\
reigned there ;. which so allayed the sun\'92 heat as to make it indifferent whether\
you sat in it, or in the shade: the rich- leaved trees; as beautiful in their stems as\
their greens, moved almost insenfibly ; when the young and tender sprouts, as\
yet but thinly leaved, careffed by the mild and gentle air, seemed to rejoice. the\
silver leaves by  sweet motion, glittering like medals: the sky was fine blue,\
losing gradually in thin air towards- the horizon : the small clouds not violently\
driving this way and that, moved slowly and quietly. till they got out of sight. The\
white\
\
\
\
\
\
\
white swans beheld themselves in the clear brooks, freely winding and turning\
without feeling whether with or against the stream.\
In this delightful region,  found  very beautiful fountain, the bason of which\
was of white marble, furnished towards the road with rocky bowls and scollops\
to receive the water; the figures standing upon it were most elegantly chosen :\
round it stood low and close May-trees, against the green whereof, the white\
marble was magnificiently, yet modestly-set off; causing thus  pleasing mixture\
in its shade.\
From thence,  took to the right hand, along  level and broad way, on both\
sides faced with  parapet of free-stone, whereon stood forwards two large vases of\
flesh-coloured marble, in shape and ornament like those in the Farnese garden ;\
wide on top and without covers-, but instead of an Iphigenia, the faint carving\
consisted of dancing women. These vases had  wonderful fine sweep, the figures\
were ordefly disposed, and in all parts alike and moderately filled with work; and\
because the bas relief arose so- little, the whole appeared as yet fresh and un-\
damaged.\
The parapet was built after the Doricorder, and its pannels were adorned with\
foliage and branch-work, twined with reeds.\
The end of it let me into  wide sandy road, on the left side bordered with \
gentle flowing river, and on the right, with sine and large trees ; along the brink\
of this river were planted only grey and whitisn willows, not all alike streight and\
large, but some leaning over the water, others close branched and leaved, others\
again, thin and young, discovering the glitter of the water: on the right side,\
where the road run high, stood, as  say, large and heavy trees of various kinds,\
such as oak, afn, lime, wild olive, pine, cypress, &. Some with straight stems,\
round tops, swaying branches, and fine greens ; between which, some tender\
suckers with their small and upright stalks and airy leaves afforded an inexpresfible\
elegant variety. The brown cypresses laden with their fruit, added no small lustre\
to the green of the other trees, to my great delight. Under these trees grew\
some wild simples, and various kinds of large and small leaved plants intermixed\
with thistles and thorns in an agreeable and most painter-like manner. These un-\
der growths, but especially the grafs on the sides, were in many places dusted by\
the road ; which, by their union, caused  charming decorum.\
At proper distances, along both sides of the road, were placed for the ease of\
travellers, some low free-stone feats, in the form of  long and narrow architrave,\
supported by two square pillars.\
Going on  came to  cross-way, where  found  term, or guide set up. Here,\
not to gowrong, Iwas at \'92stand which way to take: in this doubt  recollected,\
that those guides have commonly their faces towards the way strangers and travel-\
lers ought to go. This term, was down tothe lower belley, like  man, yet very\
musculous, and the head resembled that of  saytr, and guarded with two large\
crooked ram\'92 horns ; it stood in  gap. between some large trees, half fhaded\
with leaves and ivy ; it seemed to he made of marble, but very much be-dripped\
aud fouled with green liquor.  little from it  saw, on  white marble plinth, \
decumbent statue of  naked nymph, resting with her elbow on  vase shedding\
water,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
water, which flowing down the plinth below the way, which was there  little\
rocky, run into the river : this figure was very agreeable.  wondered at first,\
fince it stood not far from, and lower than the term, that yet it was much cleaner,\
thinking that in such  place it could not well maintain its beauty and whiteness;\
but my wonder ceased on perceiving that there were no high trees over it, but that\
it had  free air : another reason was, that being so low as to be reached over,\
possibly some draftsman had been at the place, and wiped it clean ; on such \
conjecture, ltook some water out of the vase into my hand, and rubbed  part of\
the shoulder, which confirmed my suspicion, for  discovered that some parts were\
already become smooth and glossy, by being handled and rubbed.\
Stepping \'e0 little further,  saw another sight as fine as the former ;  say, fine\
with respect to art. It was an ancient tomb or sepulcher of light red marble, in-\
termixed with dark grey, and white eyes and veins, with  lid or cover of lapis\
lazuli. This tomb was supported by four white marble sphinxes without wings,\
resting on  large black marble plinth, which, through its dustiness, seemed to be\
lightisn grey. The ground under it was rugged, yet level for three or four feet\
round the plinth.- This work was generally encompassed with sand extending to\
the sea-shore, which it faced; and, ten or twelve steps further, the sea was seen\
foaming. In the middle of the belly of the tomb, was  round bass-relief within\
 compartment of oak leaves ; it exhibited  flying eagle, with thunder in its\
bill.; whence  conjectured it might be Phaeton\'92 grave; and the rather, because\
there stood, near the corners, three very old and large cypresses; of which the\
hindmost was as yet whole and sound, but the forward ones, by weather or other-\
wise, so damaged, that one had lost its top, and the other was on one side half\
unbranched and bare. Behind this tomb, stood  large pedestal of greyish-blue\
ftone, on which had formerly, as it seemed, been set an urn, now flung down,\
and lying near it half buried in the ground : it was somewhat broken and da-\
maged :  could make but little of the carving upon it, since that was under-\
neath, and the ear or handle of the urn lay upwards ; wherefore, in order to see\
what it was,  began to clear the ground away from it; but had hardly dug \
foot deep, before  perceived  piece of  chariot, and half  wheel in the shape\
of  star; this,  thought, must be the chariot of the sun, as being not much:\
unlike it.\
This work thus seeming old, and yet the tomb with all its ornaments as new as\
if just set up,  thought it must have owed its preservation to some heavenly in-\
fluence.  was so entertained with viewing it on all sides, that . was wholly taken\
up with it; without reflecting, that as fortune favoured me, \'92otight to hasten to,\
other things. of consequence before it grew too late; yet  resolved, though \
stayed all night, not to leave the delicious place before  had exactly designed in\
my pocket-book every thing remarkable in it.  then went ten or twelve steps\
forwards from it, in order to have  full view of every thing thereabouts-; and\
sitting down, there opened  perfect ordonnance ; for, on seeing the trees-behind\
and on one side of the decumbent nymph, and, on the other side, an- easy afcent,\
with  small cottage in  low ground behind it,  could not but observe how ele-\
gant and becoming all the by-works kept themselves : the trees behind the tomb\
appeared.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
appeared dark, and thereby flung it off strong and brightly, the objects on each\
side appearing faint. Further on  discovered  small bridge; and, in the off-\
scape, some hills, &. all which  presently sketched and shaded; marking, for\
shortness of time, with letters or figures, the colours of the stones, and their\
tints, together with the lightnefs and darknefs of one object against another, and\
also against the sky.\
Having done with this, and walking further on the right hand,  came to \
very large and weighty bridge, of one arch, which had an exceeding great span\
ending, in the crown, in  point. This opening discovered an even plain, reach-\
ing almost to the horizon, with cottages and houses here and there, in  vil-\
lage-like manner: they were not meanly boarded and plaistered like ours, but\
regularly built with stone, though plain and without ornament. This bridge\
came from behind the trees on the right hand, and preserved  communication\
over the road, with an high and large rock on the sea-shore : it was possibly pla\'ac\
ced here for the sake of  dry passage to the other side in case of floods.\
Going under this arch,  found myself in the open field, near another sort of\
common buildings, which, at  distance,  could not perceive, on account of\
some intervening trees. These were herdsmens habitations, and built with mean\
materials, yet in  fine manner with respect to art. Some stood on ground-sills,\
others went up two or three steps, but the generality of them had their entrances\
even with the ground. Some had square doors, with circular windows over\
them; or else round frames, stuck instead of bass-relief, with rams, ox, or goats\
sculls, cut in white stone, according to the condition of the inhabitant. The\
lower windows were in form like the doors, and  diameter and half higher than\
wide ; or else, twice the breadth in height. The upper windows of such as had\
two stories or small garrets were mostly round. Some but single-storied, had\
compass-headed door-ways; and over them, long octangular windows; and if\
any smaller over them, they were square. The roofs were generally flattisn,\
and tiled for bringing off the water forwards. Some, in my opinion, much ex-\
celled others in grace ; having, over the door-ways, small balconies with compass-\
doors into them, and the windows on each side square and equally high; and\
over them round ones again. On each side of the aforesaid doors or entrances,\
were made, in the walls, square vent-holes, like niches contracting inwardly,\
and cross-barred with iron. The pediments were Doric or lonic, and of whitish\
stones; the lower story grev, and the rest free-stone; some were painted light-\
reddishi, others white free-stone or grey. Some doors had pillars or seats on each\
side. Some houses  saw also joined with walls, wherein were round holes.\
Here and there appeared large gates, as of neat-houses ; one was open, and\
seemed to be like  place covered in ; most of the windows had wooden shutters,\
which hinged on top, and kept open by sticks. Those houses, to secure them\
from the overslow of the river running in the neighbourhood, stood much above\
the level of the way. In fine,  omitted no remarkable relating to these coun-\
try peoples manner of dwelling.\
Somewhat further, and without this village,  came up to  round temple,\
having  lofty and elegant frontispiece. It waa ascended by  flight of ten or\
twelve\
\
\
\
\
\
\
twelve steps, with  free-stone ballustrade on each side, adorned with two sphinxes,\
facing each other, which were headed with caps, and bodied with houses or co-\
verings, after the antique manner. Landing on these steps  came up to  por-\
tico, fronted with eight columns, entablature and pediment of the lonic Order;\
the pediment had  fine intire bafs-relief, not much rising. The columns were\
continued round the temple, two and \'92two together, resting plinths and basements.\
Over their ornaments ran  gallerv, divided into parts by pedestals, whereon\
stood fine statues, one answering each pillar. Behind the ballustrade of the gal-\
lery ran up pilasters of the Corinthian Order, two and two together, and between\
them large windows, finely wrought according to that Order, as was the frize\
and cornice with grave foliage, modillions, &. On this arose an open dome,\
inclosed with  close ballustrade, covered in with  compass-roof, whereon was set\
 sun.\
Though  was not mych conversant with architecture, yet  perceived  very\
regular disposition in this building, which, among these adjoining, also orderly\
and beautiful, loftily and magnificently distinguished itself; appearing like  pre-\
cious stone set in enamel, though neither had other ornaments than simply those\
of the Order. The contiguous houses were low and extensive, with high chim-\
Behind these stood \
nies or towers, yielding, in my opinion,  fine decorum.\
close plantation of trees, mostly pines and cypresses, which added no small lustre\
to all this stone-work. On each side of the before-mentioned steps was  fountain\
or square bason, adorned with two pretty large lionesses, couching, on pedestals\
and spouting water.\
Thus  faricied  saw this glorious lofty, and especially painter-like sight: When\
we come to treat of architecture, and the choice of beauty\
within doors,  shall be\
at the trouble of stepping into this temple todescribe its inward wonders.\
Oh  How comfortable is the shore after  tempestl What  defference is\
there between  lovely sun-shine and  gloomy night  Between fresh and lively\
youth, and stale old age  Love solaces in gardens of pleasure and beautiful\
palaces ; but Envy lurks in desolate wildernesses, among the rubbisn of things\
which it defaces.  Abandon then, true and young artists  vour blind zeal ; beau-\
ty does not triumph, nor is here attended with what is deformed, spoiled, fouled,\
or broken, but takes up with things simple, or less beautiful without defects.\
Wherefore  think, that these two kinds of beauty differ as much as the verdant\
and delightful summer, and the dry and barren winter. Who, in building for\
pleasure, would make  patch ; Or, in making  garden, fill it with half-rotten\
trees ; He must be an unaccountable man who seeks delight in  desolate wil-\
derness. Is it not then evident, that those men have vicious tastes, who endea-\
vour to fetch beauty out of deformity ,  princefs sufficiently shines among her\
ladies by her state and costly attire, without setting off her lustre by  comparison\
with  swine-herd. When we meet with fine marble statues, are they not pre-\
served with care from ill usage, and the injuries of time ; though the latter spares\
For,\
nothing :\
Gutta cavat lapidem, non vi sed s\'e6pe cadendo.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
But probability ought to be observed in all things, that we need not inquire,\
what is modern or ancient, without being therefore broken or over foul ; since\
stones much handled will become sinooth, yet without damage : and, Why should\
 man be made  judge of what is beautiful and fine, who came from  foreign\
and wild country, and never saw beauty ?\
In oppofition to true beauty, let us now represent the other sort, and leave the\
point to the determination of the judicious.\
CHAP. XVII. Of Things Deformed. and Broken, falsely called\
Painter-like.\
HANGING the scene, we shall now consider what is also, though unjust-\
 ly, called painter-like ; and this in an imaginary way, like the pre-\
ceding.\
In walking,  saw  large gate, the door whereof was broken to pieces by an\
huge oak blown down against it. Creeping through it,  found myself as in \
strange country, so very rugged, desolate and rocky, without paths or roads, that\
 knew not where to walk ; the ground was no where so even as to reston. Here\
 saw the fragment of  column ; yet, lying so obliquely, that  could not sit on\
it : near it lay  piece of frize and cornice, with an end sticking up; and not\
much further was another stone, pretty level, but in  morass abounding with\
vermin.  nevertheless endeavoured to get upon this last stone; and then, with\
my cloak under me, laid myself down upon it. Which  had no sooner done,\
but somebody called,\'97-Hark ye ; go from it ; you lie in my way.\
, not\
dreaming any person could be here, suddenly looked back in surprize, and sawa\
young man sitting on an hillock, who, as he said, was drawing after the stone \
laid on. But, on recollection, he again called out, that, if  would stay there\
but half  quarter of an hour,  fhould do him  great favour. This  consented\
to, not without afking him, What he was going to do with such paltry fragments  answered, ee They are the finest things in the world to. introduce into our\
pieces. When  have such  fine parcel as that piece of  column, and this water\
before me, with the addition of  stump of  tree, and  small dark off-scape be-\
hind it, they, together, immediately compose  perfect ordonnance. Oh  you\
cannot imagine, how extraordinary and full of variety these objects are. This is\
the finest place on earth for  curious artist; all is painter-like; every thing lies\
so loose, pretty and wild, that few good masters would refuse coming hither to\
design these wonders ; and nothing but the present high wind hinders their being\
here now. \'92\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Upon this prattle,  viewed him from top to toe ; he sat all in an heap, with \
board in his lap, and  small ink-horn, and  magnifying, or spectacle-glafs in his\
hand : on his head he had  night-capalmost down to his eyes, with his left leg\
over his hat, poffibly to save it from the wind ;  small light coming from between\
the trees, shone on his lap. Poor man  thought , how feelingly you can talk\
of what is painter-like, and what satisfaction you must find in those things : if\
there be any more artists of your stamp, this must be the place to find them in.\
The truth is, the more  viewed him and heard his talk, the more  blamed my\
own judgment for not discovering such beauties as he did. Now, perceiving he\
had done,  went towards him to see his work ; but before  could come up to\
hiin he had packed up his awls, and was gone another way. Behind the trees,\
near the place where he had been sitting,  found another spark, who stood and\
drew after  small rivulet full of big and little clods of earth and pebbles, which\
he neatly designed on drawing paper, aud marked with their different colours.\
His whole port-folio was full of such-like painter-like trumpery ; such as muddy\
water, decayed and broken stones, pieces of wood, barren shrubs and bushies,\
rough grounds, toads, snakes, &.  afking him what branch he made his study)\
He answered, that be had not yet practised any ; but hoped, if he could get all\
those things, and perform them well, to become  good landscape-painter; ee For,\
said he, those objects are so uncommon, that the best masters give themselves the\
trouble to seek them. But, continued he,  cannot but wonder, that some search\
here and in other places, and can scarce find  piece to their go\'fbt, nay, often re-\
turn without doing any thing: when , on the contrary, discover  thousand\
things, both delightful and useful, whenever  cast my eyes. Were  to design\
every thing  meet with,  should have work for many years. Look there, said\
he, yonder is one of that tribe, prying about ;  have not yet seen him sit down\
any where   thought within myself, that it was strange, any man should run\
about in an error in so wild and desolate  place.\
Going on, Icame to \'e0 large and hideous rock, split through, and having one\
part hanging forward full of sharp angles, open hollows and cuts, over-run, here\
and there, with mofs and barren shrubs. On the right side was  deep morassy\
valley, going off very steep, and on the left appeared an inaccessible ruined\
building, like an heap of stone, swarming with adders, snakes and other vene-\
mous creatures. Behind me the ground was so uneven, full of ups and downs,\
and pathlefs, that  thought it impossible to get from the place. On the point of\
returning back, Isaw  man creep on all-four, out of one of the holes or hollows\
of the rock, and thereby cleared  passage for me. This man told me what won-\
derful things were to be seen on the other side ; but  was scarce crept half\
through, before  heard  frightful thunder-clap, which shook the wh\'f4le rock ;\
wherefore, redoubling my speed, and being got through,  found that the top of\
the rock was tumbled over the right side; which made me suddenly retire from\
thence, fearful that another part might fall apon me. What also raised my aver-\
fion, was the sight of  tomb crushied to pieces, and almost sunk into the ground,\
and near-it lying  piece of  large trunk of white marble.  could perceive by\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
the base, that it had been  term ; and being curious to know what might be\
hidden behind it, Igot on the tomb, and. saw through the trees, downwards, \
frightful pool.  therefore took to the left, where  thought the ground was\
more level : three or four stepsfrom thence,  sawa white paper fluttering before\
me along the ground, and after it ablue one, somewhat larger ; both which  ran\
after and took up. The blue paper appeared to be  drawing after the aforesaid\
tomb, when intire and standing, which made me judge that he must have been \
good master who had thus improved it in the draught. Possibly, thought , he\
is hereabouts. My conjecture was not groundless; for stepping  little further, \
found the poor wretch- lying under  large oak which had been thunder-struck ;\
the stem was cleft from top to bottom, and  large limb lay across the man\'92 bo-\
dy : his port-folio lay near him, emptied of all his drawings. This sight affright-\
ed me; and approaching near,  heard him sigh : he perceiving me, called out\
presently for help.  cleared the limb from off his body as well as  could,\
whereby, and after much pains, he disengaged himselfrom the leaves. He was,\
to my wonder, no where hurt, save  little in his left hand, yet of no consequence.\
Ireturned him his papers, and afked him, Whether he had seen the tomb in the\
condition wherein it was drawn ; He answered, He had. When, going to shew\
it to me, he in amazement started back on finding it in ruins. Oh  says he, does\
this lie also tumbled down, and my drawing scarce finishedl We then went\
together further up towards the left, and regained most of his papers. He\
told me, that his companion had left him, and run away on the approach\
of the storm ; which induced me to think, he was the person who\
came creeping on all-four through the aforesaid hole.\
On our coming down, we found many already drawing after the broken\
tree under which the good man had lain, with the utmost application.\
It was their unanimous opinion, never to have seen  tree more painter-\
He shewed them his drawing, and\
This talk surprised us both.\
like.\
said, That the tomb was the only object he found intire thereabouts ; and\
this being demolished, there was nothing left to please him. But this\
they scoffed at, and answered him, that such things. might easily be made\
out of one\'92 head, or found in prints.\
In short, it was great diversion to me to see one as hotly clambering up\
one place, and another creeping through some hole, for the sake of designing\
the rock and tomb tuinbled down, as if they were going after treasure.\
Taking leave of this person,  pursucd my way ; but was obliged, for\
the sake of  ruinous fountain, the vases, mouldings, and other ornaments\
whereof lay across and stopped the way, to take to the right hand. On\
the remains, adorned with bafs relief,  found not one intire figure, every\
thing being excessively mouldered, fouled, and over-run with wild plants and\
shrubs. Its bason lay awry, with  corner sunk into the ground, broken,.\
and full of earth or mud.  boy, who had been sitting there, came and\
afked me, Whether  could not tell him, which part of this heap of stones\
was the most painter-like , \'92te  have been long making  choice, says. he,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
of something good out of it; but the number confounds me; the parts are\
all so broken, that  cannot find so much as  whole hand or foot. \
have, shewing me his drawing, pitched upon this among them, with much\
ado.  believe verily, there was not such another undamaged bit in the\
whole ruin, though of little consequence. It was  plinth with the right\
leg and foot of Apollo, wanting the great toe. He said that he, with eight\
others, had been drawing every thing after the heap, except this fragment ;\
the foot of which was not, according to their fancies, broken enough. \
comforted him with saying, that he had picked out the very best thing of\
all, when he owned, that he had made the choice through the persuasion of\
another, who was now gone away, to whom the leg, by means of the sandal\
and straps, was not unknown. This boy,  thought, ought to be set in \
right way; and his simplicity pleased me.\
Turning then to the right hand, as  have said,  came into  dismal\
place, which, by the largeness of the pavement, and arch work supported\
by great pillars, seemed formerly to have been  palace.\
It was here so lonesome and gastly, that  was seized with  cold swcat ;\
wherefore  mended my pace, in order to get out of it; and, being got to\
the other side, and ten or twelve paces from it,  found myself again at\
the lake before-mentioned ; near which lay  shattered tomb, with the corpse\
half tumbled out. The head and one arm rested on  large root of  tree\
lying near it; the lid was almost slid off, and just on the totter, and \
snake, from underneath, was creeping into the tomb.  sight frightful\
enough.\
The sun, now on the point of setting, darted his refulgent rays between\
some heavy clouds ; the sky was moreover dark blue, and on the horizon\
yellowishi striped; which, along through the trees, strongly glittered in my\
eyes.  saw  grave man carefully designing this sky in colours. In pas-\
sing by,  said to him, ee Sir, you have met with  fine sight; that is \

at the hazard of their healths and lives; though not able to chuse out\
of them the most beautiful, for want of judgment to know what is\
good, and, by some additions, to supply defects. These things are the\

CHAP.  Of Portraits in general.\
SINCE we meet with no presidence in the art, nor pretend to insist\
on ceremonies, we shall treat of things as they occur to -us, and as :\
\
clearly and profitably as possible.\
But first, give me leave to say, that  have often wondered how any man\
can, prefer slavery to liberty, and, by departing from the essence of the art,-\
subject\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Of Portraiture.\
subject himself to all the defects of nature.  speak of such great masters as\
Van Dik, Lely, lan Loo, the old and young Bakker, and others, who though pos-\
sessed of great talents in the art, postponed what is noble and beautiful, for what\
is nore ordinary and common. The truth is, and we have seen, that sooner by\
this means than others, men have obtained the honour of gold medals and chains,\
&. Nay, the liberty of prescribing laws to princes ; staring them in the face,\
drawing their pictures, and many other privileges, whereby they have acquired\
great riches. What an unheard-of reward did not Apelles receive, when Alexan-\
der gave him his dear Campaspe, in order to save the life of that great artist, by\
satisfvinghis love, inslamed by drawing the picture of that beauty  When \
consider these things,  am surprised, that all painters do not give in wholy to\
pertraiture ; since now--days money is preferred to learning, lucre to virtue, and\
honours dispensed to men in proportion to their riches. But, leaving this sub-\
ject, we will proceed thoroughly to consider every thing relating to that branch\
of the art.\
As in music and singing  good ear is requisite, so in portraiture it is impossible\
to excel without  good eyc ; such an one,  mean, as is governed by sedate and\
sober sensation, and not by self-love or passion. Next is required  regular design,\
containing an exact proportion or division of the parts, not only of the face, but\
of the whole body, that the sitter may be known by his picture, which may be\
most agreeably done by mixing the fafhion with what is painter-like; as the great\
Lely did, and which is called the painter-like or antique manner, but by the ig-\
norant commonality, the Roman manner.\
Next, we must be thoroughly judicious in the graceful choice of the light, and\
the place where the person is to sit, that the face may appear to the best advan-\
tage-; and then the body is to be disposed to the most natural and becoming\
posture.\
The next business, and which gives it the greatest lustre, is, the colouring, that\
each person and his parts may have their proper colour, and such as appears in\
his daily converse ; not such as proceeds from extraordinary emotions. Let the\
artist beware of inelining to any particular manner, like some, whose work is\
thereby better known to be theirs, than the friends of the sitter know the picture\
to be his.\
As for the choice of light, in order to apply it most advantageously for the be\'ac\
nefit of either sex, it is certainly  matter of great moment; since the fair sex\
commonly partake of more delicacy and grace than men, so they must have \
light as beautiful and agreeable as their persons.\
But ere we proceed further, it will not be improper to look into the origin of\
portraits, in order thereby to shew-the aim of those who cause themselves to be\
drawn, and the profits which masters get thereby.\
The ancients used to cause those, from whom the Common-wealt had received\
extraordinary benefits, either in war or civil affairs, or for imminence in religion,\
to be represented in marble or metal, or in  picture, that the sight of them, by\
those honours, might be  spur to posterity to emulate the same virtues. This\
honour\
\
\
\
\
\
\
honour was first begun with their Deities ; afterwards it was paid to heroes, and\
of consequence to philosophers, orators, religious men, and others, not only to\
But now\
perpetuate their virtues, but also to embalm their names and memories.\
it goes further ;  person of any condition whatsoever, have he but as much mo-\
ney as the painter afks, must sit for his picture : this is  great abuse, and sprung\
from as laudable  cause.\
In noblemen indeed it is  very commendable custom; because, being descend-\
ed from great families, the lustre of these ought to shine, to encourage their suc-\
cessors to keep up their glory, and to prevent sullying it by unworthy actions.\
As for \'e0 general, or admiral, who has died in the bed of honour, gratitude, \
think, obliges us to raise  monument to his glory, and to animate brave souls\
in future times, to immitate his virtue. But what is this to the vulgar ; pride on-\
ly spurs them to it. The rich do it that their children may boast of it; the\
master of  numerous family does it, that the world may know he is  father;\
he who has fired  magazine of the enemy must be drawn, with this great ac-\
tion, though perhaps tnere was no body to hinder him. Has  citizen\'92 wife but\
an only babe, he is drawn at half  year old ; at ten years old he sits again,\
and, for the last time, in his twenty-fifth year, in order to shew her tender folly ;\
and then she stands wondering how  man can so alter in that time. Is not this\
 weighty reason;  reproveable custom, if painters did not gain by it. But\
again, portraits are allowable, when  lover is absent from his mistress, that they\
may send each other their pictures, to cherisn and increase their loves ;  man\
and wife so parted may do the same.\
But to return to the original matter;  must warn the artists not to give in too\
much to what is common; or humour ignorant people so much, as not to re-\
serve to themselves some liberty of doing what they think proper for the sake of\
reputation : surely this cannot be strange advice; for  master who prefers money\
before art has no more dangerous  rock to split on, since the ignorant multi\'ac\
tude usually insist to be drawn according to their own whims. One says \'92to \'e0\
good master,\'97te Draw me thus, or thus; let me have one hand on my breast,\
and the other on  table;\'92 another must have  flower in his hand, or  flower-\
pot must be by him; another must have  dog, or other creature, in his lap;\
another will have his face turned this or that way ; and some who would be drawn\
in the Roman manner, must be set off by  globe or clock on  table, whether\
such ornaments be proper or not. On mentioning the Roman manner,  find that\
it signifies  loose airy undress, somewhat savouring of the mode, but in no wise\
agreeing with the ancient Roman habit.\
But many other inconveniences attend portraiture ; as first, the ignorance of\
those who sit; for some of them, having no right notion of their own mein and\
shape, often refer the judgment of  fine portrait to the eye of achild, or servant;\
and what they say, Monsieur and Madam believe, either to its praise, or dis-\
commendation.\
 second inconveniency arises from  wedded inclination which any one has to\
fuch and such objects; judging, as they like or dislike, not only of pictures, but\
even the life itself ; for though they may be afraid to pass sentence on \'e0 fine\
history\
\
\
\
\
\
\
hiftory or landscape, yet  portrait must not escape them, as thinking it within the\
reach of their capacities.\
Thirdly, we nnd many artists never pleased with other mens works, but being\
full of themselves despise every thing they see, though as good as their own; and\
this perhaps on no better bottom than  pique against the artist\'92 conversation,\
talk, dress, or money ; or else because of his greater fame: and yet if ten per-\
sons happen to applaud  fine picture of this eye-sore master, they will at that\
juncture, chime in with them, to sereen their prejudice. And on the contrary,\
if but  single person afterwards find fault, they immediately turn the tables against\
ten others. Again, if apiece of their friend be brought on the carpet, though\
never so faulty, they will applaud and justify it at any rate, though against their\
own convictions of conscience. But this partial and prejudiced humour is most\
prevailent in those who know least.\
 fourth set of men are those, who, being always of an unealy temper, dislike\
their own, but applaud every thing other men do: these indeed are not so noxious\
as the former, because they only hurt themselves, whereas the others hurt every\
body.\
Fifthly, there are  prejudiced set of men who find no taste but in easv and-\
grave airs and postures; others in stirring and hurrying ones ; others in violent:\
ones : some think that womens draperies ought to be loose and soft; others will\
have them of velvet or fattin, or else party-coloured : this thinks that  dark or\
brown ground beft sets off  figure ; anether chuses  landscape, or green curtain,\
right or wrong. Are the- colours beautifully chosen, the picture smells of them;\
are they broken, they seem muddy and foui. How can  portait please so many\
opinions ? It is not like an history full of figures, where we can introduce va-\
riety of sedate and stirring action, more or less beautiful colouring, loose or set\
draperies, dark or light grounds, &. Because this is but  single figure.\
Our businefs then, must be to find  way between soylla and charybdis, to enable\
the artist to paint  good portrait ; for he who makes due reffexion on every thing,\
can prepare himself to overcome the aforesaid difficulties.\
CHAP. II. Of the Defects in the Face and other Parts.\
HE defects, which are seen in nature, or in simple life, are three-\
fold.\
 Natural ones.\
 Accidental ones.\
 Useful ones.\
The natural ones are,  wry face, fquint eyes, wry mouth, nose, &.\
The accidental ones are, loss of an eye,  cut on the cheek or other part of the\
face; pits of the small pox, and the like.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The\'92usual ones are, those. habitsito-which we aecustom gurselves from- our in\'ac\
faney ;. to wit, contraction of the eyes and. mouth, or closing, or gaping of the\
latter, or drawing. it in. somewhat to this or that side, upwards or down-\
wards, &.\
As for-otherbodily infirmities; how many have wry necks, hunch backs, bandy\
legs, withered or short arms, or one shorter than the other ; dead or lame hands\
or fingers ? Among these, some are unavoidable, and others may be either left\
out; or handsomely hidden. The necessary ones ought to be secn, because they\
help the likeness; such as  wry face, squint eyes, low forehead, thinnefs and\
fatness,  wry neck, too short or too long  nose, wrinkles between the eyes,-\
ruddiness onpaleness of the cheeks, or lips, pimples or warts about the mouth,\
and such like: among those which may be hidden or left out,  count  blind\
eye,  wound, wen, mole, pits of small pox, too many pimples, &.  red, blue,\
oghairy spot; as also habital usages; such as- hanging lips, pinchings or draw-\
ingsof the-mouth and eyes.\
Ithink also, that the common and useful dress of  person is  great addition\
te-likenefs ; for no sooner is the dress altered, but the look does the same, and\
shews itselfeither more or lefs pleasing and agreeable ; and thereby the person be-\
comes more tor lefs known : to obviate which,  advise the artist above all things:\
to get first  true likeness of the face, and paint it. to the sitter\'92 satisfaction; and\
then he may freely manage all the rest as he thinks fit, and thereby get honour\
and commendation ; since the life itself in such  dress, cannot any more alter.\
The painter should likewise discover and- know, as much as possible; the nature\
and temper of the person sitting, and in what circumstances lies his favourite plea-\
sure ; that he may, when sitting, be entertained with talk pleasing to him, and\
his air thereby kept steady and serene, and his posture natural and easy; avoiding\
every thing tending towards sorrow or frightful relations ; for these are apt to ruffle\
the mind, and so to discompose the face, that it cannot easily be got right again :\
but if the sitter himself do by his talk, difcover his own bent, the painter ought\
to humour it to the last, whether if-be jocose or moderate, without exaggeration-\
or diminution ; yet with such  variety, as not to prove tiresome, and make the\
face alter.\
He who cannot thus-manage and furnish outa discourse, will be the longer ere\
he hit the likeness. Some will even sit three or four times, and each time with -\
different air; and were they to sit ten times;  fancy something new would still\
offer.\
Another hindrance may be, that painting-rooms are often hung with such sinutty\
But\
pictures as frequently put virgins to the bluss, or alter their countenances.\
though for improvement, fine pictures are necessary to be always in view, yet in \
paintingeroom, there ought not to hang the wanton picture of Mars and Venus\
casched by Vukan; or Dina\'92:bathing,, though done by Van Dyk, or Joseph and-\
Potiphar\'92 wife ; for; though these may hang in  corner, yet when the eye hag\
once catched them, it. will retain them; because theirideas make continal iin-\
preffions on ithe mind; even against its will; and therefore: the bare remembrance\
of such things must put  young and chaste virgin to the blush. Must it aot create\
 longing\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
 longing, to see  picture of two beggar-boys fall greedily on ripe fruit, the one\
eagerly biting  piece of fresh melon, and the other  bunch of grapes, with the\
juice falling down his chin on his naked breast? The room then should be hung\
with every thing modest, as fine landscapes and flower-pieces, which will amuse\
the sight without disturbing or tireing the mind, or altering the countenance ;\
fine portraits will also animate \'e0 sitter to keep him serene, and make him emu-\
lous of their airs :  large looking-glais may be likewise of service, if so hung that\
the sitter can see himself in it, for, thereby discovering any disagreeableness in his\
look, he will correct himself, in order to have as good an air as he desires; and by\
such methods as these  painter may become great.\
We will now proceed to consider how many mistakes some painters commit in\
relation to the first observation of natural defects; these endeavour to their utmost\
power, to express punctually the deformities and defects of  face, without\
scruple, to wit,  blind or squint eye, or the like, though they know that it is an\
enemy to grace, and on no other ground than  false belief that it creates  greater\
likeness. But who loves to be reproached with his defects, when they can be art-\
What would become of grace, which teaches, that  painter-\
fully hidden ;\
should make as beautiful  choice as possible ; which these blemisnes obscure. \
think therefore, that we cannot lay too great  strefs on what concerns the make,\
position and turn of  face, that the eye be not offended with blemisn, or deformi-\
ty, or the posture look disagreeable.\
How monstrous is the picture of  certain admiral, who seems to stab himself\
with his staff of command, and has  defective eye turned directly to the light; be-\
cause, according to the saying, he is best known by it. Would not -more pro-\
file view have suited him better, or to have flung the side with the blind eye into\
fhade ; Would it not be ridiculous to paint the Duke of Luxemburgh in profile, to\
represent him the better, and that his hunch-back might be the more vifible, for\
no other reason, than that most people knew he had one )\
Nature abhors deformity, and we cannot behold it without aversion, and \
quick turn of the eye from it :  squint-eyed person cannot see himself in the glass\
without inward trouble ; especially one of the fair sex, who; in other respects,\
tolerably handsome, cannot bear to see an instance of her deformity in another,\
but will basfifully look off or down to the ground. How much worie then must-\
it look in  picture ; The life may be sometimes seen on an handsome side; which\
in an ill chosen picture we can never expect : whence it is natural for one who has\
 blemish or defect in an eye or cheek, always to turn the best side to. the light-\
In short, we do not desire to do any thing, walk, stand; fit, talk, but with  be-\
coming air. Have we fore eyes, we hide them under our hats ; or if  lame hip,\
we endeavour to walk briskly ; have we fome humour or pimples in  cheek, we\
either hide them with  patch, or paint the other side like it; have we bad teeth,\
we keep the mouth shut ; ora lame hand, and hide it not under our coats, or in\
our pockets. If nature acts so, how can such defects please in  picture ; Such \
flattery then as is agreeable to art, is not only aflowable, but commendable; es-\
pecially when the sitter is so disposed in posture, that the painter himfelf cannot\
perceive it.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Alke any one wha wears  piece of black silk over an hollow eye whether he de-\
fires to be draun from that fide ;  believe nots Aperson with  wooden leg cares-\
not that the deformity should appear in  picture : such an one ought to be drawn\
in half length only : but if the heroe insist upon the introducing such  leg, on \
supposition that is an honour to have lost  limb in his country' service, the\
painter must then comply with his defires; or else contrive it lying on  table\
covered with red velvet : if he desire it after the antique manner, it must be con-\
trived in  bas relief, wherein the occasion of it may be represented ; or it may\
hang near him on  wall, with its buckles and straps, as is done in hunting equi\'ac\
pages ; or else it may be placed among the ornaments of architecture, to be more\
in view. But what praise or advantage will an artist get by this, when  judicious\
master sees the picture ; He may perhaps plead in excuse, that the sitter would\
have it fo. This indeed  cannot argue against, because we usually say to whom\
we employ, Do as  would have you, right or wrong. We have an instance of \
gentleman, who being drawn in little, and comparing the smallness of the eyes\
with his own, afked the painter, Whether he had such ; However, in compli-\
ance, and for his pleasure, he desired that one eye at least might be as big as his\
own; the other to remain as it was.  sad case   miserable subjection  for\
though we cannot compell others to be of our opinions, yet  pity those who must\
fubmit to incongruities. But, not to dishearten the artist too much, we will\
proceed to,\
CHAP. III. The Observables in  Portrait,\
particularly that of-\
 Woman.\
ELF-CONCEIT and self-love seem nathral to all, but especially to the female\
sex ; who, whether their pictures are drawn on their own accounts, or thro\'92\
\
the desire of others, imagine they deserve such homage; nor stops it here, for\
although they may possess  tolerable share of beauty, yet that is not satisfactory\
enough; they must be flattered, and their pictures painted in the most beautiful\
light; and unhappy is the painter who abates but half  drachm of such \
beauty.\
For these reasons the master is-obliged to have  principal regard to light and\
colour; but to the light chiefly, since it is well known that nothing gives greater\
offence to ignorant people than shades, and still more, when they are strong and\
broad : they believe they speak to the purpose in objecting, Well, how can it be\
possible that my neck and cheek should have such large shades, when Idaily con-\
sult my glass, and find my skin all of  colour and white , And \'92then the painter\
is blamed. But are not such reasons weak and absurd ; Since, ifa man, how\
tenacious soever, meet another, who by long. absence and alteration of dress, is,\
got out of his memory, he will naturally turn him to-the light, in order to know\
him and his features. This conduct has been wonderfully observed by Barocci in-\
his\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
his picture- of Mary paying  visit t Elizabrth twhen big with-child; in-which, by\
his method-of placing the figures, and the ataegtion of the faces, we seem: tot\
hear them. talk, looking earnestly at each other.\
 think those masters have made the best choice who have chosen  front-lighto,\
and thereby kept.their colours most natural and beautiful ; since thig-light is,cer-\
tainly most advantageous, whether the picture hang-against  wall, or where-else.\
But here seems, to-arise .difficulty, since we formerly said, that we ought. to fix,\
 certain place, and the, point of sight and distance, and to. dispose the light so\
as it can fall on that place ; to-which the answer is easy ; porfraits have,no fixed\
place, as we shall further shew in another chapter, as also how far and-on: what.\
occasions we must- confine ourselves to that rule.\
The best way to settle this- point is, to follow those who have chosen their-light:\
almost fronting, and, as before said, such  colouring as naturally appears to the:\
eye, besides  good choice: since . think the case of placing  portrait te be-the-\
same as that of curious china, which, whether it stand high or low, shews- itself\
every where beautiful. My reason for this is, that objects, which have such .\
front-light, have an exceeding fine effect, and great relief, when, they come\
against  dark ground; and still finer when the light falls on, them somewhat\
from on high, if tha-sitter. and some accidents do not hinder it; in whigh case,\
reason and our eye must best-direct us. Viewjbut this fineness in asposture painted\
leaning over an hatch, or out at window, and what great decorum the-\
touches and shades about the most relieved parts cause in such an object; as\
Leonardo da Vinci has well observed.\
Of the accidents which  just now spoke off,  shall mention two or three ; some\
persons may be. toa long and sharp-mosed, or too hollowreyed; for such,  low\
light is most proper; but where it is otherwise, an high light : in this manner \
judicious master ought to help the defects of \'92nature, without adding to, or ta-\
king any thing from them : yet, to. the sorrowof impartial masters, the contraty.\
is too much seen ; for; as.  have said, that history-painters chuse and follow what\
they have the greatest inclination for, so it is with many portrait-painters, their\
work is better known by their particular manner than the sitter by his picture.\
Permit me here to make  comparison between those two great masters, Titian\
and Van Dyk, with respect, to the judgment  have heard made on their works.\
Of the latter it is said, that in the delign, grace, and choice of  portrait-figure,\
he was the most skilful; nevertheless  have seen many of Titian\'92 (who, in most-\
mens opinions, has the greater reputation), which scemed to me incomparable,\
though less agrecable: here my position, about the particular choice of masters,\
takes effect again; because  think, that the defect in agreeableness is peculiar to,\
Titian\'92 country, and limits his choice, and therefore he is the lefs culpabl\'e9;\
when, on the contrary, our region prefers what is gay and elegant before the.\
majestic. and grave; and likeness is the chief object both of the sitter, and the.\
artist, every thing else being looked on as by-works and ornament :  poor judg-\
ment methinks of people of sense  For if  portrait have not, besides likeness, an\
agrceable disposition, the little knowledge of. the master will presently, appear.\
It is true, that we meet with many odd faces in the life, especially among vul-\
gar\
\
\
\
\
\
\
gar and clovnisn people, yet  fay that, be they ever so rude, agrecableness\
should be observed in their pictures. By agreeableness  understand the dispo-\
fition of  posture in general ; as when the face has an advantageous turn more or\
lefs totthe light, up or down, in order to create handsome shades, and to shun\
unbecoming ones; for every face requires  particular observation ; one, an high\
light, another,  low one; this  side-light; that, an almost fronting one :\
\
speak not yet of many other requifites, such as the sway of the neck, shoulders\
or breaft; or of  proper back-ground; all which considerations are essential to \
fine portraft, as well in refpect tothe naturaluess and colour, \'e0s to the motion :\
but ef the light and back-grounds we shall say more in the next chapter, and\
now return to our comparifon. Some think that Van Dyk\'92 paintings are but wa-\
ter-colours, compared with Titian\'92, whose pictures have so much force in colour-\
ing, fights and fhades, that those of the other cannot stand in competition with\
them, nay, that his colouring is inimitable, and whereby that of Van Dyk ap-\
pears faint and weak :  ridiculous opinion indeed  However, that Van Dyk and\
Jitian differ much in colouring,  allow; but neverthelefs think, that we need\
not run to the Italians to prove it, since, if the stress lay in strong colouring on-\
ly, Rembrant need not give way to Trtian. But whence arises the mistake; Most\
men chime in with thofe simple judges who approve no histories, landscapes, or\
portraits, that are not painted in the Jralian manner. My opinion is, that the\
whole of the matter l\'efes more in the difference of climates than in the handlings\
of the masters; for let an Englifhman\'92 picture. hang near an stalian\'92, both\
handled with equal fkill, and each represented according to his hue and nature,\
there will appear  great difference between them; the sweetning softness of the\
Englihman will charm as much on onc hand, as the strong and glowing colout\
of the Italian on the other. On which of these two pictures has the master be-\
stowed the most pains , Are not both praise-worthy, as having each expressed the\
character natural to his figure ?\
But not to go abroad for comparisons, with respect to particular climes, our\
own Netherland affords differences enough : two brothers, of the same parents are\
born in the same town and. hour; one of them is brought up to the sword, and\
endures all the fatigues of war, and the incommodities of hailx snow, wind, rain,\
sun, smoak of salt-petre, &. whereby his complexion is altered, and becomes\
swarthy. The other brother, contrarily, is educated in saloons, sine apartments\
and tender conversations, by which means time cannot so much affect him; each\
sits for his picture, to \'e0 feparate and good master: now these two pictur\'e9s being\
brought together, Will the painter be censured for the difference of tints and fea-\
tures; or will it be objected, that nature has not been rightly followed; or that\
the pictures are not like; An impartial judge will determine that both are good\
and natural, and that each master has duly mixed art with nature.\
 have discovered  great oversight in some artists, which is, that when the\
face was finished, they had no further regard to the life, but chose  posture, at\
pleafure, out of drawings or prints, without considering whether it suited the per-\
son, and whether the dress was proper to the condition and countenance of the\
sitter; nay, whether the head matched the hody : certainly  great heedlessness :\
For-\
\
\
\
\
\
\
For if  body must be added, what more proper than the life itself, And though\
Many disre-\
the layman be good, and helpful, yet it is not equal to the life.\
gard this, thinking they have done enough in hitting the face : but all the while\
they are preposterousty joining an airy drapery to  sedate and grave head, and \
grave and stiff dress to  merry face. But further, the hands are entirely neglect-\
ed ; if  pair of fine ones can be got of some other master, these are made use of,\
without regard to the life, which may perhaps have short, thick and coarse\
hands. How can these things agree ; Is it not almost the same as to dress Flora\
\'97We have the\
with the drapery of Vesta, and Vesta with Flora\'92, Artists say,\
prints of Van Dyk, Lely, Kneller, and others, for fine examples; and as Lely has\
followed Van Dyk in graceful action and draperies, so we have  liberty to immitate\
him and others.  which  willingly agree ; but then we ought to do it on\
the same footing as he did ; in his postures he has not merely, and without alte-\
ration followed Van Dyk, and still less without judgment ; as may be seen in his\
\
of .\
two celebrated pictures of Nell Gzuynn and the -\
: the one, \
wanton and buxom lady, he has so represented; and the other, being  widow,\
and more sedate, appears more modest.\
By this rule we must walk in the use of those great masters; but if things be\
done without making distinction of persons, and their conditions, the artist will\
work to his dishonour. He who steals thus, may indeed call'the work his own,\
without reproach; none will object, as Michael Angelo did once to  painter who\
practised it to excess :\
-What will become of your pictures at Doomsaay, when the\
parts shall return to their ozen wholes, seeing your works are made up of stolen pieces \'e0\
Moreover, in this theft, we ought well to observe, how masters best applied\
every thing, with respect to youth and age, as well in postures as draperies and\
by-ornaments ; what suits an alderman or heroe;  merchant or citizen; noble-\
man or plebean : hereby we shall discover the aims of the great masters in thus\
managing these particulars, and learn to immitate their beauties in  sweet and\
agreeable manner.\
CHAP. IV. Of the Choice of Lights, Draperies, and Grounds in \
Portrait--and of the Point of Sight.\
 the preceding chapter we have laid down as  rule, that  front-light is\
the best to be chosen, and the most beautiful, especially in the fair sex; and\
 think it the more necessary when the face itself is also chosen in front, because\
then the greatest force will fall directly upon the most rising, or relieved parts ;\
but  shall now subjoin, that since the life, however we dispose it, either from or\
near the light, fronting or in profile, yet supports itself, though the light be not\
advantageously chosen, which  portrait cannot do ; we therefore must needs, in\
order to make it appear as it ought to be, accommodate the light to the dispo\'ac\
sition of the face ; for instance, when the face turns somewhat sideways, the light\
must be adapted to it; when it is quite in profile,  side-light will be best, be-\
cause\
\
\
\
\
\
\
cause then  great mafs of light remains together, to wit, in the forehead, nose\
and cheeks, which are not broken by any ground-shade, but united by the\
roundness; which shews us how to represent rising nature, and causes  becoming\
relief.\
We see that many, without difference, be the figure in full proportion, or in\
little, give the touches under the nose so black and dark, that it seems as if \
black beetle were proceeding thence ; whereas it is certain, and nature teaches it,\
that when the light falls strong on the nose, the nostrils and their ground-shades\
can never appear so black ; and yet some think they have done great feats in using\
force and strength, and will do it even in  fair and tender face, and no bigger\
than the palm of the hand, although the deepest black should not have force\
enough to shade the other objects of \'e0 darker colour, such as hair,  cloak or\
other garment; by which sort of management the face seems to jump out of the\
frame, and to desert the wig, hair, and garment. We must not so understand,\
when we teach that the face must have the main light; we mean only, that all\
ought to keep due order, that it may look natural. Each colour of the by-\
work ought, according to its lightness or darkness, to have its moderate shade\
and dark touches, as the matter it consists of is either solid or thin and transpa\'ac\
rent; and in proportion as the objects lessen, so must the force of their colours\
diminish, as shall be further illustrated in-the following chapter, to which for\
brevity we refer. We see an excellent example of this management in the fa-\
mous Netscher\'92 artful portraits, wherein he has judicioussy handled the darkest\
shades, and main-light-touches, according to the natural force of the colour.\
For the better understanding of further observables,  have found it proper to\
mention some other particulars concerning the disposition of lights, according to\
occasion, consisting in light against dark, and the contrary; and though every\
thing thereby becomes relieved, and is set off, yet that is not sufficient; for the\
placing of colours against each other on suitable grounds, and  contrast in the\
objects, whether moveable or immoveable, is of great consequence and decorum :\
and although we have handled these things at large in the Book of Colouring, yet\
we find it necessary to recapitulate them here, with respect to portraits, and the\
retiring grounds or vistos behind them.\
Observe then, whether  fair and beautiful face will become  light grey, or\
lightifh blue ground; and whether  warm complexion and strong colouring,\
against  glowing or yellowisn ground, will please the eye.  speak of the face,\
not the draperies, though both together make  portrait. But let the fair\
and beautiful face of  woman be placed against  warm ground, and then the\
light parts will not only be thereby flung off, and look more agreeable, but the\
shades will also be softened, and appear more tender; for it is unnatural to force\
 fair and tender virgin, who shews little or no motion, out of her seeming apart-\
ment-; as some by their glowing shades and reflexions have endeavoured to do;\
whereby their faces, on the shaded side, look as if  lighted candle stood behind\
them, which penetrated their skin : this is as unnatural in the open air, as with-\
in doors.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
This example of  woman is enough to prove the contrary conduct with re-\
spect to  man\'92 face, according to the aforesaid rules touching the disposition\
and placing of colours on suitable grounds; namely, that the strong ought to be\
painted against the weak, and the weak against the glowing and strong ; wherein\
is also comprehended light against dark, and dark against light.\
Whence it is evident, that back-grounds contribute very much to the charm-\
ing grace of objects; nay,  dare say, that the decorum mostly depends there-\
on : and though many imagine, that  dark or black ground always becomes \
portrait, yet it is no rule, since, as before has been said, each individual colour\
of the objects requires  particular back-ground : besides, if such things were to\
be taken for rules, the art would smell too much of an handicraft ; for  dark\
colour against  dark ground can have no good effect, and that of  white or pale\
against it will be too hard ; therefore  medium must be judicioussy observed in\
both, that one colour may suit with the other. In the draperies the conduct is\
the same; one person best becomes light, and another dark cloaths ; blue suits\
one, and red, yellow, or green, &. another: the artist must then take care not\
to force Nature, but help her as much as posfible, and represent her always most\
beautiful.\
If any one would know my reason for thinking that many errors arise in this\
part of the art, it is, that the colours of the naked receive more or less, or too\
much force by the by-colours of grounds and back-ornaments : It fares with\
them as it is said of the camelion, who changes his colour as often as he is pla\'ac\
ced by different colours; though this is occasioned by his elegant and shining\
scales, when, contrarily, the human skin is dull and not shining. However we\
shall find, that he who paints  portrait twice, and each time on  contrary\
ground, yet with the same temperament of colours, will perceive  very great,\
nay, incredible difference : as . have on several occasions experimented in the\
life ; to wit, that when some virgins were in  room hung with yellow, they look-\
ed sickly and grey, notwithstanding their fresh colour ; but, contrarily, being in\
 room hung with violet, their colours shewed themselves very beautiful ; whence\
it appears, that the alterations are oftentimes occasioned by the adjacent objects.\
Let him who doubts this make trial of it in  portrait, by laying  ground with\
water-colours on paper, and after the face is cut out, placing it against the pic-\
ture instead of  back-ground. But  think there is  convenient way of pre-\
venting the aforesaid alteration; namely, by fixing against the wall, behind the\
sitter,  garment, cloth, or something else of the same colour, or near it, which\
we chuse for our back-ground: thus we may be sure of hitting the right colour,\
and make the painting look agreeable.\
In order to represent an extensive back-ground, and chiesly in  small picture,\
be it an apartment or landscape, some shadiness should be contrived between the\
figure and the distance, as  column, curtain, body of  tree, vase, &. These\
objects being in shade, or of  dark colour, the lights falling on the off-works\
will not prejudice either the face or drapery, though both be light; but, on the\
contrary, the figure, as receiving the foremost and greatest light, will thereby be\
relieved, and look more agreeable.\

\
As for the draperies, fince they confift of different and various colours, each\
of  particular nature, and littie agreeing with the colour of the face, they also\
require each \'e0 particular ground, beft suiting and uniting with it; to the end\
that, though differing among themselves, they may have  perfect harmony with\
each other, so that the eye be not taken alone with the face, or the draperies, or-\
naments or by-works; but, by this sweet conjunction, insenfibly, conducted all\
over the picture.\
It will not be improper to treat also about easiness and sedateness in posture,\
opposed to stir and bustle, and the contrary : namely, that the picture of \
gentlewoman of repute, who, in  grave and sedate manner turns towards that of\
her husband hanging near it, gets  great decorum by moving and stirring hind-\
works, whether by means of waving trees or crossing architecture of ftone, or\
wood, or any thing else that the master thinks will best contrast, or oppose the\
sedate posture of his principal figure. And because these are things of conse-\
quence, and may not be plainly apprehended by every one,  shall explain my-\
felf by examples in plate LVII. touching the elegance and harmony of back-\
grounds with the figures.\
In No.   reprefent  beautiful face against the light of the ground ; and\
the drapery, which is white, or of light colouring, against the dark of it; these\
oppofitions thus meeting, produce  sweet mixture above, and below an agreeable\
relief or rising of the under part of the body ; whereas, were it otherwise, the\
face, as but  small part of the body, would look too fharp and disagreeable,\
and the under part of the body would have no force.\
In No.  being the portrait of  man of  more warm and swarthy complexion,\
we see the reverse of the former, because his colour, and that of his dress, are\
of  different nature ;, yet the ground is very ornamental, and each sets off the\
No.  shews  man with  drunken face of red, purple and violet, and some-\
what brown and darkisn; which is set off by  white marble or light stone ground,\
and gives it  fine air.\
In No.  is an example of the contrast in off-works with the drapery of the\
figure ; shewing the opposition of moveable objects with fixed ones ; for herein\
are seen rounding and crossing folds against straight and parallel off-works. And,\
In No.  appears the reverse ; where the folds hang straight and mostly dovn-\
wards, and the off-works crofs them.\
No.  gives us an example of the opposing action and posture of bodies in two\
fellow-portraits ; for the man; being on the woman\'92 right side, turns his face\
sideways towards her; his body is fronting, receiving the light from the right\
side.\
In Ne.  we see the contrary in the woman\'92 posture ; her face is fore-right,\
and her body sways sideways towards the man; she also is lighted from the right\
side.\
The figures numbered  and  represent also, yet in  different manner, the\
contrast in the motion; for the woman, standing on the right side of the man,\
has\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
has  sedate motion, and set and hanging shoulders: but the man, contrarily, is\
in active motion. And,\
No.  shews  proper method to exhibit  great extent, or seemingly such, in\
 small piece ; for the figure stands in  strong light; the by-ornaments, viz.\
curtain, vase, pillar and walling, are in shade; and the off-scape or hind-work is-\
light again, but somewhat broke by reason of its distance.\
To conclude this chapter, Ishall say something of the placing of portraits ;\
and of their point of sight.\
As to the former, it is certain that when we see any painted figure, or object in-\
 place where the life can be expected, as standing on the ground, leaning over\
 balcony or ballustrade, or out at window, &. it deceives the eye, and by being\
seen unawares, causes sometimes  pleasing mistake ; as it frightens and surprises\
others, when they meet with it unexpectedly at such places as aforesaid, and\
where there is  likelihood for it. If we are thus misled by  representation of\
nature, how great must the master be who did it  The knowing esteem him, ig-\
norants cry him up: if this be the case, we ought to endeavour to follow nature\
and likelihood, and principally to observe the rules of perspective ; for who can-\
doubt, that  standing, sitting, or moving figure, artfully painted, and placed as,\
aforesaid, will not have the same effect as the life itself ?\
Hence it follows, that low horizons, or points of sights, are the best and most.\
natural in  portrait, and will most deceive the senses, if the light and distance,\
with respect to the place where the picture is to be set, be well observed;, other-\
wise the effect will be contrary to what we expect.\
This conduct is chiesly necessary in portraits hanging high ; for being. so much\
above the eye, they must needs have  low horizon. But as portraits are move-\
able, how natural and like soever they be, and well handled, if they hang not in.\
proper places, they will not have  good effect : hence the mischief attending them.\
is, that by continually changing their places, they cannot always be painted\
to  certain height and distance, and consequently baffle our rule :  difficulty\
which the greatest masters must struggle with, and this branch of the art is\
liable to.\
Having now shewn that  low horizon and point of-sight are best and most na-\
tural, as supplying, in some measure, this inconveniency : How much must they\
mistake, who always chuse anhigh horizon, They are on  level with the sitter,\
and yet place the horizon manyfeet higher; nay, they think, those who do other-\
wise act against nature and art. Some will have two points of sight in one piece,\
one for the figure, another for the ornaments; one level with the eye, and the\
other for the off-scape; one hand higher or lower at pleasure, or about three or\
four fingers breadth above the middle. Although these are inexcusable errors, yet\
 think it vain to attempt their redress; but hope the judicious artist will weigh\
what Ihave said, and endeavour to avoid them.\

CHAP. . Of Portraits in Little.\
THERE are many things, as  have formerly shewed, which if we will have \
them transport the senses by their natural representation, we must always\
exhibit in their natural proportion and force of colouring: but in  portrait it is\
otherwise ; for this may as well be done in little, as in full proportion, provided\
the diminution be well observed ; and besides, it has some relation to historical\
management. We could say the same of  little flower compared with  great\
one ; for if it were coloured in proportion to its distance and diminution, it-would\
be in the same case with  portrait in little:. But it is nevertheless certain, that in\
festoons, garlands, flower-pots in niches, groups of flowers, &. serving for\
ornament of chambers, little slowers are of small account ; nay, never seen wove\
or embroidered in any stuff: whence some may be induced to think, that  por-\
trait in little, as big as the palm\'92of the hand, has as little property in  square\
against the wall, especially when it receives its light from without the frame, and\
is handled with as much force as the life itself; which, with respect to force, Ial\
low : nevertheless,  small portrait may, in order to make it look more natural,\
be more easily helped, than small flowers placed against  door, window or other\
flat; which, in my opinion, can in no wise be made good; but  small portrait\
may, as  shall prove in what follows : in order to which the artist must previously\
consider.\
First, How much the life in proportion diminishes; and consequently, how\
faint it must be.\
Secondly, that the picture cannot receive its light from without the frame, as\
being too far from it.\
Here, perhaps, it may be afked, Whether  portrait of  lady or gentleman\
leaning out at window, in the manner of old Mieris, Mezzu, Vonder, Neer, and\
others, would not be good and natural ,:  say, Yes. But then the window\
must also go back ; for as it would be difficult to represent its- going back from\
the frame, since no object, whether ceiling-or sloor, &. is between them, in\
order to create distance, and make the picture fall back ; something may be intro-\
duced in full proportion, to shew the depth and distance, according to the differ-\
ence to be seen in the following instances in plate LVIII.\
In No.  we see  common fault in the figure leaning on aframe : in this there\
is no other way to make the figure go baek, than by taking away the frame. And,\
although,\
No.  shews itself within the frame, yet it would be to no purpose, did we\
not assign  sufficient large breadth or thickness to the frame ; for in such case, we\
must not regard an hand\'92 breadth of cloth, whereon to repiresent something in full\
proportion, as an orange, flute, book, &. Yet,\
No.  shews  good method, and in my judgment, the best and most natural.\
 remember,:\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
 remember, amongst the paintings of  certain lover, to have seen one of \
Doctor with an urinal in his hand, thrusting his arm out at window, so that the\
shade of it, and the glitter of the water plainly appeared on the sill of the window.\
Next the window  maid-servant was seen standing at the door, speaking to \
woman in the street with  child in her arins : some other figures appeared in the\
front of the picture, seen to the shoulders only, as if standing in the street. On\
the sill of the window were lying  bottom of blue worsted stuck with needles,\
also  pair of sciffors,  piece of dark blue cloth, and  thimble, all in full pro\'ac\
portion : to be short, this picture was by an artist, with the owner\'92 leave, sen-\
tenced to be docked; in order to which, he drew  square chalk-line round the\
window, which contained the Doctor, and cut away all the rest round about it,\
hitting here an head, there an arm, without sparing any body but the Doctor,\
who was instantly put into  smaller frame : thus the piece was half cut away,\
and for noother reason, as the artist pretended, than that the Doctor alone was\
sufficient to satisfy the eye, the rest being superfluous.  wretched fate for so\
good alpicture  But some painters will keep the old road, because it is difficult\
to correct  rooted evil : they do as the old woman did, who being exhorted in\
her last sickness to embrace the true faith, answered,\
ce She would follow the steps\
of her fore-fathers, were they all gone to the devil.  it is with  portrait in little, which has nothing of nature but the features,\
and looks like  puppet ; whereas there are well-known methods to make it appear\
as big as the life; nay, to move and speak, as  may say : but being slighted,\
the figure seems immoveable, dumb and little, and therefore unnatural.\
On this footing, Imean to shew, that all things may be naturally represented\
in little, except  moon-light, which baffles all our fkill.\
Now, if itbe afked, Whether too nice an expression of parts in  small portrait,\
would not be superfluous and unnatural, with respect to distance, and whether less\
finishing would not be better ;  say, No; provided it be not so strong and warm\
as the life ; for the figure not being exhibited in open field, it cannot have so much\
mistiness and vapour about it : and therefore the neat pencilling cannot be ob-\
structive, especially if managed with sxill, as the principal parts well touched,\
and the tender and melting smallness in the broad parts the same, so that at the\
proper distance the one is seen more, and the other less.\
Here may arise another question : Whether such pictures are not of the same\
nature with what is seen through  prospective-glass, since every thing appears so\
plain, elaborate and neat \'e0 But  answer, that they are not, nor can ; because\
the glafs exhibits the life without the interpofition or mistiness or vapours, and\
with strong and warm shades, which overcome its smallness.\
 have often wondered at such small paintings, because they seemed as if  was\
looking in  Nuremberg looking-glass, or through  prospective, since they appeared\
not like the life, but little moving puppets.\
Now, another difficulty is, that since such paintings cannot, according to our\
position, be made good without the addition of some by-ornament, as imagery in\
whole or half figures, vine-branches about the frame, or something lying on it, in\
order to fling them off, it would be hard for those who can only paint  whole or\
half\
\
\
\
\
\
\
half length figure, and aim at nothing else than to become masters therein, where-\
as, he who is better versed, may by  due observance of what has been said, easily\
overcome the before-mentioned difficulties.\
CHAP. VI. Of the Application of Requisites with respect to the different\
Conditions of Persons.\
 will not be foreign to our main design, to put the artist in mind of the appli\'ac\
cation and right use of such materials as may enrich  portrait, and make it\
look the more noble. This is so great  point in portraiture, that when well\
known, we need never be at \'e0 stand through the mishape or defects we often\
meet with in the disposition of  portrait, and which sometimes must not be hid ;\
since we have often means enough for obviating them with seeming reason, and\
without foreing nature ; as  long and narrow face may be helped by  hood, or\
other head-dress;  thick and too round  face by the contrary :  figure too\
lonesome may be embellished with  pillar, pedestal, slower-pot, table, and such\
things as are proper to it, which serve nor only for ornament and grandeur, but\
also to express the sitter\'92 lustre and virtue : but care must be taken that the figure\
of the sitter, as the principal object of the piece, sill up the major part of it, either\
by  spreading sway of the posture, or by the addition of some proper by-work ;\
by which means it will have  good effect.\
Since it is certainthat the vices as well as virtues have two powerful qualities,\
and though contrary to each other, yet both tend to good purpose; nay,  wicked\
person, may, by  virtuous example, be rescued from evil ; and  virtuous per-\
son, through bad example, led into error and ruin ; but virtue being joined to vir-\
tue, fears no evil ; contrarily, the evil will make us avoid evil. So pictures\
should create an ardour for virtue, and especially those of religious and good\
persons : since this, as we have said in Chap. . gave the first rise to their repre-\
sentations, in order to perpetuate their memories, as well as their virtues and\
glorious actions.\
To come then the better to this excellent point; let us by noble by-works make\
them with their persons, in  conspicuous manner. Wherefore  shall lay down\
some examples, though drawn from heathen story.\
Among the Heathens, some were so virtuously endowed, that they need not yield\
to christanity itself ; Lucretia and Penelope in chastity; Cato in steadiness and cou-\
rage; and many others whom we shall for brevity omit, to pass to the sketching\
chamber, or other apartment; and an example of  chaste virgin shall be that of\
Lucretia. It is said, to her honour, that she was descended of  noble family,\
and so virtuously educated, that she delighted only in that. Now, whether we\
represent\
\
\
\
\
\
\
represent her living or dead in that character, we may adorn her apartment with\
sine tapestries, statues and pictures; in the pictures, the history of Penelope at work ;\
the fable of Cronis and Neprune ; some modest emblems of gods, &. all relating to\
chastity and honour. It statues, or houschold goods be necessary, let them be\
Pallas, Diana, Hymen, and especially Vesta : her bed may be ornamented with\
Chastity and Stedfastness ; and on her couch may be seen some Cupids lighting\
each others torches, or playing with palm-branches and olive-leaves : the apart-\
ment may be here and there furnissied with gold and silver vases, cups and other\
house-plate, wrought with virtuous significations ; but herein, care must be taken\
not to introduce any thing foreign to the matter, or against history, which ought\
to be consulted.\
The handling this example may sufficiently usher in the method of treating\
others, such as of Julius Casar, Augustus, Marcus, Aurelius, Crasus, Solon, Seneca,\
&. and contrarily, the stories of Sardanapalus, Semiramis, Faustina, Phalaris, &.\
As for  cruel prince, or tyrant, either in his court, apartment or other place,\
even in his revels, &. each requires its proper embellishinent : the apartment\
may be adorned with paintings of all sorts of punishiments and cruelties, drawn\
from the blackest parts of history, together with those who cause them to be in-\
flicted: if it be Nero, let all or some of the cruelties of his bloody reign be painted,\
and his qualities, with emblems in marble bas relicf ; his statues are deities or\
household gods, as Mars and Meg\'e6ra; he himself may be represented on  pe-\
destal, with thunder in his hand, the world under his feet, and the Roman senators\
bowing and kneeling before him, fettered like slaves : his drinking equipage may\
be ornamented with noxious animals, as ferpents, adders, and the like ; his chair\
or seat, with tygers, lyons and dragons, wrought in silver, gold and ivory ; his\
throne may be supported by Jupiter; Juno, Neptune, and Pluto ; the floor curiously\
and richly inlaid with  celestial sphere of Lapis Lazuli; and the meteors and\
constellations wrought in bright gold ; the censers may smoak in all corners of\
the apartment, but chiesly about his statue. If the scene lie in his dining room,\
the household gods may be seen thrown down in all corners, especially the simula-\
crum of Roma, with its head broken off, and lying near it, Jupiter, Apollo and Vesta\
are principals in this companv. In fine, every thing that can denote  wicked\
man, or monster, art must exhibit. The same character should also appear in the\
actions, looks, and dresses of his retinue or guards ; for we usually say, et Like\
master, like man.\
But not to dwell too long with princes, we shall also speak of other characters,\
and shew what suits them.\
With  burgomaster suits the statue of justice ; and in paintings or hangings,\
some emblems of it, representing the rewards of the good, and punishment of the\
bad ; the fasces (or rods and ax) are the true token of  consul, or burgomaster.\
With  senator agree the statue of policy, or government; and in paintings or\
hangings, some representations of the laws ; besides prudence and care for the\
state.\
With  secretary the statue of Harpocrates; and in tapestry, or bas relief, the\
story of Alexander shutting Hephestien\'92 mouth with\'92 seal-ring; also the emblem of\
Fidelity, or  goose with  stone in its bill.\
With\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
With  director (governor) of the East-Idia Company, the figure or statue of it,\
to wit, an heroine with  scollop of mother of pearl on her head, in the nature of\
an helmet, and thereon  coral branch  breast ornament of scales, pearls and\
corals about her neck ; bulkins on her legs, with- two dolphins conjoined head to\
head, adorned with s\'e9a-shells; two large Thells oh her shoulders ; \'e0 trident in her\
hand, and her cloathing  long mantle ;  landscape behind her of an Indian pros-\
pect, with palm and cocoa-trees, some figures-of. Blacks, and elephant\'92-teeth-\
This figure also suits an admiral, or commander at sea, when  sea-fight is in-\
troduced instead of  landscape.\
Withe  divine agrees the statue of Truth, represented in  christian-like manner;\
or else this same emblem in one of his-hands, and his other on his breast; besides\
tapestries, bafs reliefs, or paintings, and some christian emblems of the true faith,\
and  representatinn of the Old and New Testament, and in the off-scape, \
temple.\
With  philosopher,  celestial globe, the statue of Nature, and  representation-\
of the four elements, &.\
 general should have  white staff in his hand, and the figure of Mars in \
niche; if  landscape be seen,  trophy may be reared with Victory sitting on it :\
he may have Hercules for \'e0 statue.\
With ae sea-insurer, suits. Arion on  dolphin; and in  picture,, \'e0 sea-haven\
with  ship under sail making towards is; on the shore the nigure of Forlune, and\
over the cargoe, Castor and Pollux.\
With  steersman suits the figure of Precaution ;. besides  compass: and in \
picture, the four cardinal points.\
With an engineer,, the figure of Industry ; besides  map of military\
architecture.\
With an orator, or speaker, the figure of Elequence, or Mercury, without his\
purse, and besides him  roll of papers, in the off-scape,  person mounted on \
stone, and surrounded with an attentive audience.\
With  virtuous young man, the figure of Virtue; and on  wall Horace\'92 em-\
blem of the young man in the stadium or course ; or else the young Hercules stand-\
ing between Virtue and Vice.\
Some thingsare also. proper to women, to betoken their virtues and qualities ;.\
as by an imminent woman for reputation-the statue of Honour, and by it some em-\
blems of Fidelity, especially oeconomy, or family government, and some medals\
relating thereto.\
With  widows agrees well the figure of Humility, or emblems tending towards.\
as also Perseverance.\
it,\
With  young and sober virgin, suits the figure of Neatness ; an embroidering\
frame and its furniture ; besides emblems relating to it; among which, that of-\
Business, shunning Idlenefs, Pride and Gluttony, have  principal place.\

CHAP. VII. Of the Saiting of Colours in Draperiex.\
 \
HE\'92 suiting of colours in-portraits c\'f4mes: now before us, \'e0 matten\
of as great ionsequence as the former, and deserves no less\
\
attention.\
Many think, though without ground, that deep red best becomes  red-faced\
person ; deep yellow  fallow one ; and all pale colours  pale one, and what is\
strange, black and dark colours,  swarthy persou : but this must be rediculous\
and without reason, if we confider what  strange erdonnance thefe people would\
make. Truly, if the art were so, there would be no difficulty in finding agree-\
ablenefs, and every one would be able to dispose it as it obght to be; and if this\
were  becomingness, variety would be no art : nay, the fafhiion itself, which\
alters four times  year with respect to colour, would not be allowed every body to\
wear; as in fpring, green; in summer yellow; in autumn, red; and in winter,\
fillemot. Yellow or fallow-faced persons durst not wear red ; or red-faced ones,\
green : but enongh of this. Let us now return to what sober art dictates.\
Beginning with the head and its hair,  say, that deep or strong colours, such\
as deep red, deep yellow, deep blue, &. best fit  person who has brown hair.\
Those who have fair hair, beft become half or weak colours, such as purple,\
lightblue, violet, green and rose-colour.\
 yellow-haired person best becomes violet, blue, and whitissi yellow, as masti-\
cot, and\'92such like;. these are the chief colours which  know. But here we must\
observe, that the lighter the hair, the more weak the drapery ; and the darker\
the hair, the stronger the drefs.\
He is  prudent master who well knows how to express in his pictures the dif-\
ferent naturez and complexions of people, and to distinguish persons full of fpirit\
and fire from the meek and dead-hearted ; the sickly and weak from the healthy\
and strong; as to whom we may use draperies of the following colours : with the\
red or firey fuit best draperies of half or broken colours, with little red in them ;\
the pale suits no yellow, or other pale colour; the fallow the same ; but white is\
very agreeable : brown complexions become not dark or strong, but white and\
all light colours. The Blacks love white above any colour, and think no dress\
better beconses them than  light coloured one; and not without reason; for,\
Would not  black man with black. or dark cloaths be frightful to look at ; And\
how ridiculous it is for  pale virgin, to dress in all sorts of light and pa\'efe-colours,\
in order to look less pale ; and that one who is red, wear nothing bat red for the\
same re\'e2son. Hereby, mstead ofhiding  small fault, the mafter would commit\
 greater; and yet this is the common notion. But if  may give my opinion, \
red and fiery faced person, dressed in red, seems to me like  red painted statue ;\
and  pale looking person in  light or yellow dress, as sick or dead. Wherefore,\
if we would be artful, we must manage otherwise, to wit, that those whom we\
would\
\
\
\
\
\
\
would represent healthy or fickly, ought to appear such by contrary colours ; as,\
lively colours for  sick or unhealthy person; and weak and faintonesfora healthy\
person : yet let me not be here misunderstood ;  say not this as  positive Jlaw,\
: without. exception, but as an hint to tyros. The more experienced know, what\
the art teaches; for she is not deficient : but as the drapery sometimes over-rules,\
:so we can manage the naked accordingly ; for instancc, red drapery requires \
:middling carnation, between pale and red; so also it ought to be with  pale\
tcolour. When  say the decorum consists in an opposition, it must be understood,\
tghat oppofition has its degrees, which we ought to know and use according to\
tghe. different occafion, and\'92the grounds -against which they happen to come : but\
in general terms, the naked must always seem to. be of  distinct nature from the\
draperies.\
ICH AP. VIII. 'Of the Fnitation of great Masters in painting Portraits;.\
and of copying their Pictures in general.\
\
RE twe leave the subject of portraiture, Tthink tliis head necessary to be\
treated of, and therefore, shall shew how far, and in what mannery we may\
\
engage in it;. and subjoin. somewhat of copying pictures in the same bigness, as\
rwell as in diff\'e8rent flzes.\
\
 find that this imitation of masters is less observed in their design and ordon-\
:nance, than in the colouring, lights and shades: this is certainly  principal point\
tin aepicture, because, there can be :no decorum without it; nay. we find. some\
works of smadll. masters. in this particular tolerably successful;. though, they-know\
rmot, how they got- the ikrmwledge, it happening mostly by chance : they are\
 oharmed with\'92 some fine- and taking colours. in this or that great master; these they\
use at-random:in their own productions, either forwards or in the- depth, middle\
 an sides hand iftthey happen to. be paced against  proper ground, or are set off by\
any aiding by-colour, the work hits right, in satisfying both the eye, and rules\
of art; but if these fine colours happen to suit the grounds, then all is wrong and\
the artist at  stand..\
To explain this point, we shall be more particular, and clear it by examples;\
though lthink Ihave already in this hook spoken largely enough of it, in treating\
of back-grounds and the harmony of colours in  portrait.  certain artist having\
seen  very beautiful white and green lace on  young lady\'92 gown, painted by \
great master, he must by all means imitate it; but being afked, whether: he had\
taken due notice of the ground-colour of the gown Phe answered, No. How then\
oan this finetand becaming lace have  good effect in his-works, unless by chance ?\
The roafon of swhich. is,  think, that-either through-sshame orepride, or both, the\
fartist takes\'92 something from  great master; for instance,: what he used,in the loin-\
tain, the other, that it may not be known, brings forward; and what he has repre-\
sented iin the open air, the other contrives in  dark rogm. : poor method of\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
concealment, since by  right application the theft wquld be lawfull but it is such\
mens misfortune,to be, in this particular, mostiout of the way when they think they\
do best : for, wanting the great :master\'92 wit, judgment and apprehension, they\
have no true notion of his conduct, and therefore are easily msled, like Asop\'92\
ravan, cxposed to censure-\
Since it is an undoubted truth, that we can perform nothing but what passes\
through thought, and of which, cither by feeing or hearing, we get an idea;\
therefore must the paintings, drawings and fine prints: of old masters give an\
handle to thoughts and practice; for he who never saw  lion can never paint him\
well, unless by the help of  draught, or model : as was the case of  certam\
Westphalian, who representing Daniel in the lion\'92 den, and having never seen  lion,\
he painted hogs instead of lions, and wrote underneath, These should be lions. Be\
this  fable or truth, it however teaches us, that we cannot represent any thing,\
whereof we have no idea; nay, if we have seen the objects, and made no sketches\
or models of them, we shall never exhibit them naturally; since memory is but\
the repofitory of knowlege and thoughts, from which they draw the things which\
judgment esteems useful and servigeable.\
 am of opinion, that two great advantages arise from copying great masters\
works : the one is, that therein we see many defects of simple nature corrected by\
their skill and judgment; and \'e9he other, that by this means we accustom ourselves\
to rectify those defects, when we have nature before \'fbs : truly two points of great\
\
importance.\
But alas  Is an artist, considered in his natural inclnation, otherwise than \
child which, advancing in age, follows its impulse \'e0 If he perform one praise-\
worthy act, how many errors will he contrarily commitp but when this bent is\
conducted by reason and art, the perceptions of the mind will then, as through \
clear channel, flow pure and undefiled : which leads me in some measure to con\'ac\
fess, that art and practice have great advantages, and are more to be set by, than\
all we receive from Nature, which is often defective in desired perfection, in \
single object: but she is perfect in her performances and objects in general ; and,\
in that sense, art is obliged to follow-her; wherefore, with the philosopher, \
must say of artists,\
Natura incipit, ars dirigit, experientia docet.\
That is,\
Nature points out the way, which arts improve,\
And settled practice makes  picture move.\
Hence we may easily perceive what we should do to cure this great defect of\
tke mis-use of other mens works ; but, that  may be the better understood, Ishall\
insist on further means for doing it: if then it happen, that the artist meet with\
any thing which is very taking, and he be desirous to make it his own, whether\
fine colours, drapery, stone, &. Let him take notes, in his pocket-book, of the\
ground,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
ground, by-colours and other incidents, as what. there is about such or such colour,\
and against what ground, and whether it be strong or weak; and of what colour\
the objects be, and wherherjthe warm or. weak colour be in the distance or for-\
wards, disagreeing or not ; as in the Chapter of the Harmony of Colours is shew-\
ed. . We must also consider, whether the-light come from open air, or fall into\
: room through glass windows ;. as is more largely taught in the Book of Lights\
and Shades, and which  repeatihere; becquse  think face-painters fr\'e8quently act\
contrarily, in seeing afaint y\'eat sine drapery represented without-doors, which with\
the same tint, they exhibit in an open air.\
The like heedless mistake we see in the copies of manydisciples and young\
masters after old or modern paintings; for, not observing whether in lessening\
their copies (which they generally do) they should not also abate the strength\
of colour and tints, their colouring, as well in light as shade is as strong as the\
original. The same error they commit in painting  great copy after  small\
original. But this ill conduct is owing chiefly to masters when they set their pu-\
pils to copy in  different size, in not admonisning them of it; but rather desiring\
that they shall imitate every thing as exactly as possible; thought in fact it be\
against the rule of art. It is therefore certain, that  picture with figures, of\
 landscape, suppose it as big as the life, to be copied  third less in size tints in\
the copy must needs be  third fainter than the original; and the more it lessens\
in size, the fainter the tints, or else it cannot be good. If this conduct be of\
such moment in copying pictures, of how much greater consequence must it be,\
when  portrait-painter diminisnes the life, or paints  portrait in full proportion\
from  small one, with respect to the weakening ro strengthening of colours.\
Although it is commendable to follow great masters in general, yet it is  fault\
to dwell upon some of their particulars, as an ornament, urn, vase, term, &. with-\
out striving at something new. We think, that what they have done is enough\
for our practice; but this is weakness; since art and nature have such  fund of\
objects, and our time for learning and living is long enough, and by consulting\
within ourselves we may spur pur genius.\
Others commit the same fault by  contray impulse ; for so violent is their in-\
clination to some particular great master in his objects, colouring &. that they\
think it lost time to employ their thoughts on the works of any other good artist,\
and being thus wedded to him, they wishi, drudge and plod to be like him as well\
in errors as perfections; by this means, and by  punctual imitation of blunders\
and mistakes, it sometimes happens, that the copy and the original are not to be\
distinguisned, both being so wounderfully like each other; nay, their own pro-\
ductions are taken for copies. For,  tyro of good ability may at first use him-\
self to  good manner of designing, which he ought to be master of, before he\
takes to painting, and to understand this well before he proceeds to ordonnances ;\
and then, if he have  thorough knowledge of the latter, he will paint  good\
picture. Yet it is often seen, tnat his work is but taken for that of  pupil, nay\
worse than  copy; and what, is still lefs, it is not like his own manner or hand-\
ling: and Why ; such artists, being advanced thus far, endeavouring to produce\
their\
\
\
\
\
\
\
their Gun inventions, no longer minding grounds and rules, but ftriving only\
at novelties, care little for painting or defigning well; whence their works are\
oftentimes indifferently designed, poorly handled and coloured, but well ordered\'92;\
arising only from  neglect of their master\'92 instructions, and what, they know\
and an itch for what they still want to know; whereby they are often shipwreck-\
ed between both : pernicious effect of the bent of our youth  which cannot be\
remedied otherwise than by returning to original principles and their putting in\
use : for as by an \'e8xcess in loading weight upon weight on  weak and un-\
settled, though well-laid foundation the whole building may tumble, even the\
foundation may dance ; so must our practice always have an eye to theory,\
that the custom (which, as we say, is  second nature in goodnefs as well as\
badness) may gain firi. footing on us, and be our furest guide.\

The art of painting\
VIII.\
BOOK\
Of ARChETECTURE.\
\
CHAP. . Of Archit\'e9cture in general.\
AFTER having handlad sol. many diffegent parts of the art, we meet\
\
also with architecure ; an art full of noble performances and fine usez\
But our purpose is not to insist on all its advantages, or give  system\
\
of it ; since such  work would be too tedious, and calls for Homer\
or Virgil\'92 eloquence : and having been copioussy handled by several\
learned pens, we shall treat noffurther of it than what concerns  painter, leaving\
the rest to architects.\
An ingenious history painter, if he would be universal, must needs understand\
architecture and statuarry ; because he will otherwise be at  nonplus in some\
things ; he ought even to be as knowing as an architect, and how to order  good\
building, though it is an architect\'92 daily practice, and \'92ghat but  part of the\
painter\'92.\
It is certain that the human body is, in its symmetry, proportion, majesty\
and grace, the most perfect pi\'e9ce of work in the creation ;, architecture is no less\
perfc\'e9t in. its \'f4perations ; it has even preduced ghe first wonder of the world, and\
thereby obtaied the laurel and palm of fame.\
Writers say, that Babylonians were the first, and after them the Agyptians, Greeks\
and Romans, who brought it to perfection; until in the emperor Augustus\'92 time, it\
arrived\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
arrived at its-highest pitch; but sunk, afterwards by the irruption and barbarity\
of the Goths, Vandals, Hunns, and Longobards, who burned and destroyed all\
before them.  true proof that nothing in the world is permanent and\
stable !\
But to come to our purpose, we must \'92premise that the word architec-\
ture) simply signifies draughts or designs, after which,  building is carried\
up and constructed ; and comprehends the five following Orders, namely,\
The Tuscan, Doric, lonic, Roman, and Corinthian : according to which, all buil-\
dings are regulated, whether palaces, tomples, town-houses, triumphal arches,\
bagnios, theatres, town-gates, galleries, tombs, and, other-magpificent buil-\
dings, round or square, or both :  speak of their outward construction.\
The word Order, is of large extent : but in architecture is, as Vitruvius\
defines it.  joining of different proportionate and symmetric parts, as pe-\
destals, columns, andjtheir ornaments, in such manner as to compose  perfect\
order and body.\
As for the entablatures over columns, to wit, architraves, frizes, and cor-\
nices (which for their richnefs, have got the name of ornaments) they may\
as little as the Orders, themselves, , be gither, mixed among one another, or\
changed from one Order to another.\
 careful painter will not only distinguisn one sort from another, from\
cornice to, base, but will also take care not to put an lonic moulding on\
 Doric pedestal ;  Corinthian on  Tuscan;  Roman cornice on an loni\'e9\
frize, &.\
Further, it is certain that the Orders do not promiscuoussy suit all sorts-\
of buildings, but ought so to be applied (respecting their parts and orna-\
ments, which also differ in general from each other) as to have an har-\
mony and agreement with the whole: buildings, with respect. to their situa-\
tion and quality.\
These Orders must be enriched in their several kinds, to fhiew  suitable\
decorum, especially the Capitals, except the Tuscan, which iis- throughout\
\
\
plain and simple.\
The Doric Order excells: in its triglyphs and metopes.  The Jonic, in its\
valures, medillions, &. The Roman, in the elegance of cornices, and beauty\
of capitals with their volutes, and oak-leaves.: And the Corixthiaa, by its\
mouldings of victorious olive leaves, and its- excelleat and agreeable\
capitals.\
The metopes in the Doric frize imay be-enriched. according: to-the qualities\
and uses of buildings, whether temples, town-houses, honourary arches, or courts\
\
\
\
for priests.\
\
In the first suit best carved challices, books, wases, mitres, &. \
In the second, the coats of arms of the Republic, or chief men in the governt\
ment : also the rays and thunders of Jupiter tied together; or the Caduces (staff)\
of Mercury, twined with serpents, as denoting peace-\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
In the, third,, various arma and trophies taken from the enemy; or all\
forts of mufical and warlike instruments, as usual in triumphs and armies, huddle-\
ed together. And,\
In the last suit best carved ox-sculls, adorned with garlands, betokening sacrifice\
which the ancients made to their deities ; oftentimes the utensils of those offerings\
were introduced, to wit, altar, vases, three legged kettles, vinegar-cups, censers,\
candtesticks, basons, dishies, hammers, axes, knives, &.\
Among the works of the ancients we see in the frizes of the lonic, Roman and\
Crinthian Orders (especially in the two last) some foliage of cak lcaves ; which\
has  fine effect, when twined with shrubs and vine branches, interspersed with\
roses and other flowers. Sometimes are introduced vizards, with playing children\
and running animals : also festoons of fruit, leaves, and various kinds of the most\
beautiful and agreeable flowers; these tied together look nobly, especially when\
judicioussy placed : but enough of this. He wno would know more sorts of frizal\
ornaments, must consult the works  of the ancients, in which he will find.\
them, though the before-mentioned are the principal, and most in use.\
Although the ancients teach, that the fronts of buildings (which are the parts\
most in view) ought to be more adorned than the flanks and rears, yet some mo-\
dern masters have misunderstood this, and apprehended, as if in those parts the\
ornaments could not be too many ; nay, they have crowded the mouldings of the\
architrave, frize and cornice, and of the pedestals under columns, with small\
carving, in such  manner, that it rather causes confusion than ornament, as ap-\
pears by their works : but when used in moderation, and between tbe principal\
ornaments  part is left plain and blank, it causes grandeur and decorum.\
Something is also to be remarked about pediments and key-stones. Pediments\
(or tops of fronts) like the forehead of  man, snew the principal aspect of build-\
ings, especially when their spandrells (or faces) are agreeably enriched by good\
masters with histories, sacrifices, arms, or the like, in marble, according to the\
quality of the fabric.\
Sometimes also are, put over pediments, trophies, coats of arms, or shields ;\
which if well cut and placed, have  noble effect.\
As for key-stones of arches over gates and niches, these may be en-\
riched, \
In the Tuscan Order, with wild beasts ; and between heads of cyclops, or\
giants.\
Inthe Doric Order, with lions heads, or Hercules with his lion\'92 skin over his\
head.\
In the lonic Order, with tame beasts, or heads of Pallas or amazons, with their\
head attire.\
\
 There is  lurge collection of them in Langley\'92 Ancient Masonry, lately published.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
In the Roman Order, with heads of demi-gods , as Ronndas, Jiliks Casar, and\
such heroes. And,\
richly wrought.\
CHAP. II. Of the Rises of the Ornaments, Columns; and their\
Pedestals.\
AVING spoken in the former chapter, of the decoration of the Orders,\
we shall now, in  brief manner, treat of the rifes: and divifions of the\
\
\
columns, with their ornaments and pedestals.\
The ornament (or entablature) of the Tuscau column rises one mod\'fble and\
seven-eight parts of  module (by module is meant, throughout the Orders, the\
pillars diameter next above the base). The column, with its base and capital\
rises seven modules and  half, and the pedestal one module seven eights ; this\
being agreed, the entablature and pedestal are each one fourth of the column\'92\
rise ; the base under the column, and gapital over it, are -in each in rise half \
module; the lessening (or diminution) of the shaft of-the column at the neck,\
under the capital, is one fourth of  module, and it begins below at one fourth\
\
\
\
of the column\'92 rise.\
The entablature of the Doric column rises two-modules and one eight ; the co\'ac\
lumn, with its base and capital, is eight modules and  half, and the pedestal\
two modules and two fifteenths : this being fixed, the entablature is one fourth,\
and the pedestal throe and three fourths-of the column\'92 nise. : The base and ca-\
pital are each, as in the Tuscan, half  module. The diminution at the neck of\
the shaft is one fifth of  module, and begins below at three parts one fourth of\
The entablature of the lonic column rises one module and three fourths ; the\
column, with its base and capital, is eight modules and three fourths, and the\
pedestal twe modules and  half : this settled, the entablature is one fifth, and\
the pedestal three parts and  half of the column\'92 rise. (But if the frize be\
carved, the entablature is four parts and  half of the column\'92 rise, and in the\
following Orders the same). The capital with its volutes, is little more than\
half  module, and the base is just half  module (and in the following Orders\
the same). The diminution at neck is one sixth of  module, and begins below\
at three parts and  half of the column\'92 rise, divided into twelve parts, as afore-\
said.\
The entablature of the Roman column rises one module and twelve twentieth\
parts of  module; the column, with its base and capital, is, nine modules and\
three fourths; the pedestal rises three modules : which laid down, the entabla-\
ture is one fifth, and the pedestal three parts and one fourth of the column\'92\
rise :\
\
\
\
\
\
\
rise : the capital rises one fnodule and one flxth; the base as before ; the diminu-\
tion at neck is one seventh of  module, and begins below at the rise of three\
parts and one fourth of the column, divided as aforesaid.\
The entablature of the Gorinthian column rises two modules ; the column, with-\
its base and capital, is ten modules in rise; the pedestal three modules and one\
third : after which, the entablature is one fifth, and the pedestal one third of the\
column\'92 rise; the capital rises one module and one sixth; the base as before ;\
the diminution at neck is one eight of  module, and begins below at one third of\
the column\'92 rise.\
The breadth of the Tuscan and Doric pedestals ought always to be equal with\
the plinths or bases of their columns; and though the plinths in the three other\
Orders project more at their bottoms, by reason of their sweeps, their pedestals\
must neverthelefs be alike perpendicular with the upper, points of their plinths.\
Let me here six the height of  statue on  pedestal placed next  column ;\
since many mistake in it. In right proportion it ought not to rise higher than\
two thirds of the column; but then the column should not be too high, or too\
low, but stand on  base only, which is frequently continued through the build-\
ing. As for pedestals, they serve only to raise  column, and augment its orna-\
ment. We ought also, for elegance, to take care, that the figure and its pedef-\
tal be proportionate to each other; because,, if the latter be too great or too\
small, the figure would become too small, or monftrous.\
In fine, as all the parts of  building ought to answer in  proportionate dis-\
position, so should the figures, whether carved or painted, be neither too big or\
little : wherefore they must be governed by the height ef the place where they\
are to stand.\
CHAP. III Of the Property of \'e0 Bailding, and Observations\
thereon.\
we \
Must believe, according to the evidence of writers, and the tradition of tra-\
vellers, that the Italians have the best taste, as well for architectur\'e9 as paint-\
ing; and though it is certain, that Germany, France, England, Holland, and othet\
countries, have produced fine architects, yet at this time they are not comparable\
to the italians, whose manner, which is the antique, is now followed by the most\
polite nations. The old taste was known by the name of the Gothic, as  certain\
writer affirms, faying, ee That the Gothic manner of building of the ancient Ger-\
mans (which at that time gave law to all other nations); is quite abolishied by the\
Italians: nay, he cries ont, What magnificent and choice wonders do we not\
see in proud ltaly, lofty Rome especially, where it seems as if Nature and Ant have\
mutually agreed to establisn their thrones, and exert their powers, in order to\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
make this famous city the mistress of the world, and the beauty of the universe !\
St. Peter\'92 church, the Vatican, the Rotunda, and many other structures (serving\
the whole world for examples, and without which architecture is but  confused\
mass), draw yearly thousands of people and young artists thither to improve\
themselves by them, for the service of their own countries ; so that the finest and\
newest things which we see in those countries, lately built, and still going for-\
ward, are designed in the Italian gusto. Wherefore it is to them that those fine\
piles, the Stadthouse at Amsterdam, the new Lutheran church, and divers other\
structures, as well without as within the town, do owe their origin and beauty.\
We are then much indebted to those great artists, Vitruvius. Serlio, Philibert de\
'Orme, Palladio, Cataneo, Leo Baptista Santoritio, Vignola, Scamozzi, and many\
others, who have enlightened the world with their works and writings. And\
\
think that no one can be  good architect who has not studied those authors. The\
French acknowledge, that their great improvements in this art are owing to the\
works and precepts of those excellent masters.\
We shall now speak of intire buildings so far as they serve for ornament in\
painting. The goodness of  building springs not merely from the aforesaid rises,\
breadths or depths of the Orders, but from an apposite conjunction (or bring-\
ing together), of different proportionate parts into an exquisite body, which, by\
reason of its excellent form, whether in height or breadth, appears to the judg-\
ment of the knowing both admirable and beautiful ; especially when sitly adapted\
to the quality of the owner, and has general conveniency with respect to cus-\

But, waving other mens opinions, we shall proceed in our purpose, so far as\
eoncerns  painter in these countries, and no further. Our judgment is, that the\
best proportion in- building is one third. higher in, rise than breadth, espe-\
cially if it be covered in with  compass-roof and its appertunances; but if flat-\
roofed,  third wider than high, and to be commanded by  single Order rising\
from bottom to top. It would be improper to adorn them with statues, bass-re-\
liefs, festoons, &. For such heavy and close structures, without weight, and\
moreover open on top, are proper for an amphitheatre, but not for  temple or\
palace ;  speak with respect to custom and decorum, which must allways go to-\
ther, since nothing is beautiful without its natural qualities. The case is as \
woman in  man\'92 habit, and the contrary ; or  water-vase adorned with an\
olive-branch and thunder; or an oil-vessel with tritons and dolphins.\
In painting  good building there must appear, besides the architecture, per-\
spective and colouring, an orderly disposition, producing elegance, otherwise it\
is of no worth. Orderly disposition consists in so joining the parts, that they\
mutually set off each other in  pleasing variety, and thereby exhibit  fine piece\
of work, and an agreeable figure : this variety springs from the inequality of\
openings, or windows, whether oblongs, squares, circles or ovals ; the disposi-\
tions of these openings, near and over each other, are founded on reason, as shall\
be explained by an example.\
We exhibit in-plate LIX. -temple topped with  cupola, or rather an house\
round-roofed. On each side of the door  flight of steps descend ballustraded;\
underneath which is  vault; and over the entrance  balcony : now, beginning\
from below, we shall shew what figure each opening ought to have in an orderly\
disposition. The door under the steps is square, rising somewhat more than its\
diameter: that of the entrance is circular on top, and rises one third more than\
its diameter: that of the balcony also rises one third more than its breadth, but is\
square or flat on top; and then we meet the roof rounding again. Now let us\
dispose it otherwise, and make the door below circular, the next square, the next\
Thus much for doors; for we find no other than\

round and square ones. The same method may be taken with windows ; when\
there are two ranges, one above the other, the undermost may be oblong, and\
the uppermost compass, but lower: if there be another range of windows above\
these, next the roof, they ought to. be perfect squares. This rule we have taken\
from the works of the ancients, who always gave their openings or windows more\
rise in the first story than the second, still lessening in the third, yet all alike in\
diameter. Windows should never be lower than about three feet from the floor\
within. If there be windows in the basement-story (where the walling is thickest,\
and is usually finished with  Rustic Order), they must be square, and above ei-\
ther scheme (little rounding) or flat; and thus the one snew the other, with re-\
spect to roundness and squareness. If-now there were compass-windows in the\
basement and upper stories, the- uppermost should be circular, and the undermost\
oval, with their longest diameter parallel with the level of the building, because,\
being pressed by the weight, their arch is dilated ; when contrarily the others\
do not bear any weight. But circular windows are grown out of use, as not ad-\
mitting light so well as the square ones.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
If in the piers between windows there were niches and figures in them, and\
over head, room for  bafs relief, than the table for ie must be square, but circu-\
lar, where it is over  square window.\
As for doors over each other, Isay, that if there were over the cornice  com-\
pafs pediment, and on both sides  ballustrde with figures; then the bal oony door\
ought not to be circular but square and ornamreated with pillasters; yet the door of\
the entrance may be circular. We ought even not to set on the balcony  ballustrade\
with figures, but ornament it with balls or other low things. The one or other\
ballustrade must be also diversified ; for two parts alike in two such emminent\
places have an ill effect; wherefore one of them should be close walled (parapet-\
ways) and the face of it may then be enriched with bafs reliefs of figures,\
festoons, &.\
 think what  have said  sufficient guide for the other kinds of buildings; for\
these observations are on all occasions unalterable to  painter, with re-\
spect to agreeable disposition.\
There is still somewhat behind, which, though contrary to the dispofition\
aforesaid, must be animadverted ; it is touching  slower garden, which if fine,\
must needs be regular, as well with respect to its general form, as its particular\
division ; at least the two sides ought to be alike, whether set off with pots, vafes,\
statues or other ornaments. We are taught indeed, that uniformity is stiff, and\
not painter-like; wherefore we Thould avoid it as much as posfible : but\
weighing the precept maturely, we shall find the fauit to lie in dur misapprehen-\
fion of it : questionless things proceeding from rul\'e9 and order must be regular,\
but that regularity may nevertheless be somewhat hidden on occason : wherefore,\
though  garden be uniform on both sides, we are under no necesfity of shewing\
all that uniformity : one side is sufficient, the rest may be handsomely hid, or\
broke with  tree, piece of stone work, column, or  corner of the house. But\
let us not from hence absolutely conclude, regular objects to be unnecessary in an\
ordonnance ; for they sometimes furnisn all the decorum of  picture ; yet if we\
see but  part of them, we may conceive the residue.\
More examples of breaking uniformity may be thefe : when  figure stands on\
each side of  gate or alcove,  man may be placed or sit down before one of them\
in order tocreate inequality ; so also if by means of \'e0 curtain, one of those figures\
be shaded. If  bafs relief be set on each side of the gate or alcove, one ofthem\
may partly be covered by the personages, to answer our purpose. If without\
doors on both sides of an entrance, there be  carved lion or sphinx, we may break\
of one of their heads. Solomon\'92 throne was adorned with twelve golden hons : we\
need not see them all, the fix on one side fhew sufficiently, that there must be as\
many on the other : two orthree entire are enough, of the rest we may see only \
part here andthere. Thus we must always manage in such Cafes.\

CHAP. . Of the matching of the vario\'e9: coloured Marbles, as\
well without as within  Building; with the Management of Tombs,\
Vafa, and Bacchanalian Terms.\
BJECTS have \'e0 fine effect, when nature and art are joined together by al\
skilful hand; and though all eyes are not alike qualified to apprehend the\
it is beautiful, and soought to be, though the one person, as  say, understand\
it, and the other do not : and forthis reason; art has such  power, that though\
Nature, be beautifut in her productions, yet they would not perfectly please our\
eges, without the help of art.\
Nature produces an infinity of fine stanes of various colours and qualities; but\
art alone judges of their fitness and orderly looation as to rank and dignity, inso-\
much that, though ignorant in art, we oan. clearly apprehend that it ought to be\
so, and no otherwise.\
We know, that ths white is foft and tender, and lovely to the eye ; the black\
contrarily is melancholy and disagreeahle. We place then the black among the\
red, and upon the red, white. These three coloured stones are capitals, and can-\
aot be otherwise dispofed as-to th\'e9ir natufes and qualities, without foreing nature,\
and zunning counter to art.\
However, their rank and application in architectonic use may be these.\
In the Tustan Order, as undermost, black marble.\
In the Doric, green.\
I the : Janic, yeHow.\
In the Roman, red. : And,.\
In the Coriathian, white.\
If any afk why the ned is not set before the yellow, since the red is in its nature\
daykerrthanthe yellow Ianswer, That it is because the red and green are op-\
posers in strength ;. coatrarily, yellout is proper to green, since yellow and blue\
 green.\
 at any time we are obliged to place between two stones of one colour,  stone\
of another, the following mixtures are mostly in use.\
Between two black marbles suit best jasper, copper or brafs.\
Between two serpentine, or green marble stones, the same.\
Between. two red stones, white.\
Between red, black or serpentine stone, Pisan white-eyed marble.\
Between two grey stonies, free-stone or yellowisn white marble.\
Between two dotted long veiny stones;: one that is speckled ; aad the contrary-\
Between two jaspers, yellow, or ffestry white marble.\
\'92marbl\'e9-painter miist observe the conveniency and place for marbling : if the\

pass, he ought to moderate it, and keep it faint, that the place may not seem\
thereby lessened, or the eye offended. If the room be hung with pictures, he\
should consult men of experience, especially the master who painted them, what\
colouring will fit best.\
\
\
About light pictures, dark marble is best, and about dark pictures, light marble, \
as Pisan, jaspar, or any tending to  light yellow. But if it be  single\
colour, such as bass reliefs, then free-stone suite best.\
In bringing many sorts of coloured marbles together, we may, for instance, in\
 frontispiece either single or double-colonaded and pedestrated, very agreebly\
dispose them thus : viz. plante IX. The base and pedestral-mouldings may be black, \
little eyed : the block of square of the piedestal, dark red, much\
dotted, less veined: theplinths of the columns and pilasters mey be white,\
the columns, light red, or Pisan marble with large white-eyed veins on both sides\
the eying to be alike ; the pilasters also light red, moderately eyed, the capitals\
white, the architrave black, like the base and mouldings of the pedestals ; the\
frize may be dark red, like the blocks of squares of the pedestals ; and the cornice\
black again like the architrave ; if the frize have raised ornaments of foliage,\
children, triglyphs, ox-sculls, &. they ought to be white : if over the cornice\
be  parapet, it may be entirely of another colour, and the pedestals and the\
members of Pisan or other cross-veined marble, and the panels of faces of grey\
marble, or white, if adorned with bass reliefs ; the figures, or vases on top also\
white.\
This distribution may be doubled, and varied on occasion : the frizes and co\
lumns may be white, the bases and capitels gold ; and so may also the ornaments\
be to wit, triglyphs, little blocks and foliage; the rest may remain as before.\
In an hall of red or other marble (where the mouldings of the ornaments are\
different, larger or smaller) we may make  door frontispiece, or alcove of white\
or other marble; but if the members continue along the hall, \'92the frontispiece or\
alcove ought to be of the same colour with the room. The room may be of one\
order, and the frontspiece, alcove and chimney of another. Thus the room may\
be lonic, and the rest Corinthian or Roman. The pavement of the floor must cor-\
respond with the building,  mean, if the room have pillasters, the bands (or\
bordering marbles tying the pavement) must run up to them, whether the\
pilasters stand wide or close, for they ought to be so laid, as to shew every where\
-regularity, whatever jets or breaks the door, frontispiece, alcove, &. may oc-\
casion; as  prudent gardener disposes his parterres, one round, another square,\
octangular, &. always contriving such an uniformity as closes with the borders.\
In the middle of the hall, may be introduced such figures or compartments, as best\
answer the general purpose, and they may be of what colour you please.\
In chambers or galleries, where the sides are unlike, we are obliged to part\
them by some figure coming between; and yet the bands, which bind the sides,\
must come every where alike. If there be columns on both fides of the gallery,\
the bands must run, croffing it, from one to the other.\
Proceed we now to party-coloured tombs; and other stones.\

copper or brass. Note here,\
that the black inust always be undermoft, especial-\

Having pitched on  place for their stay, they,fixedit in the ground,- by means\
of the point aforesaid. These terms were-sonretimes painted of  brick colour\

grapes.\
The posts, or guides, called hermes, were huge and immoveable, and of white\
stone, set on rijde heaps of stone, in order to be conspicuous to travellers at  dis-\

CHAP. . Of the Veins and Eyes in Ston\'e9s used in Architecture, as\
well without as within; and how to dispose them,\
\
\
HE beauty in painting buildings consists in an elegant expression of the dif-\
ference of stones which compose them ; and this may be effected not only\
by their-divifion, but also by their colours, especially in outside-work, which is\
not so. much. heeded -as the inward, and is subject to more inconveniences of\
rain, hail and wind; and if standing in damp places, their effect in  few years\
visibly appears, if the stones be-not very-hard, by the dropping of mouldings and\
projeckures in seyeral parts.\
 Fountains must be supposed to suffer much, and become very mossy by being\
dropped on; and so do tombs and igrave-stones, but principally pyramids, which\
age not set up so much for the sake of their polisned bodies, as for their forms\
and huge bulk ;:wherefore it is no great matter whether the stones of these be of\
nae fort or colour ornot : they are often seen of many sorts of stones, some as they\
have been fopnd, and others changed through- time : yet the cement suffers most,\
by being eat ijn; whereby the stones get sloose, and must needs drop. Again,\
some stones, being more weak and brittle than others, and corroded by the air,\
dampnefs and drought, are broke in pieces by the pressure of those over them,\
and-thuis leave gaps and breaks, wherein the rain;gathers, out of which grow\

 know not hou\
some can so far relish sloveliness, as to spoil not only statues and fine figures, but\
also intire buildings; if they were broken or mould\'e9red pieces, ruins, and other\
decayed stones, it would be no damage if ever so much muddled and be-dropped;-\
but it is very improper to serve intire and fin\'e9 figures thus, and in places too\
where are neither trees or any thing else to oecanon iti The fame they do in\
buildings looking as frefh as at first; were the spots seen on them, natural to the\
stones, it would be more proper than all the gutters ufually represented to \'92trickle\
down them : wherefore care must be taken, before we begin to paint things sup-\
posed to be dropped on, that \'e0 difference may appear between nearnefs and dis-\
tance ; for as spots in cloaths are more visibl\'e9 near than -far off, so the faintnefs.\
of remote objects must be obferved. But let me afk, What foulnefs of wet and\
dust can stick to smooth bodies, which rain, hail, or fnow do n\'f4t wasn off; But\

they reprefented men or women; like figures of snow partly dissolvedt by tke sun-\
beams.\
 speak not here so much against the dropping upon and muddling such objects,.\
as. of the abuse when the cause of such an effect does not appear; for withoux\
 probable reason why  thing should be thus, or thus, art becomes obstinacy.\
But to return to our subject.\
It is certainly praift-worthy to take some pains in shewing the stones of\
buildings, and their veining and eyeing, when they are judieisusly and agree-\
ably disposed, according to rule :  say it is commendable to him who under-\
. \
stands perspective.\
The parts of buildings within (which are not so subject zo the teeth af time),\
are not so apt to decay as those witkout ; the cement ajso Jasts- longer; which-\
makes them keep elean and intire, their joints to seem afmost. iivisibie, and th\'e9\
whole to be as one stone. For this reason we must aveidk the miiftkkes of som\'e9\
painters, who vein and eye their work, and afterwards. divide it intaeftones; where-\
by one vein or eye happens oftentimes to run through twubr thr\'e9e stones. at once .\
Whence we must conclude it to be what it is, meer painting and inot the life ::\
whereas  think it the most certain way first to divide che work inte stopes, and.\
then to marble and eye them ; observing chat each stoue have  partieilar eye, t buildings have  beautifil effect when the architecture is fine and well,\
ornamented; and this as well in painting as the dife : &rcerly dispofltion is ope of-\
the best r\'e9afons thereof, without which it cannot have that vaft agreeublenefs.\
 knowing architect takes especial care of che setting\'92the stones of is build-\
ing in such  manner as to blazon its beauty, and improverit,, and\'92thereby cregte\
harmony ; wherefore he disposes the eye-veiny stones in *he prepereft manner;\
for instance, in  single-colonaded porticoy\'92the veiny eyes must oppose each other,\
sloping\
\
\
\
\
\
\

Bdafters, -and al parts that are paired.; so that the work may appear regular at \
distance, taklag especiadt care that they be eyed alike, to keep the eye always in \
balance. between thom. The ftones for the architrave, frize and cornice, fhould\
he fo chofen, that the weining fall perpendicalar, in antter to keep the members\
distinct; which they would not be were the veinr to fall in with the mouldings.\
Ip remains to beobserved in marbling eolumns, that the eye-veins ought to re-\
ceive the: strongest light on the relieved and swelling parts, in order to aid the flat\
of the picture by art; wirich Nature wants nor, as being round of herfelf : where-\
fore it would look ill, that the most dark of thezeye-veins come on the weaker\
parts, because it would render the effect you proposed abortive.\
Imagine  piece of walling divided into three pannels, on each side of which\
stand two columns; the two first ought to oppofe each ocher; theit veming muft\

\
\
\
HITHERTO we haye fpoken of th\'e9 beauty and regularity af intire\
 buildings ; wherefore it is, proper next to treat of fraginents and ruins,\
equally necessary with the former.\
Thave sometimes wondered how-ir hapipens, that among the paintprs of figures\
and landscape, who make use of buildings and gther-brick-work, so fow exhibit\
whole and highly fmished ones : all they thew is, rains, broken walls, and de-\
cayed stones, but feldom itire and perfect ftructures ; becaufe, as  take it,\
they will be at no trouble to fearch antiquity for the forms and most beantiful\
parts of architecture, whereby they might learn to produce something curious :\
 supinity proceeding from their want of knowledge, and ambition to obtain it.\
Although many think that  piece of ruins does not requine so great  regard\
\'e0s an intire building, they are. much mistaken; for the one as well \'92as the other\
depends on measure and proportion : yet some will go and throw down  part of\
\'e0 building, and intermix with it some fragmenis of capitals, pieces of frizes,\
cornices, and the like, of an Order foreign to. the building; which, though very\
wrong, they salve by suppofing, that when  building is in mins no one will have\
the curiosity to examins the mibbisn to see whether- zhere be  wnong capital, frize\
or cornice; and granting such were to be fowad,the fault would be nan\'e9, fince those.\
broken parts might be brought thither gafually. But this is  'lame excuse ;\'92to speak,\

is to shew, that we ought to study the rests of antiquity with care and attention,\
and chiefly to learn the ancient state of old structures, in order to know perfectly\

CHAP. VII. Principal Directions for painting the Ornaments off\

In this sort of work we must, in the first place, have an, eye. to, the regu-\

least hurt it under pretence of decorum, or acting- painterelike; and if at any\
time we are obliged to. alter this conduct, it must nevertheless be in favour of the\
architecture.\
 That the painting, of what kind soever it be, must tend to the lustre and\
magnificence. of the building; . speak with respect to painting the wood-work,\
whether it be marbled or plain.\
 That the ornaments to be painted agree with shose of the room, and be\
governed by the same Order in architecture.\
ia\
 That in pannels, niches and windoms. ought to be artfully painted, whas\
you would have appear to be real on nattirally there, whether tapestry or prospect :\
af tapestry, it must appeas to be such; if  view, it must look like  view; the:\
former by being bordered, and the latter by its sky or sun every wh\'e9re agreeing\
\
with the light of the room-\
 The master must beware of representing in  room chree or more different\
hours of the day at the same time ; nor in histories, unless they be in the mannee\
of tapestry.\
 He must never inclose white marble bafs-reliefs wigh wood-work, as being\
repugnant to custom and likelihood.\
Lastly, fince excess often abates the majesty of  fabric, the artist\'92should avoid\
many littlenesses in the divisions and ornaments :: on such, occasions historical fi-\
gures should not exceed three. or four feet in height, be the paintiug ever so large :\
tapestry figures exceeding the life are unjustifiable ; they look. monstrous in \
fmall room, and lessen  larger.\
\
It were to. be wishied, that great men and lovers, who bespeak such works, had\
some previous knowledge of fuch things as these ;: at leaft, that they were in-\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
formed of them, and would asfent. to the-artist\'92 opinion in the execution of them;\
finoe it is reasonable that his design, if it pleafes, be followed.\
Few artists are sollicitous about :inside-ornaments, either in reference to their\
elegance and splendor,. or their uies andeconvenience ; as is -evident in many old\
masters works, wherein we generally see too great  simplicity, all is plain and.\
mean ; tables, benches, chairs, kitchen-stuff, drinking-vessels, &. And what\
is. more, oftentimes  company of old and young people in  room with never \
chair in it; and sometimes, no more than bare walls, and  curtain hanging for\
no purpose : orgaments and foliage are feldom seen in their works; and when:\
they are, they are so improperly and disjunctively applied, that we must con-\
clude them rather to serve for humour than decorum; certain signs. that such maf-\
ters were ignorant, hoth. of the naturalness, needfuluefs, and application of ob-\
\
jects.\
It is. oertain that the- ancient Greeks and Ropaus were not originally so sumptu\'ac\
ous in their house-furniture as afterwards :they came to be; and it is as easy to\
think, that there was -difference, between the nobility and commonalty, as well\
in their buildings and dress, as in other zespects : the one used plate at his table ;.\
the other, earthen-ware or painted -wood; the, one had bals-reliefs, statues,\
hangings or tapestries-in his house; the other was content with bare walls ; each\
according to. his fancy or ability. Truly  am surprised to think of my first\
ordonnances, and how disjointed my conceptions were ;, often exhibiting  royal\
history in  stable or cottage, and as often the contrary : questionless every maf-\
ter of an house furnishies it with what is proper for each. apartment, whether\
kitchen, chamber, state-room or gallery ; one apartment has  bed or couch and\
its appertunances, chests, tables and chairs; another has hangings more or less\
costly, floor-carpets, stands, sconces, looking-glasses, &. Another has benches,\
 chimney-piece, circular couches fitting the table, and other things. proper to\
the room : and thus, other apartments.\
Some imagine that chairs were: not ancieutly in use, but men sat on cushions,\
as in the Eastern countries, or else rested on couches. When  certain person had\
represented. Aneas and Dido in . stately hall, and she placed on  low small half-\
pace, covered with  carpet, with the young Ascanius in her lap, and Aneas by her\
fide, and some ladies sitting here and there on cushions on the floor (which was\
covered with  green ganpet) . was surprised to see  large round table stand in\
 corner on  side of the painting, and this serving up as for an entertainment,\
and yet not  chair nearit ;  afked the master why the ladies had not chairs or\
benches, and whether this circumstance was thus to be found in history, He\
answered, that in those times neither chairs or benches were known.  could\
hardly forbear laughing; but afking him, Whether the company were to stand to\
their victuals, because of the height of the table, he began to see liis error; yet\
in excuse said, ee They will make use of the couch which stands vonder against\
\'bb, This would have been  tolerable come-off, had the couch been\
the hanging.\
made for the table ; but by ill luck the one was square, the other round.  said\
no more, because  would not augment his- blushes.\
Others.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Others have made the same mistake; as was the case of one who, as the reoort\
goes, representing Abraham\'92 offering, drew him with  scymiter or bending\
sword in his hand, and  straight scabbard by his side.\
 once made the fame blunder, when my inclination for compofition was greater\
than my skill, in the story of Hercules foinning by Omphale.  had feen, in  de-\
sign of Bartholet, that Hercules was much bigger than any of the women; where-\
fore  also drew him larger, and dreffed in wornen\'92 apparel, having fleeves closed\
at hands (like Sardanapalus amongst his women, in Mervan \'92 Historical Chronicfe),\
 distaff in his girdle,  spindte in bis hand, and pearls about his neck; and; in\
order to shew that they were Omphale\'92 cloaths,  placed her by him stark naked.\
Now  appeal to any one how well the garment couid fit Omphale, seeing it was\
neither too short or too streight for Hercules, though half as tall again as fhe. But\
 afterwards rectified my conduct.\
It is plain that such overfights proceed from ignorance or lame instruction,\
and principally in what concerns embelfishment;  say, embellissiment of any\
kind whatsoever, whether within or without doors ; for few know the importance\
of this part of art, and the uncommon effects of it.\
We may, from tlie works of old and judicious masters, here and there bor-\
row some of their thoughts, and use them in  proper mamer in our own works.\
The famous Pouffin, in his finding of Moses, shews the Nile, with  water-god;\
and with good reason (as we fhall prove in the chapter treating of the authority\
painters have to represent spiritual and manimate beings under hyman forms) :\
but it is ridiculous, in my opimon, that the same figure, with all its adjuncts,\
fhould be placed on the strand of  river, and near it Narcissux viewing himself\
in the water ; on  supposition that, if it be but  water-god, all is well; for,\
thinks the mafter,it suits well.-It is  fine figure-- Befides if Poussin durst do\
It, Why may not we ) But it is against reason; indeed, were the sphinx and\
children left out, it may be passable enough.\
Who sets out  room of entertainment, and it does not shew whether the din-\
ner be over or not, by the cloth laid, bottles, glaffes, cisterns, and all things in\
order, as before dinner; and empty bottles lying in disorder, empty difhes, \
dog gnawing  bone, chairs displaced, table-cloth half turued up, and such like,\
after dimer, Or,\
Who can approve in Testa\'92 dipping of Aehilles, Thetis\'92 lymg in an open gal-\
lery, where also is  cradle  for moveable embellishments, it is improper td shew Mark Anthony and Cleo-\
para in their grandeur and luxury, without  retinue, and as in  private colla-\
tion, seeing we know they had such  crowd of mufic, buffoons, juggiers, and\
other loofe people about them. Or can we represent Crift lying in the manger,\
attended by Joseph and Marv, and the three kings waiting on him, and that in \
stable full of beast-provender, and on the wall  fan and stail hanging; befides\
other utenfils of husbandry, and yet not  countryman or servant to appear; or \
chest, box, saw or square to be seen ; (xhether Joseph hired the stable, or found\
\'e2t void of people, is another consideration ;) moreover, one of the principat\
figures\
\
\
\
\
\
\
gures is in  fuit of armour, and bare-headed, and yet his head-piece is not to be\
feen.\
One of my fehow-disciples once painted  collation; and  afked him, why he\
put not knives on the table \'e0 He answered, That knives were not aatique. Very\
well, thought , are then the bread\'92 and meat, and  three-legged stool wich  back\
standing by, antique  is not improper, though  small circumstanee, that  chamber-pot be placed\
by  bed-fide, when  person is in it ;. even were there also at day-break  lamp\
either burning or extinguished, and such like things; whereby we may judge,\
what other circumstances are required.\
From all which confiderations it is plain, that  judicious master must take par-\
ticular thought about the by-works; seeing it is. as bad to. leave out something\
ghat is needful, as to add what is unnecessary.\
CHAP. VIIE. Of the Pictures proper to various Apartments.\
xVHE nature, property and use of pictures in general, is, to keep the senses,.\
by  pleafing variety of objects, as figures, landscape, &. in  continual\
einploy and contemplation.\
Their nature has- near affinity with that of the things they reprefent, when\
those are done by  skilful hand, and therefore they can, when natural things are\
wanting, fufly fatify.\
Thein preperty lies in their \'92application to meet places; and they cannot be\
displaced without hurting, nay undloing naturalnefs.\
As for the use oft pictures, it is in the occasion we have for them, and the\
glaoes they are to ferve for, in order to-gratify the senses of the ouners ; they\
must be well expressed, and fall in with the architecture in the agreement of the\
various objects wich the ornaments of the buldings.\
Ef tkis-be uuintelligible, Pfhah endeavour to explain myself.  say then, That\
it is not sufficient for  painter to design work for apartments at random, and\
introduve therein what fancies he pleases, or best understands; for, he ought to.\
aonsider, whether it agree with. the place, and be proper there; if therefore he\
would go on with certainty, he must, in the first place, consult the architecture,.\
und then the three poines following.\
 The quality, or condition of the building:\
 The building itself.\
 The aparemenes in iti.\
First, let him consider whetlier the owner be  prince, lord, magistrate, or\
Ierokaet.\
Secondly, whether the building be public, as  town-house, church, palace, &..\
ar pr\'eavete, as- far  merchant or eitizen.\
Lastly, whecher ie be an hall, chamber, parlotrr, kitchin, or che like.\
Thus\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Thus far in general\'92: but if we bulld  galaser for  kiag, the apartments must be\
contrived for other uses, than those for  merchant, or even  town-house; for in this\
latter we find many rooms fitted, for purposes, oppsite to \'e0 palace ; as may be seen\
in that fine- model, :the Stadt-house, at Amsterdant, where architecture has wonder-\
 fully disposed all the rooms to their several uses;. nor is the judgment of the pain-\
ters or architects less conspictous in the proper placing the pictures, in each apart-\
ment ; for each piec\'e9 (chiefly sculpture ) is so ordered, as to allude tg the rooms ;\
whence we know, what uses, the rooms are put  and by the rooms, what the\
printings, stone-figures and bass-reliefs signify.\
Wherefore it is very necessary to consider the nature of the apartments in order\
govern our work thereby ; as first,\
to\
in the hall belew, fuits well  gray bass-relief; or else trophies painted on the\
walls after the life.\
\
\
\
In an antichamber, where people wait for commands, gray ornaments are alse\
best; sometimes intermixed with slowers, but very sparingly.\
In an audience, or presence-room should be tapestries, or pictures with figures,\
as big as the life, of magnificent transactions which happened in apartments or\
palaces.\
\
In the ladies visiting-room must be other sorts of embellishments, such as fruit,\
 flowers, landscapes, sine thoughts, virtuous representations, and the moft cloathed\
and modest histories.\
In the nursery, agree bafs-r\'e9liefs, and painted emblems or morals; whereby\
the children may learn. good manners, and\'92 inure tender years to virtuous actions :\
to these may be added, some flowers, fruit, birds and such like.\
In the kitchin may be seen the representations of culinary furnitute, hunting\
of deer, the picture. of some maid-or-gther servant, or  dog or cat; but these\
must be mostly gray or wood-colour, on account of the smoke, which otherwise\
would sully the colours.\
In the gallery may appear all sorts of hunting-equipage painted on the walls\
from the life.\
In thet upper-rooms suit landscape, and all kinds of beautiful prospects.\
In the mafter\'92 bed-chamber are proper, some beautiful faces, and naked child-\
iren painted after the life.\
\
In the childrens bed-room nothing must be seen but foliage or bragch-work.\
The study may be adorned with paintings, in gray marble, of learned. men,\
philosaphers, &.\
In the summer-house, being  place for the enjoyment of company and enter-\
tainments, suit nothing better than merry Bacchanalian pieces, sportive, herdsmen,\
dancings, brooks and fountains.\
We proceed now to the decorations over chimneys, and on doors, in each\
apartment.\
\
Over the dining-room chimney place, Comus, god of meals, accompanied by\
Taste and Smell; and on the door, Latitia, or Joy.\
Over the hall-chimney may be Decorum, or Authority, accompanied by. Pallas,\
or Virtue, and Hono\'92, or Honour; and on the door, Understandipg. :\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Over the lady\'92 visiting-room chiinney, Modesty, accompanied by Obedience\
and Diligence; and on tne door, Fidelity.\
Over the chimney in  saloon, or meeting-room for youth, may be seen Inventus,\
or Youth, attended by Grace and Eloquence; and on the door, Gaudium, or Joy.\
Over the nursery chimney place Education, and by it  young branch tied to \
stick; and on the door, Obedience.\
Over the kitchen chimney, Prudentia, of Prudence, accompanied by Ceres and\
Bacchus; and on the door Diligence.\
Over the bed-chamber chimney, Quiet; and the door, Security.\
Over the study, or closet chimney, Wisdom, or Science; and on the door,\
Harpocrates.\
On the doors of side-rooms going out of the hall, Clemency and Vigilance ;\
and between them, Oeconomy.\
On the pantry-door, Abundance.\
On the cellar-door, Silenus.\
On the garret or loft-door, Winter.\
On the garden-door, Flora.\
On the orchard-door, Pomona.\
In the green-house, between the stoves, the figure of persons who, have been\
transformed into trees and plants, as Cyparissus, Myrrha, Daphne, &. On the door\
within, Apollo; and on the outside, Diana.\
On the stable-door, all sorts of stable-appertenances, as  bridle, saddle, houfing,\
stirrups, dung-fork, shovel, curry-comb, &.\
On the privy-door, Momus laughing.\
And now, that  may conceal nothing from the artists,  shall subjoin the pic-\
tures proper to be put into chimneys; which may be various ; because we are\
not confined to the fire, as being only used during the winter-season; the spring,\
summer and autumn afford us  large field for fine inventions; and since the place,\
for three quarters of the year, becomes any thing we sind proper, we can either\
shut them up, or leave them open, or contrive, in niches all sorts of statues or\
busts, bass-reliefs and other ornaments, as cisterns, vasa, flower-pots, bafkets of\
fruit, mufical instruments, globes and such like : we can have them be open with\
doors or without, with one door or two half ones, and represent vistos or pros-\
pects, such as  flower-garden,  public place with fountains,  street of houses,\
 grove, lane, frontispiece, pantry, wine-cellar, an alcove with  couch, or  li-\
brary, and such like. In fine, we may introduce any thing that is different from\
the furniture of the apartment. But care must be taken, that the painting have\
 natural and high horizon, with little or no sky, to gain more depth; vistos of\
apartments one within another are also not improper; but if we represent with-\
out-door-prospects as aforesaid, it is more proper to paint doors, seemingly to give\
the room-air: and seeing it often happens, that such  painting cannot have the\
most advantageous light, and is sometimes in shade by the projecture of the chimi-\
ney, we should contrive the work accordingly, and so as not to appear like paint-\
ing, but nature itself.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The designs proper to such places (for the fake of those who are not fertile in-\
invention) may be such as follow.\
 Spring. Flora, setting out with  gay and joyful air, has  basket of spring-\
flowers under her left arm; with her right hand behind she  little lifts up her\
gown : her left foot rests on  step, and her right lifts up; her breast is somewhat\
to the light, behind, in  low off-scape, is seen  parterre, ornamented with vases:\
behind her, we may place another figure in shade, ascending the steps, in order to\
sling off the off-scape, and bring forward the fore-figure. Flora must be propor-\
tioned to the size of the fire place ; if not as big as life, let her be  young damsel,\
and, if-the face be fhaded by the chimney, make good advantage of the re-\
flexion; the same design may be also executed with children.\
 Summer. Pomona with  basket of fruit in her lap; and in the off-scape, an-\
orchard, and some Cupids busily gathering fruits and flowers.\
 Autumn. Bacchus represented in an entranee or gate-way, hung round with\
vine-branches and grapes; and, if you please,  young satyn by him, with  cup :\
this-design may be also represented with children-\
 Anteros. as  youth, crowned with laurels, stands on . threffiold, leaning on\
 torch or else  long arrow, pointing inwardly to  library, wherein are an astrolabe\
and globe, and against the wall \'e0 lyre hanging;. his-garment, fastened\'92 on each\
shoulder, is-reddish. purple ; his look agreeable and majestic; his mouth open,\
as if complimenting somebody to come in; he stands on the left side against the\
door, which comes half in snhade, against the off-scape, so that he is strongly set\
off ; his face and under-parts are fronting; his breast turning to the light; this-\
design either left or right is equally good, and so are the- before- mentioned,\
 Cupid is seen here : sweetly smiling, having  flask on his arm, and  spax-\
water-bottle in-his hand, which- he holds up, as if he were saying,\'97\
Rare waters!\
By him is an elegant stand or tea-table, on which another Capid is placing  silver\
salver with- glasses, and  silver sugar-box and spoon; behind may be seen  winc-\
cellar- lighted by  candie or lamp; we should also discover part of  summer-\
 or fountain, or  gallery, &.\
 In this design we shew- serenade by three boys; the first drest. as.  Punch-\
an-ello, with  bag-pipe, hautboy or flute; the second as an harlequin, with  vio-\
lin; and the third as  Scaramouch with  guitar, and all three in their proper-\
postures : Harlequin in set- posture stands to the right against  post, holding the\
violin ta his ear; Punch-an-ello, sieting against the other post on the threfhiold,\
holds his flute from his mouth, and looks forward, laughing and shewing his teeth;.\
his head finking backwards somewhat into hisneck : Scaramouch is in the middle,\
with his-guitar under his arm, and his head quite sunk intohis fhoulders ; he is\
attentive, holding his fore-finger to his nose, and his legs closes Behind these\
buffoons we might shew  balustrade aver  water in shade, and on it an ape sit-\
ting; in the water may be gondolas, with mafks in them ;, or else \'e0 street, and\
such like.\
Because the breadth of the aforesaid opening-cannot be very great, you may, by\
shutting the door more or less, or by placing somewhat between it, get advan-\
tageous shades, if the matter require it: there ought at most but afigure and half\
to\
\
\
\
\
\
\
to be in the light, and  third, in shade. The colours will effect the same.\
Such\
paintings should not be inuddled, but boldly handled, and the lights strong.\
Thus iuch for without-dodr views.; proceed we now to designs for, \'e9himneys ,:\
which are closed.\
  vase of white marble, gold or silver, or the belly gold, and the neck\
and foot of Lapis Lazuli, in  niche of red marble, or porphry ; and the jaumbs\
to be of  lighter stone, hung with festoons of all sorts of fine leaves, interinixed\
with slowers: these festoons should be very large, lik\'e9 two arms, and spreading,\
in order to break the light ground, that the middle-ornament, whether white\
marble, silver or gold, may have the gr\'e9ater force.\
 The bust of Bacchus in white marble, erowned \'e9ither with, vine leaves , and\
branches and grapes, or else mulberries with theif greens; on each side, on \
ground of free-stone, festoons of whitt and blue grapes, and between those may\
be placed some proper instruments, as cymbals, timbrels, tabors, hautboys and\
Pan\'92 flutes. The bust is on  pedestal of Pisan-marble; in  niche, as before ;\
the niche must rise as much as possible, that the bust may have its full'h\'e9ight;\
but if the chimney and niche do not admit of  figure in full proportion, you\
may make  boy of it: if you leave out the pedestal, you can place the same in\
the niche, but  third less in height. Under the niche may be  faint bass-re-\
lief of grey or other marble; or else  festoon, of pine leaves, intermixed with\
Tome beautiful flowers.\
\
\
The hust of Apollo; and on each side some musical instruments, either\
\
ainted as carved, or natural. Under the niche may be  square pannel, and on\
at  carved torch, witha quiver across, through  garland of laurel. , Among the.\
some rolls of paper, with geometric and other fuch figures ; for these can be bet-\
ter ordered in bass-relief, tnan among those naturally painted.\
  deep niche; in which may be seen  table, with an elegant stand or foot\
of sine wood, partly gilt : on the table, china tea-furniture, as dishies, saucers,\
tea-pot, and  silver chased tea-cannister: or else coffee equipage; as  silver cof-\
fee-pot,  silver salver with pipes,  knife, some tobacco in  paper,  fine cha-\
fing dish with fire; and on the ground, in the snade, some bottles of wine.\
 The table in this design may be put to various uses ; it may be served with\
melons, or baskets of fruit, as peaches, nectarins, apricocks, silberds, &.\
 On such  table may be also music-books and instruments, as  lute,\
violin, hautboy, &. And on the ground,  cistern of water, with bottles of\
wine standing upright therein.\
 In this last, we may place  round bass-relief, representing  sitting child,\
of flefhi-coloured marble, on  blue ground, blowing bubbles:: round it,  white\
marble moulding; and underneath,  festoon.\

CHAP. IX. Descriptian of several Pictures adapted to the five\
Orders in Architecture.\
INCE no manner of describing fine apartments is more proper than this,\
 which exhibits things as if we really saw them,  shall therein give an\
architectonic view of each Order, and in as conspicuous  manner as  myself\
conceive it. The particulars must then be well regarded, because they are so-\
linked. together, that, by overlooking  small circumstance, the whole chain\
may be broke, without ever getting  true idea of the thing.\
We shall confine the subject to five apartments, and describe in each the pic-\
tures, which shew the nature, height, custom, and other properties relating to-\
the Orders of this building: and since the Tuscan Order, either in parts or alto-\
gether, is. rough and massy, we shall exhibit here,\
The Picture of POLYPHEMUS and GKLATEK.\
Polyphemus, on the sea-shore, inflamed with the love of the beautiful Galateay\
who came to divert herself on the pleasant, surges of the billows, strove to please :\
her with-his singing and music, and thereby to gain her favours; but she was-\
deaf to his fuit: his rough-hewn enormous size; and frightful aspect were her\
aversion; wherefore she shuns him, and derides his addresses.\
 calm sea was seen. On tlie second ground, to the left, appcared  vast high:\
rock, hanging over the sea, almost to the point of sight; all rough, and over-run\
with mofs and herbage, going off to the left very cragged; up to it huge stones\
were piled on each other, as steps (but three times higher), from the edge of the\
water ; on the lowermost of them sat the monstrous Cclops, as  wild and savage\
man; his skin very swarthy and hairy; his head and beard full of-bristly black\
hair, spreading over his shoulders and breast; he had but one eye-brow, and that\
as wide as his forehead, hanging over the eye (which, according to Homer, was\
as large as  fhield), placed in the middle of his wrinkled forehead; his blubber\
lip turned up towards his broad and flat nose, like that of  negroe; shewing\
his teeth, set like those of  saw, out of his gluttonous jaws, with  grim Jook.:\
by him lay his staff, whichxlike those of herdsmen), was crooked at one end, and,\
according to Ovid, bigger than the mast of  ship :  knapsack or pouch hung at\
his side ; his raiment was goats-skin sewed together, which he had shook from off\
his shoulders, possibly to discover to Galatea his conceited fine shape : this garment\
was cream-colour, spotted with black. He \'92sat very rudely, leaning  little back\
against the rock ; his left leg was stretched out towards the water, and his right,\
with the foot fore-shortened, lifted up, lay over  piece of the rock ; his flure,\
with an hundred pipes, he held, in his left hand, up at his mouth, as if he had\
been just playing. His head inclined, with his eye to heaven, towards Cepid,\
who stood near and flattered him; his, mouth was open, as if he were singing,\
and\
\
\
\
\
\
\
and his right hand, upright on his knee, seemed to beat time. It was curious to\
see the method Cunid took in the midst of his play to stick an arrow into Poly-\
phemus\'92 breast without his being sensible of it.\
Cupid was about half as big as the Cyclops arm or leg ; so that, though he had\
elimbed up the second step, he could scarce reach the Cyclops shoulder, in order\
to stroke, with his right hand, the hair from the giant\'92 eye; when, pointing\
with  stretched finger of the same hand towards the sea, he laughing stuck with\
the other an arrow in Polyphemus\'92 breast, under his lifted arm. Cupid was of \
beautiful rosy complexion, his hair yellowish white ;  quiver, tied with  red\
safh, hung by his side, and his bow lying near hiin.\
The fair Galatea, in the mean time sitting on  large sea-shell in the middle of\
the nearest distance, was drawn by two dolphins, encompassed with tritons and\
nereids, sounding their shelly trumpets, and playing on timbrels and other in-\
struments ; she sat fronting in the shell, and the dolphins, which sne guided\
gently, turned to the right; she was foHowed by other tritons, bearing beautiful\
naked virgins, and  crowd of sea monsters, who, gradually uniting with the\
farthest distance, disappeared. This whole crowd was grouped in the form of\
 crescent ; Galatea appeared to surpass all in beauty.\
lat first thought this might possibly be Venus herself; because three beauties\
attended her, whom  took to be the three Graces; but she looked somewhat\
younger, and not so wanton as Venus is usually represented ; her breast also rose\
less, and her head-attire was quite different from Venus; for her white hair, twist-\
ed in tresses, and elegantly flowing, was here and there stuck with white bell-\
flowers; and the locks in each side tied together on the head in  tuft, and, hang-\
ing down both before and behind, made plainly appear, how gently she glid over\
the billows. What most charmed m\'e9 was, that, in\'92 this great crowd, one might\
see the particular sways, turnings and affections of every figure; on\'e9 moved slow-\
ly, another swiftly, as their beards, hair and veils plainly shewed; some bending\
backward, as blowing, others forward almost to the water; some were full of\
foam; others swimming as evenly as if. they moved on looking-glass, so that their\
glitter was scarce visible in the water. This second Venus (as . call her) had \
greenish blue scarf, which, coming over her lap, twined about her right leg ;\
advancing her naked left leg, she set her foot on the scroll of the shell; her head,\
 little flung back, inclined to her right shoulder; her breast projecting; and\
the right arm, stretching cross, her body, supported her rein-hand on her naked\
knee ; her countenance was modest and smiling; her cyes somewhat downissi,\
made me think that th\'e9 sun was too powerful for her, but,  more nearly per-\
ceived,, she was talking to  sea-nymph or nereid, who, near her chariot, lay be-\
hind on  triton, staring towards the shore at Polyphemus, whither Galatea, with\
her left hand  little fore-shortened, was pointing; the top of the rock was al-\
most shaded by.  cloud, which shade run across the piece, and set off Galatea and\
he zetinue. The whole group was agrecably lighted; and \'92though the light was\
strong, yet the shades near the water were soft and melting, by the glitter or re-\
flexions of it, which, in my opinion, was  fine piece of conduct; behind the\
rock, towards. the right side, appeared beautiful tracts of verdant land, adorned\
witfi\
\
\
\
\
\
\
with variety of \'92trees, extending crescent-ways by the point of sight, and sdme\
herds of oxen, goats and fheep, were grazing; in the off-scape were hills; and on\
the right side  town; forwards, on the same side in the corner,  piece of  sea-\
rock appeared, whiel Galatea and her company seemed to avoid.\
As we have reprefented the persons of Polyphemas and Galatea, so it will not bo\
amiss to shew those of the tritons and nereids also. Pausanias describes. the tritons\
thus: Their upper parts, from the nagel, were humnan, but cov\'e9red with thin,\
shiarp and rough scales, and downwards their bodies, instead of feet, ended in \
large split tail; their hair long and bluiffi, and entangled as if in  twist; their\
cyes greenisn; their ears, nofe, and mouth, like those of men, the latter very\
large and wide; their teeth like those of  panther; their fmgers and-nails like\
the outside of an oyster-shieil, or such  substance ; on their breasts and bellies,\
and undet their ears, they had fins like little wings, which helped them in\
swimming.\
Alexander ob Alexandro says, that the uereids are shaped like beautiful virgins\
down to the navel; but the lower parts, joining together like  fisn, end in an\
eel\'92 tail; their heads are mostly unveiled, their hair disheveled, and beset with\
pearls, coral, and other sea productions.\
Second Pictilre.\
   \
Polyphemus, from the top of the rock, where he sat playing, viewing his beloved\
Galatea bestowing her smiles on Acis, was. so enraged \'92thereat, that, full of fury,\
he tore  piece from the rock, with intention to crush them both; which Gala-\
tea escaped by diving into the sea, put Acis, not nimble enough in running, was\
struck with it.\
This piece is  fellow or sequel of the preceding: the rock is here placed on \
contrary side to the former; behind it an island allo, in the form of  crescent,\
towards the right extends acrofs ; beyond it the sea is seen along the horizon, the\
rock on the right side goes down in rough steps, and follows  fandy way forward\
on its left, to the middle of the piece where it ends in the frame. The unhappy\
Acis falls here in the sand under the huge piece of rock, wijh his arms extended,\
and his face downwards, yet somewhat turned towards the sca ; He is not quite\
dead, because the great weight rolling in the air only took Fim in the-leg as he\
was running ; the enraged eclops not content with this, foams at mouth, and\
gripes an heavier piece of the rock in order to destroy the faithless Galatea; Me-\
vara, with her smoaking pitchy torch, eggs him on, and enflaming him with hel-\
lisni fury, points towards the sea at the objects ofhis revenge, at which he: looks\
back ; and now what  force he sheus in rending the rock ; all his members are\
distorted, his sinews stretch, and his muscles swell, drawing in his mouth on one\
side, with the upper teeth, and his eyes is half shut. Does he not look as if he\
were anatomised or flead ; nay, the least ofhis muscles works and presses through\
his thick skin; his hair stands an end, and his beast-skin garment being got loose\
from his girdle, drags on the ground, and he treads on it with his left foot ; the\
goat\'92 feet hanging to it appear to fly about according to his motion; he bends\
doubl\'e9\
\
\
\
\
\
\
double ons ofhis kn\'e9es almost tonching his breast, and with his right foot against\
the rocks he, with both hands and all his force, tears off  piece of it. Tisiphone,\
half behind him with her upper parts above his head, and her facea little fore-\
fhortened and downwards points with her whole right hand (not  finger)at Galatea;\
her left hand are some serpents and  fire-brand; her garment is black or dark grey,\
here and there stained with blood ; the sea swells and the billows beat with great\
violence against the rock, as if they would swallow up the shore. On the left side\
eomes Galatea in her chariot drawn by two dolphins, not gliding, as before, but\
tosfing sometimes on the topof the waves, and sometimes beneath theni, with the\
hinder part of herchariot almost upright; she stands stoping, with her arms slungout,\
looking back with amazement, and her reins- slack, her disordered locks sly in loose\
tr\'e9sses-against the wind, caused by her swift motion; her veil\'92got loose, drops be-\
hind her into the fea\'92; her lovely members are overpowered by her inward\'92\
troubles ; the muscles of her neck, before smooth, now rise, her heart seems to\
pant, and her legs faltering, she seems to sink ; her grace leaves her, and she is no\
longer Galatea, fright has robbed her of her fresh colour, and she is rather \
marble statue than  living person.\
Considering this ordonnance, Istood surprised. Is it possible, thought , to be:\
 paintingp It is certainly past my understanding ; it is reality itself, and yet it\
must be  picture ;. for what is too hard for the pencil of  judicious master) Be\
it what it will, it is real nature to me, and  am satisfied. But, to proceed,\
In the off-scape, on the left side, some ships appear in  storm, and two in the\
middle of the piece riding at anchor, and  boat landing some people : this made\
me thing that it was Ulysses, who had  design on the eye of the cruel and\'92 glut-\
tonous devourer of men : it is even sa,  can perceive them to be Greeks by their\
armed gallies and whole equipage ; the\'92sea is white with-froth, and the waves\
beat towards. the point of sight; the air as in commotion and full of driving clouds\
whichicause here and there large ground fhades-; the main light falls on Polyphe-\
mus, and the under part of the rock, and takes in almost the whole shore sor-\
wards; but the stone which falls on Acis, is with his under parts in shade, caused\
by  bit of  fide rock which strongly sets it off against the light : Cupid in the mean:\
time, above the horison, comes flying forward, turning full of sorrow and cries,\
to the right; down where Acis lies ; his left hand is up to one eye, and his right,\
wlierein is his bow, over his head, te shade it from the sun; his quiver is reversed\
and the arrows drop into the sea ; Acis lies on the fore ground with his shoulders\
bare, and he is seen  little right sideways ; his hands half covered with sand, are\
wide open as if he were swimming, his hair is dark, and his garment dark green.\
Galatea, between him and Polyphemus, with the rock, runs acrofs the piece ; she is\
seen right sideways, and her face is fronting; the off-scape, consisting of hills,\
boscage, beautiful lawns and rivers, is clearly lighted : there appear also some\
aattle grazing, as-in the former piece, under the impendance of the rock, and\
close to the sea, lies  red cloth garment in shade; undoubtedly left there by Aeis,\
which was, in my opinion, artfully contrived, in order to point out the place\
where this- unhappy couple had been sitting; the shore is covcred with cockles\
and. many other sea productions.  . large greenisn coloured tortoise is seen, mak-\
ing\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
ing froin under Acis towards the sea ; Polyphemus\'92 slute lies by him, but the bag\
still hangs by his side ; the top of the rock is dark against light clouds driving\
thither ; the light comes from the side of the piece.\
After  had exactly weighed all the circumstances of the two pieces,  was con-\
sidering whaj the master\'92 principal drift might be, and found them to be an ex-\
ample of love, or slattery of the senses wantonly affecting the body without vio-\
lence, in the person of Polyphemus, in the first piece : and, in Galatea an easy in-\
difference without any passion ; for  perceived her motion was smooth, and her\
beauty in its perfection ; she was not attended by any Cupids, because such as\
have fins instead of wings usually wait on the Nereids.  was so rejoiced at this\
observation, that  cannot express it.\
Inquiring likewise what might be learned from the second picture,  concluded\
that the author intended to express the unhappy issue of love in the person of Ga-\
latea ;  passion both warm and sudden; for the least disorderly affection puts the\
chief members of the body in commotion and disturbs the peace of the rest ; that\
of Polyphemus is violent; Cupid is subject to compafsion only, as  think : where-\
fore he is represented crying, possibly to shew  childishiness, for children com-\
monly laugh or cry about things which seem strange to them.\
Commentonthe Characters in the aforesaid Pictures.\
Polyphemus, the Sicilian herdsman, the most savage and gigantic of all the Gclops,\
was, according to Homer, son of Neptune and the nymph Thosa; the word Gyclops\
signifies, having but one eye in the middle of the forehead, whereby some would\
imply, the thunder and lightening, according to the Greck names of his com-\
panions, Brontes, Sterope and Pyradmon, and other effects of the air, round which\
they are always attending in readiness at the command of Jupiter; the air, they\
say, being placed in the middle of Heaven, as an eye in the head. Thus the\
commentators on Hefiod in his Theogonia (Deorum Origo deliver.\
Hesiod says, that Galatea, daughter of Nereus and Doris, is so named from her\
whiteness, signifying parabolically, the froth of the sea ; wherefore this poet af-\
cribes toher white hair and  face like milk: he says further,that some writers would,\
by Galatea, allude to the sweet water which falls into the sea, because nothing is\
sweeter than milk ; and by Polyphemus, the air, which loves the sweet food.\
The youth Acis, is called by Ovid, son of the river Faunus and Simethis, being\
both young, beautiful and well shaped.\
The Tritons are counted by most of the poets, sons of Neptune and Amphitrita,\
because the sea, says Vermander, is esteemed the mother or producer of many\
ftrange creatures, which its element is very inclineable to ; and the ancient hea-\
thens perceiving thus somewhat wonderful, ascribed to the sea some divinity, as\
they also did to those tritons, whose help they implored in dangers at sea. But they\
who examine more narrowly into the Agyptian hieroglyphics, say, that the tritons\
by their amphibious form of being human upwards, and dolphin-like dovnwards,\
are compaired to the two watry virtues, saltness and sweetness, teaching us that\
both good and evil spring from their nature and constitution, to wit, good from\
the\
\
\
\
\
\
\
the human nature, and nothing but evil from the fifhinefs ; for ths human form,\
says Phurnutus, is compared to sweet water, which is proper for the aliment of\
noxiousto the animals of the carth and air, and also to plants, causing them to\
die and wither, as we read in Plutarch, of the nature of things.\
Touching the Nereids, we find in Plato, that there were an hundred of them;\
H\'e9fiod says hfty, and gives us their names ; of which Glauce, Cymodoce, Galatea,\
Cyrene, Drimo, Deiopeia, Xantho, Arethusa, Phillodoce, Euridice, Nes\'e6e, Leucothoe,\
Spio, Thalia, Cydippe, Pafithea, Lycorias, Ligea, Ephyre, Opis, Asie, Clymene and\
Halia, are the principal : their lower parts being hsni-like has given the poets oc-\
cafion to feign, that they were very beautiful nymphs who accompanied their\
gods, viz. the Ocean, Thetis, Neptune, and Nereus and Doris their father and mo-\
ther, and many others, who signify the different qualities and various effects of\
the waters : they were stiled mothers of the floods, because the rainy clouds, be-\
ing exhaled from the sea, are the origin of floods ; wherefore, on account of the\
virtue of the earth\'92 moisture towards the procreation of animals, trees, fruits,\
flowers, &. they were worshipped by the heathens as the nurses of them.\
Having largely handled the off-spring and signification of the characters in both\
Har-\
the aforesaid pictures, we shall pafs to  general explication of the latter.\
mony in music arises from an agreeable mixture of discording and flat sounds with\
concording and sharp ones ; but in love it is otherwise, where dissimularity can-\
not be brought to agree, or two hearts to join which do not sympathise by an\
harmony of humours. The hideous make of the Cyclops is frightful to the beau\'ac\
teous Galatea, who shuns him for her dearer Acis ; by Pobyphemus, in this last storys\
we learn that those persons sue in vain, who flatter themselves that their trouble-\
some addresses gain the aff\'e9ctions of those who hate them : contrarily, Acis blessed\
with the smiles of his mistrefs, shews us the danger of exposing ourselves to the\
resentment of  powerful rival, from whom at any time we must expect nothing\
but death. It may also,  say, serve for an example of the power of beauty,\
which so bewitched Acis, that he could not forbear loving, though at the expence\
of his life. Thus we are bewildered by our own inclinations, and brought to the\
place of inevitable misfortunes, where we are plunged in tears to the weakning of\
our vital strength, as in this fable of the young and amorous Acis when Galaiea\
transformed him into  fountain.\
Opposite to these poetic pictures,  saw two others treating of love, but differ-\
ently, as being the sacred stories of Samson and Delilah; the sense of the first is\
this:\
Third Table or Picture.\
Samson, resting on Delilahis lap, his hair is cut off whilst he sleyt, and the Philis-\
tines lie in wait to seize him-\
Here Samson is sitting near the center of the painting on  carpet which covers\
the floor, and reaches over three circular steps before  couch, whereon sits De-\
lilah, with his head in her lap ; her right foot rests on  small foot-stool, agaiast\
which he is leaning, with his left knee somewhat raised ; the foot of that leg is\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
under his right thigh, which is somewhat fore-shortened, but the leg is seen at\
full length, with his shin fronting ; his right arm hangs down between his legs,\
resting on the outfide of his hand, which is seen inwardly ; supporting his head on\
his left arm over Delilah\'92 lap, with the elbow standing out ; he is all in an heap,\
and his head hangs  little forward and sidling.\
Delilah\'92 right arm is about his neck, and her upper parts bend  little over to\
the left, when, looking another way, sne with her left hand pushes from her an\
old woman, who stepsback, having both her hands joined under her chin, and \
key in one of them, and with her mouth shut smiles at Delilah. Delilah\'92 eyes are\
fixed on  young man standing near her, who gently lifting up Samsen\'92 hair is cut-\
ing over him with his arms extended, and legs close, and his garment between\
them, that it may not touch the sleeping Samson; near him stands,  boy with \
basket to hold the cut locks ; he looks back at  Philistine, who is coming towards\
them with  rope in his hand ; he pouts with his mouth, and has  finger thereon,\
in order to make the other keep back  little. The aforesaid Philistine walks stoop-\
ing, advancing his right leg, and supporting his body with the other, which is\
quite bent ; he thrusts out his head, and his elbow is drawn in, holding the rope\
with both hands close to his body. Another on the right side behind him is lift-\
ing up  curtain and looking after him. Between\'92these two rises  large column,\
and another on the other fide of the latter, whereon the aforesaid curtain hangs :\
these curtains and their pedestals run towards the point of sight. Behind the last\
Philistine stand three or four more. On the left side behind the old woman, ap-\
pears part of the couch, supported by  lion\'92 paw; the top of the couch has an\
ornament of foliage, from whence projects  woman\'92 head with breasts of yel-\
sowiffi ivory, representing an harpy, and  spread wing supports  gilt moulding-\
From the top of the couch hangs  light reflecting drapery with tassels down to\
the ground. Forward, in the corner, appears  large pillar, or  piece of walling\
against which stands an hexagonial leafed table, supported by three mermaids,\
back to back, on  triangular foot of black stone. On the table are several bags-\
of money. From behind the table,  young servant-like man is gently advancing\
with more bags of money in his arms, looking back suddenly with knit eye-brows,\
over his right shoulder at the couch : at his heels is another bearer with  copper\
vessel full of money, which he lugs very heavily before him ; his upper parts\
falling back, and he screwing his mouth, puffing and blowing; he is well set,\
of  sedate countenance, and his hair and beard are,frizzled. Beside the couch,\
below the steps, in the shade, is seen the statue of Venus on  pedestal, misteriously\
representing Astaroth. Next it stands  commander of the Philistines with  staff in\
his hand ; he somewhat thrusts out his head, and if  mistake not, thene are more\
people behind him, lost in the snade. On the right side of the steps, close to the\
foremost column stands  censor, the smoak whereof ascends up the column. The\
apartment is hung round with dark tapestries of landseape, and between them. are-\
broad pilasters. The floor forward is inlaid with banded compartments.\
Delilah is wantonly dressed, having  nice head attire mixed with ribbons and\
pearls.  long hair-lock of  brown shining colour comes over her bosom, her-\
garmeng\
\
\
\
\
\
\
gartent of white sattin hanging so caresly- down her bosom, as to shew- her bare\
breasts and left shoulder ; the fore-part of the right leg is also naked from below\
the knee ; the thigh is fore-shortened, and the sandals white; her left leg covered\
by the drapery afore-mentioned hangs down by the couch as if she was standing on\
it, with the foot behind the foot-stool : from her right shoulder hangs slooping, \
beautiful sea-green veil tied on the left side, the flaps whereof are partly on the\
bed, on one side, and down her thigh on the other.\
 Samson is of  large size, and robustly membered, of  swarthy hue, with black\
hair and beard, and hairy breast : his drapery is dark purple, which fastened.\
with  girdle about his body, buckled on his side and gathered about the waist,\
cemes down between his legs, covering the right thigh, the flaps of it finely fold-\
ed, lying sideways on the carpet. The old woman\'92 head is bound with  yel-\
lowish cloth, and her garment violet or blue, with streight sleeves tied under her\
breast and over her hips. The young man with the scifsors is in  short green-\
sleeved coat. The boy next him, the same but somewhat more ordinary : the\
haig of each islight, and tied behind with  white ribbon. The soldier with the\
rope in his hand, is. swarthy, and dressed in  light yellow coat reaching to his-\
knees, with dark and dull iron or copper straps three fingers broad, about the\
waist, over the navel, and the same on the shoulders ; his helmet is plain and of\
copper, ha\'ab  dagger by-his fide, and dark bufkins and sandals, with strings to\
the calves of the legs. The person behind him has also an helmet, in the form of\
 dragon\'92 head ; his body is covered with  beast\'92 skin, and he has  tauncheon in\
his hand. He, who on the-left side, carries the copper vessel with money before\
him, has  light grey cloth rolled about his middie, and coming down half way\
the thighs. The table is eovered with sine red stuff, hanging down on each side.\
The floor carpet is dark, and variegated like Turkey work.\
The light of the piece proceeds from the left \'e0 little fronting, as if from afingle\
window, whereby the middle group and steps receive the broadest light. The\
soldier, with the rope before the steps, is more lighted on  fide. The statue,\
standing in the shade receives  reflexed light from the floor. The commander of\
the Philistines takes  little light on his shoulders. The young man laden with the\
bags of money, is, with the tables next to him, in shade, but the other bearer\
receives the light directly on his raised naked breast.\
Second Table, or Picture.\
After Samson\'92 hair was cut off, and he tied hand and foot, he awakes, and\
finding himself thus wretchedly trapped by Delilak, arises full of wrath, striking\
and pulhing: all away from him as well as he is able, but is at last overpowered\
and seized.\
Here, in his fury, he stands inithe midile of the giece, turned with his left to\
the light, and straddling, hiis feft elbow rises, with the hand and arm down be-\
hind his head ; his right hand comes forward, with the elbow pulled back by \
quite\
rope, by one of the Philistines ; his right leg advances, and the left falls\
back,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
back, yielding to the weight of his heavy body, which bends backwards. Two\
persons lie at his feet, either knocked or kicked down, and the third lies on the\
right side against  balustrade with one hand on the floor, and catching hold of\
the pedestal, with the other ; his head drooping, he spits abundance of blood.\
On the left side of Samson,  littie forward, stands the commander of the Philistiner,\
punching him in the breast with his left fist, and with the right, wherein he holds\
 staffon high, threatning to beat him. Behind the commander stands  soldier,\
. who having flung  rope about Samson\'92 neck, pulls forward the Naxareau heroe\'92\
almost mastered head, whose mouth is clofe, and checks are swelling. Behind\
Samson, another stooping soldier is pulling  rope fastened to his right foot. The\
aforesaid balustrade on the right side backwards, runs towards the point of fight,\
and the door is in the middle of it, through which rufhi in three or four men,\
shouting and armed with truncheons, staves, and other weapons, of whom the\
foremost, with  staffor half pike, seems to strike with all his might at the reeling\
Samson. Their fury is very great on this occasion.\
 little to the left behind Samson, and close to the couch, Delilah is seen em-\
bracing the statue of Venus, and looking back with astonishment ; she is some-\
what high on the steps, which run crofs the piece. Just beyond her, the old wo-\
man is either ffung down or falling, and with one leg  little up, shews her na-\
kedness, by reason of her garment somewhat turned up; she has one hand on the\
sloor, and the other coming forwards. In the corner forwards hangs  part of \
large curtain, which covers part of the table whereon lies the money. The two\
vouths, mentioned in the former, come running in  fright, endeavouring to\
hide themselves between the table and wall ; the one is already half behind it, and.\
the other is looking back, with his head between his hands.\
Somson\'92 drapery lies half on the steps, and the refidue is under his feet, together-\
with some weapons, as, half pikes and headepieces of the slain. The commander\
of the Philistines has  vestment reaching belbw the knees, and  loose drapery\
about his arm; about his head is allight grey fillet, fastened behind with  gold\
ribbon. The main light takes Samson and the parts about him. Delilab is in \
reflecting light and deep in the piece.\
These two pictures were not inferior to the two former in pafflons : the ordon-\
nance, light and colouring surprised me, and induced me to think  saw the very-\
action and lise itself.  was persuaded, that if Iknew not that it was. Samson and.\
Delilah,  must have guessedat by their makes, faces and motions. And, what\
was most wonderful, the fact and drift could not only be naturally seen, but also.\
its cause, and what the issue would be, whether good or bad. In the first pi\'e8ce,.\
 could easily perceive that Samson was to be betrayed ; and if  did not know it;\
the circumstance oft his hair cut offs, money told;. and ropes at hand;. would make\
me surmise it. Yet this could not Be done without bloodshed, as in the fecond\
piece; wlicre he is seized and ropedlike an ox for the sacrifice;. who, if the first\
blow fail, rouses, pushes down, and tramples under foot all that he meets:with,\
till at length tired, he is mastered,, and thus led back. to the altar again. Just so\
it appeared to me-\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Truly, we see few fuch pieces so efficaciously expressed ; every thing, as, the\
apartient, by-works and incidents were so proper, so needful to explain the\
matter, that the omiffion of any of them would have made the ordonnance imper-\
fect. What an effect has the statue of Venus in pointing out the lasciviousness of\
this heathenisn woman  Does not the naughty old woman, with the key in her\
hand, plainly shew that she is in her own house, not in that of Samson, or the\
commander of the Philistines, Or of what use would the money on the table be,\
af we saw not by the bearer, that it was not Samson\'92s For, he is asleep, and the\
money now brought in : but if on such an occasion, the running of the bearers,\
and the noise of the money be thought improper, as discovering the plot ;  say\
there is no impropriety in it, fince it is posfible to run bare-footed over  marble\
floor without any noise, and to set down bags of money without rattling. All\
here is husfi, no body speaks, for every one knows his business..\
In the second piece, Delilad makes to the statue for protection. Why does she\
Yet, she can-\
flee, and why in such fear, after Samson is bereft of his strength ,\
not be easy, she is tossed between hope and fear, and her anxiety makes her catch.\
hold of any thing she meets with; and as long as Samson is present, she retains her\
trouble. The commander\'92 paffionate motion is,  think, very proper; for\
the dead bodies lie about him, he would not have exposed himself to the danger of\
approaching Samson, had he not been securely tied. Now rushing from his lurk-\
ing place, he falls boldly on Samson, possibly not so much to shew his own valour,.\
as to spirit the others ; for he fooks not at Samson, but at the soldiers. The old\
woman\'92 lying tumbled down is not improper, as being feeble-legged and full of\
fcar; and although she have noshare in'the action, yet it is not repugnant to the\
story, if only for Delilah\'92 sake; and for the same reason she is flung into shade.\
Her garment turned up, can be no great scandal to an ill woman.\
Let us now confider both the pictures, but chiesly the signification of Samson\'92\
hair, and the love of Delilah.\
We read briefly in Scripture, raany things touching the hair of Samson, of which-\
he was very careful, because, whilst it grew, it became longer and thicker, where-\
by he gained greater strength for breaking the ropes witn which he was at any\
time bound ; but, being cut off, his strength forsook him, and his whole body.\
was subject to weakness.\
By the person of Samson the Nazarean, we understand,  man ehosen by heaven;-\
and devoted to its service; for the mei: of that order took, as  have said, especial-\
care of their hair; which gave them virtue, adorning the head, . . the under-\
standing, which, the more it encreases, the more courageous we become against\
assaults of our enemies. By enemies. endeavouring to bind us, we understands.\
h\'fbman inclinations, and the fire of concupiscence. When now, through frailty,\
we are seduced by this Delilah, those corrupt affections, whereby the lust of steep-\
overpowers-us, and we slumber in her lap, right reason becomes useless, and we\
cease todo good. Thus we are shorn by the wiles of women ; that is, by means-\
of voluptuousness we are deaf to the impulses of the spirit, and then of course lie\
apen to our enemies, both to scorn and crush us;\'92for-worldly affairs are so affecting,\
that\
\
\
\
\
\
\
that they have no sooner got the mastery, but we find ourselves crossed, either\
by covetousnefs, love, Ratrid, jealousy, or other disquiet : but returning  our-\
selves, or awaking, we become sensible of our folly, and\'92 through contrition, gra-\
dually recover our hair, and thereby our strength; and then, dying to sin, we at\
once overcome both ourselves and our enemies.\
The hair cnt off, also implies, the weakness of the faculties of the soul or spirit,\
or even death itself.\
Euripides testifies, that Alcestus could not die before Mercury came from heaven\
to cut off his hair. Minos likewise could not overcome king Nijus, unless his fatal\
hair were cut off by his daughter. And Dido, says Virgil, could not die before\
Juno, who pitied her long agony and lingering death, sent lris to release the soul\
from corporeal ties, by cutting off her white hair, and offering it to Pluto.\
These two last hisforical pictures differed from the two preceding in this, that\
they were not mixed with poetic figures, as Cupid, or Love ; Mag\'e6ra, or Rage,\
and such like, to help the expreffion of the paffions, or. meanings; fince it is cer-\
tain, that real truth could not be discerned from fiction by  mixture of both.\
And although the statue of Venus, in 'this matter of fact, seem to be of that nature,\
yet it is nothing to the mean point, but ferves only to shew that the plaoe was\
heathenifh, and where probably such figures were common among that people.\
:\
 . Of the Pictures in the second Story, built after the\
Doric Order.\
AFTER viewing this apartment, which  could not enough admire,  ascend-\
ed the second story into another of more elegant architecture, after the\
\
Boric Order. This room was not so long, but \'e0 little higher than the former,\
and  met'there with the following pictures.\
The valiant Hercules, after having performed many wonderful exploits, not able\
longer to resist the indignation of Juno, his step-mother, through smarting rage\
burned himself, occasioned by the poisoned shirt of Nessus, which Deianira had\
sent him, out of jealousy, that he loved lole, daughter of Euritus, king of Oecalia.\
Jupiter much concerned at this, carried him\'92to heaven in  triumphant chariot,\
and placed him among the stars, in the number of the gods.\
This prospect was wild, woody, and mountainous. In the middle of the piece\
 little to the right near the point of fight, was seen alarge pile of rough wood\
lving cross-ways, not as chopped, but rent afunder, having roots and branches.\
The upper wood was small, and the under very large, lying parallel with the piece.\
Here the unhappy heroe, the scourge of monsters was lying extended over his\
lion\'92 fkin, with his head to the right and feet to the left side turned somewhat\
backward, and his breast leaning over. His face  little rifing, and bending\
forwards,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
forwards, was seen in profile from the right\'92side, discovering resignation, unattened\
with pain. His left arm was quite raised, with the hand behind, under his head,\
the other arm lay out  little forward on the wood, with the hand half shut and\
the inside towards the body. His right knee was wholly drawn up, with the\
foot inelining towards it ; the other leg was represented hanging off as if he would\
lift himself somewhat higher, Philoctetes, before the wood  little to the right,\
kneeling on his left knee, supported his bent body on his elbow and right knee.\
He looked downwards, holding before his face  part of his garment, as if he\
were weeping, and with  toech in his left hand setting fire to the wood. In the-\
midctle of the piece, behind the pile, on the second ground, was seen  trumphal\
chariot, finely adorned with carving and gilding, and children with garlands of\
palm ; the foremost wheel like  star, appeared sideways, half behind the ground\
and the horses turning to the right, almost fronting, got somewhat higher.\
Mercury was seen entire tohis left foot, which was hidden behind the ground, on\
which. foot; leaning back, he supported himself. He advanced with his right\
leg forwards the burning pile, with his right hand behind him, wherewith he\
drew in the rein, as if he were going to stop, looking back, he was accosting Ju-\
piter, riding on the air, and pointed at Hercules with his left hand quite open, and\
\'e0 little fore-shortened. Jupiter\'92 upper parts came forward with his legs fore-\
shortened towards Mercury, pointing upwards with his right hand, and scepter,\
cross his bedy, and in his left holding thethunder against his thigh. Behind the\
chariot, above Hercules, to the right side, the ground rose up hilly. Behind the\
horses were seen high pine trees and eypresses, and some broken stems, and behind\
Mernezy were others somewhat lower and further. On the left side up to the horizon,\
appeared the sea, and not far in it,  rock almost in the form of an affrighted man ;\
which  judge to bethe unhappy servant Lychas, who-was flung into the sea by his\
master\'92 fury. On the-before-mentioned rocky hilk stopd  smoaking altar, and\
next it, aburning fire-pan and the glub of Herzules, In the pannel of the altar was.\
carved an \'e9agle with open wings,, and ithe thander in its bill, sirring on \
fostoon of oak leaves. In the front of the piece, on the left -side, lay  verv large\
body of an old tree tore up by the roots.; and the hole in the ground, thereby\
made, was still apparent ; the roots abounded with fibres, and the other end came\
forwards. to the middie of the piece, where it went into the frame. Here and.\
there lay some May branches, and stones throvn off their bafes. On the ground,\
by Philoctetes, lay Hercules\'92 ivory bow and quiver, adorned with gold, and of \
fize bigger than ordinary; the strap being enriched with gold buckles. On this-\
quiver was  small inlaid or chased figure representing Atrapos, the last of the fatal.\
sisters, with her sciffors.\
This piece was strongly lighted from the right side,  little fronting. The-\
hill and altar, anc hind part of the chariot, were mostly in the shade of the\
trees. The fore parts of the horses, and the upper parts of Mercury, half way\
his thigh, were in the light; and the rest downwards, with part of the ground,\
was in shade. Jupiter, placed very high, almost to the frame, received the light\
behind his head, shoulder and arm, and the rest of his body was in shade against\
the light sxy. The trees behind the horses were pretty dark.\
Philoctetes.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Philoctetes, son of Paans was arrayed in  sattin coat of armour, of bright\
straw-colour : The straps were gold embroidery on  greenisn blue ground. His.\
upper-garment hanging behind him, and tucked up about the middle in the\
girdle, between it and the hilt of his sword, was crimson, also embroidered with-\
gold; as were likewise his bufkins; his hair was fair, and short-curled ; he had\
little beard ; his helmet and half-pike lay by him; the helmet was seen  little.\
inwardly, and elegantly wrought with gold and silver ;  large white feather\
hung from it carelesly on the ground.\
The naked body, on the pile of wood, appeared very beautiful; the breast,\
somewhat heaving, received  strong light; the muscling of the stomach and ribs\
was well expressed, but on the arms and legs, faintly; the toes of the right foot,\
which had yet some motion, fhrunk inwardly ; his eyes were dying, and the balls\
drawn towards the corners; the mouth, somewhat open, seemed either to send\
forth sighs, or fetch breath, or utter, for the last time, some moving words,\
which raised the utmost sorrow in Philoctetes, and melted him into tears, as \
thought. Mercury was almost naked, having only  small green filk scarf about\
him, wherein stuck his Cauduceus.\
The horses were winged, and the head of one\
appeared, but that of the other was behind Mercury.\
This piece was particularly remarkable for the death of the heroe; and did\
not lil agree with what we have before in this work observed, touching the con-\
dition of  man in  very hot summer. Questionlefs, the poison not only worked\
is body outwardly, but inflamed and consumed his very intrails. For this rea-\
son  also thought he must die: his breath was misty, and his mouth gaped af-\
ter coolnefs; his eye-lids, stiff'and heavy through inward heat, he could hardly\
keep open; his sight smothered by the steam, and its motion retarded by the\
slackness of the optical nerves, drew towards the utmost corners. The sweat\
broke out, and he shined with wetnefs, chiefly about the breast, over which\
waved  thin damp, like the fumes of boiling water; which made his out-line\
unite with the ground : in this part it was, that the unhappy heroe had the most\
feeling ; and where the blood, leaviag the members and seeking for shelter, was\
retiring to the heart ; his breast was swelled, and, as he fetched breath, heaved\
and set ; his belly was fallen in, and the ribs were prominent ; his upper parts\
to the navel were of  warm and fiery colour, yet fresh and beautiful, as was\
also his face ; his lips were not as yet dead nor pale, but his hands and feet al-\
most burned black ; his eye-brows appeared drawn somewhat upwards, as one\
who, though sleepy, strives to keep awake; the arms and legs were bare, pale\
and shrunk, as partaking of death; but the fingers, knuckles, knees and toes,\
were violet, heightened with yellow ; about the ribs and belly were seen some\
red and violet spots of the poison; and his linen, shoved underneath at the navel,\
hung in rags, the major part whereof was under his body and thigh, and partly\
stained with blood. Thus the illustrious heroe,  thunder to the wicked, lay in\
Jupiter, very much moved, cast his eyes downwards fideways on the pi-\
agony.\
tiful body, and spake to Mercury, who looked up at the celestial ruler, with con-\
cern, as if he were saying, ee Look father  he is expiring.; No people w\'eare\
seen thereabouts, except those before mentioned; nor any satyrs or wood-gods.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
It is certain, that if any have been there, Hercules frighted them away in his\
rage. The sorrow of Philoctetes was, in my opinion, inexpressible; and the artist\
therefore, with reason, had covered his face. But why Paan\'92 son should be with\
Hercules without servants  could not apprehend ; but fancied it was because the\
painter thought it unnecessary, this bosom-friend alone sufficiently explaining the\
matter :  second reason might be, because the poet mentions nothing of it; and\
lastly, because the matter clears itself so well, that any addition would alter it,\
and, instead of an unexpected act, make it rather appear as  premeditated fune-\
ral solemnity. Whence, we may well infer, that the pile was not prepared for\
him, but that he himself made it on  sudden, as the poet relates.\
This artful piece was remarkable for these three things naturally and plainly\
expressed ; to wit, the fact itself ; what preceded, and what followed. The be-\
ginning of the tragedy was, when, having received the poisoned shirt of Nessus\
by Lychas, he offered it at the altar to Jupiter his father. The sequel of his rage ap-\
peared by that unhappy wretch\'92 being cast into the sea, and metamorphosed in-\
to  rock ;. after which he burned himself; and his succeeding triumph was shewn\
by the chariot which-Jupiter sends him for his deification. Renascitur ex funere\
Phaenix.\
The conclusions to be made from the persons of Nessus, Deianira, and Lychas,\
may be these.\
We learn from the Centaur, how dangerous the gifts of enemies are ; the cause\
of the great heroe\'92 death. In Deianria we discover her imprudent and indisereet\
pafsion, and the effects of her jealousy, which made her the instrument of her\
-husband\'92 death; and in Lychas we observe the miserable reward of his services,\
and that the misfortunes of servants are sometimes by the great construed as to\
render obedience and disobedience equally culpable.\
Over the door, opposite to the former piece, was seen another in an octagon,\
equal to the width ot the door; which  took at first to be  gap in the wall, be-\
cause it was  little darkishi; but approaching,  found it thus.\
Second Picture.\
Amphitryo being with Alcmena in her bed-chamber, had, before he went to bed,\
laid the two children, sphiclus and Hercules in his shield, under  pavillion; into\
which Juno, full of spite and rage, cast two serpents, in order to devour the two\
innocents, especially Hercules; who squeezed them to death, and flung them at\
Amphitryo\'92  feet.\
Forwards, on the left side, one step high, were seen the two children lying in\
the shield, encompassed with  balustrade running from the fore-part of the piece\
towards the point of sight, and which took up two thirds of the piece, Amphitryo,\
at the children\'92 cry, leaping out of bed with an undrawn sword in his hand,\
came to see what was the matter; and, having one foot on the step, he met with\
the young Hercules, looking at him with  smile, and grasping, with both hands,\
one of the serpents, which he squeezed to death; the other lying already at his\
feet. Amazed at this, Amphitryo started back; the other child, bawling out, lay,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
half tumbled out of the shield, with  pillow and part of the cloaths on the floor.\
Behind Hercules, and beyond the shield hung the Theban prince\'92 purple mantle\
over two half-pikes, which stuck up. slanting from the wall, and were tied toge-\
ther. Over them,  little backward, the baulked Juno was seen mounting up-\
wards, encompassed with  dark cloud, with her scepter by her side, in her left\
hand, and, with the other lifted up, seeming to threaten with her fist, and looked\
down frowning at the children. Somewhat further, beyond the balustarde, in\
the middle of the piece, rose four or five steps, fetched in by an hand-rail, reach\'ac\
ing quite crofs the piece. Behind them, at the further ene, in the middle of the\
piece, was  large and deep compass-niche or alcove, having  curtain drawn up\
and fastened, on each side, with two rings ; herein stood the bed. The apartment\
was eight feet high, and hung with tapestries; and over them, as far as  could\
perceive, the wall was divided into pannels, wherein were some faint bass-reliefs,\
representing warlike acts. On the left side of the alcove, in the corner, was \
round pedestal or half column, whereon stood  burning lamp. Alcmena, much\
concerned, stood somewhat stooping on the steps, looking earnestly about, with \
small torch in her hand, which sne held up high; resting the other on the pedes-\
tal of the hand-rail, and holding  part of her white garment, which buttoned\
under her chin, and trailed behind; her hair was tied up in  white cloth. The\
hind-works were seen, by the torch, in  dim light, except.the corner wherein the\
lamp stood ; which, with the door, adorned with fine foliage, shewed somewhat\
stronger. From Juno proceeded some light rays, darting on the children and there-\
abouts. This light was not like that of  candle, but of the day or thunder : it\
mostly fell on the under parts of the child in the shield; his upper parts and head,\
with somewhat of the pillow, tumbled out, were in the shade; he turned in the shield\
his upper parts one way, and his under ones, another; which were fore-shortened-\
Amphitryo\'92 upper parts, almost to the middle, were in the shade of the clouds, re-\
ceiving strong reflexions from the children and the floor.  stood pondering, how\
Mlemena came by the lighted torch; but, on  narrow inspection, found  large gold-\
eandlestick standing near her, by the other pedestal; and  wondered why Alceus\'92.\
son had not taken it, yet, on further consideration, concluded, that through hurry\
and fear, he overlooked it, as usual on such occasions ; which Alcmena perceiving,\
she probably jumped, out of bed and seized it. Such was this picture. Theie\
three lights were finely and distinctly observed : the lamp, which was distant, gave\
 white or pale light, but somewhat foggy. The flame of the torch was, almost\
to the wick, covered by the clouds under Juno; which, as far as  could appre-\
hend, was an artful slight of the master, in order to render the foremost light the\
brighter and stronger; and to avoid the necessity of making the whole piece dark ;\
which otherwise he must have done for the sake of naturalness.\
Juno had  diadem, and  light blue garment, her head-attire was wild, and her\
locks flying about like serpents.\
The poets mention; that Hercules was represented by the ancients, as an example\
of all virtues, as well of the body as the soul; squeezing serpents to death with\
his hands, even in his cradle; by which they give us to understand, that  man,\
sitted for heroism, ought, from his infancy, to shun, pleasures, and mortify carnal\
affections.\
\

\
\
NOW, thinking to go out of the apartments, to see what was further remark-\
able, , looking up higher perceived another picture against the covered cieling;\
Cupola-wise; wherefore, stopying to see it, and examine whether it had any relation\
to the pieces before-mentioned,  found it to be the deisication of the aforesaid\
great heroe, welcomed by Jupiter, and the whole train of gods and goddesses.\
Jupiter sat in the middle, high on his eagle. Hercules, crowned with laurels,\
was seen below, directly under him, standing, with one hand by his side, and\
having an olive-branch in the other; he stood fronting down to half-way the\
thighs, in the fore-part of the chariot ; which was on clouds; the pole of it rose\
up  little to the right side, according to the course of the horses, which Mercury was\
guiding to the left side upwards, swaying again to the middle, and with the chariot\
making  semi-circle ; so that the winged horses were seen mostly from underneath;\
their breasts fronting, and heads towards the right. Mercury held the reins in with\
his right hand, close to his mouth. The chariot was surrounded with many Cupids,\
having garlands and branches. Mercuary looked towards the right at Jupiter, who,\
with his scepter directed him to  circle of twelve glittering stars in the firmament,\
which enlightened some small clouds in that quarter. The whole Celestial body\
sat on waving clouds, exulting and clapping their hands. The sun shined bright.\
 was surprised that none had their badge, of distinction, except Jupiter, riding\
on his eagle, and holding the thunder, and Mercury with his Caduceus in his hand,\
and wings on his feet: but on consideration, that the gods are well known to each\
other,  directed my eye to Hercules, and observed, that he was without his club\
and lion\'92 kkin; which induced me to think, they were burned with his body ;\
neverthelefs, hisfrizzled hair and beard, and fine mein, convinced me, that it could\
be no body but Hercules. In fine,  examined all the gods and goddesses, one\
after another, and began to know them all, to the very least : Apollo, by his radiant\
air and beautiful body; Diana, by her black hair and brown complexion ; Bacchus,\
by his jolly cheeks and members : Asculapius, by his long tressed hair and beard ;\
Venuts, by ber squab members and amorous look; Momus, by his foolish counte-\
nance ; and so forth. Each had his propercolours: Venus\'92 garment was red, Diana\'92,\
blue, Bacchus\'92 purple, Ceres\'92 ftraw-colour, Monna\'92 green and yellow, &. which\
so distinguiffied them as to leave no room for doubt. But Juno and lris appeared\
not in their company; because,  suppose, the former could not bear the affront\
of seeing Hercules thus honoured.  examined further, into the ornaments of the\
apargment, and perceived they were so orderly and well adapted to the subject as\
to raise wonder. On both fides of the room ranged eight columns of Pisan\
marble, cross-cut into bands pretty wide from one another; on each side cf the\
door and in each corner, one, and between these, two others standing close together,\
with their architrave, frize, and cornice, and thereon  parapet with pannels, from\
which sprang the coving of the cieling, in the middle whereof was this last men-\
tioned: piece in an oval compartment of oak-leaves and acrons. The metopes in\
the frize were adorned with foliage of the same fort of leaves; and in the pannels\
of the parapet were festoons, with  crown of laurel hanging at them. Between.\
the two first and last columns appeared other festoons in oblong pannels; and un-\
der each,  club and lion\'92 skin; those feftoons were composed of palm branches,\
with\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
with their fruit. On both sides of the door, between it and the first column,\
stood  palm-tree, whose branches reached up to the coving, projecting very\
elegantly over the before-mentioned picture. Those palm-trees, with the frizal\
ornaments, were bronzed; the architrave and cornice, of serpentine stone, and\
the frize, like the columns, Pisan marble. On each side of the door, between\
the two first columns, was  large bass-relief of plain light and yellow marble.\
The one represented Hercules asleep, surrounded by the troop of pigmies: the\
other shewed his awaking, and hiding them in his lion\'92 skin. From this first\
proof of his valour, he afterwards got the name of  Hercules Primogenitus. On\
the other side of the apartment, opposite to this last, Hercules was seen spinning\
by Omphale ; and, in the other pannel on that side, his shooting Nessus. Round\
the cieling-piece were twelve small circular pannels, joined together with wreaths\
of palm-leaves ; these exhibited, in faint bass-relief of fret-work, the labours of\
Hercules. Between them and the piece appeared some lions heads.\
Before we proceed in our relation, let us shew what the heathens understood by\
the deification of Hercules.\
Hercules, the glory of valiant men, shews us, by his deification, that those who-\
attempt that honour in their life-times, as Anthony with his Cleopatra did, or strive\
to obtain it by intreating and cajoling the people, as most of the Persian kings\
and Romulus did, mistake the right method ; whereas Hercules\'92 whole life was ta-\
ken up in freeing the world from monsters and tyrants; and no divine honours\
were paid him until after his death ; for eternity, which he obtained only by\
death, teachs, that true virtue will not be flattered in this life; as Aleander prov-\
ed to those who were beforehand for calling him  god, by shewing them the\
blood which issued from his wounds, in the same manner as. from other mortals.\
How powerful and virtuous soever  man may be, as long as he draws breath he\
cannot call himself happy, as being no more exempted fxom the teeth of biting\
envy, than Hercules was in his life-time. The heathens worshipped him as  god,\
according to their superstition ; beliving also, that though alk souls are immortal,\
yet those of valiant men, pursuing virtue, attain an higher pitch of honour, and\
partake of the Deity : they even affign him, in heaven, Hebe, the goddess of youth,\
for  confort, on account of his strength, which is found only in youth.\
Thus, in after-times, the philosopher and poet Empedocles, (vainly, in immitation\
of Hercules, who made his frind Philoctetes swear never to reveal the place where he\
burnt himself, nor what was become of him, in order to induce the people to\
think he was taken up into heaven) threw himself into mount Ama: but his iron\
slippers being cast out with the fiery stones, discovered the case andthe truth-\
But, to return to our relation.\
In going out of the apartment,  saw on the pavement  sphara: mundi or ter-\
restrial globe, curiously inlaid, divided on each side with compartments, and cut\
with elegant bands of costly marble and jasper, which ran to the center : each\
stone shewed.  monster running off from. the globe, and such as Hercules, in his.\
life-time, had delivered the world from.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
 could not satisfy myself with the fight of this work., But having at last seen all\
things here, , by  fide pair of stairs, landed on  paffage leading to another\
apartment, of the lonic Order, nothing inferior to. the before-mentioned in rich-\
ornaments and marble.\
CH.AP. XI. Of the Pictures in the third Story, built after the\
lonic Order.\
Na time, as- S\'e9miramis was combing and binding up her hair, news was\
brought to. her of the revolt of the Babylonians ; whereupon, with one of the\
 hanging untied, she immediately marched against the rebels; and bound\
not her hair untill she had regained the town, and reduced the people to their-\
obedience.\
This courageous princess arose from her chair, half coifed; swearing with her\
right thumb held\'92up, and with her left hand pulling her side-locks towards her,\
the comb was as yet sticking. On the table by her, which was- covered with \
costly carpet of thick gold embroidery, stood  large oval looking-glass, in al\
gold frame chased with foliage, and on the top were two billing pigeons of un-\
polished silver. On the table lay also some precious ornaments, as bracelets,\
neck-laces, jewels, &. and her diadem, in the shape of  pyramid, beset with\
stones. Behind her chair stood  young damsel, holding  gold plate with some\
cups, pots, and\'92little boxes of perfume. Behind this virgin appeared two others\
in surprise and mutual embrace. On the left side was an old matron, with her\
back fronting, holding an opened letter in her left hand.  little more to-\
wards the middle, another virgin was pulling away, from the table into the cor-\
ner forwards,  littie fountain elegantly wrought, and resting on four wheels. In-\
the fore-part of the piece, on the right fide,  meffenger was kneeling before the\
queen quite dejected. At the furtber end of the apartment, in the middle, was \
gate-like opening, and on each side of it,  term, of white marble, whereon hung\
shewed an entrance into another magnificent apartment adorned with bass-refee\
and other imagery : at the further end of it was seen  large shallow niche, and\
under it  broad pedestal or elegant seat, on the side of which sat the figure of \
woman, with the teet towards thelight, holding in her lap aglobe, whereon the right\
hand, with  scepter in it, refted. Its head was adorned with  tripple mural crown.\
Over it, in the niche, stood, bass-relief-like, agrave man, in  majestic dress, rest-\
ing his right hand on  truncheon, and having  torch in his left. He was crowned\
with flowers, and about his neck hung  gold chain. This figure was golden, and\
the ground of the niche, azure blue. The columns where of white, and the build-\
ing of Egyptian marble, and the ornaments gold. Behind the matron, at the end of\
the first apartment,  young damsel, by the queen\'92 order (which the matron signi-\
fied to her) was climbed up, reaching with one hand as high as sne could, to take\
down\
\
\
\
\
\
\
down some arms off one of the terms\'92; which the matron, with the bent fore-finger\
of her right hand, beckonedto her, to bring forwards. Where-upon the damsel\
looking back as fhe was untyingthe weapons.\
The queen stood by the table, with her upper parts turaed  little to the left;\
her breast was half open, and put out ; her head, almost upright, inclining some-\
what towards the left moulder; her eyes staring; hef mouth,  sittlen open, as if\
she were speaking: she was drest in white sattin, over  dark blue bodice or cuirafs,\
richly embroidered with gold, vand beset with precious st\'f4nes; the sleeves were\
very wide, but turned up, and fastened with  gold buckle or hook ; her gown,\
buttoned above the knee, and gathered up round about ; she was buskined half-\
way the legs : her robe, lying on the chair, was of Tyrian purple, embroidered\
with gold, and lined with ermine. The young damsel, who was busy in attiring\
the head of the princess, was drest in violet. The virgin behind the chair, pushied\
somewhat by the queen\'92 starting up, stept back and overthrew  cup on the plate,\
which put her out of countenance : she was drest rose-colour; and the two, be-\
hind her, in dark blue,  little greenisn. The matron had  long cloth garment\
of dark fillemot, gold-bordered ; her under garment, as well as  could perceive\
by the sleeve, was dark violet, and her head elegantly wound with sillets of many\
colours, the end whereof hung down her back. The virgin, who took down the\
weapons, had  pale apple blossom-coloured garment. The messenger was seen\
sideways,  little hindwardly, in  small gold-fringed mantie, dark gray or blackisn,\
hanging halfway down his back ; his under-coat was light grey, and reached be-\
low the knees; his buskins were of beaft\'92 fkin; he had  dagger by his side, or\
stuck in his girdle, with \'e0 small staff in his. hand; his helmet, having  dragon\'92\
head, and two wings on top like thole of  bat, lay by him; his brown kkin shone\
with sweat, as did his hair, which was not long, yet tied behind.\
The apartment received its-light from the right side, through \'e0 large compass-\
headed window, which fell strongly on the queen, and about her,  little forward,\
she caused  ground-shade on the corner of the table; by which the matron\'92 un-\
der parts were well set off. The messenger was mostly in shade, as being more\
forward than the window. The hangings, between the window and gateway, were\
half in shade; which set the princeis and the attendance behind her strongly off.\
In one of those hangings (which were very old, and of  dark purple colour) was\
wrought, in costly needle-work, the flood and Noah\'92 ark; and in the other, the\
confusion of Babel, and the marching off and division of the people; and above,\
about the sweep of the gate, as round the edges of  medal, were Syriac characters\
or letters. On the right side, over the hangings, the apartment appeared lighter,\
by means of two circular windows running towards the point of sight. The ciel-\
ing was covered. The floor inlaid with large marbles of various colours. About\
the table, and on the foremost group, lay  large white round stone, which gently\
united with the other light; yet without attracting the eye.\
Forward, on the right side, behind the messenger, some steps went down to \
door below. Through the window appeared the off-scape, or part of  palm-tree.\
 forgot to say, tnat the weapons hanging on the terms consisted of quivers,\
bows and swords. In the bason of the golden fountain ran  spqut of water, up-\
on  cloth or two, and \'e0 spunge lying in it.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Over-against this piece, on the opposite wall, was the sequel of tlie preced-\
ing, in \
Second Picture.\
Here Semiramis was seen setting out from her court, with an extraordinary majesty\
and courage. she descended tne steps very airily.  martial fire seemed to in-\
flame her heart ; which gave  glow to her cheeks; her eyes sparkled like two\
stars. If she had not an helmet,  should, by her dress and accoutremens, have\
taken her for  Diana going  hunting. Everything was in readiness for her march,\
even to her robe; which she refused to put on contented only with  bow and\
arrows and her authority. The waiting woman ran up and down stairs, one bring-\
ing this, another that; one of the chief put the royal helmet on her head;  foot-\
stool was set for her, below on the stairs, whilst the other was girding the sword\
about her. The curvetting horse, inured to war, stood ready at the stair-foot.\
The trumpets sounded, and the people, full of desire, crowded about. The pas-\
sage was cleared. The horse, divided into troops, were drawn up in the inner-\
court. The Messenger ran down the further steps; and the matron above, in the\
gateway, was gaping and staring at the preparations. The sky was clear, and:\
seemed to favour the princess\'92 enterprize.\
Having, through hurry, but transiently viewed these things,  could not possibly\
well remember every circumstance, so as to give  true description of that excellent-\
piece ;. wherefore, attentively placing myself before it, my observations were,\
as follows.\
On the left side was seen  magnificent portico, with four lonit columns sup-\
porting their ornaments ; and on each side,  balustrade and plinth, runnig down\
five or six steps, to  large pedestal, whereon lay lioneffes, capped and covered,.\
whose bodies were full of- Syriac characters. The gate was circular-headed; and-\
over it  key-stone which supported the cornice, and wherein was  bronzed lion\'92\
head. Over each column, in the frize, were some forts of heads; and between\
them,  faint carved quiver and lighted torch acrofs. On each fide, in the wings.\
of the portico, was  niche, the bottoms whereof were even with the sill of the\
door, and running towards the point of sight. At the extremities, of those wings,\
were two other columns, standing against  wall, which ran, on  low ground, to\
the middle of the piece. This wall was divided by flat fascias, in the nature of\
pilasters; and, between them, were circular openings, through which was seen the\
inner-court, and above the wall, its fide, running, deep in the piece, towards the\
point of sight. At the end of the wall was such another, parallel with the fore-\
most, which bounded the inner-court; and, further behind, some palm and other\
trees rose above it. On the fore-ground, on the right side, the ground was rug-\
ged up to the landing place of the steps, descending into the fore-court; in the\
middle of which stood  large fountain, of white marble, resting on  basis of four\
or eight arches, which were supported by square, smooth and high pillars, of the\
Doric. or rustick Order, divided by rusticated or rock-like blocks; over this work\
arose, instead of an entablature,  large plinth, three feet high, of white marble,\
like the figures. On the top, in the middle, rifing three or four steps, stood \
large terestrial globe, supported by four sphinxes; on which globe sat  woman, with\
her\
\
\
\
\
\
\
her fore-parts towards the court, holding high, in the right hand,  sun, and\
downwards, in her left,  moon. On her helmet was an eagle with spread wings,\
and on her breast-ornaments  lion\'92 head Her dress was like that of an heorine.\
On the lowest steps, next the plinth, sat the four parts of the world, fettered against\
some trophies. Below, between the pillars, were copper-bronzed basons, which\
received some spouts of water from within, out of  rock. This huge pile stood\
in the middle of the piece, against the point of fight, half behind the wall. The\
fore-court was rough; and at the further end had steps ascending as aforesaid.\
Thus wasthe plan of this picture, and the disposition of all the fixed work; \
shall now, to the best of my sxill, decribe the rest.\
 little to the left of the point of sight, the courageous queen was descending\
the steps, with her left leg forwards, and her body bending somewhat back,\
poising on the right leg on  step higher. She swayed her upper-parts to the left,\
with the breast fronting; somewhat lifting up her left arm, which was guarded\
with  small shield; at the same time,  stooping virgin girt her scimyter. Her\
right hand, in which she hefd  bow, with the arm down-wards; and  quiver\
full of arrows appeared above her left shoulder :  crowned helmet, ornamented\
with  large white feather, was set on her head by another, and  third, with the\
royal robe, (which the princefs thought needless in this march) was going up stairs\
again, with her eyes fixed on the queen : this virgin\'92 right side was  little front-\
ing; and she held the robe high in her left hand, that it might not drag, and, with\
the right, kept the rest close to her body; her dark head-attire was strongly set off\
against the white fur, or lining of the robe; and her locks, through her swifth\
motion, were flyig behind, and her gown ruffing between her legs : she was girt\
just under the breast, and had white sandals : the gown was open on the fide,\
discovering the bare leg and half the thigh: her garment was rose-colour. The\
matron, near the gate-way, stood stooping forward, and wondering, with her right\
hand on thebalustrade, and looking down. Next the first step, before the queen,\
under the point of sight, stood  stooping damsel, setting  small ivory foot-stool,\
covered with purple velvet, for the queen to mount her horse by ; she held it with\
her right hand, and with the other was tucking up her garment behind, seeming\
fearful of the horse.  little from thence came, from the right side of the piece \
voung man, looking at the damsel, and holding, with his right hand,  fine horse\
by the bridle ; he was seen from behind; his left leg advanced, and the right drew\
quite back, just touching the ground with his great toe ; his breast projected quite\
over his poise, as if he were still walking striking the horse\'92 belly with his left\
hand to make him turn about. The horse\'92 breast was fronting, and his right\
side somewhat fore-shortened ; his head in profile; the foremost leg prancing, and\
the right drawing in, as if he went backwards ; his open nostrils were white ; as\
were also the breast and legs ; the rest being dark or brown : the bridle and other\
things were gold beset with stones, having  rich caparison, set off with gold plates ;\
the housing was purple, richly embroidered with gold, powdered with pearls and\
other costlinesses, and almost trailing the ground, with sine tassels flying up at the\
horse\'92 motion : the mane was drest into tresses; and the tail buttoned up.  ty-\
ger\'92 skin covered the breast. The young man had long light hair, tied behind;\
his\
\
\
\
\
\
\
his Coat, girt in the midctle, was light -yellowi reflecting green ; being strongly\
set off. against the: purple housing; his right shoulder, with half his back, was seen\
bare ; and his carnation, beautiful and fresh; his sandals were white. The horse\
gave  ground-shade over the damsel with the foot-stool, and  little beyond her.\
Quite on the right side, somewhat further, stood two trumpts, turned towards\
the inner court, girt with beasts skins, and sounding, their trumpets, almost\
like those of the Romans, were. winding like serpents, with dragons heads\
at the ends of them. On the further side of the queen, the messenger appeared\
running. down the steps, quite over his poise; pointing, with his right hand  lit-\
tle fore-shortened, forwards at the inner court, with his face towards the queen: by\
the little flying mantle behind him, might be perceived the swiftnefs of his mo-\
tion ; his action, like that of  flying Mercury, being free and extensive: he flung\
out his left leg, and his right foot was quite behind, and off the ground. The\
people, on the second ground, below stairs to the pedestal of the first balustrade,\
were seen between his legs : these people, as well men, as women and children,\
stood, some wringing their hands, others lifting them up high, some embracing,\
others clapping their hands; the former for fear, the latter for joy : among the\
rest was seen  distressed woman, hanging her head sideways, with her arms down,\
and hands folded: by her stood  grave man, talking to her almost mouth to\
mouth, with his right hand pointing up to heaven, and with his left, giving her\
 friendly look, he pulled her by the sleeve, as if he would have her take heart.\
Some children were lying on, and crawling up the steps. In the fore-court some\
troops of horse were seen putting themselves into order, and others mounting\
their horses. On the further side of the place, other people were coming running\
down the steps. The off-scape behind them, on the right side, was hilly. Over\
the aforefaid steps, at  distance, arose  large pyramid, and some palm-trees, ap-\
pearing darkissi against the clear fky. The fore-court was light, and the inner\
court itself, on the left side, of white marble. The wall, on the further side of\
the steps, was, together with the people, and beyond\'92the- lionesses, shaded by \
cloud; which strongly set off the foremost group, whereon the main light fell.\
The trumpets, on the same side, with  part of the balustrade on which thgy\
leaned, were in shade. Forwards,-in the corner, was seen part of an open gate,\
and its side-wall running up high, just beyond the trumpets; who thereby werc\
in'the snade, receiving here and there, from the opening,  little light on their\
under-parts and legs. The gate was low, because the ground run off sloping\
from the steps; the ground, with the hind-part of the horse being shaded by it.\
The horse and young man received small but very strong lights and shades. The\
trumpets and gate were strongly reflected from the left side. The people on the\
second ground, against the balustrade, were mostly lighted from on high, by the\
blue of the sky, and could have no reflexion, because they stood parallel, along\
the stairs. Behind the wall, with round openings against the angle of the wings\
of the portico, arose the top or leafing of  large palm-tree; which broke the\
length of the said wall; at the same time caufing the extremities of the wings to\
unite agreeably with the inner-court. The portico, fronting the light, was, with\
The\
the balpstrades, tof Pisax. and Agyplian. marble, witht white ornaments.\
lionesses on the pedestals were of serpentine. The upper steps were of white\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
marble with eyes. The large and spacious landing, at the foot of the steps, was\
of free-stone; and the ground, on the right side, somewhat ruffet, mixt with\
earth.\
The matron had, as in the former piece,  dark sillemot upper-garment, over\
 violet one; and her head was elegantly wound. The young virgins were also as;\
before. She, who girt the princess with the sword, had an apple-blossom-coloured\
garment; her coat being tucked up behind; her head-attire was light against\
shade, was putting on the queen\'92 helmet. The young damsel below shaded by\
the horse, was likewise drest in blue. The virgin, with. the royal robe, stood\
close to the foremost balustrade, almost up the stairs, behind the lionesses, which\
were strongly set off against her light garment.  had almost forgot  soldier\
standing in the gate, near the trumpets, with  club plated with iron on his\
shoulder; he had  light grey linnen coat reaching below his knees, with stock-\
ings on his legs, and on his head  copper helmet, adorned with two beast\'92\
horns; about his neck was fastened  brownisn red beast\'92 skin, with the paws to\
it, and, by his side,  dagger. This man was entirely in the light of the gate.\
After  thorough view of this picture,  began to consider, wherein its good-\
ness lay, which was what  chiefly wanted ; wherefore, taking my pocket-book,\
 set down in it the general heads in the following manner.\
First, The dispofition of the irregular objects against each other, whether high\
or low, standing or lying.\
Secondly, The disposition of the grounds behind each other.\
Thirdly, The placing of the lights.\
Fourthly, The motion of the moving objects.\
Fifthly, The proper by-works, climate, and customs.\
Sixthly, The conditions or characters of the persons, with the dresses and\
Syrian equipage.\
Seventhly, The particular postures and paffions.\
Lastly, The harmony of the colours.\
Being much rejoiced and inflamed with new ardour for further-inquiries,  saw,\
opposite to the aforesaid two pictures, on each side of the door, the following\
bass-reliefs in white marble.\
In that on the right fide Semiramis was standing on the fore-ground, and by\
her an architect, fhewing her, on  board, the plan of  town-wall. On the\
left side were workmen, busy in carving, hewing, cuting, and sawing stones :\
and on the second ground, the said wall appeared faintly just above ground, and\
next it was the town.\
In the otherpiece the queen was seen on horseback, with  quiver behind her,\
and aiming at  lion, who, rearing up, approached her, with an arrow through\
his body. In the off-scape, the town-wall appeared as finished, and here and there\
some palm-trees- The figures were small life, and finely wrought.\
Between those bass-reliefs stood  square pedestal in  niche, and on it the statue\
of Semiramis, with  dead lion under her feet. She was drest in the Assyriau man-\
ner, as an Amazan, with  bow in her hand, and  quiver behind her; and on her\
head\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
head  crowned helmet, on the top whereof lay  little dragon, whose neck curled\
down the fore-part of it.\
The pedestal was, porphiry, and the figure massy gold.\
The niche, like the building, was intirely serpentine, and the pillars and pilasters\
of Agpytian marble.\
Oyer the aiche was an oblong azure-blue table or fascia, and thereon  pile of\
burning wood, of white marble, out of the smoke whereof ascended  pigeon.\
Over each column was  modillon of olive-leaves, which supported the archi\'ac\
trave, and in the frize were some arms, not much rising. All these ornaments\
were of gold.\
In the middle of the arch-work arose  very large cupola, and therein was \
celestial sphere, of blue chrystal, with the signs and circles of gold. The half\
of this wonderful machine took up the cupola, shewing itself in such  manner a the sun shone on it, and enlightening the whole apartment, for which reason,\
 did not before take notice, that the room had no windows. On each side of\
In one was re-\
the sphere were two tables of fret-work, and each had  figure.\
presented Srengih, like an heroine, holding an oaken-branch, and having \'e0 griffin\
on the shield; and in the other was also an heroine, signifying political government,\
leading  bridled lion with the left hand, and holding  staff in the right. By\
which figures and the sphere are understood the heavenly insluences, as philosophers\
intimate.\
 floor was, like that in the under apartment, inlaid with  terrestrial globe,\
juist under the cupol\'e2; where the light, falling directly upon it, made it rise, and\
Over the door, in  round copartment of palm keaves,  saw carved, in white\
marble, and old sea-god, whom  judged to be father Ocean, leaning on  large\
sea-vase, shedding abundan\'e9e of water, running crofs through the piece; out of\
which arose, in-the middle  large winged lion. On the other side of the sea-god,\
appeared  smnall hill, and thereon  littie palm-stem. This table was like  me-\
dal of one deptb. The sense alluded to the first rise ofthe Assyrian monarchy, re-\
presented by the winged lion according to the prophet Dantel.\

WHEN Horatius had gajned the victory over the ffiree Caratii, and was\
\
 going with his arms tosthel Capitol, he was met by his sister, who, espy-\
ing those qf her bridegrobt, called her brother  murtherer : at which\
enraged,, he drew hia sword and stabbed her, thereby staining the victory with\
his; oun blood. Thaipeople- ijudging this to be  cruelty, voted, that he had\

\
This sorrowful triumph happened before the Capitol at Rome, as when in its\
ancient state. Forward is seen  large plain; encompafsed with walls, where lay\
two large lionesses of porphiry, which, it is probable, the artist introduced, in\
they have been of so long standing, yet we may easily admit it. On the right\
side was represented the proud capitol of marble, and costly architecture after\
the Roman Order, ascended by \'e0 spacious flight of steps. On the top was this in-\
scription in gold letters, SENATUS POPULUSQUE ROMANUS, . . the\
Senate and People of Rome. Here, they were mounting the steps with arms on\
pikes. Horatius followed, sheathing his fword. Behind him, his unhappy sister\
dropped down backwards, the people from all corners, flocked together, mut-\
tering and cursing his cruelty;:but he, regardless of it, boldly went forward.\
Before the steps, about three or four pac\'e9s length, the ground was paved with\
large grey stones; the residue being rigged or uneven : the foremost weapon\'ac\
bearer, entering the gate, held his trophy somewhat stooping within it: he was\
seen from behind, having, almost the same action-as the gladiator; his left arm\
extended, and his right leg on the threshold. The second, two or three steps\
down, held his weapon up against his body, looking back at the- third, who fol\'ac\
lowed close, and was speaking to him. This poised on his left leg, having his\
right very much bent, and the toes of it on  step higher; his upper parts swayed\
against his right breast, and the bottom of it with his right hand. The third\
carried the trophy on his fhoulder almost uprights his breast projecting, and his\
back swaying  little forwards, with his elbow standing out, settingthis right foot\
on the steps; the left being quite behind, and off the ground, as walking on, and\
the other before him, as  little stooping; those three men were called Velites, or\
light-armed, and drest in linen, girt about the middle, with daggers by their\
sides and plain helmets on their heads; as we see in the prints of Trajan\'92 column,\
and other remains of antiquity. Three or four steps from thence, just in-the\
middle of the piece, Horatius advanced in full armour, holding an oliver-branch\
befide his scabbard in his left hand, and on. thie same arin (which, with the elbow;\
was putting out, and  little fore-shortened) small shield, whereon was represent-\
ed  lion. His Breast was fronting, and the right hand lifted up and sheathing\
his sword. His right leg was put forth, somewhat bent, and the other drawn far\
his face fronting, he looked down on the iscabbards havifig on his head an helmet\
crowned with laurel and oak-leaves; with  faather behind, which by the turn\
of his head and the swiftnefs of his walk, slew to and fro.   mantle, fastened on\
his right shoulder, and tucked under his chin, hung  little over his left should-\
er ; one flappet of it flew behind, and the other forwards, flinging over his left\
leg. The straps under his coat of armour and on the arms were short and broad,\
and rounding at bottoms. His buskins came half-way up the legs.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
from him forwards was seen the expiring virgin falling back, with her feet ex-\
tended towards him, and arms spread wide, the right lifted up and the left sink-\
ing, her breast turned to the light, her right hip swelled, her thigh was at full\
length and the leg  little fore-shortened; the left leg hid under the right: her\
face also foreshortened, leaned towards the left shoulder, which, with  little of\
the breast was naked ; her breast garment girt under the breast, was flving up-\
wards, her upper garment sinking, slung over her right leg and  flappet of it hung\
over her left arm; her light tresses, by her tumble, flew upwards. Beneath her,\
 little more to the left side, was an aged woman supporting the noble virgin, and\
shrieking out beholding the murderer ; she, with her breast downwards, and left\
hand on the ground, and right hand lifted up, was staying with her body, the\
back of the dropping Roman virgin : her head was wound with cloths and fillets.\
Just behind her appeared the half of  pedestal, whereon lay one of the aforesaid\
lionesses, and somewhat further behind the fellow of it, running towards the point\
of sight. Two soldiers followed Horatius, who, in dissatisfaction, seemed to\
turn back. Not far behind the conqueror were some spectators highly discontent-\
ed ; some were pointing at him, some menacing, ochers disdainfully turning their\
backs upon him, &. It looked as if we heard them grumble. On the fore-\
ground on the right side, an aged man, with one shoulder bare, came hastily run-\
ning to see what was the matter; he had on  short coat with an herdsman\'92 cap on\
his head, and  flute and scrip at his side ; his under parts were, with part of the\
fore ground in shade, and his back fronted the light.  dog ran before, looking\
back at him, according to the custom of those creatures. Beyond the capitol,\
part of  wall with its architrave and  large compass-headed gateway, ran to-\
wards the point of sight. This wall extended from thence crofs through the piece\
by the point of sight, to the left fide, and was divided by rusticated Doric pilasters,\
into squares, wherein were small niches. Out of this gate just below the wall,\
some cattle as oxen, cows, goats and sheep were coming, with  shepherd, who at\
the noise, was looking back. This shepherd and cattle coming in at the gate,\
made me believe he came from the market, because it was behind the capitol.\
Over the wall appeared several fine palace-like buildings, as also  column,\
whereon was placed  she wolf, with the two children Romules and Remus. Above\
the angle of this wall on the right side, in the off-scape, was seen, as well as  could\
guefs, the rock Tarpeia, rising up very high; but neither Pantheon, Monte Cavallo,\
Vatican or Colosseum, as not being as yet known : no ruins or broken buildings ap-\
peared here, but all beautiful and whole, except some little houses; since the\
town had not been an hundred years standing, nor before ruined. On the left\
fide forward in the corner, on  rising ground, stood  woman by the trough of \
fountain, astonisned and crying out, who seemed as if she were going away, ; lift-\
ing up one hand on high, and holding out the other to  young girl, who came\
running in confusion.  child, held by another girl sitting on the side of the,\
trough, was looking down on the ground on an overturned pot of milk. This\
fountain stood against  large pyramid, which run towards the point of sight.\
Several ordinary dressed people, men, women, and children, came running in\
groups three or four together from behind the pyramid ; others were returning\
\
\
\
\
\
\
from thence. The young girl, who came running in confuston, had  fhort coat,\
and was barefooted and her hair very meanly tied behind. These people and\
objects with the pyramid, filled up almost  fourth part of the piece.  row of\
low houses, like an hamlet, ran by the pyramid towards the point of sight, and\
above theni arose some pines, cypresses and other trees.\
This piece was lighted from the right side, yet  little fronting. The capitol\
gave  large ground shade over the steps beyond the two arms-bearers, and con-\
tinued beyond Horatius, over two or three men, who stood behind him, against\
whom he was strongly set off. The side walls, with the gate, reached half the\
height of the building, the same receiving strong reflexions from the ground, and\
having ground shades which were not too sharp. The pyramid, with the women\
and children, was kept somewhat darkisn, by reason of  cloud, except the top of\
the pyramid, which received  clear light. The sky was full of clouds, especially\
in the middle, and on the left side of the point of sight, behind the houses.\
The Romans in those days, except people of the first rank, wore little or no va-\
riety in the colours of their cloaths; they were mostly white, or else light grey\
woollen. For this reason, as  conjecture, the designer of thefe pictures had made\
the principal persons to excel, for  perceived that the people were mostly in grey\
or white; some  little russet, others inclining to green. Few among them, ex-\
oept aged people, had long gowns or garments. Horatius\'92 coat of armour fhewed\
golden, the straps under it, and on the arms. were elegantly embroidered on \
fillemot ground ; his mantle was yellowish white, with violet reflexion. The\
scabbard of his sword was dark blue, finely wrought, the hilt represented an eagle\'92\
head: his bufkins tied with vhite strings, but quite fouled, as  judged, by\
sand and dust; were purple. His sister\'92 upper garment was light blue, her breast\
garment light yellow, with. violet reflexion, almost like that of her brother.\
\
The\
aged woman beneath. her was swarthy skinned; her garment greenifh blue and\
plain. The lionesses were dark porphiry, and the pyramid of  rocky stone.\
Having sufficiently viewed this picture, and exactly learnt all the circumstances\
of it,  took infinite delight in seeing how naturally the occurrence was expressed,\
and that nothing was supersluoussy intreduced, though the story does not\
make mention of all the persons who were brought into this representation.\
\
thought, it is truly of great moment that the principal parts of  story be well ex-\
pressed; and herein  good master has work enough to give each person his due\
paffion, to the end the matter must speak for itself: but it becomes still more ex-\
cellent by the addition of all other necessary circumstances (though not to be found\
in the historiant after such  manner that both appear natural.\
On the right side of this piece,  saw  carved bafs relief in white marble, ex-\
hibiting an emblem over the foregoing. This bass relief appeared in  niche run-\
ning towards the point of fight. On some high steps, Roma was on her right knee,\
and lifted up by Valour. Her breast was fronting, and her head turned  little\
backwards towards the left shoulder, her right ari hung down, just touching the\
steps with the tips of the fingers; her left elbow stood out towards the left side,\
in the hand whereof she held an hanging slappet of her garment. The left foot,\
far srom the fteps, rested on the toes, seeming, by the rise of the hip, and- the\
\
\
\
\
\
knee keeping down against the steps to pufh her up. Valour was represented tur-\
ning its upper parts fideways towards Roma, supporting her elbow with its right\
hand, the arm whereof being faint in the ground. Its head was in profile and,\
the left arm guarded with  shield,  little drawn back. It stood somewhat like\
the known statue of Apollo, supported on its right leg, the left faintly uniting with\
the ground.  little further, Albania was on her knees, quite bowing her body ;\
she was decked as an heroine, with an helmet in the form of  town-wall, on her\
head, and laid with the left hand  staff down on the ground, holding the other af\
her breast; her left knee was upwards, with the foot drawn in, and she looked\
down with  dejected countenance. Behind her stood Fate, yoking her shoulders,\
and she at the same time pointed backwards with the-right hand at some trophies\
which hung on pikes, and united faintly with the ground. This goddess of Fate\
was dressed like an old matron; in her girdle stuck  pair of scifssors ; her under\
parts were seen sideways, and the upper from behind, with her eyes fixed on Roma-\
Under the aforesaid trophies the horned Tiber god lay with his left arm resting on\
 large vafe, and holding in his right hand an oar behind his right side; he lay\
on his left side, with the breast turned against the light; the left leg was stretched\
out, yet faintly rising; the right hip upwards, and the thigh seen only to the\
knee, rested on the other leg, the residue united with the ground. Behind his.\
back the she wolf and parts of the two children were seen. Above him appeared\
some columns, as of  portico, running towards the point of sight, which, as on\
the other side, were half lost in the ground. Victory flying between Roma and Va-\
lour, held in her right hand  crown of laurel over the head of the former, and\
with the left-putting into her hand  scepter topped with  little globe; her gar-\
ment was flying behind her, and her legs quite extended without any fore-shorten-\
ing, faintly united with the ground, In the shield of Valour, was represented the\
combat of Horatius with the Ceratii, and on her helmet, crowned with oak leaves,\
was  lion\'92 head, and the same on her buskins. This work was inclosed between\
two young palm trees not much leaved.\
The triumph, on account of the mournful accident, so much affected me, that\
 remained in suspence, not knowing, for fear of  miserable issue, whether \
might turn to the following piece: nevertheless, considering the bravery of Ho-\
rattus\'92 exploit, whereon depended the power of Rome,  took heart, in hopes of\
his preservation, which  found agreeable to the writer\'92 relation.\
\
Horatius then was secured for the murder of his sister, and, according to law,\
fentenced to be put to death : yet, in consideration of his heroic action pardoned,\
on condition that his father paid, as  fine,  certain sum of money into the pub-\
\
lic treafury. The picture, as  remember, was thus\
Second Picture.\
At the capitol, Justice, or the Roman law, sat in  raised chair, with the scales in-\
her left, and  pole-ax in her right hand. In one scale lay  sword, and in the\
other  crown of laurel with  palm branch.; this latter far over balancing the\
other scale, as  token that the law is mitigated by mercy. The criminal stood\
very\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
very dejected before her; with his hands ironed behind him. On her left fide,\
the father on his knees, was offering  vessel of money at her feet :: on her right\
stooil Mercy with-holding the hand wherein was the pole-ax, and with the other\
pointing at  picture held by some children, representing the decayed Roman do-\
minion restored by the valour of Horatias. Further were seen the arms of the\
three slain brethren, planted there by himself round the statue of Roma, whereon\
Justice had fixed her eyes. Another child crowned with laurel, was loosing the\
fetters of the accused with one hand, and putting on his helmet, or setting up the\
cap of liberty with the other. On each side of the throne was  bafs relief, and\
over them two niches : in that on the right side was represented Numa Pompilius,\
and in that on the left, Lycurgas, two of the most ancient legislators. The bafs\
relief under Numa, exhibited the example of Charondas, who, to enforce his law,\
stabbed himself in full senate, for having acted contrary to it: and under Lycurgus,\
that of Seleucus, when, for his son\'92 sake, who by law had forfeited his eyes, he\
caused one of his own to be put out. So strict were the ancient Romans in support\
of their laws. Over the throne hung two tables, containing the Roman laws,\
written in Greek letters of gold.\
This unexpected event much rejoiced me; wherefore, full of desire,  went to\
 third picture, in order to observe on what basis so great  work was built, and\
found it as follows.\
Jullus Hostilius, chosen by the Roman people for their third king, on account of\
his great ability and merit, invaded the Alban territory, though  stout people, and\
bearing much sway in ltaly. These, weakened by many battles at last agreed.\
with the Romans toend the dispute by  combat between three brothers on each\
side : those of the Romans were named Horatii, and of the Albans, Curatii. The\
fight was glorious, yet doubtful, but at last fortunate for the Romans, for one of\
the Horat, after having lost his two brothers, mistrusting his strength against\
three such brave enemies, added policy to his courage, and by an artful sleight,\
slew the three Curatii one after another, and thus got the victory.\
Third Picture.\
Here appeared the place of combat fenced in. On the right side was seen the\
general of the Roman forces, and on the other, at  distance, he of the Albans,\
both sitting somewhat high, with their bages of distinction. In the middle of\
the piece, Horatius was represented turning tail to the last of the Curatii; but, re-\
turning, he run his pursuer through the breast ; whereupon he fell backwards.\
The second,  little from thence, was on his knees, with his face to the ground,\
and all bloody, bearing up  little on his elbow : he lay about the middle of the\
fence, against  post, whereon stood the figure of Fate, or Fortune in copper.\
Just beyond this post lay the third stretched out on his back \'92: and at the end of\
the pailing were seen the two dead Horatii. Over the valiant heroe, Victory\
shewed herself, with the left hand crowning him with laurel, and with the right,\
holding\
\
\
\
\
\
holding out  cap and staff to the chief of the Romans, who thereupon joyfully\
came down from his seat, with the acclamations and clappings of the people.\
Opposite, stood the chief of the contrary party astonished, and turning his back,\
in order to go away : the people withdrew in tumult at the sound of the Romqu\
trumpets, leaving the field-badges in the place. On the right side, behind the\
Romans, appeared part of the town-wall, and on the other behind the Albans, up to\
the wall, the field full of tents on  low ground. Over the Roman arbiter, or\
umpire, was seen Romulus and Romus, cut in  large stone. The field-badge of\
the Albans was  dragon or harpy. In the off-scape appeared the Tiber, and the\
Alps always covered with snow.\
Thus was the plan of this artful piece, which  thought no less wonderful\
than the others in force and disposition, as well as naturalness. Every thing was\
exactly observed, the paffions and motions so well expressed, the place so piainly\
apparent, the quality of the by-works so proper, and the lights, shades, colours,\
\
&. so advantageoussy distributed, that  could scarce believe it  picture.\
could not but admire the three remarkable divisions of this story : as first, the\
beginning, happening without the town; secondly, the sequel, seen within the\
town; and lastly, the end of the story, or, what was tranlacted in the capitol,\
without any thing of moment intervening, from whence  painter could make\
 picture.  speak, with respect to the different matter which opportunely offers\
to the thoughts and execution of , judicious master.\
As the sense of the story is very particular, so the three pictures were as ex-\
cellent from first to last. In the first, we perceive the lucky chance of arms, or\
the valour of the heroe, whereby he gained the repute of  deliverer of his\
country : in the second, we consider him as  murtherer, or, the accident as \
bloody triumph, and him elated with his success: and, in the third, we see him\
 malefactor, condemned to be put to death, or one who had transgressed the laws.\
Truly, those three events, may serve for instructive examples to all men. Do\
we not see in them the common course of the world, and that too great success\
and prosperity make many men proud and insolent; And what do not their\
blind pafsions lead them to  certainly, unthankfulnefs to heaven is the prelude\
to many disasters and errors, leading them into the greatest dangers: however,\
all things are governed by Providence.\
The middle of the cieling had  large oval piece, wherein Providence was,\
in the greatest depth, represented sitting on  globe, drest in gold stuff with her\
head crowned, and about it twelve glittering stars, having in her right hand\
 sceptre, with an eye on top; on her breast,  sun, and on her knee holding\
 looking glass with her left hand ; her look was full of majesty and authority :\
she pointed downwards at Roma, who sat  little to the left side, on  cloud,\
attended by Religion, Valour, and Concord. Long Life, Healih, and Prospe-\
zily, came gently waving down towards her. Long Life, was  beautful virgin\
in her prime, with  flame of fire on her head, and  serpent with the tail in\
its mouth, in her hand. Health, was Asculapius, holding  staff, about which\
twined  serpent. Prosperity, appeared  naked vouth, crowned with laurel, with\
 cornucopiae, full of fruit under his arm. Retigion, or Piety, was. drest like \
vestal\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
vestal, holding, in her right hand,  cup emitting  slame, and looking up\
at Providence. Valour was represented like an Hercules, with his club and lion\'92\
skin. Concord looked somewhat more composed than Piety, having in her arms,\
 bundle of rods, which  Cupid tied with  red ribbon. Roma, drest in white\
or light blue, under  purple robe embroidered with gold, held in her right\
hand  pike, and in the left,  laurel branch; on her head she had an helmet,\
and buskins on her legs.\
Now, we ought to weigh the meanings of these things. Providence is to\
be considered as the chies ruler of worldlv affairs, debasing and raifing empires\
as she pleafes. The three gifts of long Life, Health and Prosperity, are bleffings\
flowing from her. The corporeal virtues are the effects of might, whenee they\
proceed: the first is Religion, the second Valour, and the third Concord;\
these established Roma, in her power, and increased it. In relation to art, let\
us observe, with what ingenuity and uncommonnefs the master has executed\
those pictures :  say uncommonness, since  never saw them handled by any\
other after such  manner. First, Providence is in the greatest depth, and,\
according to guefs, thrice as big as the life. The three gifts, which sne sends\
down, being somewhat. lower, are not half so big; and the undermost, to wit,\
Roma, and the characters accompanying her, are still smaller, yet somewhat\
larger than the life-\
Providence has no bounds, always maintaining her uncontrolled power with-\
out diminution; and though the three gifts, which slow from her, are but small\
parts, yet, with respect to the undermost figures, they are much bigger, and\
keep among them their own forms, as reigning over them. The three others\
on the undermost clouds being but corporeal virtues, are therefore much smal-\
ler than the preceeding, and appeared with less majesty : nevertheless Roma\
excels, and shews herself bigger; intimating thereby her growth and improve-\
ment. Her sitting on clouds implies, in my opinion, her rising above all\
other powers of the world.\
This would be  monstrous design, if art, with respect to perspective, were\
not duly observed: but, by this means, the piece looked so perfect, that \
judged it could not otherwise be good ; for the undermost group, as quite low,\
was very strong ; the middlemost, according to its distance, somewhat fainter;\
and the uppermost, very faint, and almost imperceptible.\
This emblem bears  mysterious interpretation, and may, in general, be\
applied to all the governments in the world, provided the figure of Roma be\
altered, and another substituted, as things require. Instead of Asculapius we may\
represent health, by the figure of  woman, and in the place of Hercules, the\
fame; taking for Valour an heroine, holding. an oaken branch in her right\
hand, with  lion on her fhield.\
In treating formerly of this sort of fables, we have called them emblema-\
tical, carrying  mystic sense, whether they be mundane or spiritual ; however,\
as  distinction between boch, and to shew that this is mundane and historical,\
we must observe, that it is not intermixed with any emblematic figures, which\
have  spiritual\
sense, except those of Asculapius and Hercules, which therefore\
in this work  reject as unfit, and only-proper for poetic and fabulous sub-\
jects;\
\
\
\
\
\
\
jects; as if, instead of Roma, were introduced Troja or Aging, which are do-\
minions no where now subsisting but in the poetic writings; we find that this\
emblem, like its subject, is not only mundane and heathenisn, as the story\
of Horatius proves, but that therein is also exprest the force or mysterious sense\
by those heathenisn figures.\
Now, if it be afked, why this cieling piece does not allude to the person of\
Horatius, as that in the tenth chapter to Hercules: my opinion is, that the con-\
clusion of the story, so far as it respects him, is contained in the second picture :\
for here we cannot expect any deification, nor do the gods interfere in the\
matter : they regard only those who are reckoned in their number, such as\
AEneas, Hercules, Memnon, and others of godly race.\
CH AP. XIII. The Fable of Calisto, adapted to the Corinthian\
Order, in the Upper-story.\
AM delighted to relate here, in four pieces, the wonderfully embellished\
story of Calisto, and her deification; as not unworthy, in my judgment, to\
adorn so fine an apartment as this last, which was of the Crinthian Order, and\
very magnificent, as well with respect to the extraordinary thoughts as their\
artful turn; the conclusion whereof renders this work most perfect.\
The first piece was as follows.\
Calisto, tired with hunting, went to repose in the shade of the trees ; Jupiter\
enamoured with her, came to delude her in the shape of Diana, and gratified\
his paffion, notwithstanding all her efforts to the contrary.\
There, on the right side of the piece, on an eminence, the innocent creature\
was sitting under the trees, not at rest, but full of concern, shame, and dread,\
melted into tears, with her hand on the edge of  fountain; her tresses, half\
loosed, hung carelesly over her naked shoulders; her chaste bosom was above\
half bare, and her legs uncovered to unseemliness, sufficiently shewed her sor-\
rowful fate. Jupiter, the author of it, was seen  little off, next the middle of\
the piece, above the horizon, not as  disguised or pretended Diana, but the\
chief of the gods, shining with majesty, with his diadem on his head, and in\
his purple robe; not as  thunderer, with lightnings and tempests, but only\
attended by his eagle. The cruel and degenerate lover seemed to deride her\
forrow, having his left hand up at his breast, as if he meant, that he had got\
his will; wherefore, penetrating the clouds, he advanced through the air, for-\
saking the miserable woman. The unmerciful incendiary, Cpid, was extin-\
guishinghis torch in the fountain, looking at Jupiter, who, with his pointing\
sceptre, commanded him to do so. Diana was seen in the off-scape, in  valley,\
with her retinpe of nymphs. The landscape was delightful and woody : here\
and there appeared some river gods. Behind Calisto, among the trees, stood \
term of Priapus in shades.  attentively viewed the aforesaid three figures, and\
reflected to myself, how well they acted their parts ; clearly opening the matter,\
even to th\'e9 very term, which, though it might be placed there accidentally, yet\
Second\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The unhappy Calisto, bemoaning her misfortune, and full of shame and fear,\
and discarded by her mistress, was seeking shelter in solitudes : yet the jealous\
Juno spyed and found her there.\
On the left side of the piece, appeared the superior goddess of heaven,\
glittering, coifed with peacock\'92 feathers, instead of  diadem, or royal head\
ornament, and seeming to turn about, as she was stepping on  eloud in or-\
der to go upwards : she was dressed in her blue garment, and held her sceptre\
in her right hand, on the right hip, charging Hellish Rage, or Revenge, which\
attended and was at her back, to punisn the innocent Calisto; and lifted up\
her left arm, and the fingers streight up, she with  severe and envious look,\
reproached the oppressed creature, with lying with her confort. Revenge was\
beating with serpents and adders, besides her smoaking pitch-torch, the mi-\
serable Calisto; who now had no more of her former shape, except her cloaths,\
which fell  prey to the hellisn fury; there lay the quiver, here the bow,\
yonder the girdle; as  conceived, it was  she-bear who shook off those cloaths,\
and was taken to flight. Being now metamorposed into so frightful  monster,\
by the immoveable jealousy of Juno; she, in her flight, looked up to heaven,\
feeming, by her bellow, to move Jupiter to piety. This landscape was also \
dark wood, filled here and there with sleeping river-gods : among the trees ap-\
peared some wild beasts running about, and  lion in  bottom on the right side\
near  rock, drinking at  river : up and down arose some palm and other trees.\
After this piece, another presented, the subject whereof was this.\
Arcas son of the deluded and now metamorphosed Calisto, was fifteen years of\
age, when, according to his custom, going  hunting, he met with  frightful sne-\
bear which came towards him, not to hurt him, as he thought, but, if poffible,\
to make herself known to him; vet ignorant that she was his mother, stoutly pre-\
pared to shoot her.\
Jupiter, from heaven, seeing this in pity hindred the\
matricide.\
Third Picture.\
Here, on the right side of the piece, Arcas appeared gently stepping forth from\
behind some trees, and putting an arrow into his bow, in order to shoot his\
mother, unknown to him in that shape. But Mercury, slying down suddenly,\
with-held his arm; at whom he therefore looked back. The celestial messenger\
staring behind at the she-bear, which was on the second ground, intimating with\
his staff in his left hand, that she should take to flight, which she seemed to do;\
fhie stood upright, with her under-parts towards him, and the upper turned to\
the left, swaying towards the road. The way she took was apparent, beginning\
from her feet like dust, or thin vapours, altering, by degrees, into clouds, which\
ran winding about her, and at last mixed with the air, wherein Jupiter appeared,\
yet very faint, and almost imperceptible. In the clouds by him, on his right\
sicle, but somewhat lower and more forward, sat the three Fatal sisters, of whom\
Clothe\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Cotho was spinning the thread, Lachests winding it on the reel, and Atropos ready to\
cut it, which Jupiter observing, laid his left hand on the scifsors, holding up his\
sceptre in the other, with his mouth  little open ; she, surprised at this, turned\
towards him. Arcas stood astride, with his breast projecting. Behind him, on\
and near  stone lay some game, as an hind, fox, hare, &. together with  gar-\
ment, which  judged to be his. Low against the said stone lay  river-god, with\
his vase. This landscape was woody like the others. The she bear, about the\
middle of the piece, appeared in the shade against the light off-scape. On the\
left side on the second ground, or at the extremity of the first, was  ruined tomb,\
with some cypresses; and behind, on  further ground, arose  large rock.\
After this,  was curious to view diligently the cieling-piece, as the concllusion\
of this artful work, and  found it thus :\
Jupiter affected with the sorrowful fate of Calisto, does, notwithstanding Juno\'92.\
hatred, glorify her with the radiant brightness of the North-star, which among the\
constelations, is named the Great Bear, and is followed by the Little Bear, into.\
which her son Arcas was transformed.\
Fourth Picture.\
Underneath in the piece, the youth was seen flying upwards, pursuing his mo-\
ther with  bow and arrow, and supported by some Cupids : he appeared back-\
wards, without any fore-shortening, with his right arm, with the arrow extended\
and the other with the bow behind, having  quiver by his fide. Jupiter some-\
what above him on the right side, sitting on  cloud, and large-fized, was, with\
an erect sceptre, shewing him the zodiac, wherein  particular bright star appearedt\
very ghittering. The bear was seen rifing  little beyond the said star, looking\
back upwards, and being encompassed with  great shining light in the shape of \
star, which enlightened the whole piece ; her hind paws rested on the clouds,\
which, beside her, from Jupiter, off to the left fide rose under her. Quite on\
the left side sat Juno on the rainbow, looking envioussy at Artas ; she leaned her-\
head on her left hand, with the elbow on the rainbow, and lay half turned to the-\
right, her under parts inclining towards Arcas, and the upper fromhim : her right\
arm and sceptre crossed her body. At her feet, on the clouds, lay some water-\
gods and goddesses, as sub-directors of the clouds and dew. Behind her stood her-\
peacock, with its tail so spread as seemingly to serve for  diadem. lris appearedt\
looking upwards behind her with an hand over her eyes to shade them from the-\
beams of the star. Diana and Apollo sat behind her. Juno and those sitting be-\
neath her were shaded by the driving clouds above. Diana, Apollo, and otners,\
looked smilling. Jupiter appeared directly in the light, of equal height with the-\
Juno was- little lower, and the river-gods and Arcas beneath. her: he was.\
bear.\
 youth of small size, receiving his light from the star above.\
Thus the work concluded with the deification of the unhappy Calisto,  second.\
time metamorphosed. It would be troublesome to rslate all the particulars of it,\
and.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
and needlefs to the knowing': wherefore, Ishall only subjoin the general dispofi\'ac\
tion ofthe lights and shaded parts. Japiter and Arcas were strongly.lighted against\
the blue of the sky on the right side. Juno contrarily, on the left side where the\
star was dark. The foremost water-god under Juno, received  little light from\
above, holding his hand over his eyes.\
\
Animadver sion.\
This fable clearly stews how beautiful bodies are polluted by uncleannefs; for\
in  fhort time after Calisto was delivered of her son Arcas, Juno transformed her,\
as  punishment of her unchastity, into  she-bear,  beast so deformed, as to be\
reckoned among monsters. The aforesaid evil has such direful effects, that the\
fruit or children of unlawful love mortally hate their guilty parents ; foi-beauty\
stained with unchastity; is of no account in the eyes of the virtuous, and what be-\
fore created wonder, is now  mark of infamy. Ovid, in an elegant and artful\
manner, assigns Calisto  notable place in the northern hemisphere, and shews Ju-\
no\'92 intreating Thetis, that those stars (according to the belief of the heathens) might\
never refresn themselves in the sea, in order to pourtray wonderfully her eternal\
shame, as surpassing the other capital stars, and having such  station near the\
Northern Pole, that, as this pole or point of the axis is above our horizon, this\
star, whatever course it takes, can never be out of our sight, and therefore her\
crime be as little out of our memories.\
But  more christian-like inference may be, that the polluted soul abhorring her\
crime, by true repentance gained  most glorious and shining aspect, besides \
fixed station in the heavens ; setting an example to others like Mary Mugdalen,\
whofe crimes, through repentance, were not only expiated, but, by an incorrup-\
table glory intirely blotted out.\
The truth of this story, taking off the poetic mafk, is, that Arcas, son of Jupiter\
and the nymph Calisto, taught the Arcadians (who pretended to be the most ancient\
people of the earth, nay, older than the moon, as Plurarch intimates in his  gzd Roman questions, boasting to be sprung from the earth, and therefore\
made great account of the oak and beech-trees and their fruit, after king Pelasgus\
had taught them to make it their food, which before was only herbs and roots)\
to till the ground and sow corn; which knowledge he learned of Triprolemus, son\
of Cres; and afterwards to make bread of it : also how to weave woollen cloths\
for covering their bodies; likewise inuring them to many civilities. In acknow-\
ledgnent of which benefaction, and in honour to him, they named their country\
Arcadia, which before was called Pelasgia, as Pausanias, in his Arcadia testifies.\

\
CH AP. XIV. Description of the inward View of the Temple of\
Apollo.\
We hhave before, in treating of Painter-like beauty, described the outside of\
\
this temple ; we shall now, according to promise, shew the inside of it,\
Stepping into the portico,  saw over the door of the entrance  carved lyre;\
whence . inferred that this edisice was sacred to Apollo. Going into it,  was\
transported with the sight of all the fine things so artfully worked and of such\
rich materials.\
In the middle stood the figure of the god on  high pedestal. At the four angles\
of this pedestal sat the Four Seasons, each holding an horn silled with the particu-\
lar fruits and flowers of the scasons. All these were of beautiful plain white\
marble. The figure of Apollo was naked, crowned with laurel; and holding \
sceptre in its hand.\
The floor was inlaid with variety of costly stones in the form of  terrestrial\
globe, in the center whereof stood the aforesaid figure.\
The arch-work was azure blue, but  could not certainly perceive it to be Mo-\
faic ; it was adorned with the seven planets, and other constelations, all in gold.\
Near the windows, between the two pilasters, were niches silled with figures, each\
representing one of the months of the ycar; they had the form of young men, and\
were cut in whitish marble.\
The whole building consisted also of marble, but not so fine as that of the\
figures ; for here and there under the niches in the mouldings, and about the\
windows it was veiny. In  basement running round the temple, was carved \
continued bass relief; the figures ofit were about four feet high, and of fine white\
stone. The other inside division was the same as we have already described it to\
be without ; the undermost part being composed of the lonic Order, the middle-\
most of the Roman, and the upper of the Corinthian.\
Over the sirst cornices appeared terms, instead of pilasters; these represented the\
hours, and with their heads supported. the cupola; they were inthe shape of young\
virgins, to the number of twenty-four. It would be tedious to describe them,\
and their badges of distinction singly; and the rather, since Caesar Ripa has so\
handsomely done it.\
Next,  took notice of the orderly disposition and proportion, which was ju-\
dicioussy observed throughout the building ; for Apollo\'92 figure was, as  guessed,\
eight feet high, and those about him seven feet and an half; the young men, re-\
presenting the months, were seven feet, and the terms for the hours, six,or six and\
half. This proportion not only seemed so large, but the imagined height really\
appeared to me to be such, without abatement for distance, as seen from under-\
neath. Reflecting on this neatness, Ithought it strange for people of sense, nay,\
great\
\
\
\
\
\
\
great masters, to agree, that  large window should come over  small one, or \
giant be set above  young child, and how such things should look becoming.\
The undermost bafs reliefs consist of smaller figures than those in the upper work,\
not without reason, for the walling wherein they stand, as well as that figure-\
work, bear throughout the building; nevertheless, he, who duly considers the\
matter, and such  sight, will soon alter his opinion ; for since Apollo, or the sun,\
is the largest of all created things, and the chief of the universe, observed by the\
heathens, by his quality among irrational creatures, as the father of the four sea-\
sons, he is the biggest and principal figure. The four seasons, brought forth by\
him, are somewhat less, and the months inferior to them in bigness, to which the\
hours must give way again, because twenty-four of them make but one natural\
day. We ought also to observe, that the four seasons are of  more composed\
countenance : the months reprefent young men still growing, and the hours shew\
nimble virgins.\
Is not this division very elegant, with respect to architecture, since every thing\
keeps its relation and property ;  good architect employs his thoughts about\
all those particular objects, in the compartion ofhalls and apartments ; according\
to which,  good master ought to accommodate himself in the painting of\
buildings.\

BOOK\
\
IX.\
Of the Painting of CIELINGS, or PLaFonds.\
\
CHAP  Of Cieling-Painting in general.\
\
AMONG all the parts of Painting, none is so difficult as that of\
\
\
\
\
\
than an upright piece on  wall or over  chimney : this is owing to\
\
\
\
ignorance, and an indifference in some people what their cielings\
\
are daubed with, so as they be but quickly finished, dazzle the eye\
and cost little. Formerly they were contented with foliage slightly painted, for\
saving expence, and that in places of consequence only ; whereas now, according\
to the present state of the painters and times, they can have other things for the\
same price, and the painter making no great matter of it, they lay hold of the\
opportunity, causing the whole cieling to be silled with histories and emblems,\
whether they be suitable or not.\
We sce that all things from small beginnings improve, and at last come to per-\
fection, through the industry of judicious artists : even so it is in painting ; for \
remember to have se\'ebn many cielings with figures, landscapes, sea-fights, battles,\
&. without any fore-shortening, as if painted on an upright wall; and others\
which were represented from underneath more or less, and yet withoJf fore-\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
shortening; as also some which fore-shortened, but had no point of sight : whence\
it is evident, that without regard to perspective, such pieces cannot possibly be\
brought to the aforesaid perfection. Now, for order sake, let us examine into\
the name of this branch.\
The word (Plafond) is French, and signifies  flat or level superficies, fit to be\
covered with boards or cloth, whereon to paint or plaister such representations or\
ornaments as we think proper, consisting mostly of histories with flying figures,\
skies with birds, flowers, and many other things: but the true sense of the word\
(Plafond) imports,  cieling of Halls, Apartments, Temples or Galleries, even\
all that hangs over head and is parellel with the ground. Such pieces are called\
Opticat, because they must be viewed from an assigned distance, without which,\
they ainavoidably appear mis-shapen, as we shall hereafter shew.\
In the matter itself we ought to consider the nature of  plafond, or cieling\
painting, and wherein it differs from  wall painting; as first, in the fore-shorten-\
ing of the objects, and secondly, in the colour;  speak with respect to the objects\
contained in one and the other, such as buildings, balustrades, figures, and other\
things occurring in ordonnances ; all which, in an hanging picture, retain their\
perfect heights and breadths, shortening in thickness only ; whereas, in plafonds,\
or cielings, neither height, measure nor proportion are to be observed; in  word,\
every thing foresshortens, except the bafis and the cap or top : what is round re-\
mains so, and what is square keeps its angles, whether in the middle, in profile,\
high or low. As for the colours, they doubtless must also differ much from those\
of hanging pictures, for they ought to appear more beautiful, not only in the\
light, but affo in the fhades,  mean in  clear light, as we may eafily appre-\
hend.\
We ought moreover to know, that by means of optics or practical perspective,\
we can make crooked things look strait, hollow or rising ones flat and even, and\
cause them outwardly to appear what they really are not; as the famous . Niceron\
and others have plainly demonstrated. Wherefore, we need not wonder, that so\
few painters excel in this branch of the art, since they are little conversant with\
the practical part of perspective, though without it it is impossible to execute \
good cieling-piece. It is certain that many painters are rash enough to undertake\
such  piece of work, and sometimes they happen to perform good things, (for\
laboriousness and daily practice often contribute much) nevertneless they do not\
inquire whether their methods be the shortest or longest, commonly chusing that\
which first offers, drudging witheut certainty, and led by meer chance.\
CHAP. II. Of the usual Difficulties in Cieling-Painting.\
IRST, we are at  great stand, because we cannot use the life either in the\
nudities or flving draperies, though they be the principal objects.\
Secondly, Because we cannot, without great trouble, find the true and certain\
places of the figures we introduce ; for which reason, they must mostly be done\
by guess.\

Lastly, It follows, that the master is always in pain for the effect of the paint-\
ing in being fixed in its place.\
These difficulties are not  little vexatious, even to one who understands his\
business; for it is otherwise with those who make more use of their hands than\
careful than others. Paint as many cielings as you please, as long as you do not\
believe that there are grounds and rules for it, and remain in this ignorance, you\
will never surmount the aforesaid difficulties. The most skilful master is often at\
 loss in this part of painting. Let us then in the first place learn perspective, and\
what it shews us ; since thereby only we may arrive at this laudable study, which\
otherwise is impossible.\
CHAP. III. Of fore-sbortening Objects in Cielings.\
VT is-obvious, that the off-scape in  common picture, is the part which retires\
or goes off from us, leffens and grows faint, and that the horizon is an utmost\
distance limiting our sight.\
Contrary, in cielings, our off-scape and boundary of sight is the firmament or\
starry sky ; whereby objects, the higher they are, lessen the more, even to insensi-\
bility, not only in their proportions and neatness, but also in their colours.\
Here we ought to observe, that all objects of what shape or form soever, keep\
their due breadth, provided they are parallel with-the horizon: for instance, placc\
 square stone so as to be viewed directly against it, or  figure in the same manner.\
Here you see that the top and bottom\
(In Plate LXI. we exhibit  square body. )\
of the said stone keep their squares, and that the upper and under corners of it fall\
perpendicularly from the point of sight; moreover, that, however the said square\
is turned, thetop and body always make  right angle, and consequently the\
hindermost extremity is parallel with the foremost. It is the same with figures of\
other objects.\
Place, for instance,  man on one or other side of the piece, standing up-\
right, and the point of sight in the middle; let him be in profile, and have both\
his shoulders of equal height, and you will then perceive that the shoulders, from\
one to the other keep to their full breath, and their figure its full thickness from\
top to toe. Thus we see evidently, that there is no other fore-shortening than in\
the length ; or to say better, in the height; and the more the figures, or other\
objects, rise and approach the point of sight, the shorter and more mis-shapen\
they become; because in their breadth they retain their measure and proportion,\
as before has been said. This is  principal rule, and ought alivays to be observed.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
As for buildings, . Boss\'e9 gives full precepts touching them, in the latter part\
of his book of Perspective ; vet  have room to say, that when we would place\
columns over columns for galleries, we ought to draw  rising line through their\
centers, from the basis or ground to the point of sight, even through each balis-\
ter, and thus find the due proportion of their heights as well as the breadths, by\
the help of  gradation line.\
This, with respect to proportion, must likewise be observed in designing figures\
and other objects, as  shall hereafter shew by examples.\
This fort of painting is not only the most artful but also the most difficult, as\
 have before said ; because, although we understand the rules and practice of it,\
it appears nevertheless disagrecable and deformed ; which no one can be \'e0 judge\
of but the master himself, unless it be put up in its proper place, and seen at\
the due distance.\
\
CHAP. IV. Of the Sizes of Cieling Figures.\
HE figures which we paint in cielings, ought not to exceed the common\
size of  man, to wit, six feet and an half, when they are so low as to be\
\
even with the cieling; but being higher, and sitting on clouds or flying, they\
must lessen and go off, as perspective teaches. Yet we may represent the deities\
as big aswe pleafe, provided they be not painted with more strength than other\
figures; it even sometimes happens, that when they almost vanisn out of sight,\
thev have yet human bigness.\
Eun-shine is the most proper and agreeable in spiritual representations.\
As for the glory of each deity in particular, they keep it when they appear to\
men, but when they are represented in heaven it is  mixture of many smaller, pro-\
ducing one great fhining. To do this artfully is not  matter of the least conse-\
quence ; and he is  great master, who, instead of dark, thick and heavy clouds\
like wool-sacks, places his figures on thin, transparent and almost inseniible va-\
pours.\
It will not be improper, in this chapter, to mention something of flying figures\
in the air.\
Though the air be seldom without  wind, and this may always be somewhat\
perceived, it is nevertheless not advisable to make it appear in cielings; because,\
if the wind were stirring, the sigures slying before it would seem to be motionless;\
and contrarily, those which are sitting or standing shew as much violence as the\
slying ones : for this reason no wind must come into the piece but what the ve-\
locity of each sigure causes, that we may plainly see by what motion the drape-\
ries are slung, as also the places the figures are going to or returning from, one\
gently waving and the other nimble and swift.\
The different stuffs are very proper to this on such occasions, and they very\
much conduce to express the matter; as the ressexion of ruffling silks for waving\
figures\
\
\
\
\
\
\
figures and which are gently descending, thin and sleazy silk for swift and down-\
flying figures, and the most pliant or thick silk or stuff for sitting, lying or stand-\
ing ones. The secret and importance of  fine stirring cieling piece lies chiesly\
herein.\
As for the making of the coloured stuffs of flying figures, because they cannot\
be put on the layman, and therefore not painted after the life, we cannot lay\
down any rules about them ; nothing but  good conception and natural judg-\
ment, joined to continual practice and observation, can bring the artist to per-\
fori it. We must use these means, and be perfect in them; observing what\
stuff is most proper to the occasion, as we have before intimated.\
We ought also to take dare that the thin stuffs be warm and transparent against\
that the flying figures never seem to be upright, as if standing, much less to be\
standing; but always sitting, kneeling, lying or slying, unless in the case of peo\'ac\
ple supposed to be on cielings or galleries, who then are either standing, stoop-\
ing or kneeling, as the subject requires.\
Let me say, that we ought sometimes to make some additions to the disposition\
of the general and particular objects; but with as much caution as possible, that\
the inability of the artist and the deficiency of the work may not appear.\
CHAP. . Method for viewing  Cieling-piece on the Easel, as if on\
the Cieling.\
 have already observed the difficulties arising in cielings, with respect to\
\
the use of the life, and in laying down rules subservient to it. Now,\
had  my sight  should certainly find out some; but since this is impracticable\
without figural demonstration, and  cannot possibly verbally do it, Ishall never-\
theless shew some methods, which, though they may seem trifling, have always\
been of service to me and of little trouble in their use.\
After sketching my ordonnance upon paper,  fixed it against  low cieling;\
then taking  looking glass and sitting under it,  with ease exactly considered\
every thing, observing what was wanting in it, and thus  marked and corrected\
faults as much as possibly  could. Next,  drew each figure, whether naked\
or cloathed, after the life, in such manner as shall hereafter be shewn. Then \
dcad-coloured my piece with such light as  thought proper. After this  took\
the looking glafs again and held it over my head, in order to view commodiously\
the piece standing behind me, inclining  little backwards on the easel as if it were\
against the cieling, and casting my eyes every where, first on the general design\
and then on the particular parts; this examen  repeated, till, by several correc-\
tions,  found that  had brought the piece to my fancy. Here be mindful not\
to take too near  distance, to the end the glafs may take in the whole piece ;\
for\
\
\
\
\
\
\
for which reason  sometimes got with the looking glass on  chair or table, and\
having my pallet and pencils in readiness, and brought my piece into such for-\
wardness,  finished it without further looking back.\
 will now, for the service of those who may find it useful and necessary, also\
treat,\
CHAP. VI. Of Designing after the Life, for the Use of Cieling\
Painters.\
TE must not flatter ourselves, that cieling painting can be performed with-\
 out good knowledge in proportion, since, as has been said, we cannot\
\
conveniently make use of the life ; for, how great soever your skill may be, you\
will find difficulty enough, though the life were before you, to bring it on the\
eloth. Nevertheless, to shew that it may be done, and that  have often used the\
life, Ishall, for the service of those who are not sparing of pains, lay down my\
manner of doing it.\
After  had set the model, whether of man or woman, on an high place, ac-\
cording to my sketch,  sat down on the floor with my back against the scaffold,\
with  looking-glass between my legs, which  moved and turned about so long,\
till the model appeared in it in such  manner as  wanted according to my point\
of sight; and then designing it on drawing paper as correct as possible,  painted\
after this design without any trouble.\
As for the dresses  managed them in the same manner, casting the garment on\
the layman accordirg to my sketch;  mean without slying, which is  thing im-\
possible and depends only on imagination.  then placed the layman, thus dres-\
sed, on an high tressel, and sat down against it in the manner aforesaid, and made\
 design of the dress; if it was  flying or lying figure,  made shift with pack-\
thread, wires, or such like means, as well as  could, sparing for no trouble, when\
the matter was important and  had  mind to do something fine.\
 used the same method in designing after all sorts of plaisters, as faces, vases,\
urns, ornaments, capitals, festoons of flowers, &. in order to have them from\
underneath. Thus  mastered the greatest difficulties occurring in this study.\
However,  did not this before my cloth was in readiness for it, that  might not\
mistake; since, notwithstanding all our care in some things, especially upright\
standing objects, we may easily be deceived.\
As to the preparation of the cloths for our design, as likewise the dead-co-\
louring, in order to sinish, and thereby refresn our memories,  shall now treat of\
them.\
First,  six the point of sight either within or without the piece, as my place\
of standing directs; then  strike with  chalked thread, from the said point, as\
many lines over my piece as  find necessary to serve all my upright standing ob-\
jects, viz. balusters, columns, pilasters, figures, &. which  suppose to be per-\
pendicular :\

pendicular :  also strike some diagonals, or slope lines, from that side of the piece\
whence the light comes, either right or left, parallel and equidistant from each\
other. These put me in mind how high or low the light falls on my objects: if\
they run parallel with the base, the objects are lighted entirely from the side;\
if oblique or sloping, as before is said, they lighten  little fronting; and if they\
fall from on high from the point of sight, the light comes directly fronting, as is\
visible in the examples, Numb. ,   in Plate LXII.\
Tthink myself obliged here to propose to the artist  small practice of my\
own invention, and, in my opinion, of little trouble, but certain great advantage\
to-cieling painters; fince we find that although there are certain rules, yet they\
cannot be put in use without the greatest trouble, application, and loss of time,\
unless aided by some practice or other, or by some artful instrument; like Astro-\
nomy, which, how demonstrative soever, has its globe and astrolabe; Architec-\
ture, its plan and level ; Geometry, the oval, triangle, square and compass\'e9s;\
Mathematics, algebra, &. But to return to my invention.\
 first mould some wax puppets, as we have shewn in the \'f4th Chapter of Or-\
wires, some long, others short, whereon to stick the puppets, and keep them\
from bending, whether they be made standing, lying, slying, or sitting: this\
being done,  take an oblong wooden trough, lined with tin, of what bigness \
 pleafe. Into the corners  put some pins or serews to fasten  cover of wood\
or tin fitting the trough, and made full of little holes wherein to stick the afore-\
faid wired puppets, and so as they may turn easily : then Ifill the trough with\
clay or kneaded bran, and thus my machine is in readiness. Now when Imake\
use of it  stick my puppets, bent and turned according to my design, on the\
wires, and through the holes into the clay where  would have them, one high,\
another low, one stooping forwards, another leaning back, &. as the subject\
requires, which will then stand immoveable.\
My scheme being in this forwardness,  lean the whole machine back on  ta-\
ble, be the light left or right, and then slightly design the figures in the manner\
 have shewed with the lines.  can give the machine such  light as  desire,\
either from afide, fronting, or from on high,  common, sun-shine, or candle-\
light.\
Now for perfecting this sketch and conveniently painting after it,  set my\
layman, with such  dress as each figure requires, in the manner before laid.\
down; and then, my cloth being ready,  proceed to painting.\
 invented this machine in the vear  and put it in use for about five years\
with great advantage, and with such exact reflexion that  afterwards had no fur-\
ther occasion for it, though  never used more than three or at most four pup-\
pets.\
Now the curious artist must also know what observations lmade in the use of\
the machine.\
First, as Plate LXIII. fhiews,  put one puppet coming directly down, quite\
extended, namely, with the head and feet both on . line, and then ob-\
served\
\
\
\
\
\
\
served that there was not the least fore-shortening, all the parts having their full\
lengths.\
 second puppet  set upright, standing in profile on one side of the point of\
sight, and found it fore-shortened in all its parts.\
 third  set stying upwards from behind forwards, and perceived that the\
members fore-shortened somewhat more than those of the first and somewhat less\
than those of the second.\
 fourth  placed sitting with its upper parts upright, the thighs parallel, and\
the legs like the upper parts, and observed, that when it was quite in profile, the\
upper parts and legs fore-shortened and the thigh kept its full length, as it also\
did when in al front position.\
Having made  firm impression of these things in my thoughts, Ihad no fur-\
ther occasion for that method.\
We shall now say something,\
\
CHAP. VII. Of the Colouring of slying Figures.\
HEREIN we must observe, that in cieling-painting it is the same as in\
landscapes. First, we rub in the greatest light of the fky, then all parts\
\
about it; next the highest and most faint objects, and then the lower and more\
near ones ; and in case  balustrade be represented, it must be the last: the reason\
of this Ihave shewn in treating of the dead-colouring of histories and landscapes.\
Moreover, as in  fine landscape the sky principally governs all things, and\
without it no proper distance can be given to the picture, so it is the same in \
cieling-piece with figures slying through the air; for it is impossible to make\
objects rise, unless they have some communication with the air. Nor is it enough\
for objects going off higher and further from us, to be painted fainter and fainter,\
as in  drawing or print, but the colour must also be shewn, and as the air is co-\
loured so must the objects partake of it, Imean in their shades; for if the air be\
blue, yellow, or red, the shades ought likewise to have  mixture of blue, yel-\
low, or red.\
As to the light of the objects, we must observe that of what colour soever it\
be, it breaks and grows darker as it goes off; even were the air, as  may sav,\
snow-white, it breaks by distance or air interposing; the red becomes violet, the\
yellow greenisn, and the violet blue : as the objects go off from us and approach\
the air, they are darkened ; white becomes darker, pale yellow the same, and so\
on in other colours.\
Something still remains to be remarked with respect to objects in the air, viz.\
that since the air communicates light from all parts, the broad shades cannot\
possibly be so dark as in  landscape or other parts; but contrarily, the dark\
touches will be so much the stronger: all that is in shade ought to be lighter and\
seen more plain, yet somewhat leis than in the light. It must be likewise known,\
that\

that round objects have no furface, especially on the shaded side, that is to say,\
the out-line against the sky ought to unite and vanisn, not quite scumbled away,\
but made somewhat lighter on the edge, as we have clearly demonstrated by the\
example of  globular body, Book . Chap.  implying, that such works in the\
air differ from others, to wit, that the objects against the sky are more rounding\
and going off.\
CHAP. VIII. General Observations in painting the Cielings of Halls,\
Galleries, &.\
HE first and principal observation on these occasions is, that the quality and\
regularity of the architecture be firmly preserved in all its parts.\
The second observation concerns the grandeur of the architecture, as being\
the main matter. Painting in this case is only to be considered as an aid, to\
accomplish it with less charges; wherefore such care must be taken, that the\
painter\'92 designs do not mar those of the architect, but that both unite in such \
manner as to induce the eye to take every thing for truth itself.\
By the first observation, that the architecture ought to preserve its regularity,\
we give to understand, that the structure of the room must chiefly be regarded\
by the painter in his cieling pieces, so as not to be hurt by making openings where\
they ought not to be; for it is not allowable to make them every where, as big\
or little as we please: the cieling must remain cieling. All that is without the\
painting, as the summers, ought to have their proper thicknesses and be lasting,\
For instance, let us suppose the cieling divided into three pannels lined with cloth;\
one next to the windows, the second in the middle over the chimney, and the third\
to be next the wall; that in the middle is between two summers one foot in, and\
the two side ones lie almost flush with the under parts of those summers. Now\
if the two side cloths be, like the middle one, adorned with sky, and the thicknefs\
of the summer (which is one foot) not painted on the cloth, the cieling on those\
sides is so much weakened, or at least seems to be so, and is heavier in the\
middle, contrary to architecture : whereas to make it look natural and according\
to order, the ponderosity must in this case be on the sides, and the middle part\
lightest, that it may not seem to be falling on our heads. Moreover, we ought\
to observe, that there must be but one opening, and that in the middle, since\
there is but one point of sight and but one place of standing to view the work\
to advantage. As for painting the thickness of the summer,  only faid it to\
rectisy  mistake often committed when  cieling is made all over open, and in-\
stead of  covering, nothing is left but  grate, which cannot be justified. Some\
think it may pafs for  lantern, but they are mistaken, for  lantern rises and \
cieling lies flat; moreover the whole cieiing cannot serve for  lantern, because of\
the\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
the windows in front. The principal or middle piece must predominate, and of\
consequence be open and the others closed ;  mean not to have any sky or living\
creatures, but bass-reliefs, foliage, compartments or flowers, all. of such  co-\
lour as suits with the apartinent. This  judge to be the first and principal care\
and study of  good cieling-painter, before he sets about the work ; for in the\
division of  cieling it is as with  diamond, the largest and most valuable is set\
in the middle, and round it the less and less.\
As to the second observation, that the art of painting is aiding to architecture,\
and enriches it at less expence, the point is plain ; wherefore  shall proceed to\
shew the reason why the one may spoil the other.\
In painting divisions, it often happens that the summers have not proper rests\
to lie on, especially when the cieling is covered all over (and the summers hid)\
with  single cloth, and left to the judgment of an ignorant painter, who then\
without consideration divides it into three, four, six, eight, or more pannels, and\
these parted by painted summers, which do not bear on any thing. Now to\
prevent this, vou must let each summer rest on  discharger, pilaster, or car-\
touche, as architecture teaches: for instance, were you to divide the two, pannels\
next the windows and wall each into two parts, in order to have four pannels,\
this would be improper and against architecture, because of the flatness over the\
window, unless it were compass-headed, and then it would not do without  car-\
touche.\
If it be afked, whether the division be  painter\'92 business,  say, it is, so far\
as he understands architecture, otherwise more proper for an architect; at least it\
As to the work, where the painting may disorder or be contrary to architec-\
ture, it lies in the designs, when they do not suit the building, nor perfectly\
bear on foundations, or have their proper weight. By the foundation of the\
painting.  mean the apartment; and by the weight of the design, that what the\
painter intends to exhibit in his cieling piece be not too heavy, and seem to press\
down the under parts. The better to clear my meaning,  will suppose  room\
to be twenty feet square : now if  second depth, or upper room, were to be re-\
presented, the piers, columns, doors and windows thereof must needs accord\
with those of the under room and bear upon them;, and in the next place, the\
course of orders ought exactly to be observed, as architecture teaches, that is to\
say, the heaviest must be undermost : first the Tuscan, next the Doric, then the\
Jonic, next the Romon, and lastly the Corinthian, and so upwards lighter and lighter,\
which lthink is seldom observed; and the reason is, because the figures are some-\
times represented bigger than the life, which necessitates the artist to proportion\
his by-works accordingly : an unpardonable error, and not at any rate to be jus-\
tified  But Ishall say more of this on another occasion, and now pursue our pur-\
pose in cielings.  principal point is that the work rise, and that its force unite\
with the life; that is, that the objects in the lower parts be not painted stronger\
than the fixed work, as compartments, bass reliefs and other ornaments, which,\
not being fore-shortened, receive their light through the windows. Now it may\
be afked, whether, in case we were to represent an apartment above with the same\
light\
\
\
\
\
\
\
light as below, the force of light and shade must not be the same; And  say it\
ought not, because of the great difference between them; as we may easily sup-\
pose in two columns set over each other, receiving their lighr from one front, the\
one from the undermost and the other from the uppermost windows : here the\
upper base must have no more force than the under capital, for were it other-\
wise, it would seem to be nearer; it would also not rise, and consequently over-\
power the life. It is here, as in  fine landscape, where the fore-ground has the\
greatest force, and the second and third are lefs and fainter in proportion as they\
go off. It is the same with slying figures; for the light weakens by their rising,\
and the shades become, as well as in  room by the surrounding air, weaker and\
fainter; but the touches and shades keep their force.\
We have observed what is necessary to the stability and regularity of the ar-\
chitecture with respect to painting, so that both may seem to be one body ; as\
we shall exemplify by the following fable out of Ovid, proposed here as  pain-\
ter-like simile.\
 \
Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, two accomplished and agreeable young people,\
introduce, representing Architecture and Painting. Salmacis meeting Hermaphro-\
ditus, and imagining her happiness lay in the possession of so beautiful an object,\
falls in love with him; but finding  repulse, she invokes the aid of the gods,\
and thereby obtains her earnest suit. The young man, not daring to resist the\
will of heaven, gives up the cause, and is by Mercury (whom we must observe\
here to be Optics) joined to her, and thus of two bodies is made one. Fur-\
ther applications are needless, since the simile sufficiently explains itself.\
Now to continue our subject, the following observations are, at the beginning\
of the work, chiesly necessary.\
First, The condition of th\'e9 place.\
Secondly, The quality, office and inclination of the owner, and what subjects\
are proper thereto, whether histories, fables, &.\
Thirdly, The disposition of the subjects.\
Fourthly, How the subject is to be divided.\
First, By the condition of the place  mean the light of the room, and in what\
manner it takes the cieling; also into how many pannels the architect has di-\
vided the cieling, and which is the principal, that we may adapt our thoughts\
thereto in the disposition of the reprefentations, as well as in the execution of\
them.\
Secondly, By the quality, &. of the owner, we must understand whether he be\
 divine or lawyer, philosopher or artisan, and whether he incline to spiritual or\
moral, general or particular representations ; that is, such as relate to him or\
his family in particular, or generally to any one who may live in the house after\
his decease ; according to which information we ought to chuse subjects suitable.\
Thirdly, How the subjects ought to be disposed; namely, what must be placed\
above in the air, wherein, as is said, lies the soul of  room-painting, and what\
below, as touching the body of it: this we divide into spiritual and moral ; spi-\
ritual, all that is governed by heaven, and moral, every thing that is directed\
by our judgment.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Fourthly, How the subject is to be divided : Here the principal piece in the\
middle, must shew either-the cause or rise of the story, or the effect of it; the\
next to it must exhibit the matter itself; and that further off, an appendix to\
or inference from it. But to make this point plainer,  shall give an example.\
In the middle pannel  place Solomon, before the Ark of the Covenant, praying\
to God for wisdom, and on each side  represent, surrounded with  glory, the\
gifts which God bestows on him, as wisdom and riches flowing down; and in\
the lesser pannels  exhibit, in bafs relief, the corporeal virtues. On this foot\
we may handle any thing or subject whatsoever; and by having due regard to\
the aforesaid four particulars, and well executing them, such  representation\
will certainly please every one, even envy itself.\
Hence we may sufficiently perceive how orderly we must manage; wherefore\
it is no wonder that so few excel in cieling painting, though it has rules as well\
as other studies, but if these be not duly observed, we cannot gain the point. He\
that sets up for  good master, must shew that he understands his art.\
If  am afked, whether  think Corregio, Cortona, Vovet, and others, who per-\
formed wonders in this branch, have always so punctually followed the rules,\
and so nicely regarded all the observations here laid down, according to my ap-\
prehension ,  answer, that it would have been better if they had done it; or else\
what  say must, as  have shewed in  foregoing chapter, be owing to the ma\'ac\
chine with puppets, which  made use of for four or five years, and afterwards\
laid aside ; for we ought first to have  thorough knowledge of  thing, and then\
demonstrate it. But  am further of opinion, that had the great masters per-\
fectly known the prescribed rules, we should not find such great mistakes in\
their works, as some now think there are. Nevertheless, it is most certain, that\
none are qualified for this judgment, but those who have made it their practice;\
for he who understands the rules, and retains them in memory, can always judge\
whether they be observed or not, though not able to do it himself: yet they\
who work only by guess, and know nothing of grounds and rules, are more\
unpardonable than those who are acquainted with them and do not use them;\
though both blameworthy, the one for his carelessness and neglect of learning,\
and the other for his knowledge and neglect of using it.\
 am very sensible that some will make little account of many things, by\
me delivered as necessary; but  am in no pain for that, if  can but give\
satisfaction to  curious reader.\
 must own, that in my juvenile years  daubed some cielings, but never flat-\
tered myself that  understood the art so as  ought, because  was then igno-\
rant that there were any certain grounds and rules; nevertheless  afterwards at-\
tained them, by sometimes hearing others discourse about them, and by the\
rules of perspective, and by my own indefatigable application to so noble  study;\
insomuch, that at last  could sketch  large and grand composition with more\
certainty and less trouble than formerly  little one.  must, on this occasion,\
relate what course  took.\
 had in my room  little jutty closet, and when  was to make an ordon-\
nance,  pinned my paper against the upper part of it; and, having  candle\
in\
\
\
\
\
\
\
in one hand and  crayon in- the other,  laid myself on my back, and scratched\
my thoughts on the paper. This  found to be  good method for preventing\
mistakes,  mean in the sketch. Now for the painting it,  also did it against\
the cieling, yet not after such  slight scratch; for, having made my sketch, \
took out of the prints of Vovet and others, such actions and postures as were pro-\
per; altering them either in the faces, hands, or folds of draperies, more or less,\
by guess as well as  could. Thus  made shift, yet all was done against the\
cieling; whereby you may judge what trouble  had, as well in finding things\
as afterwards in executing them, which really was double work: but when bet-\
ter informed,  sat commodiously at my easel. He who proceeds with certainty\
has  great advantage above others.\
CHAP. IX. Method for Drawing fore-sbortened Buildings, Figures,\
Trees, &. after the Life.\
INCE it commonly happens, on Nature\'92 denying her favourable affistance,\
 that we have recourse to our wits for means to supply the defect; it was even\
\
my case in cieling painting. After having given myself much trouble to no pur-\
pose, and taken useless pains in order to design every thing after the life, lat last\
found out the following method, which has made me full amends. It is very\
profitable in all places with low horizons, as you will perceive in the use.\
 suppose then, for instance, that  am to make  design of the Stadt-house\
at Amsterdam (it is no matter if it were thrice its present height) and this without\
looking up.  chuse  station or distance of eight feet, more or less, from the\
building, as occasion requires. Then  take  convex looking glass of about \
foot diameter (to be bought at the Nuremberg toy-shops) and place it against the\
inside of my drawing-board or port-folio :  contrive it in such  manner, that it\
may either stand upright or leaning back, according as  would see things either\
from beneath or higher. Thus  approach with the open port-folio, and my\
back towards the object, till the building, tree, &. appear as  would have it,\
and then design it from the looking glass on blue or white paper.\
This method is very convenient for drawing all sorts of large works in nar-\
row places or streets, even  view of twenty or thirty houses. It is also useful to\
landicape painters in their country views ; they may take whole tracts of land,\
with towns and villages, waters, woods, hills and sea, from East to West, with-\
out moving cither head or eyes : it is likewise proper for those who are ignorant\
of perspective.\
We must here also shew  method for representing all sorts of fore-shortened\
flat-faced ordonnances, whether pictures, hangings or bafs reliefs, against walls,\
cielings or any where else, either standing, hanging or lying, and that with cer-\
tainty according to perspective. These are things which painters ofteen meet\
with in exhibiting rooms, galleries, gardens, and other places; and the method\
for\
\
\
\
\
\
\
for doing it, though not attended with difficulty, yet sometimes puzzles those\
who neglect it.\
 have therefore chosen the example in Plate LXIV. which is the foundation\
of all fore-shortenings, as well of apartments as cielings, and the performance\
is as follows. Having made the scheme of  room in perspective,  divide the\
height and width of the side wall (where  would have hangings or representa-\
tions of pictures) into  certain number of diminishing feet, fetching the crofs\
lines from the point of sight, and the perpendiculars from the plan or scale.\
Now in this example we perceive four principal fore-shortenings; for  is\
the cieling,   side wall,  the floor, Da loose picture hanging forwards, all\
four proceeding, after one and the same manner, from the point of sight, as the\
middle part  shews, which is divided into squares. To say more would be use-\
less, and tedious to those who are in the least conversant with this art.\
CHAP. . Of the Harmony and Union of Colours in Cieling Pieces.\
LTHOUGH in the chapter touching the deities and their qualities,\
we shall treat of the colours proper to them, we must, on this occasion,\
\
say something previous, and shew how the colours ought to be placed and han-\
dled, in order to create  perfect harmony.\
You must not herein by any means be known by flaring, strong, and glitter-\
ing colours.  am of opinion, that on this occasion nothing suits better than\
the union of the colours ; because it is agreeable to the eye, causes  fine relief,\
and contains something uncommon, even supernatural. And when  pretend\
here, that in cieling pieces you ought to use tender and weak colours (even were\
they mostly fetched from white )  do not contradict my asfertion in  former chap-\
ter, to wit, that particular colours are assigned to the deities, according to the\
nature and meaning of each, as red, purple, yellow, blue, green, &. and even\
to be known by them without their usual tokens of distinction, as Phabus with\
sun, Diana with the moon, Mercury with his caduceus, Ceres with her ears of\
corn, Jupiter with the eagle, Juno with the peacock, Momus with his fool\'92 cap\
and bauble, &. They who can give their pieces such an exprefsion are\
principally commendable, and- the, painting must look well. Nevertheless\
 do not hereby confine the lightness and darkness of the colours, whether they\
differ little or much from each other, or whether they ought to be almost\
all white or light, since the colours- may be beautiful, be they ever so light.\
Even were  cieling piece to consist only of white and black; light and shade,\
it would have no less decorum, nor be less valuable.  think it, in this case, to\
be much like  print, which, though consisting only of white and black, has\
yet its harmony and decorum, when light and shade are well disposed against\
each\

each other; and still more with the addition of proper colours, and those thinly\
and transparently managed, whereby it gets the property of  picture.\
As the principal goodnefs of  cieling piece lies in an artful disposition of the\
figures above each other, so it is of no lefs consequence that the colours be\
well adapted thereto.\
 will now give an instance in two pieces, differing from each other in light\
undermost depth strongly set off in colour against the second, which is  little\
dark, and the third is light against the dark blue of the sky. In the latter\
(which  think the best on account of decorum) the uppermost group is dark\
against  light blue sky, and the undermost, by the force of light, set off against\
the uppermost. Even were we thus to dispose three or more grounds or groups\
over each other, it would look very decorous; and each deity would nevertheless\
keep its proper colours, yet less in force, in proportion to the distance ; for when\
the uppermost group is set off against the light sky, it causes  wonderful go-\
off, and the reason proceeds from the sky\'92 seeming to be infinitely higher, which\
contrariwise cannot be effected.\
If it be objected, that supposing one of the principal figures in the uppermost\
group, ought, according to its dignity and the reasons laid down in the suiting of\
colours, to have  white drefs, and therefore the aforesaid position will be over-\
thrown : ldeny it; for it will be helped by disposing some dark clouds behind,\
which will preserve that garment in its force, and make it have  pleafing har-\
behind each other, we have more largely handled this point, and shewed its truth\
and decorum : for dark against light cannot advance with so much force as the\
light may against the dark, because the light has greater strength in itself. How-\
ever, to put an end to  point of so great latitude, which by discourse cannot be\
fully demonstrated,  shall conclude it with the great Junius, who, in his third\
book of the Art of Painting, says,\
ee Thus we see that artists, in their works, ereate shades or depths, to the end\
that the parts to come out may approach with more force, and seem to meet the\
eye of the beholder, even without the picture. Let two parallel lines, says Lon-\
ginusk be drawn upon  cloth, with light and dark colours ; the brightnefs of\
the light will soonest strike the eye, and seem to be nearest. And  little fur-\
ther, quoting Johannes Grammaticus, he says , ee lf we paint  board with white\
and black, the white will always seem to be nearer, and the black further off.\
Therefore,\'92\'92 continues the same Author, in his observation on this point, ee the\
painters also make use of blackisn or darkish-brown colours, when they are to\
represent the deep hollow of  well, cistern, ditch, bottomless pit, or the like.\
But when, on the contrary, they will make any thing come out, as the breasts\
of  woman, an hand held out, or the feet of  leaping or running horse, they\
lay on both the sides,  sufficient shade of black and brown colours, in order that\
these parts may, by the neighbouring darkness, be flung off from the picture. with\
 lively force.\

CHAP. XI. Of the Deities in sacred and profane History, and Fables;\
and, first, of the Difference between  facred and profane Representation.\
AVING done with treating of cieling pieces,  thought it improper to\
Aend this book, and make  new one of the following chapters; because\
the matter has such  connexion, that we can scarce think of the one, without\
falling presently on the other.\
It is certain, that in common pictures the deities, ghosts, demi-gods, angels,\
virtues, and other powers may likewise be introduced, nay are even inseparable\
adjuncts; but into cieling pieces, where the upper part is the sky, they must of\
necessity come ; because the major part of such representations relate either to\
their persons, qualities, or virtues.\
Now, duly to execute this representation of the deities, the artist ought chiefly\
to be acquainted with the sacred and profane stories, as well as with the poeti-\
cal fictions, that he may learn from them the particular occcurrences and pro-\
perties peculiar to each person and rank of the deities or upper powers, and re-\
present them accordingly ; for although imagination must, in this point, lend\
great assistance, yet it is not safe for every man to rely eatirely thereon, lest he\
should be deceived; like the man, whose neighbour dreaming that in  cer-\
tain place was hidden great treafure, and awaking and going thither found it by\
digging, and carried it home; he, on this good luck, laid himself down on an\
heap of poppies, in hopes of the fame happinefs, but, after  long sleep, he\
awaked without any advantageous intimation from his dream; contrarily, found\
his pocket picked, and thus at once was bereft of his hopes and the money he\
before had in possession. This simile is too plain to need nearer application.\
 judicious master must certainly be well exercised in the knowledge of the\
true conditions of the things he is to handle, that he may not be thought an ig-\
norant ; for the truth cannot be hidden with respect to the inventor. Where-\
fore you ought to take heed of mixing this truth with salse things, especially\
in sacred stories, or spiritual representations ; since there is so great  contrariety\
between them, that they cannot be joined, unless to shew the disagreement:\
say, they cannot possibly be joined in order to express  single meaning, but will\
rather serve to confound, weaken and mistake it; except they be separately dis-\
posed, the spiritual above, in heaven, and the worldly below, on the earth.\
\
speak with respect to emblems; for there is  great disparity between Pallas and\
the Wisdom of God, since the latter cannot be attributed to any person, and much\
less represented on the earth. The same may be said of Janus and Providence.\
The heavenly and civil justice are also very unlike. We must therefore note,\
that the whole lconology, or science of the heathenisn figures, though formerly\
accounted heavenly, has now no relation to the soul, but to the moral virtues and\
merits of men.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Let us then enquire, with reverence, what are Chriftian emblems, and what\
profane or heathenisn; using in spiritual. representations nothing but what is pure\
and heavenly, and in the worldlv, all that is proper to them, in order to gain the\
esteem both of religious and worldly persons.\
 passage in scripture mentions the driving Lucifer and his companions out of\
heaven ; whence we may plainly conclude, that those monsters afterwards fell to the\
share of the heathen, as no longer pertaining tothe faints. But we do not find after\
that time, any more such unruly spirits were expelled heaven, wherefore we are\
not allowed to represent more such iiistances. But in the case of men seen to\
battle the true faith, things may be accompanied and represented with heathenisn\
emblems, because, as is faid, the heathens gave themselves up to the devil; the\
better by that means to express their error and shew the truth, thus also driving\
them out of heaven.\
It is, upon occasion, likewise not improper or disagreeing with the pharisees\
or hypocrites ; but has  greater weight in fictitious stories or parables. Nor\
can we, without offence, introduce other emblems than Christian-like, when they\
only tend to incite to salvation. In which case we may represent angels or spi-\
rits, to keep those hypocrites out of heaven.\
In true profane histories, as the Roman, Grecian and others, this management\
would be improper, but we may lawfully use hieroglyphic and other characters,\
of which there is an infinity ; for instance, by  religious person,  white garment,\
or an offering cup; by  cruel one,  tyger\'92 skin, or dragon, either on his helmet\
or shield. It would be preposterous to place  vestal virgin by Numa Pompilius, in\
order to shew his religiousness, or Achiiles by Alexander to express his valour, or\
an Hercules by Milo; and still more ridiculous to set an Herrules by Hercules to\
pourtray strength, or  fool by Momas to exhibit solly. It would,  fay, be very\
ridiculous to explain Ovid by emblems, sceing he gives us nothing but emblems.\
This would be  sceking light with light, or enlightening darkness with dark\
clouds. We want not another sun for expressing the\'92 sun\'92 light. But these re-\
presentations and by-works must only tend to the exhibiting invisible things by\
visible objects.\
The more noble and lofty the things we are to represent, the more valuable\
ought to be the emblems we chuse for them; for instance, in expressing the na-\
ture and quality of the deities, we use young and chaste virginity, \'e0 state in all\
ages accounted the most rare and valuable; but in representing the paffions of\
men, we make use of beasts; or else inaniinate characters and objects; for being\
of  lower rank than the deities, they must also bear lesser objects.\
If now it should be objected, because  represent Eternity by  serpent, and the\
Purity of the deities by  Lamb, that this is contradictory to my own position; \
believe, with respect to the former, that any person will be of my mind, on  fair\
consultation of the most ancient heathenisn representation of it; : and as to the\
latter, scripture, and chiesly the Revelation of St. JJohin,: in niany passages exhi-\
bits the person of Christ in the form of  lamb, and as the Lamb of God. Now\
since all this. has an hieroglyphic meaning, why. should- not . be allowed to fetch\
my emblematical thoughts from so pure and rich  fountain of wisdom; Thus \
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
deport myself with-respect to. other fuch objects which represent some quality of\
the doity ; bur those of later inxention,  endeavour, in \'92this cafe, to avoid a as possible.\
Moreover, scripture, in many places, delivers itself in hieroglyphic terms;\
comparing Anger to  bear bereft of its cubs, Meeknefs to  lamb, Innocence to\
 dove, Subtilty to  serpent, &.\
CHAP. XII. Disquisition touching the Representation of the Trinity.\
TANY will think this fubject beyond the reach of what we have hitherto\
 handled, and inconsistent with art ; but  am of  contrary opinion : for\
 tender-hearted artist has, on account of the many differences among Christians,\
reason to be in concern for this point, since so many occurrences offer in scrip-\
ture, where the Aliighty is either acting in some form about mankind, or is\
passing by as  glory, to make his presence known.\
The greatest part of Christendom (Holland, England, and  part of Germauy ex-\
cepted) allow, with one accord, the representation of the persons in the Trinity;\
as first, God the Father, in the fhiape of an old man, with  long grey beard and\
hair : secondly, Jesus Christ, as he appeared in his humanity; and thirdly, God\
the Holy Ghost, in the shape of  dove, in which shape he descended on Jesas\
Cbrist at the time of his baptism.\
Now if, according to the letter of scripture,  were to represent Adam and Eve,\
 find it necessary to exhibit the Creator of the world, and Maker of Adam, in\
 vifible shape, fince it is written, That he made Adam of the dust of the ground,\
and breathed into him the breath of life- Now, he who is to make some-\
thing, or breathe into something, must, humanly speaking, have both hands and\
mouth.\
As scripture also commonly shews us an apprehenfive quality of- the Almighty,\
why should  be more culpable for representing him under the same, than under\
that of  triangle surrounded with  glory, and containing some Hebrew letters \'e0\
Yet our divines are of opinion that this last is allowable, but not the former.\
Is not then the one  figure as well as the other \'e0 Or do the Jewifh characters,\
or the inanimate shape of  triangle, make any alteration )\
Besides thefe reasons, Does not  picture tend as well to inftruction as  well-\
digested speech, wherein the orator, in order to. be understood, is obliged to use\
 figural way of expreffion by parables; Or as  writing, wherein we find the\
same method for understanding it ) Since the aim of both is, by the perception\
of the hearers, to make their difcourses have an impreffion on their minds. Even\
the writing containing the matter, Does it not confist of letter-figures, which, by\
 certain method of uaderstanding, we comprehend; For it is not the Matter\
itself.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
 think, that the learned world and artists represent the first person of the\
Trinity rather in the shape of  man, than of any other creature, on good reasons;\
for we learn from scripture, that God created and made man in his own image;\
and from the aucient fathers, that man is an epitome of. all that God created ;\
who is therefore called the little world : fome even call man the master-piece of\
God. We ought therefore, if we will take some likeness from the creatures, to\
express the Almighty by the most perfect idea to be found, in order to exhibit\
his perfection, and thus to make the copy, in the best manner, like the original :\
and the more, as scripture, in feveral\'92 places, makes mention of the head, eyes,\
ears, mouth, lips, armis, feet, hands, and other members of God : which things\
must not be understood in  carnal and literal sense (according to the opinions of\
some ignorant people, who imagine God, in-his nature, to be like  man; that\
he sits in heaven on  throne, according to  passage in Isaiah,  The heaven is\
my throne, and the earth is my foot-stool. And as-in another place the same pro-\
phet says ee  saw the Lord sitting on an high throne, and lifted up) but in- figural\
and spiritual sense :  think then, that  painter has no nearer expreffions, in such\
representations where God himself is acting, than to exhibit his figure in an\
human shape, as best agreeing with those likenesses. We paint him aged, in\
order to shew his majesty and wisdom, which are more to be found in old age\
than youth; and with  sceptre and globe, and  circle of stars about his head,\
to shew his omnipotence both in heaven and on earth. But Roman-catholics\
daily make additions.\
If- the scripture represent his godly person under  mysterious sense, why may\
not the artist be allowed to do the same; Do we not read in the Revelation what is.\
mentioned of God in an human shape, Is it not plain enough  Or must it be ob-\
jected, that this description is apocryphal; But granting it the relation, neverthe-\
less, is not accounted heathenish. Any doubt, which might arise from it, does-\
not affect the point with r\'e9spect to shapes. In an\'f4ther place we find, that the\
High-priest hid himself, that he might not behold the Lord : but the Lord put-\
 finger on his eyes, till he was past by. How can  represent that paffage, with\
out  body; or is it no fact: The prophet Isaiah says, ee Behold the name of the\
fire. Now, to make this known to  person who cannot read, and is deaf, Is it\
not more easy to do it by  representation, than by signs ; Are we to make only \
mouth sending forth  flame ; ls this so proper for such  nian\'92 apprehension, as\
 whole figure; Moreover, is not  mouth  likeness and  figure, as well as \
whole image, What then are they pretending, who allow one part of the crime,\
and not the whole) lf it be  crime, let it be intirely forbidden; and if good,\
or at least sufferable, intirely allowed, and performed. Nevertheless, we must not\
how before these things, mnch less worship them, but the true God only, who\
is thereby meant. Can we observe . facrifice otherwise; ls not that  mysterious\
representation, or, in better terms,  figural demonstration, when it is said,\
ce The facrifice was burning upon the altar, and the children of God were bow-\
ing before it, praying, beseeching, and giving thanks in all submission,\
Scripture,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Scripture, in several places, speaks of the appearing of God to men, either\
really by the ministry of angels, or in  vision by dreams, or by extafies. There\
is so sine  description of God, under the shape of an old man, in the seventh\
chapter of Daniel, that no artist can better represent it. The same scripture also\
mentions several appearances of angels in human shapes: for which reason, the\
church, in the second council of Nice, made no difficulty in allowing artists to do\
it; and chiefly painters, to represent God the Father as  kind, loving old man,\
and the angels in an human shape.\
It seems also, that  Painter has the privilege to paint and represent inanimate\
things as living, according to the ideas which scripture affords him : and the\
spectator must not be offended, when, in some pictures, he finds sacred subjects\
attended with poetical fictions, for their better explanation; on  supposition the\
latter be impious. Are not the Psalms of David, Solomon\'92 Song, the Book of Job,\
and the revelation of St. John the Divine, all delivered under poetic figures,\
not to speak of the parables besides, mentioned in scripture.\
Painters therefore are not blame-worthy, for bringing in something that is\
heathenisn, in order to clear the matter; and especially if the fact happened in an\
heathenisn country. Thus the great Raphael, in his passage of the Children of\
lsrael over Jordan, has represented the river under an human shape, violently turn-\
ing the water back towards its source.\
As scripture often lays down such and the like things under some figural de-\
scriptions, it gives painters full liberty to do the same; fince, in order to accom-\
modate itself to the weak apprehenfions of men, it usually delivers many of the\
greatest mysteries under figures and parables ; as it speaks of the rivers, in\
Psalm xeviii.  also made no scruple, in his picture of the finding of Moses, to exhibit\
the river Nile, by an human figure. But there were calumniators in his time as\
well as as there are now. He was charged with atheism, for mixing truth with\
lies, and having no more regard for either, than to treat them alike. Yet, if we\
look nearer into this matter, we shall be convinced, that the learned painter\
was not in the least tinctured with atheism. Did it not happen in heathenisn\
Agypt  Was not Pharaoh\'92 daughter present' Did she believe the truth, which was\
only manifested to Israel ? Certainly she did not. Since therefore the fact lay in\
an heathenisn country, and was done in the presence of but two Hebrezo women,\
the others being Ethnicks, this great artist has not trespassed either against the\
Christian Faith, or against the art.\
And although, at the first view,  well-grounded objection may be, that with\
things which relate to religion, no false gods or deities, worshipped by the hea-\
thens, ought to be mixed, and that it is sufficient for  painter to represent  river\
in its natural course, and not in an human forin : yet the objection is easily an-\
swered ; for scripture reprefents the waters, and the noise of rivers, under an\
human form, as in Psalm xeviii. where it is faid, That they. clapped their hands\
and were joyful. Moreover, the Agyptians never worshipped the rivers, but the\
crocodiles living in them, and Isis under the shape of  cow, as Ovid and other\
writers testisy.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Since then scripture makes use of allegorical speeches,  painter may also ex-\
hibit his subject under symbolical and perceptible likenesses, in order to be the\
more intelligible to the spectator, without fear that his work will mislead faithful\
Christians, or strengthen heathenisn superstition; for  painter, who has no other\
language to express himself by but figures, ought to make use of them, if he\
would be understood.\
Rubens, who of all the painters handled those symbolical figures, in the most\
agreeable and learned manner (as we may particularly observe in the Cardinal\
Infant\'92 entry into Anizverp, and in the paintings of the Luxemburgh gallery) is\
taxed by some with mixing, in those compofitions, truth with fictions; but\
how easily is this judgment to be refuted, by shewing the use that judicious artist\
made thereof : for fiction is here not at all mingled with truth, but only tends\
to make truth clear to sight and apprehension, and thus more plainly to express\
it by the fictitious characters and emblems.\
 pray observe, in his birth of the French King, Lewis XIII. how that ex-\
cellent artist has exhibited Castor with an artful sway, on distant clouds, sitting\
on his winged horse, and opposite to him Apollo, who, in his radiant chariot, is\
driving upwards, in order to shew that this prince was happily born in the\
morning. Hereby it is evident, that this ingenious master had no thoughts of\
representing deitics as deities, but only to denote, by Castor (as accounted an\
happy constellation) the king\'92 fortunate birth, and by Apollo the time of the\
day, which was in the morning, appearing by his chariot\'92 mounting up from\
the horizon.\
But, further to clear my thoughts touching the representation of God the\
Father,  shall, before  end this chapter, subjoin the following observation.\
The Prophet Ezekiel, in his first chapter, mentions, that he saw the Almighty\
from the appearance of his loins even upwards, and from the appearance of his\
loins even downwards, as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness\
round about. Wherefore, by this and other instances of scripture, we suppose,\
that this sacred figure ought never to be represented without  glittering or glory\
from head to foot ; even in such manner, that, bigger or less, according to the\
place, occafion and decorum, and spreading around gradually thinner and fainter,\
like  clear and transparent vapour, it at last insensibly unites with the by-works,\
and disappears.\
Now, to reduce this to  painting, we ought first to design the figure of the\
Almighty, whether sitting or standing, in heaven or on carth, in the most per-\
fect form and countenance, yet much bigger than any heavenly or earthly\
creature. This you must colour with  single tint or ground,  little darker\
than the glorv, and afterwards heighten with light. Then, with  large brush, soften\
the figure, so that neither its out-line, nor any edginess or sharpness of the parts\
of the face, hands, or feet (which ought to be touched very gentle and faint)\
be perceived; just as if it were viewed through  silk gause, steamed glafs, or\
thin mist: in short, like things seen in  Camera Obscura, observing that the\
figure do not receive any light either from on high, or from afide, or from be-\
hind, but in front only and about the most relievede parts, although the whole\
piece\
\
\
\
\
\
\
piece have another light; it must moreover have no other shades. than in, the\
deepest cavities, and those very faint.\
We have before cursorily shewed, why we represeat the Almighty as  vene-\
rable old man; and shall now further insist on the point, though without re-\
ference to all the paffages in scripture which might serve our purpose. In Daniel,\
chap. vii.  it is written, The hair of his head was like pure wool, and his gar-\
ment white as snow. The reason whereof, says Gregorius Nazianzenus, is to shew\
thereby, as by an infallible token, his clean and undefiled Being. Wherefore\
the wise Euscherus is also of opinion, that, for the same reason, the choir and\
multitude of angels are represented in white. Others compare it to the human\
shapc, and would thercby allude to. infinite duration, since nothing is so eternal\
as the Godhead ; which  remark here;, because some scrupulous persons are of\
opinion, that we ought not to represent God the Father in such.  shape, actorned\
with white garments and grey hair.\
And on this account all nations have, by an universal consent, thought proper,\
to perform divine service in white garments and ornaments. The white has also\
been at all times appropriated to the holy service, wherefore the poet Persius says,\
He is worshipped in white.\
But what is Persius\'92 saying to us, since the raiment of Jesus Christ, when he\
manifested his glory to his disciples, appeared as white as snow; Cicero, Lib.  says, The white looks best in all stuffs, but especially in the woven ones,\
in order to exhibit what is holy and godly.\
It is therefore necessary to represent the Almighty in  white garment; how-\
ever it is not improper, to make it look more natural, that you keep it  little\
yellowisn, as lighted by  sun, or like the glory which surrounds the figure.\
But in all this  painter must be very discreet, and not abuse the licence al-\
\
lowed him by scripture and the consent of the fathers, or, by his art, pervert\
the sacred truths or slight them.\
\
CHAP. XIII. Of the Glories proper to Angels and heathenish\
Deities.\
VAVING shewed in what manner, and on what terms, according to my\
Ljudgment, to represent the Almighty ; let us now inquire how the angels,\
in their power, ought to be exhibited.\
Gregorius Nazianzenus says, that the true property of the angels, when they ap-\
pear in  bodily shape, is to have  bright glory and glittering garments. We\
\
sind the angels thus described in Mait. XXviii.  in Mark xvi- in Acts .  many other places of scripture.\
This glittering light of the angels ought therefore by all means to be observed\
in most of their appearances ; as for instance in those to Abraham, and in the de-\
livering\
\
\
\
\
\
\
livering Lot out of Sodom, where they smote the lustful people with blindnefs;\
for it is ceitain they had something more than human, since Abraham salutes them\
as lords. It is not likely that this honour proceeded from their costly dress,\
jewels and other precious things about them, but from some heavenly or uncom-\
mon addition.\
 further proof of this glory of the angels, is the sore pressing of the Sodomites\
upon Lot, and their not coveting either him or his daughters, or any other strangers\
probably living among them, but only these two young men to be brought out in\
order to know them; and, perhaps, because of their more than human form and\
charming brightnefs. If now this glory had shone too strong, they would have\'ac\
perceived some deity, and forbore their wickedness; for it cannot be imagined,\
that any man should daringly and knowingly strive against the Almighty.\
But before we proceed further, Imust here deliver my opinion touching the per-\
son of Jesus Christ; which is, that in his humanity, and before his resurrection, he\
ought to be represented without the least shining or glory ; since he was made\
in the likeness of men, and would be like his bretfiren in all things except sin,\
as scripture testifies: but after his resurrection, he should be shewn with  glory\
(as we read. he appeared to his disciples on Mount Tabor and in other places) as\
having then put off his humanity in its principal purpose. Now to proceed.\
We have further instances of the appearance of angels, as in those who came\
to Manoah, Gideon and Tobit, and him who smote the people of Jerusalem for Da-\
vid\'92 sin, &. Of the first, scripture exprefsly says, that he, foretelling Ma-\
noah the birth of Samson, ascended in the flame of the altar; possibly in an aug-\
mentation of glory, uniting with the slame of the offering, by which doubling\
brightnefs the parents of Samson were strengthened in their faith and hope of the\
birth to come.\
If this glory now be painted too strong and like lightning, it blinds our mor-\
tal eves, and thus the patriarch Abraham could have viewed it no more than the\
prophet and leader of lsfrael, Moses, when God appeared to him and passed before\
The blind heathens had glimmerings of this truth; for when Semele presump-\
tuously defired, that Jupiter might once embrace her in the same majesty as he\
did Juno in heaven, and insisted on it, notwithstanding his dissuasion to the con-\
trary, she was, on the requeft granted, intirely consumed by the attending glory\
of the god, insomuch that with difficulty he saved the child he had by her-\
Whence it is plain, that the glory, even in exhibiting the heathenisn deities,\
ought to be observed; since in their appearance to men, either by night or day,\
to bless or punisn them, they retained tneir full force, glory and majesty; and\
this being weighed, they must also be represented glittering, beautiful in aspect\
and shape, and in raiment of an elegant colour, as much as possible and the\
nature and use of the picture will permit; as we haye before hinted in the hand-\
ling of colours in cieling pieces.\
But when the deities appear among men, as men, then they ought to be like\
them, and not eafily distinguishable, otherwise than by their mein; as, for in-\
stance, in the story of Jupiter with Calisto, Apollo with Dophne, Jupiter with Lycaon,\
Mercury\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Mercury with Argus, and the like : in such cases, and that they might the better\
play their parts, they transformed themselves intirely into men and were perfectly\
like them, laying aside all god-like glory and shape; as if, according to the opi\'ac\
nion of the heathens, they meant that there can be no union of the divine with\
human nature.\
As to the motions of the heathenisn deities, many represent them appearing in\
active postures, as walking, running, and other motions ; but it is as contrary\
to my own opinion, as that of the great bishop of Hippo, Heliodorus. This learned\
man, and great searcher into heathenisn antiquities, will not allow them to go or\
walk, when seen in their majesty, but only to wave, or seem in some measure\
to walk, yet gliding like  fhip moved gently along by the wind, without per-\
ceptible motion : they ought always to be set out with thin clouds, of which\
such as are nearest them receive  greater and stronger light.\
CHAP. XIV. Of the Representations of Angels and heathenisb\
Genii.\
yHE Almighty in the beginning created an infinite number of angels or\
heavenly spirits, who in scripture are distinguished by names, as seraphins,\
cherubins, thrones, powers, arch-angels, angels, &.\
The first, as being nearest to the glory of the Almighty, are always represented\
young and harmless, and with six wings, according to lsaiah ch. vi.\
The second are exhibited only for the sake of motion, and to denote the\
efficacy of eternal happiness; which their undefiled purity and childish form give\
to understand.\
The third, who continually attend God\'92 justice (as Dionysius Arcopagita, St.\
Paul\'92 disciple, writes) are somewhat older, and more full-grown, and of an\
agreeable sway and motion ; causing, by their appearances, no fear or fright, but\
joy and gladness in people\'92 minds.\
The fourth are appointed to execute divine vengeance, in the punishment of\
fins and wickedness; of these one was so strong, that, with the Almighty\'92 per-\
mission, he smote in the camp of the Assyrians  men,  Kings xix.  Cron.\
xXxii. Isaiah xxxvii. These are represented bigger than the former, having stern\
countenances and violent motions ; are seldom or ever naked, but in coats of\
armour, and with  flaming sword or thunder in their hands, or else  shield on\
theiz arms, with the name of God glittering thereon. By their unexpected ap-\
pearance they cause not only fear and fright in the wicked, but  continual re-\
morse without repentance.\
The fifth manage great and courtly affairs, as- guardians leading men to the\
knowledge of God; they are of  perfect form and modest countenance.\
The\
\
\
\
\
\
The last protect us from all hurt, and are particularly ordained to excite us\
to virtue, and dissuade us from evil, Acts xii. These, according to Dionysius,\
as being the eldest in the lowest choir or hierarchy, are represented of  large size,\
majestic and quick in motion.\
There is still another kind, called evil spirits, or damones, or devils: Plato\
calls them cacod\'e6mones, or knowing and crafty. These afflict the wicked, and\
induce them to all manner of sin, as blasphemy, unchasteness, gluttony, drun-\
kenness, lying, defrauding, murder, &. Their shapes are various, even as.\
many as there are sins; and although they endeavour sometimes to mislead men\
under beautiful appearances, yet they are always represented by some token\
whereby to know them, either on their heads, backs, hands or feet, such as fins,\
bats wings, vultures or eagles claws, bears paws, dragons tails, &. also hold-\
ing lighted torches, pitchforks, purses, murdering weapons, crowns, fetters,\
yokes, serpents and adders, and with flames issuing out of their mouths; in \
word, any thing that betokens evil.\
As to the angels before-mentioned, who in all ages have been represented\
with wings, scripture allows us the liberty so to exhibit them; for the Al-\
mighty himself shewed Moses the pattern of the Ark of the Covenant, and the\
cherubins in this manner upon it. Can any example be more perfect than his ,\
More instances in scripture may be found in the prophecies of Daniel, ch. ix.  vi. Rev. IV. Ezekiel . &.\
Having thus far treated of the representation of angels, we shall now shew the\
opinion of the heathens, not ill agreeing with the same meaning.\
Plutarch tells us, that the ancient Romans had also their tutelar guardians, by\
them stiled genii, or birth-gods; but they were not represented as angels, or sit-\
ting upon clouds, or with wings or glories, but as well-shaped young men be-\
tween sixteen and twenty years of age, and without beards, having long light\
hair, composed countenances and easy motions, and  dog\'92 skin over their up-\
per parts.\
The reason of this cloathing was, as Chrysippus says, that they, as good spirits,\
attend us from our nativities, being guardians of our actions, in reproving vice\
and revenging transgrefsions, as often as we prefer brutality before humanity,\
which the genii abhorred, pursuing and barking at us, in order to awake the\
conscience. Of which opinion is Censorinus, and several others whom he quotes ;\
adding, that these spirits watch so narrowly, that they never leave us, inciting\
us to virtue, in proportion as we forsake vice and covet felicity. But why need\
we these examples, Our Saviour affirms, that the angels have charge over us,\
to conduct and preserve us, as we have before said ; wherefore the heathens, by\
this emblem, have also rightly stiled their genii, guardians.\
Censorinus likewise testifies, that the ancients considered their genii as gods of\
procreation, either that, as we have said, they took care of us, or were born\
with us ; for which reason, they believed there were as many genii as men, and\
that each had his own : or else that there were twice as many, and that each man\
had  good one and an evil one, the former persuading to virtue and the latter\
to vice, agreeable to what Christians say of their guardian angels and the devil;\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
this last not failing to afflict mankind, though not born with us, as the heathens\
believed of their genii. Hence it is, that some represent the genii in the shape\
of  serpent, others as children or young men, or else as grey-headed old men,\
conformable to the philosopher Cebes in his hieroglyphical table.\
Zoroaster and the ancient philosophers have made  distinction between the ani-\
mals consecrated to the good and evil genii ; according to them, dogs, fowls,\
and the tortoise are proper to the good, and water animals peculiar to the evil.\
The ancients often exhibited the genii crowned with garlands of horehound,\
the leaves whereof much resemble those of the vine, or else with chaplets of di-\
vers forts of flowers ; as Tibullus in  certain place says, ee The genius is adorned\
with  beautiful chaplet of flowers, when his name and festival are celebrated to\
his honour. \
Each person worshipped his genius without knowing it, in celebrating his\
birth-day, and those of. princes were especially kept by every body with great\
splendor ; wherefore he who falsly swore by the genius of his prince (which was\
accounted  very great oath) was an immediate delinquent.\
Since, as is said, the ancients had two kinds of genii,  good one and an\
evil one, according to the Socratic Euclid, as Censorinus relates, we shall now con-\
sider how the evil were represented.\
 do not find the ancients had any statues or resemblances of them, but we\
read, as writers testify, that they appeared to many.\
Plutarch, Appianus, Florus, and others report, that as Bruius one night (accord-\
ing to his custom) had betaken himself, with  light, to his apartment for medita-\
tion he saw before him the likeness of  man, but very frightful, black and cloathed\
in  wolf\'92 skin ; who being afked, who he was ; answered,  am thy evil ge-\
nius, Brutus  Valerius Maximus also writes, that the evil genius appeared to Cassius,\
of the cursed tribe of Marcus Antonius,  little besore Caesar caused him to be be-\
headed. This genius appeared as  large black man, about fifty or sixty years\
of age, having long hair and  dirty matted beard, and was covered with  wolf\'92\
skin down half way the thighs.\
The Temesians, formerly inhabitants of Abruzzo,  country in Iraly, had also \
very evil genius, of  black colour and frighful look, and cloathed in  wolf\'92\
skin, doing that people much damage; as Paufanias and Suidas testify.\
CHAP. XV. Of sacred Emblems.\
THE defign of  well-composed sacred emblem is principally to edify, and\
to incite to virtue; representing it to us as  looking glass, not so much\
for the regulation of our bodies as our souls, and by such means to bring us to\
happiness.\
These emblems are either general or particular : general, when they suit any\
person whatsoever; and particular, when they relate te one only. When their\
subject\
\
\
\
\
\
\
subject is piety or virtue; learning, liberty, peace of mind, and such like, they-\
are general, and applicable to every person who possesses or endeavours to pol-\
sefs those qualities: but when  particular person is their subject, as the Vir-\
gin Mary, an Apostle, or other virtuous man, who excelled in some particular\
gift, in such case they are particular or singular. We ought, therefore, in the\
former fort, to observe, that the main matter is spiritual, and in the latter, cor-\
poral : the one exhibits learning itself, and the other  learned man or philoso-\
pher; one shews Peace, and the other  peaceable man; one represents Piety,\
and the other  pious man, &. The one is the matter itself, and the other he\
who possesses it. However,  judicious master will make  distinction be-\
tween spiritual and corporal virtues, between natural inclinations and heavenly\
gifts. The corporal, as Strength, Prudence, Equity, and the like, proceed\
from us, or, in better terms, are peculiar to us, walk, stand, and act with us;\
and the spiritual and heavenly, and which consequently have no relation with\
the body are as without us ; wherefore they must be represented either sitting\
or lying on clouds, and the nearer they approach beatitude, the more glitter-\
ing, nimble, faint and waving they are to be exhibited.\
am of opinion that we ought to adapt particular sorts of stuffs to the afore-\
 virtues and qualities, according to their ranks and dignities; as, to cloath\
the earthly in stuffs and cloth, and in thick silk; and those still higher, in\
gause scarfs, or else to let them remain naked.\
We must further remark on the last of these, that the characters called the\
qualities of God, Imean figural characters, such as the eye, implying Dominion;\
the circled serpent, Eternity ; the sun, Glory; and such like, ought always to\
appear in the uppermost glory, as pertaining to the Deity, and are represented\
by lovely waving children. Yet let it be observed, that those things only re-\
spect the blessings of heaven; for when the Almighty is provoked, and is to\
inflict punishiments, we must introduce other qualities, such as his wrath, justice,\
&. also represented by angels, with thunder, siery swords, scales, &. but these\
ought to be stronger and like young men; as we find it in scripture, in the\
story of Lot, where they struck the Sodomites with blindness; and in that of Sen-\
zacherib, where an angel of the Lord in one night smote so many thousands, and\
more such cases.\
 shall illustrate what  have before said by further examples, in such manner\
as  apprehend the point; and for that purpose have chosen an uncommon sub-\
ject, to serve for  particular\
Emblem and stately Monument of her Majesty, Mary Stuart, late Queen of Great Bri-\
tain, France and Ireland, Princess of Orange.\
Here  tomb is standing on the left side of the piece, on  basement whereon\
is carved the river-god of the Thames. In the middle of the piece, on the se-\
cond ground,  princess is sitting in grandeur on  throne, representing Englans\
with its proper badges. She leans her head on her left hand, and with het\
right opens the royal robe of the deceased, which is lined with ermin, and witl-\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
the sceptre and crown lies in her lap, whereon she casts  forrowful look ; she is\
covered with  black gause weed, which darkens the glitter of the seat and coat\
of arms. Policy on her left side, quite dejected, is beholding the tomb, ac-\
companied by Sorrow. On the other side appears the Protestant Church, lan-\
guishing, supported by Hope, who points at the tomb, whereon stands  large\
beautiful antique vase, out of which is growing  rose-twig having but one bud,\
whereon Providence, sitting on clouds, dispenses some moisture out of  small\
crystal phial, and with her sceptre points upwards at the celestial light, to\
which Wisdom, Piety and Stedfastnefs are seen flying, supporting, or rather\
carrying  beautiful young virgin along with them. This virgin is drest in\
white and crowned with roses, having  bright star over her head ; her hands\
are crofs her breast, and she is looking upwards with  joyful countenance.\
On high appears God\'92 Love or Tendernefs, waiting for her with open arms,\
having in its lap  pelican feeding its young with its own blood. The other\
characters of divine Happinefs before-mentioned are also seen, and especially\
heavenly or perfect Joy or Harmony, represented by spirits singing and playing\
on instruments. On the vase is  medal, wherein is carved  phoenix arising out\
of its afhies. Under it, on  black table, is written in gold letters, either in\
Latin or Englissi, TDIE IN ORDERTO LIVE. The tomb is hung with fes-\
toons of cypress, intermixed with roses. On the right side of the tomb stands\
Fate, having in the left hand  rose close to the vase, and in the right  pair of\
scissors, as if she had cut off the rose with them. On the left side of the tomb\
stands Nature, dejectedly holding  handkerchief before her eyes, and with the\
left hand at her breast. Envy, to the right forwards, is taking to flight, biting\
an heart, and looking either at Providence or at the beatified soul ascending.\
About the throne stand Scotland, France and lreland, in. mourning.\
 Second Example-\
Here we may represent Majesty on  raised throne, sitting in full splendor;\
Clemency and Authority standing behind her, and holding over her head  crown\
topped with  glittering star. On her side may sit Religion, and on  step be-\
low Policy taking shelter under her garment. Quiet, Plenty, and Success by\
land and sea, may be placed as coming in; and, on the other side, Peace ac-\
companied by Art and Science. Above, in an open heaven, fits Providence\
pouring down divine Blessing. Over the throne, on  cloud, should be Wisdom,\
Religiousness and Stedfastnets.\
This Majesty may be here the subject of this emblem, and, if it have no par-\
ticular characters, suit any kingdom, power or commonwealth in Oristendom;\
but if it have any arms, device, or motto, as SUFFICIT UNUS, or  Flower-\
de-luce for France; PLUS ULTRA for Spain; HONI SOIT QUI MALY\
PENSE for England; then this Majesty ought to be like that which it is to re-\
present.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
It would not be improper to see the glory filled with Divine Love or Kind-\
nefs as before-mentioned, and Prosperity flowing from it. Fright and Fear tak-\
ing to flight, and Envy, Fraud and Heresy under Majesty\'92 feet.\
The active Virtues  represent by figures, which hold the crown over Ma-\
jesty\'92 head, and those sitting on clouds, &.\
 Third Example.\
The subject of this shall be Innocence murdered.\
Here Innocence is prostrate, murdered by raging Impiety. She lies near an\
extinguished altar, stretched out on the ground, cloathed in  clean white gar-\
ment, betokening an upright undefiled heart. The cruel executioner forcibly\
tears her innocent child from her breast, and at the same time the brutish mur-\
derer is stepping from the eminence whereon he sat, in order to go off; he is\
stained with innocent blood, and, sheathing his bloody sword, tramples under\
foot  pelican with its young. Rage attending him, and firing them with her\
torch, is looking back in great consternation at Heaven, which darts many\
thunders at her. There Divine Justice is descending, with scales in one hand\
and thunders in the other. Piety, bowing before her at the altar, is praying.\
and shewing her the innocent corpse; whereupon she doubles her speed to exe-\
cute revenge. Now see the wrath of God expressed, not with bright sun-beams.\
from on high, but with fiery and bloody ones.\
Here Justice, or divine Wrath, has  flaming red garment or veil. Impiety\
is cloathed in  rusty copper-coloured drapery. The Executioner, who misuses.\
the child, has  cruel aspect, and is reddish. Over Innocence  little angel is.\
ascending to heaven with  bright star, to which  long ray seems to proceed\
out of her mouth; he has  palm-branch in his hand, to fignify her happiness.\
The following. is  fhort sketch of the actions.\
The head of the corpse lies on the middle of the piece on the fore-ground,\
 little up, as if there were still some life left. Behind the altar Piety kneels\
the second ground, is with her upper parts directly over the point of sight, and\
her feet somewhat fore-shortened towards the right side, from whence sne is-\
coming. On the left side, on the same ground,  little more forward, Impiety\
and Rage take to flight. Rage is half-shaded by dark clouds, over which hea-\
ven opens. The fore-ground has  right light; but Justice receives-her light\
from behind. On the left side of the piece is  dark off-scape.\
Now, as the former emblem represented the reward of virtue, so this repre-\
sents the punishment of evil; in that appeared the love of God, in this his\
wrath.\
Thus are my thoughts an these subjects, not presuming to have handled them.\
with the utmost accuracy ;  am far from giving them out as perfect emblems,\
since that is the work of great judgment, vast knowledge, and mature consi-\
deration : nevertheless, rough as the plan is, it is sufficient for explaining my\
sentiments.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
sentiments. And as we always stick either more or less to art, and hardly keep\
so much within the-bounds of curiosity, as not to take some liberties in the dis-\
position of things, so  have represented him who is taking away the child, as an\
cxccutioner, naked, his hair tied with  cloth, and with  dagger lying by him,\
and Impiousitess, as  prince, with  bloody diadem about his head and  staff in his\
hand ; though these figures ought rather to be women ; moreover, the execur\
tioner might have been left out.\
CHAP. XVI. Of the Penates, Lares, and Cupids.\
NCIENT Historics relate, that most nations which lived under laws and\
policy, especially the Hebrews, Greeks and Romans, -but mostly these last\
Fad certain figures of gold, silver, copper, or wood, which they stiled Dii Pe-\
nates, in Engiisa, Houshold-gods. These they kept as holy, and took such par-\
ticulat care of, that in case they happened to be lost, either through carlessness,\
violence, or other accidents, they thought it foreboded some imminent disaster\
or bad luck to befall them ; and accordingly believed, when any such were at\
hand, that those gods were either removing, or vanished.\
The historian Tim\'e6us writes, that they were represented like two beautiful young\
men in  warlike dress, each with  javelin in his hand, and by or near them an\
earth\'e9n fire-pan, over which lay two long iron bars crofs-ways, turned at the ends\
like the hazel wands which Augures held in their hands at the time of\
officiating.\
Cicero, treating of the Penates, says, They were certain Gods brought forth in\
the houses of particular men, and worshipped in the most concealed and private\
places of them. And in this sense Demophoon and Terence spake, when they said,\
\
They would go home and hide their household Gods, before they betook to their\
business and callings.\
In scripture also we have the Teraphims, or household Gods, which Rachel stole\
from her father Laban, when he went to sheer his sheep ; as the Rabbi Eliezer, in\
the  Chapter of his Discourses, largely treats, speaking of Laban, and the\
preparing of the Teraphims.\
We have before said, that the Penates were in great esteem among the Romans,\
which Dionysius Halicarnassus affirins, saying, They were worshipped at Rome, un-\
der the shape of two sitting young men, in very ancient and warlike dresses, and\
having javelins in, their hands; with this subscription, Dii Penates, as we find it\
still in ancient medals. Nigidius was of opinion, that they were Apollo and Neptune,\
and the rather, as by Apollo is meant heat and drought, and by Neptune, cold and\
moistness; judging the worship to owe its origin to these cffects: wherefore, Virgil\
in the Eighth Book of his Aneids, stiles them the Great Gods, meaning the Pe-\
nates. Others think that Jupiter and Juno are signisied by them, because their\
chief\
\
\
\
\
\
\
chief businefs was to give men help and asfistance, and therefore they both derive\
from the Latin word Juvare, signifying to help or assist. Others again imagine\
them to be Castor and Pollux, because they, with the Penates or household gods,\
were also according to the ancient poets and historians, in very great esteem, and\
the Raman worshiyy asfigned them the first places in their temples.\
It will here be proper to deduce something touching these gods from antiquity,\
the better to illustrate the point.\
We read, that when the daughter of Pallantes was married to Dardanus, she\
brought in dower the gifts which Pallas had made her  present of, being an ob-\
long shield, dropt from heaven (which she stiled Palladium) and the figures of the\
Penates, or great Gods. Afterwards on  rebellion breaking out in Peloponnesus,\
where Dardanus and his wife lived, he with many of the Arcadians fled from thence,\
taking shipping for Samothracia, where, in consideration of those gifts, brought as\
 portion, he built  temple, instituting private solemnities for their religious\
worship, keeping them srom the common people in  vault under the ground ;.\
and soon after, on his departure for Asia, took them with him and placed them in\
Dardania, so called from his. name. His son llus being employed in building\
llium, or Troy, transplanted those gods thither. AEneas afterwards having saved\
them out of the slames of that city, carried them to Italy, placing them in the city\
of Lavinium. Ascaniushis son, removed them to the city of Alba, where he dedi-\
cated  large and magnificent temple to their honour. But they say, the Gods of\
themselves, without human assistance, returned the next night to Taviniam, though\
the gates were fast, and the town-wall and roof of the temple found intire and\
without any breaches. Which miracle very much surprising Ascanius, he sent to\
Livinium six hundred men, called Curatores, of whom Egestus was chief, to guard\
the Gods. At last, being carried to Rome, they remained without any alteration,\
and the Roman people committing to them the care and protection of their city,\
and growing empire, placed them, in imitation of Cardanus (that they might not\
be stolen either by fraud or violence) in  vault or temple under ground, wherein,\
after consecration, they offered sacrifices to them, not allowing any person to spit\
in this temple because the Gods, like Vesta, were worshipped with fire.\
They were represented as young men, and sitting with javelins in their hands,\
to signify their being adored as maintainers and protectors ; for the sitting hiero-\
glyphically expresses, stedfastness in what we design to do: the javelins imply that\
they preserve from harm and disaster; and the youthfulness denotes the increase of\
The Lares were much like the Penates, at least in the guard and care of cities.\
They also are said to have hid, or kept themselves secret in the houses, as well as\
the Penates ; which Tibullus affirms, saying, That they have not only the care of\
particular houses, but also of the whole town.\
The ancients used to place dogs to watch their idols, called Lares ; as being .\
creature kind and fawning on the family, and fierce and frightf ul to stranger.\
They had the same opinion- of their Lares, or houshold Gods, committing to\
them the intire care and safeguard of their families. For this reason, says Plutarch,\
the Romans represented them as brisk young men, dressed in dog-skins. Ovid\
affirms,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
affrins, they were sonietimes exhibited in short garments, gathered up on the left\
shoulder, and coming down under the right, in order to be more sree and loose in\
their motion, because, says he, Their business was like that of the genii (men-\
tioned before) to inquire narrowly into mens actions for the punishment of the\
wicked. The philosopher Jamblichus relates, that they were often worshipped on\
the roads, and had froin time to timne offerings of wine and frankincense.\
We shall now treat of the shape of children, distinguishing them into heavenly\
and earthly.\
Poussin exhibited them too squab and full for flying, and those of Raphael are\
gencrally, chiesly in the borders of the histories of Psyche, too hard and masculous;\
wherefore, to find  good form, we must keep  medium between both. But\
Cupids ought not to be represented so heavy as earthly children, yet as young as\
you please. The earthly contrarily, must have understanding, in order to handle\
something, and their bodies to be enlarged according to what they are to do or\
carry. But in representing  Cupid, who is to deliver  message,  think it is\
proper to give him age and bulk enough to do the business punctually, and the\
better to express truth and nature. As to their wings, they must not be made in\
proportion to the weight of their bodies like birds, for their bodies wave of them-\
selves, and the bigness of the wings often creates deformity, unless they are to re-\
present  Fame, when they ought to be larger.\
As to the Loves or Cupids themselves, they, according to my apprehension,\
differ as much in size as action. The one is by the poets called Capid, and the\
other Anteros. The former creates love and desire for voluptiousness, and the\
latter leads to virtues, arts and sciences. They have both  like beautiful and\
agreeable aspect according to their ages. Cupid is represented about six or eight\
years old, and quite naked, armed with  bow and arrows, and sometimes holding\
 burning torch. Anteros, contrarily, has  purple garment, with bare arms\
and legs only,  crown of laurel about his head,  burning torch in his hand,\
sandals on his feet, and he is about twelve or fourteen years of age. Cupid is wild\
and frolicksome, Anteros sedate and contemplative.\
There is another less kind of Cupids somewhat younger and more simple than\
the former.\
These increase love, incite the pleasures of voluptuousness, or\
more stronger delude the senses. To them, in order to shew their simplicity, are\
ascribed childish and idle actions, such as dancing, skipping about, running,\
rolling, flying, slinging apples at each other, &. They must not have quivers,\
bows, arrows, or torches, but baskets of fruit and flowers, or chaplets,  look-\
ing glass, or any thing tending to the pleafures of Venus.\
Alexander Propertius, Philoftratus, Claudianus, Silius stalicus, Apulcius, and others\
relate, that the different Loves and Cupids do not only respect the charms and\
service of Venus, but also imply the desires and tendencies of the heart ; since\
all men do not affect the same object, but each chuses for himself.\
We represent Cupid or Love in the form of  little child, because it is sot-\
tisn to betake to venerv; for the actions and speeches of those in love, are as\
imperfect as those of little children, as Virgil shews in Dido,-She begins to\
speak, and stops in the middle of her talk. He is exhibited with wings, to\
signify\
\
\
\
\
\
\
fignify the inconstancy of lovers, who change with every wind, as we see in\
Dido, who was to put to death the person whom fhe before so dearly loved.\
He\
has arrows in his hand, because they are also very light and do not always hit\
the mark, as we have said of lovers, who are whimsical and fickle when they\
cannot gratify their wishies; and as the arrows are sharp and piercing, so the sins\
of concupiscence no less wound the conscience. The arrows are likewise an\
emblem of love, which like thunder seizes the heart ; for many have experi-\
mented the sorrowful isfue of being captivated by the amorous glances of  beau-\
tiful woman, and through their fiery paffions been led into great troubles; for\
which reason Cupid is sometimes represented with thunder in his hand.\
CHAP. XVII. Devotional Actions of Nations.\
Of all the perfections of human nature, Religion is the most excellent and\
\
 most universal ; wherefore all nations partake of it in their manner of liv\'ac\
ing and service. And as reason principally distinguishes man from beasts, so we\
any where see, that the use of it binds men to some religious duties, as attend-\
ing human understanding, and according to Jamblichus,  Platonic sectary, ex-\
citing it by  natural desire and-propensity to do good and shun evil. To which\
some allude by the celestial fire in the fable of Prometheus, with which he ani-\
mated the first man; thereby signifying, that as the soul is governed by religion,\
so our actions must chiefly tend to implore  blessing on them, and our eyes and\
hands be lifted up to heaven, knowing that all good proceeds from the invisible\
Giver of all things, and we ought thankfully to receive it to his honour and\
glory. We shall therefore, in order to be both delightful and useful, shew from\
antiquity, how and in what manner divers nations, not enlightened by the Gos-\
pel, have dedicated their worship under fictions and fables to the invisible Being,\
and begin with the Egyptians.\
The custom of these people was, when any person prayed to the gods, that\
he must, as the most decent action, do it standing and with lifted up hands ;\
which posture was also strictly observed by the Romans in their religious worship,\
as Martial and Horace testify. Virgil likewise shewe, that standing with hands\
lifted up signifies worship, when he introduces Anchises (at the miraculous sight\
of Julus\'92 head, encompassed with  shining light and yet his hair unhurt by the\
flame) joyfully turning his eyes to heaven, and lifting his hands in prayer to\
Jupiter; and, in confirmation of the acceptablenefs thereof,  loud thunder was\
soon after heard, and  star appeared in the heavens when dark, which, like \
torch, with  long clear tail, descending towards the house, glid along, and at last\
hid in the wood of Mount lda, leaving behind  long stripe which emitted  sul-\
gods\
phurous vapour and smoke ; whereupon Anchise, standing up, invokes the\
and\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
and sacred stars. Philo says, that the erect standing posture denotes an humble\
heart, wholly devoting itself to heaven. Authors unanimoussy agree, that the\
ancients offered their sacrifices, vows and prayers to Jupiter in  standing posture,\
but to the goddess Ops in  sitting one, signifying thereby that she was the mo-\
ther of the earth. Eythagoras enjoins those who pray, to do it sitting; yet Plu-\
tarch says that Numa Pompilius was the author of that custom, thereby teaching,\
that vows and prayers ought to be certain and constant.\
As tothe posture of praying standing, St. Paul seems to exhort thereto in his\
epistles. We find likewise in the Old Testament, that the priests did in their\
prayers, stretch out their hands to heaven. In the Book of Judges, Chap. vii.\
we read, that in Gideon\'92 army, the men who bowed down on their knees to drink,\
were by God\'92 command, sent away ; but those who drank standing, putting\
their hands to their mouths, were chosen, and defeated the Midianites. In Exod.\
Chap. xvii. it is written, That as long as Moses held up his hands Amalek was dis-\
comfitted : which, as Adamantius says, signifies, that he offered up to God his\
actions and enterprizes, not like creeping animals who cleave to the earth, but\
as directing his heart and thoughts to heaven. On which grounds and examples\
the council of Nice ordained prayer to be made standing.\
Adoration, says Pliny, not only consists in lifting up the hands to heaven, but\
also in their being open inside upwards, as if we gave them to kifs. They who\
adore and supplicate, says Hieronymus, are used to kiss the hands : wherefore the\
Hebrezes judged this manner of kissing to be very reverential, and strictly observed\
it. Cicero and Catullus also confirm the signification of lifting up or stretching out\
both the hands to heaven. Tertullian speaking of praying for the preservation\
and prosperity of the emperor, says thus: The Christians bareheaded lift up\
their hands, with their eyes to heaven in token of innocence ; signifying thereby\
that they had no occasion to be afhamed, but heartily prayed for their emperor.\
The Tuscans likewise in their prayers, used such  posture or stretching out the\
hands; and, in adoring their gods, especially Jupiter, lifted up their hands to\
heaven. Of which Virgil also makes mention in his Fourth Aneid, where he de-\
scribes Jarbas among the statues and altars of the gods, lifting up his hands to\
heaven, humbly and earnestly imploring Jupiter. We read further, that in the\
Olympic games anciently celebrated at Smyrna,  ridiculous and ignorant actor was\
reproved by the sophist Polemon, for his awkward motions with hands reversed ;\
because when he was to say, Oh Jupiter/ he turned his hands downwards, and in\
saying, Oh earth  he looked up to heaven. But these perverse gestures pro-\
ceeding from ancient customs are still seen among the Romishi clergy, who as often\
as they pronounce the word God or Lord, give the blessing to the congregation ;\
and in praying for the prosperity of the people, stretch out their hands on high.\
In the medal of Gordiauus Pius, we see  small figure with the arms thus extended\
and the hands open, with  motto alluding to the matter Pietas August. But to\
return to the ancient Agyplians :\
They used to represent the Deity in an hieroglyphic manner by  circle : and\
agrecable thereto, the philosopher Pythagoras enjoined  turning round in the ado-\
ration of the Gods, Alcinous says also, that he gathered from the Greek writings,\
that\
\
\
\
\
\
\
that they had an ancient custom of running round the altars when they offered sa-\
crifice, beginning from the left to the right side, according to the Zodiac, and\
then running from right to left. Plutarch thinks this was done in imitation of the\
heavenly motions in their continual rotation, which mortals ought to follow :\
though others pretend, that thereby was meant the continual changes and insta-\
bility of human actions. As for the continual motion and turning of the body in\
prayer, we find it to have been the custom of divers nations ; and in this sense\
the poet Propertius, in his First Book, accosts his mistress,\'97ecl have often turned\
round before your door, aud offered up to you my soul and my prayers. there is  passage in Suetonius, when he speaks of the ancestors of Vitellius,\
ce He had, says he,  particular address for flattery, and was the first who com-\
manded divine worfhip to be paid to Caius Casar; and no person durst, after his\
return from Syria appear in his presence without being covered, and turning se-\
should turn several times round in prayer to heaven, and afterwards sit down,\
thereby intimating that, in worldly affairs, mertals must expect nothing but ine\
constancy and continual change, which they ought to bear with patience and re-\
solution. Add to this what Pliny says; That the manner of turning round in\
prayer was from the left to the right hand, in imitation of the earth ; which, ac-\
us, that as Camillus in prayer turned round, according to the Roman custom, he\
suddenly fell; by which accident the people (much addicted to superstition)\
Marcellus being at war with the Transalpine Gauls, and come to  town called Capide\
in order to charge them, his horse affrighted by the shouts of the enemy, went\
backwards ; wherefore, to encourage his men, he turned him round as if he were\
adoring the sun, according to the Roman custom before battle, and thus covered\
the accident without the peoples perceiving it.\
We shall now, for the reader\'92 greater satisfaction, treat of Piety and what re-\
lates to it.\
The ancients chiefly esteemed the altar as an hieroglyphic of Piety, offering,\
being supposed  medium between heavenly and human things, they pretended\
c\'e9\
it to be  mediator or messenget. Accordingly Virgil, in his  Aneid,\
They\
touch the altar, and call the fire upon it and the gods to witnefs, &. \
urge further, that fire unites with material parts, and always rises upwards from\
below ; as knowing all our earthly actions, and imparting them to the heavenly\
spirits. Hence we see, that the manners of offering sacrifices are not without\
some foundation in reason, because the laws of nature are always purely observed.\
And since the world has been enlightened with the truth, fire is customarily\
used in divine service, and no facrifice was thought acceptable without it. In-\
deed, if earthly creatures can any way reconcile us to heaven, nothing has greater\
affinity with the fire, as it lights and clears every thing. Wherefore they think\
that they may represent the genii and angels, even the Dity itself by it.\
As\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
As to the Altars and Piety, we see in the medal of the emperor . Alius,  with open hands, which, as before observed, signifies Worship, and by it\
an altar with these letters, PIETAS. In one of Hadrianus Augustus is the same\
figure, between  stork and an altar adorned with ground-ivy, with this inscrip-\
tion, PIETAS AUG. In one of Diva Augusta Faustina appears  woman, lift-\
ing up her garment with the left hand and laying the offering on the burning\
altar with the other, having the word PIETAS, In the medal of Lucilla we see\
 figure standing behind the altar, with  cup in its hand as ready to offer, with\
the word PIETAS. In that of Antoninus is the figure of Piety, opening the\
right hand as  token of adoration, and with-the left ready to put the sacrifice\
on the altar, with the same inscription. In the gold medal of . Alius Caesar,\
the right hand of the figure is in the same action and the left holds  gift, alsp\
inscribed PIETAS.\
We offer prayers and supplications, either in making vows or receiving fa-\
vours in consequence of them. Hence proceed the various inscriptions on me-\
dals, which neverthelefs do all allude to piety, whether in praying for help or\
returning thanks. Accordingly we find in the medal of Jalia Pia Aug.  wo-\
man tucking up her garment on the left-side and offering with the right, with\
this inscription VOTA PUBLICA. But in one of Hadrianus are two figures,\
one like the emperor, and the other holds in the left hand  palm-sprig, and\
with the right offers him  cup, having this motto ADVENTUTI AUGUSTI.\
In one of Domitian is  burning altar, inscribed PRINCEPS JUVENTUTIS.\
The altars were anciently, as they are now--days, places of safety and pro-\
tection. Wherefore Priamus, in Virgil, having lost all hope of preservation,\
took sanctuary at the altar, of which his wife had said, This altar shall protect\
us all. Cicero, speaking of the actor Roscius, says, We run into his, house as to\
an altar. And Ovid, in his Triftib. says, The altar only is left me in my mis-\
fortune.\
The Athenians had  particular altar dedicated to Mercy and Compafsion, as\
we gather from the poet Papinius and Lactantius Grammaticus, and from Apfinis in\
his Rhetoric. Plutarch, treating of superstition, calls the altar abominable. Xe\'ac\
zophon, in his second book of the state of Greece, takes Vesta for an emblem of\
refuge to the altar: When Theramenes (says he) had heard the things, he took.\
to Vesta for refuge. Pollux calls Vesta the altar of offering, especially that at the\
Prytaneum  where the everlasting fire was kept. Dionysius Harlicarnassus says,.\
That Romulus built  temple in honour of Vesta, and as  memorial of his hav\'ac\
ing divided the Roman people into thirty wards. Suetonius writes almost the same\
in the life of Tiberius.\
In fine, the altars were set up for facrifices and prayer, to obtain divine favour\
and blessing, though few have determined which of the various sacrifices was\
best and most approved by the ancients, who offered to the Almighty only in\
spirit\
*The place in Athens, where the judges and magistrates sat, and where those who had done\
any confiderable service to the common-wealth, were maintained at the public charge.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
spirit and understanding, without uttering  word ; wherefore the MEgyptians ho-\
noured the crocodile, as having no tongue, applying it to the divine silence-\
They praised the spirits and souls of the ever-blessed, and offered to heavenly\
things material ones, such-as had some affinity with them, viz. fire to the sun,\
&. But to the evil spirits or devils, they brought offerings that they might not\
hurt or obstruct them, or that their uncleanness might not pollute the sacrifice\
or the savour of the meat. The Agyptiansf always thought it abominable to\
expiate with the blood of animals, and therefore offered only prayers and frank-\
incense. The kings of the Ptolemaic line enjoined them sacrifices to Serapis and\
Saturn, to whom they built temples without their towns, wherein to offer beasts\
as usual; though in after-times, according to the inhuman custom of Busiris, on\
his usurping the countries and places bordering on the Nile, they offered men.\
But of offerings we shall treat further in the following chapter.\
\
\
\
\
CHAP. XVIII. Of the different Offerings of Nations, and their\
Rites.\
AS from highest antiquity down to these times, different regards have been\
had for many persons and places, and the knowledge thereof much con-\
\
oerns an artist : so he ought diligently to inquire into the ancient manners and\
customs relating thereto, both in general and with respect to particular\
countries.\
Scripture informs us; that the Athenians were very religious ; wherefore they\
as well as the Romans, lestthey should forget  deity, would rather set up an altar\
to an unknown god, and make offerings thereon, than be any ways negligent in\
the duty of worship. From which altar St. Paul took occasion to preach so\
powerful  sermon touching Christ and his gospel, as thereby to bring over many\
souls to christanity.\
We must conclude, that so many altars required many priests, who were as\
different in drefs as the gods and manner of offering; those of Jupiier not at all\
like Priapus\'92, nor Diana\'92 those of Bacchus; as we shall shew in the sequel.\
The great Laver of the Jews evidences, that their priests observed  perfect\
cl\'e9anliness in their worship. Even the Almighty himself ordered Moses to put off\
his-shoes,. when he appeared to him in the burning bush, and that any man or\
beast who touched the Mount or its borders, so long as he was present; should\
be shot or stoned.\
It is not probable that the heathens were so nice in this- point ; nevertheless,\
 the present custom induces us to believe that their ancestors no less observed this\
decency\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
decenev in their worship, since, to this day, even Christians are not allowed to\
enter the mosques of the Mahometans, though of all infidels they are the least ob-\
servers of religious ceremonies.\
 think it not amiss to deride the Agyptians in particular, for paying divine\
honour to sonie beasts, because most nations especially the Greeks, (who excelled\
in wisdom and knowledge) as likewise the strict Romans were infected with the\
same superstition.\
Marcrobius writes, that king Janus was the first who introduced and established\
in ltaly the offerings to the gods, and that he himself was afterwards worshipped\
as such, even so much, that the ancient Romans never sacrificed before they had\
invoked him as the inventor and protector of the offerings ; for they believed he\
always fat at the gates of heaven, and that the prayers of mortals could not reach\
the Gods if he denied them entrance, nay, he must even lend them an hand to go\
forward, because prayers, which Homer calls women, are lame and cripples.\
The most ancient nations who brought offerings (of which the Agyotians were\
doubtless the principal) did not make use of beasts, but herbs, flowers, trees and\
plants, as likewise perfumes ; they therefore who anciently lived on beast\'92 flesh\
did it, as reported, for want of fruits : and this on an opinion of Pythagoras, who\
forbid the eating of meat or blood, as judging that the soul had its residence\
therein : although Eusebius relates the ancient divines maintained, that no beasts,\
even no meal, honey, fruits or flowers ought to be offered ; for, says he, God\
knows them who fear him, and favourably accepts the poorest leaf they lay on the\
altar, regarding their hearts and inclinations, and not what they offer with their\
hands.\
It is certain, that in old times,  detestable custom prevailed among almost all\
nations, of butchering men for victims, as we learn from credible authors, was\
practised to Diana Taurica. And not only the ancient Soyrhians, but also the Agyp-\
tians and Romans were infected with this cruelty; the former offering such victims\
in honour to Juno, and the latter to Jupiter, called Latialis, whom they esteemed\
the protector of the Latins. Sicinnius Dentatus (or the toothed, as being so born)\
very famous for martial exploits, was the first among the Romans who sacrificed\
men to Mars. Athanasius relates, that divers other nations, after their return\
from conquest, had  custom of dividing their prisoners into hundreds, and that\
one out of each, as the unlucky lot fell, was sacrificed to Mars. Varro also testi-\
fies, that the wandering Trojans, on their arrival at last in staly, offered, according\
to the oracle, one man in ten to Pluio and Saturn. Anaeas, as Virgil informs us,\
chose eight young gallants out of the prisoners he took of the enemy, to sacrifice\
them to the gods of hell for the sake of Pallas deceased. Diodorus Siculus mentions,\
that the people of Carthage sacrificed to an idol of metal, representing Sciurn,\
holding out its arms bent, young men as  burnt-offering, by consuming them\
alive in the flames of  red hot oven placed under this figure. Which offerings\
were long retained among those people, till at last having them in abhorrence,\
they put \'e0 live deer to the same usc. Yet, some time after the death of Alezander\
the Great, on being visited with the plague. and the town closely besieged and re-\
duced to famine by Agathocles king of Sicily, they, according to the common cus-\
tom\
\
\
\
\
\
\
tom of nations, had recourse to their imagined tutelar-gods, prayers, and old su-\
perstitions, believing that Saturn, provoked by the change of offering, (which\
their ancestors, with great devotion appropriated to him) had as  punshment,\
caused this disaster and irreparable damage to befall them : which opinion so in-\
fluenced on the minds of the citizens; that they barbaroussy in one day offered two\
hundred, others say three hundred youths of noble birth to that idol, as an at-\
tonement. the same writer adds, that the Phaenicians exceeded all other nations\
in that unnatural practice, insomuch, that in  frantic extravagance, and to ap-\
pease the imagined wrath of the idol Saturn, they sacrificed their own cnildren ;\
and afterwards abating that cruelty, they made use of those of other men, whom\
they secretly bought or stole-for this abominable purpose. But Plutarch, that\
Gelon, king of Sicily, having vanquished the Carthaginians in the battle of Hymera,\
forced them to promise never more to offer either ther own or other mens children\
in such  manner. Quintius Currius testifies, that this cruel custom prevailed among\
the people of Zyre, till the destruction of that city. And, according to St.\
Augustin, the ancient Gauls, inhabitants of France, as now called, and several other\
nations, were defiled with this abomination. Heliogabalus, one of the greatest\
and most extravagant tyrants who ever sat on the Roman throne, caused all staly to\
be searched for beautiful and noble youths, whose parents were still alive, barbar-\
oussy, and to the greater sorrow of their families, to offer them as victims. The\
Jews are also, not without reason, much censured by Aypion, Julian the apostate\
and others, for having sacrificed men to idols ; abhorring the crueltv of Jephthah,\
chief of the Gileadites, in delivering up his daughter for  burnt-offering. This\
detestable superstition was not only prevalent among the heathens, but also among\
the kings of Judad, the rulers of God\'92 chosen people, in making their children\
pafs through the fire, offering them up to Moloch, as we read of Ahaz and Manasseh,\
 Kings xvi. and xxi. and as Josephus de Antig. lib.  says, after the manner of\
the Canaanites. Cambyses, king of Persia, and Alexander the Great, after him, by\
public and universal laws, prohibited their subjects these abominable offerings :\
yet, not being long observed, the emperor, Hadrianus, under severe penalties in-\
tirely supprest them. Hercules first abolished the killing of men for  sacrifice to\
Suturn, offeringhim so many burning lights in their stead, and thereby reformed\
the inhuman custom. This he did on his return from Spain; and assigned for\
reason, that the Greek word oos, (which the oracle of Dodone had made use of\
for the institution of that solemnity) signified light, as well as man, and that there-\
fore they were to offer to Pluto \'e6 baked figures of clay and burning torches of\
candles instead of men : for which cause, they on the festivals of Saturn, called\
Saturnalia, made presents to one another of little figures and burning wax-candles.\
But Lycurgus, the Lacedemonian legislator ordained that pigs should be used for\
victims instead of men.\
The image of Dianna, mentioned before, which lphigenia and Orestes had\
brought, bound up in  bundle of willow-branches, from Chersonesus Tauricia,\
now called Grim, was worshipped by the Lacedemonians with great reverence.\
They\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
They anciently offered it to men, who were chosen by casting the lot : This cru-\
el custom Lycurgus altered thus ; they led youths to the altar of the idol and whiped\
them so long till, according to their institution and the will of the oracle, it was\
sprinkled with human blood : and this was done to encourage young people not\
to fear the cuts and wounds they might receive from the enemy in battle.\
Pltarch also relates, that anciently when the plague had made  sad havock at\
Lacedemon, the people were informed by the oracle, that the infection would\
cease if they offered yearly some noble virgins. The Lacedemonians obeyed. At\
last it happened, that the lot fell on Helena; who being led for sacrifice, an\
eagle descended and snatched the weapon out of the priest\'92 hand, carrying it over\
 field, where he dropped on  heifer. Aristides, in his  Book of the Italian\
state, mentions the same accident formerly happening at Rome to Valeria Lnperca.\
The head, says Hesychius, bishop of ferusalem, as having of all that is created,\
treason, is called understanding, and has planted its seat in the heart. God also\
formerly commanded, that the head and liver, and all that belonged to it, should\
be  burnt-offering tohim: for from the heart and the liver come forth the springs\
and motions of our carnal appetites. And in this sense St. Paul blesses his con-\
igregation, saying, ee The peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep\
vour hearts and minds, &. The prophet lsaiah says likewise, ce The whole\
head is fick, and the whole heart faint: from the sole of the foot even unto the\
hcad there is no soundness in it.'\
Herodotus writes, that the Stythians worshipp\'92 divers gods, but did not erect\
teither temples, altars or images, other than to Mars, altho their manner of sacri-\
fice was one and the same to all their gods; and which  think not improper to\
mention here. The victim being brought to the appointed place, with its fore-\
legs tied, the priest followed, striking it on the head; which causing it to sink,\
they thereupon invoked the god to whom it was to be offered. Then he threw\
 rope about its neck and strangled it, and pulling the skin and flesn from the\
bones, heiput the same, if they had no wood, on the bones with other burning\
mixtures, in order to boil it; and if they wanted the n\'e6cessary kettles, they put\
the flesh into the skin again, and thus broiled it on the fire. This being done,\
the priest offered the victim to the god they intended. But among all their vic-\
tims the horse was the chief, which therefore they dedicated to Mars; whose\
temple, when damaged and decayed by rains, dampness and  bad climate,\
they retrieved in the following manner. They gathered many branches, twigs,\
and chips of trees, piling them into  arge square heap, made perpendicular on\
three sides, and slopinig on the fourth, so as conveniently to step on: in the\
middle of this heap, they laid  large knife, not unlike the present Persian or\
Turkissi scymitars; which they imagined to be the true image of Mars, whom\
they worshiped and honoured with their offerings.\
That the horse was anciently first sacrificed to Mars, the histories of the Grecks\
and Romans plainly evince. The annals of the lattertestify,thatthey usedtooffery early\
tohim, in the Campus Martius, on the  of December, an horse which had won the\
prize in the race; thereby besceching the god to favour their warlike enterprizes\
with success. Pausanias reports, that Jyndarus, father of Helena, who was ravish-\

ed by Paris and carried to Troy, having determined the utmost revenge, asfembled\
all the Grecian princes in conjunction with her consort Menelaus, vowing by the\
facrifice of an horse, to revenge by sword the affront put upon him and his fa-\
mily. Some also pretend, that the aforesaid festival, kept on the  of Decem-\
ber, has been celebrated on the  of October, and that the name of October was\
given to the horse appointed for those purposes. On which occasion,  great\
contest one time arose at Rome about the sacrificed horse\'92 head; some insisting\
to have it on the Capitol, and others on  tower of the city, called Manillia.\
The solemnities of this rite were performed in the following manner. On the\
 of October, they led  fine horse, decked with garlands of greens, intermix-\
ed with flowers and loaves of bread, through the streets and quarters of the town,\
and being arrived at the Campus Martius, they there killed and offered him to\
Mars, for obtaining prosperity and fruitfulness. This was done to beseech the\
god to prevent ruinous war; in which, the cavalry causes the greatest damage\
and destruction to the product of the field : for it would be absurd to think,\
that the Romans, who pretended to be descended from the Trojans, should offer\
the horse to Mars, after the Greek manner, and in conformity to the intention of\
Jyndarus, in order to be revenged of their ancestors ; wherefore it was only for\
the reason aforesaid. The Lacedemonians, as Festus affirms, had also  custom.\
of offering  horse yearly on Mount Taygetus; burning him to afhies for the wind\
to scatter into all their towns, villages and districts. And Pausanias mentions,\
that the Macedonians sacrificed on the same Mount, an horse to the sun, in imi-\
tation of the Persians. Xenophon asferts the same in his Memoirs, when he relates,\
That they made Curio  present of an horse for that purpose; knowing it was\
the custom of the Persians to honour the sun with such  victim. He says further\
that the Sarmatans bred horses for sacrifice and sustenance. The Salenrines like-\
wise offered horses, and afterwards burnt them, in honour to Jupiter. The\
people of Rhodes offered to the sun  chariot with four beautiful horses, which\
they drove into the sea to be swallowed up by the waves ; believing the sun ran\
round the world equipped in that manner. We read in the Heroic Poems of Phi-\
lostralus, that, in order to overcome their enemies, they were obliged to offer to\
the sun  white foal who had never known the bridle or spur: this was done by\
the advice of Palamedes, to buoy up and animate the Greeks, who, at the siege of\
Troy, were struck with frights and fears at the sight of  sudden eclipse which\
then happened.\
Origines intimates, that the offering  bullock before the tabernacle, according\
to the ancient Jewoissi rite, signified, that we must subdue all pride and haughti-\
ness; and by  calf, the having overcome the weakness of the flesn.\
The Baeotians had  custom of sacrificing to Neptune  bullock, called with\
them Mucytes, or bellowing ; because his noise has some affinity with that of the\
billows when violently agitated by the winds. The bullocks, which the priests\
selected for that deity, ought to have dark or black hair, thereby to signify the dark\
depths of the water. Wherefore many think, that the eagle is called by the\
Latins, Aquilla, from the word Aqua, as having  dark and blackisn colour. For\
the same reason, the sea-gods are usually represented with brown complexions,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
bluish hair and garments, and with full chests and broad shoulders, like bul-\
locks. ; to the Taurii Ludi, or bull-solemnities in use among the ancient\
\
Romans, they were not instituted by them in honour to Neptune, but for the\
infernal gods, whom they believed were thereby moved to compassion, when\
under Tarquinus Superbus, the city was affficted with  plague, which carried off\
abundance of women with child, and the people imputed the misfortune to the\
eating the flesn of black bullocks.\
The sacrifices which the Ronan censors used to offer every fifth year for their\
purification, and called Solitaurilia, confisted of  boar,  ram, and  bull.\
The offering  bullock, as we gather from history, was generally, especial-\
ly among the Romans,  token of victory gained over the enemy : according-\
ly, Juvenal says, They led to the Capitol  large black bullock marked with chalk.\
But here it must be observed, that the Lacedemonians in some fort imitated the Ro\'ac\
mans in several of their sacrifices of that nature; for when the latter got  victory\
by slaughter and taking the enemy prisoners, they offered  bullock ; but when\
without blood-shed,  sheep. The Lacedemonians, contrarily, sacrificed  bul-\
lock, on obtaining  victory without cruelty or blood-shed; and  cock when it\
was got in the open field, in  pitched battle, preferring enterprizes performed\
with reason and conduct, to those effected by main force.\
We read likewife, that anciently, especially among the Romans, the bullock\
was so much regarded, that it was as capital to kill one as to murder  citizen.\
Wherefore Erichthaeus, reigning at Athens, ordered, that at the yearly festival,\
wherein  bullock was sacrifiiced, the popa, or priest (whose duty required him\
to furnisn the cattle, and cut their throats when knocked down) should, after\
the solemnity was over, and in maintainance of the law, forsake the town, first\
leaving the ax at the foot of the altar.\
The Thessalians were enjoined by the oracle of Apollo at Dodone, to offer sacri-\
fice yearly on the tomb of Achilles; and to furnish the necessaries from their own\
country; namely, two tame bulls, one black and the other white; the wood\
from Mount Pelion; the fire out of Thessaly; and slower and water from the river\
Sperchius. With these were to be used garlands and festoons of greens, inter-\
mixed with amaranths, that, in case the ships, bringing the necessaries from\
other \'e9ountries, should be kept back by contrary winds, at least such greens,\
and flowers that never wither, might not be wanting to hang on the tomb.\
Apollodorus and Athenaeus relate, that Hercules was so great an eater, as often to-\
devour  whole bullock at  meal : for wlich reason, the ancients dedicated to\
him the water-fowl, called by the Gree\'e8s Maoos, in Englissi Sea-mew ; because\
this bird according to Suidas, is very voracious ; nay, on account of this excess-\
in eating, they brought him offerings, whereby men were not allowed to use any\
other expreffions than cursing and swearing: Lactantius and Apollodorus relate\
the story thus; Hercules on  time travelling with some companions through\
Rhodes, and being very hungry, met with  country-man at plough with  cou-\
ple of oxen, which he desired to purchase for silling his belly; but the man re-\
jecting the proffer, Hercules took the cattle by force, and with his companions\
\
\
\
\
\
\
eat them up. The other enraged and frantic hereat, cursed and swore at Hercu-\
les as he was eating ; who laughed and bantered him, saying he never eat  bet-\
ter morsel, or with more gusto, in all his life. Wherefore the inhabitants of\
that island erected an altar to him after his deification, whereon was carved  yoke\
of oxen; offering thereon, at certain timcs,  couple of oxen : at which soleni-\
nity the priests and people bustled about, and made  great noise, by cursing\
swearing, and other impieties, which they thought would please the god, in re-\
membrance of the adventure with the plough-man.\
 must subjoin another sacrifice to the honour and memorv of the deified\
Hercules, not less foolisn than ridiculous. Suidas relates, that the Baotians on \
certain time leading an ox for sacrisice, he broke loose and ran away. Where-\
upon the mob, unwilling to pretermit the time for celebration, stuck an ap-\
ple on four sticks, with two smaller on top, representing four legs and two horns;\
offering this with great solemnity to Hercules. Others ascribe this apple sacrifice,\
instead of an ox, to the Athenians: And Julius Pollux testifies, that it was long\
in use among the Thebans. Yet Pausanias in his Memoirs reports, that as the ap-\
ple-tree is sometimes accepted by the gods, in token of  propitious sacrifice,\
so the Baotians, at the ox\'92 running away, offered to Hercules an apple-tree, ha-\
ving but four branches instead of the four-legged beast; whence it became after-\
wards customary to consecrate that. tree to this god. And Apollodorus affirms, ac-\
cording to Zenodotus, that those offerings of the Baotians were instead of rams and\
sheep.\
The imploring help and favour by means of abullock, reminds me of  custom\
of the ancient Scythians, now called Tariars, who killing and stripping  bullock,\
the person who had received any injury from another, took the skin, spread it on\
the ground, and sat upon it with his hands behind him; and those who in passing\
by, promised to give their affistance, trod onthe skin with the right foot, thereby\
signifying the means they proposed to use for the injured person\'92 satisfaction.\
This custom is largely described by Lucianus treating of friendship under the\
name of Toxaris. And, speaking of the Homolois, he says, That when they de-\
ligned inviolably to engage themselves to each other, they killed an ox and cut\
him intobits, to give to people as they passed by : which custom is still solemnly\
observed by the Circassian Tartars inhabiting between the rivers Tanais and Phasis.\
And all such passangers as get  piece of such an ox, think themselves so bound\
in friendship, and so much obliged to the giver, as not to scruple hazarding either\
goods or life in revenging the injury done to theirfriend.\
The Athenians in thankful acknowledgment of the profitable labour of the ox,\
stamped his image on their coin, called Didrachmum. Wherefore, we read in\
Homer, and other writers, that they used to buy merchandizes by certain num-\
bers of oxen : as in the second Book of his Iliads he has it, ce Every thing of\
that kind is sold for  Hecatomb. . . an hundred oxen : or, in better terms, for\
an hundred pieces of gold or silver coin with their impress.\
\

Pindarus mentions, that the Hyperboreans performed their  Hecatombs, or\
great facrifices, to Apollo with asfes : wherefore Callimachus says, That, that god\
took delight in the killing  fat afs\
But the Agyptians hated this creature, not only for his dulness and stupidity,\
but also for his skin mixed with brown and white, which they accounted abomi-\
nable and unfit to be offered to the gods. Accordingly, they abused him as\
much as possible, flinging stones and clods of dirt and mud, and pricking him\
with sharp-pointed sticks; and when in the pursuit they found him on  conve-\
nient eminence they made him roll down it. Hence arose the comparative pro-\
verb applied to contemptible persons, The afs of Agypt.\
These people were not the only ones who paid honour to the hog: other nations\
have ranked it with their gods : for this creature was formerly sacred in Candia,\
where they believed that Jupiter at his birth, sucked  sow, which by her grunt-\
ing, intirely drowned the cries of the child; though some will rather afcribe this\
kindnefs to the goat of Amalthea.\
The ancient stalian kings had  custom, to offer an hog in their nuptial solem-\
nities : and the great, in their nuptial feasts, brought, according to the Tuscan\
manner, an hog to the altar, consecrating it to the tutelar gods and presiders over\
new married persons : which was the general custom of the Greeks as well as of\
the Latins.\
They of Argos celebrated the festival called Hysteries, by offering an hog in\
honour to Venus ; of which Callimachus largely treats; though we find the Sicyonians\
dedicated to her all kinds of beasts, as Aristophanes testifies, saying, They killed\
an hog to offer to Venus.\
They likewise offered an hog to the Goddess Maja, (by whom is meant the\
carth, thus called, according to Cornelius Labeo, as signifying greatness) because\
this creature makes great havock among the corn and grain, and is very prone to\
tear up the ground, as Horace says, The hogs loves the mud; for these beasts\
were facrificed to the gods, either on account of their likeness and agreement, or\
dissimularity and aversion. Wherefore the poets mention, that the hog was first\
offered to Ceres, for the great mischiefit did to the corn. Veranius says, They\
also offered  sow to Ceres after  funeral, for purifying the family.\
On making  peace, alliance, or truce, they offered an hog, as Virgil affirms,\
He made the peace during the killing of  sow. Though Quintilian and Servius,\
in their remarks, that Virgil means an hog, because in that solemnity was always\
used an hog or boar. Suetonius, in the life of Claudius Caesar, reports, that he\
made an alliance with the princes during the offering of  sow; though Tits Li-\
vius speaks likewise of an hog.\
The Mosait Law enjoined tne king or princes to offer for their sins an he goat;\
and those who had no public employments,  she goat or lamb. Aaron was com-\
manded to offer for himself and family,  calf, as harmless or righteous, and an\
he goat for  sin offering. And we learn from Hesychius, bishop of Jerusalem, that\
the\
*  Greck word, signifying an offering of an hundred beasts.\
\
\
\
\
\
the High-priest, after having offered an he goat for  burnt-offering, was allowed\
to go into the Holy of Holies, cloathed in  white linen coat, with  girdle of the\
same, and breeches and mitre of fine twined linen ; as signifying, that being re-\
conciled to God, purified in body and soul, chaste, sober, and righteous, filled\
with godly understanding, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit, he might enter into\
that place.\
The offering he goats and fheep under the law, implies  mortifying and rooting\
out all impurities and carnal Justs, as Admantius explains it, and to which Cyril\
agrees ; for Scripture hieroglyphically, commonly takes the he goat for men\
plunged in stinking, impure, and all manner of extravagant desires; as also\
plainly appears by our Saviour\'92 words, When, at the-last judgment, he will set\
the sheep or elect, with all blessings on his right hand, and on the lest, those,\
whoby stinking sin are unworthy of his pity, for eternal punishment. And after\
such  manner the goat was brought to attone for fins, when the law commanded,\
that he should be presented alive before the altar, and the priest laying his hands\
on the head should confess over him all the iniquities of the people, and put\
them on the head of this lascivious creature, and then by afit person, send him\
away into the Wilderness. They add, for confirmation, that the thick and\
rough hair of this beast is laid upon him as  stinking burthen of his lasci-\
viousness.\
The fables of the Greek poets tell us that Hercules was the first who tamed the\
lascivious he goat; meaning, that he overcame the wanton desires of the flesh.\
He likewise first offered this beast to Juno ; for, having vanquished Hippocoon,\
and thereby irritated the goddess, he found no other victim at hand to appease\
her with, as Paufanias relates in his third book. But the Lacedemonians sacrificed\
to Diana, called the Corythalian in the fields, goats flesn only, no other beast being\
allowed in that solemnity. Wherefore Xenephon in his Memoirs reports, that\
when the Persians invested Achens with  mighty force, intending to ruin it intire-\
ly, the Athenians mode  vow to Diana, to offer to her as niany goats as they should\
defeat enemies, in case they beat them.\
The poets likewise mention, that the goat was sacrificed to Bacchus, because,\
he being the god of wine, could not be more acceptably honoured, than with the\
death of  creature so noxious to vine-yards dedicated to him. Wherefore the\
festivals called Ascolia, were also celebrated in his honour ; when they laid on the\
ground at equal distances, sacks or bags of goats fkins silled with wind, which\
being smeared with oil or grease, they merrily to win the prize, lcaped from one\
upon the other, tumbling, by reason of the glibness over each other, to the no\
small delight and applause of the people.\
The Romanladies, on being delivered with twins, formerly offered to Juno (to\
whom empires and riches were facred) certain sheep, which, according to Bebius\
Macer, were tied between two pair of lambs on each side. But the Sicyonians cus-\
tom was, to offer fat sheep, by them called Eumenides, to the gods of benevo-\
lence and good hope, for the good luck and prosperity of theirfamilies. They\
likewise sacrificed to Hercules, as god of riches and plenty,  fheep tied on feur\
sticks instead of  bullock, who ran away as they were leading himn to the altar;\
wherefore\
\
\
\
\
\
\
wherefore he is called Melius, or Shepherd. But of this ridiculous offering lhave\
said enough before.\
We gather from the Greek and Roman histories and antiquities, that they sacri-\
ficed dogs, the former to Prosorpina, and the latter to Genetia. At the festival\
called Lupercalia, sacred to the Lycaan idol Pan, the Romans offered the same,\
knowing that the constant nature of dogs is to pursue wolves. Others think that\
this was done in honour and renrembrance of Romulus, who, they said, was in his\
infancy laid in  wood, and brought up by  wolf. Some report, that Evander\
first introduced and established those solemnities. The people of Argos offered\
dogs to the goddess Cyonia, to whom they aicribed the power of giving women in\
labour an happy delivery. The Lacedemonians consecrated those creatures to Mars\
\'92for their eagernefs and alacrity in falling on deer. For, the young men in their\
warlike exercises used to begin them with sacrificing  little dog to Mars, as the\
strongest and most valiant of the gods, judging that creature to be the most ac-\
ceptable of the tame and sociable animals. The Augures,  fort of priests among\
the Romans, also often sacrificed  kind of red dogs before the town gate, called\
from thence Catularia, or dogs-gate, that the heat of the dog-days in July and\
August might not burn or spoil the trees and fruits of the earth,\
The inhabitants of Methone annually offered  cock for the prosperity of the\
vineyards, and for averting the violent South-east winds ; for when this wind\
rises in the blossoming time of the vines; its malignity kill the young fhoots, and\
frustrates the hope of  future vintage : wherefore the Augures of that tract of\
land found it proper to order, that two young men, chosen for that purpose,\
should at  certain place, take  white cock, and each holding  leg above the\
spur, by parting pull him to pieces; and then with the piece of the cock in their\
hands, running round the vineyards, one to the right, the other to the left, till\
having as they thought made an atonement, they met again at the place where\
the cock was torn to pieces, and there buried him. By blind luck, it sometimes\
fell out that as long as they observed the solemnity, the issue of things answered\
their desire.\
The ancient Romans also used to sacrifice annually an hen to Asculapius, the\
god of health.\
The duck on account of its greedy and voracious nature, was by the Baeotians\
sacred to Hercules (whom they judged the greatest eater and glutton) as the most\
acceptable to him.\
And, according to Zenodotus, the Phaenicians offered  quail to the same god, be-\
cause it once saved his life.\
The people of Crene ascribed great honour in husbandry to Saturn ; saying, he\
was the inventor of planting, grafting, pruning and dunging: wherefore, in his\
solemnities, they wore on their heads chaplets of fresh figs, as well on account\
of their being food, as dainty taste.\
The Agyptians offered annually on the i day of the first month, honey and\
figs, in honour of Mercury, celebrating this feast with great noise, and crying,\
Oh  how sweet and agreeable is truth.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The ancient Gauls worshipped Hercales as the god of prudence, and, as Lucia-\
nus says, Eloquence, even more than Mercuzy ; because eloquence is accounted\
more consummate in aged men (as Hercules is generally represented) than in the\
young : wherefore, they offered to him, as tne Agyptians did to Mercury, honey\
and figs : moreover, all who ministered held  fig-tree branch in their hands,\
and they, as well as the priests, had their heads adorned with popular leaves.\
Virgil likewise mentions, that Evander, offering to this god, had  chaplet of the\
same leaves about his head, calling them Hercules leaves. And Macrobius says,\
that the ancient solemnities to Saturn and Hercules were performed bare-headed ;.\
but in those to other gods the priefts heads were covered.\
The ancient Romans offered to the goddess Carna, to whom they ascribed the\
support of the animal spirits in human bodies, bacon, and the greens of beans,\
whereby men are made strong and hearty for labour. And it is certain that those\
people called the first day of June Fabaria, or Bean\'92-day, because that oblation:\
was instituted by Junius Brutus, of whom this month has also borowed its name.\
Festus Pompeius says, that the Romans annually offered to Vulcan in June, at the feast\
called the Fishing-games,  fort of fisni, for the souls of men ; because the ancient\
philosophers hieroglyphically represented the souls by fishes : and, as Philo says,\
Because they consist of  pure element, and God created them. the first of all living.\
creatures.\
Vincent Cartarie relates another custom of the Romans, That, after  victory ob-\
tained, they piled all the shields and other weapons of the enemy in an heap, and\
burnt them as an oblation to Vuican. Which was done, says Servius, in imitation-\
of Tarquinius Priscus, who having overcome the Sabines, burnt all their weapons\
in honour of the same god; and as. Evander mentions in Virgil, he did when.\
young and had gotten the victory at Praeneste.\
The Agyptians offered to lsis loaves and apples. And the ancient Sicilians, acorns-\
and flour to Ceres. The heathenisn priests offered to. the nymphs, or water and\
field goddeffes, white fillies, on account of their purity. As Serapis is reputed.\
by the Agyptians the god of riches, or the productions of the earth, being the in\'ac\
ventor of sowing and tillage ; he is therefore by them represented with  basket\
of fruits of the earth on his head. Even his offerings, whether of meat, bread,.\
fruits, or flowers, were carried in baskets.\
We see that the jug is commonly sacred to Ofiris, not only on account of his be\'ac\
ing master and inventor of wine, but also of all moisture; wherefore he is called\
Ocean, and isis, Thetis ; for it was the custom to carry ajug in the procession of the\
offerings, thereby to shew their veneration for this god, keeping  large one in\
particular esteem, to carry it covered with great solemnity to the temple ; where\
being arrived, they kneeled down, and with lifted up hands, thanked the god\
for his loving kindness to men ; as believing that all things were brought forth by.\
moisture.\
In  certain place in Greece they worshipped Myngrus god of the fties; when the\
people offered to him all the flies retired from those parts. The Grenenses iii . bia\
al so honoured the god of flies, called Achor, making offerings to hiin sor stopping\
the plague, which sometimes was occasioned by the multitude of those inseets.\
Anciently\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Anciently they offered red wine instead of blood. For Moses, in his Song in\
Deureronomy; says, es And thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape. in his Psalms, ee They have drank the blood of the grape.  Indeed, the\
Aepyptim priests, some of whom were kings, intirely abstained from wine, but\
always used it in their offerings, not as an acceptablenefs to heaven, but to signify\
the blood and punissiment of those who rebelled against the gods, and thereby to\
obtain favour and reconciliation, for the Agyptians firmly believed that wine sprang\
from the blood of the discomfitted giants, which on their rising against the Gods,\
and threatening to storm heaven, was spilt on the earth, and therefore made men\
commit all manner of extravagancies : they also intimated by the wine-press, per-\
fecution, adversity, vexation, and oppression.\
The Romans, on the other hand, celebrated the feast of Mercury with milk only\
to express thereby the sweetness of eloquence. Those rites were performed at\
Rome, in the street called Sobrius, or Sober, because wine has many strange effects,\
as, disclosing of secrets, running rashily into dangers, weakness of the legs,\
faultering of the tongue, wandering senses, and other imperfections.\
slaughter of beasts, but also with festoons and garlands of flowers, and with the\
tinkling noise of copper and iron instruments, tabors, harmonious sounds, haut-\
boys, pipes, &.\
To finisn this chapter, let me add, that anciently it was the custom of many\
nations to make on the face of the altar,  circle or ring with the blood of the\
victim, carefully and with great devotion savingit in  vessel for that purpose.\
This solemnity they called by  word, which signifies, Making perfect, saying,\
That the round was the most perfect of all figures.\
\
CH AP. XIX. Of the Sacredotal Dresses, Vessels, and other Materials\
pertaining to Offerings.\
 the preceding chapter more complete,  thought it necessary to say\
something here of the sacredotal dresses, vessels, &. believing it may be\
of service to the curious artists, whose constant employments will not always al-\
low them to peruse the authors treating of those matters.\
When the Agyptian priests, for the sins of the people, put up prayers for avert-\
ing the wrath of God, they were dressed in black, to signify that mortals pro-\
ceeding from usual earth, besought and intreated that invisible Being, on  be-\
lief that no other coloured dress was more proper.\
It is likewise  general custom of the principal and most polite nations to dress\
in black at times of humiliation, and those who mourn make use of the same co-\
lour ; wherefore, Varro calls them Anthracini, or as black as coals.\
The\
\

\
The Arcadians also worshipped Ceres, Goddess of the fruits of the earth, in\
black cloaths: and the priests of the idol Falacer, to whom they attributed the\
care and inspection of the fruits of the trees, wore commonly black caps; but in\
their solemnities all black. The black was also dedicated to Pluto, and in offering\
to him the priests were in this colour, believing that it best suited the hellisn or\
subterranean gods.\
Herodotus, to shew that the heathens agree with the present opinion touching\
the signification of cleanness, testifies, that the Agrptians did not allow the wear-\
ing in their temples any cloaths made of wool, but they had white linen gar-\
ments. Terfullian, speaking of our Saviour, therefore says, As he is dressed in the\
garb of white linen, it is the same with that of Ofiris. And Plutarch treating of lsis\
and Ofiris, takes this to be the reason why the priests make use only of white linen\
garments, to signify that all clean and undefiled things best agree with the nature\
of the Gods, whose pure and sacred Majesty, according to Plato, ought not to be\
worshipped by things impure and filthy. And as linen is the clearest dress, and\
can be very easily wafhed and made beautiful, so it was thought the most becom-\
ing the sacredotal dignity and purity. And indeed, the Magii, or priests of the\
ancient Perfians said, That God took delight in white garments: which assertion\
seems to be borrowed from Solomon, who, in his exhortations to good and blame-\
\'97Let your garments be always white;\
less manners, and  pure conscience, says:\
as if he meant,\'97Take heed, in all your actions, not to be defiled with evil and\
uncleanness.,\
The priestly vestment called Poderis, from the Greek word Podes in Englissi,\
Feet, was of fine white linen, setting close to the body, and hanging down to the\
feet. Ancient divines say, That thereby they signified the most holy and mysterious\
doctrine. This was the undermost covering, as we find in Exod. xxxix. And\
they made coats of fine weaved linen, and their garment called Hypodytes of\
Hyacinth Colour, intimating heavenlynefs, and that men ought to raise their\
minds, thoughts, and faculties thither, forsaking what is earthly. The priests\
also wore under their coats, breeches of fine twined linen, covering their privities\
and thighs, as an admonition to drefs and appear in chastity. They were likewise\
enjoined by the offertorial law to be girt with  girdle embroidered with blue,\
purple, and scarlet, hieroglyphically implying Fortitude, Strength, and Virtue.\
The Romissi priests use, to this day, white linen garments in their service, as did\
al so Apollonius Zyaneus, to whom they seemed more agreeable with cleannefs, than\
others woven of foul and greasy wool.\
The shoes of the Agyptian priests were not made of other matter than the bark\
of trees ; so cautious were they in avbiding the least appearance of unchastity and\
uncleanness. Accordinglv, and with respect to purity, it was  great crime\
among the Roman prestesses, called Flaminica, to wear shoes of skins of beasts\
which died natural deaths, superstitiously believing it to be abominable; but they\
approved of such as were made of offered beasts skins- Our Saviour himself com-\
manded his disciples not to wear shoes; that being with all speed to publisn ever-\
lasting life, they might intierly forsake what is corruptible. Moses also leaving\
the Agyptian bondage, wore shoes of beasts skins intimating his affinity with mor-\
tality\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
tality ; but afterwards as he grew in strength and virtue, and was to serve. the Al-\
mighty, he was commanded to pull them off.\
The egyptian priests adorned their heads with hawk\'92 feathers, thinking to\
owe this honour to that bird, because, as they say, he formerly brought the\
priests of Thebes, in. Agypr,  book written in red letters, containing the manners\
of worshipping the gods, and many of the principal rites to be observed in their\
offerings; wherefore, the Latin poets, according to Martial, call those priests\
copped or crested.\
It would be needless to say more touching the sacred dresses, such as the mitre,\
bonnet, ephod, and other ornaments, since they and every thing else relating to\
the priest-hood are amply described by Goeree in his Jezoijhi antiquities. Where-\
fore, after having touched on the hair of the priests, we shall only treat of the\
ancient Roman priest-hood.\
It was formerly the greatest scandal and indignity for  man to have his hair\
cut off: and possibly Moses therefore commanded the priests not to have their\
beards or hair taken off with  razor, but dlipped with scifsors, to distinguish\
them from those of the Agyptians, who, after the death of Apis, deified and\
worshipped by them, had not only their heads, but their whole bodies shaved,\
that in their sacrifices they might be pure. . Moreover, according to Bede, in his\
Church-history, by shaving the head is meant  renouncing superfluous riches\
(which priests by their institution, are punctually to observe) and that hair is to\
be accounted but as  superfluity of the body. And in this sense speaks Hierony-\
mus, that as the priest hashis head shaved, so he ought also to cut and cast off\
superfluous riches and earthly desires, and that by the little hair left is signified,\
that they must be content with small provision for supporting their mortal bodies.\
Others add, that the little hair left on their heads, in the form of  crown, de-\
notes the crown of eternity, with which after their conssicts, they were to be\
rewarded.\
But as for the law commanding to cut the hair round and to shave the beard,\
many think it proceeded from the abominable abuse of the heathens, who offered\
their own hair, and that oftheir children to the devil.\
On the other hand, divers councils decreed, that the priests, in imitation of\
the Nazariies, should keep theirhair and beards, and let them grow, with inten-\
tion that, by seeing and handling the same, they might always remember their\
duties. Wherefore they did not shave, but dlip their hair with sciffors, that it\
might not over-grow. But to return to the Romans.\
Numa Pompilius, their second king and  priest, when he could no longer alone\
bear the weight of the government, and discharge the duties of the priest-hood,\
instituted three priests called Flamines; the sirst in honour to Jupiter Capitolinus;\
the second to Mars ; and the third to Romulus Quirinus. Their drefs was much\
like that of the present Romissi clergy in their service. On their heads they had \
white hat, with an olive sprig upon it, at the extremity whereof appeared \
tuft of wool taken from  facrificed sheep. This hat was called Albogolerus.\
Afterwards Numa ordained twelve other priests, called Salii, in honour to Mars\
the\
\
\
\
\
\
the conqueror, protector, avenger, and peace maker. These were dressed in\
long loose garments or coats, having  breast-piece of copper enriched with gold,\
silver, and divers precious stones. The solemnities growing numerous, and at\
length amounting to above thirty thousand, Numa increased the number of priests\
accordingly. He created the Feciales, and Pater Patratus, who proclaimed war;\
also the Epulones, or overseers of all sacred banquets, and Augures or soothsayers,\
whose authority was so great, that the Senate could not assemble without their\
consent. They had all particular garbs, except when they officiated, at which\
time their drefs was alike, being  garment of white linen, very wide, and\
reaching to their heels, girt with  girdle and buckle about their bodies. This\
garment they called Gabinus.\
And as Ficlelity ought to be close, that is, the matters we are intrustedwith\
must be kept secret, pure, and inviolable.. Numa ordered that the high-priest, in\
offering to Fidelity shouldkeephis right hand covered with  white garment, as Tertul-\
lianobserves, to signify that Sincerity ought to be preserved simple and upright, and\
that it is sacred to the right hand, since we are to assert it with alacrity. Virgil like-\
wise intimates, that the firmness of Sincerity is signisied by the right hand, as \
pledge or asfurance : wherefore Dido in his fourth Aneid, complains, es Alas !\
These are the gilded words and promises of the son, who, as is said, carries with\
him sacred things and household gods. And in his third Aneid we read, ee Fa-\
ther Anchises himself gives the dejected youth Achemenides the right hand,-as \'e0 token\
of his sincerity to him. And in another place, Amata says to Latinus, : Where\
is your sincerity : Were the former care for your kindred, and your word and\
hand so often given to your nephew Turnus \'92 Virgil also calls Fidelity white\
and grey ; meaning, according to Servius, that sincerity is most found in old\
people who are grey and white. Horace complaining of the wickedness of his own\
times, says, That Sincerity dressed in white is little worshipped : adding, that in\
the offering toit, the High-priest keeps not only the right hand covered with the\
white garment, but also his head and almost his whole body, to shew that the\
heart and will ought to be pure and immaculate, and always to accompany sin-\
cerity. Wherefore Aristo also says, Sincerity was formerly represented in  white\
dress.\
Petronius r\'e9ports that Numa himself, for  badge of priesthood, wore  small\
linen cap, like the priests and soothsayers in their services ; as did likewise the\
wives and maid-servants of the Roman priests, called Flamines.\
The hat also, among the ancient Romans, denoted the sacredotal dignity; for\
the Flamines took their names from Pileus or hat, as if they would say, Pilea-\
mines : though others are of opinion, their name is derived froin Flammeum, which\
among them, was an head ornament; for the bishop-like caps, long coats and\
garments were, as lhave said, peculiar to the priests. The authority and credit\
of the illustrious Fabius Pictor iduces us to believe this, when he says, That the\
priests, or Flamines, were not allowed to appear publicly without the hat or cap,\
but that in their houses they were at their own liberty.  custom to this day\
strictly observed in many places by the Romissi prelates.\
Infula was  fine white linen garment, with which the priest and victim were\
covered.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
When the Vestal virgins offered, they were dressed in  long and wide vest-\
ment of very fine white linen, called Susfibuium. Their heads were likewise\
wound with  white garment, and over it was  vail of white linen hanging down\
square, and coming over their cheeks, and fastened under the chin with  clasp\
or buckle ; wherefore they were called Vestals, from the word Vestis. The Romissi\
women wear to this day long vails, pretending to imitate the virtuous ancient\
matrons, who covered their heads, necks and breasts with them, and kept them-\
selves so chaste and reserved, as never to seperate from their husbands, nor giving\
the least opportunity for evil.\
Besides the before-mentioned dresses, the priests had divers implements, and\
sacred vessels for offerings, viz.\
Prafericulum,  vessel of brass, wide on top, and without an handle.\
Patinu, or Patera,  dish or platter, whereon the priests saved the blood of the\
victims.\
Achana, another small vessel in the form of  cup, in which they saved the drop-\
pings of the wine at the offerings.\
Acerra, was  small box in which the perfume was kept.\
Enclabris, was the table whereon lay the sacred things; whence the utensils and\
other materials for the offerings, were called Enclabria. On this table they laid\
the beast to be offered, cut open and stretched out, carefully turning with  knife,\
and inspecting the entrals, to wit, heart, lungs, and liver, in order to prognosti-\
cate future events to the common and silly people. Piusanias reports, that the\
Gree\'e8s observed the same methods in their sacrifices.\
Cecespita, so called,  Secando, from cutting, was  pretty long knife, having\
 round ivory handle tipped with gold and silver, and studded with copper.\
With this they cut the victim\'92 throat.\
Struppi was  bundle of herbs, called Verbena, mixed with laurel, myrtle, and\
olive sprigs. They were of opinion, that these presaged happiness and prosperity\
in their offerings; they even used them in their purifications, silling also and\
making pillows thereof for their imagined deities.\
Aspergillum, or holy-water-sprinkle, was made of sprigs and leaves of hyssop,\
which in  marble vessel, called Labrum, they placed at the entrance of their\
temples (according to the present Romish custom) and with which they sprinkled\
the by-standers and congregation.\
They had divers other rites, which for brevity  shall pass over. What  have\
said is only to let artists see how diligently they ought to consult history, that by\
that means, they may in their productions follow antiquity in all its particulars,\
and so duly order and represent things, that lovers may say, with applause, no-\
thing is wanting. \

CHAP.  Of Statuary in general.\
 REwe proceed to the qualities and operations of Statuary, we shall, as an\
introduction, say somewhat of its antiquity.\
Baedalus, as famous for architecture as statuary, was of royal extraction. Cad-\
mus himself, to whom Thebes owes its rise, was  king\'92 son. As those sciences\
then\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
then take their origin from the ancient Gree\'ebs,  shall not trace their inventors\
down to the remains of the Ifraelites, nor to those who bestowed their art on the\
costly and magnificent temple of Solomon, the cherubins, and ornaments of the\
ark, or the vessels consecrated to worship : Scripture is so express in these things,\
that we must be convinced, these arts were also in great use at that time.\
The vast pains is knovn, which the Children of Seth took in engraving and\
transmieting to posterity their inventions and skill in astronomy on two columns,\
one made of baked clay, and the other of stone, in order that, that art, threaten-\
ed with destruction by the flood and violent waters, might remain intire to future\
ages ; and that after the flood, Prometheus, son of Japhet, was the first inventor\
of images, which has given rise to all the fables and fictions of the poets.\
The Assrrians and Chaideans had knowledge in statuary, as we gather from Laban\'92\
having houschold gods, which his daughter Rachel stole from him; and after-\
wards from the Jezys making  golden calf in the Wildernefss, by Mount Sinai,\
for worship.\
The heathens applied themselves to inquiries into arts, with very good success.\
Ninus son of Belus, in Scripture called Nimrod, the first king of Asspria, immortal-\
ized his father\'92 memory by building to his honour,  temple embellished with\
statues, and especially with the idol Baal, in order to be worshipped. The obe-\
lisks or pyramids, brought to Rome by Augustus out of Agypt, are standing evi-\
dences of the greatnefs of that people in their works.,\
The ancient statuaries instruct us in  thousand pretty inventions and circum-\
stances in history, which they unriddle ; teaching us the customs, worship, differ-\
ent dresses, arms, &. of the ancients : things very well worthy of our study.\
It is likewise not for want of judgment that the antique statues are proposed to\
us as the most perfect models of elegance and symmetry, because the age where-\
in Alexander lived, was the most perfect we know of for carry ing arts and sciences,\
through the emulation of that time, to the highest degree of perfection: in order\
to which, they began with Painting and Statuary, framing some patterns, from\
whence might be laid down certain and positive rules, not to be departed from,\
without spoiling order and beauty. The famous statuaries of those times there-\
fore employed their whole wits in prosecuting the work unanimoussy, and en-\
deavoured to make exact inquiries into the beauty of nature, and what shape\
and proportion the several parts of the body ought to have, in order to form\
thereout an intire perfect and harmonious whole : yet it being impossible for\
them to bring all the collected parts into one and the same object; they concluded\
to chuse the principal and most beautiful parts out of several bodies, in order to\
compose from them different perfect figures, to serve posterity for patterns and\
models.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAP. II. Of the Execution of Statuary.\
STATUARY is an imitation of Nature, performing its work by  strong mo-\
tion of the body and dexterity of the hands. It consists in the symmetry or\
exact division of the objects, according to the particular qualities, especially in\
human figure (wherein it most excels) and next in quadrupeds ; all relieved and\
conformable to the life.\
Its other performance concerns the bafs relief, or half round work, according\
to its different qualities, as we shall hereafter explain.\
The materials for statuary are of five sorts, and each of  particular nature and\
qaulity.\
The first is clay.\
The second, wax.\
The third, wood.\
The fourth, ivory.\
The fifth, stone.\
The two first are worked with wooden tools, and the rest with sharp irons; and\
each material requires  particular handling. From the first, something is taken\
off ; to the second, something is added ; in the third, is cutting; in the fourth,\
scraping; and in the last, driving, or thrusting, according te the nature of the\
matter, either soft or hard, solid, dry, or brittle.\
In an human figure or other creature, statuary first sketches its thoughts on\
paper, making choice of the most beautiful side, and then takes clay, and sets\
those conceptions upright, and as like the design as possible. The figure being\
now roughed out with the proper tools, or rather with the fingers, the life is set to\
the same posture, in order to finisn after it; and being brought to this forward-\
ness, the artist proceeds gradually round, till all sides are finished and nothing is\
wanting. The work standing in this condition for some time to dry, is afterwards\
baked in an oven, and then may serve as  model, for carving in marble or other\
matter.\
The esfence of this art lies in  beautiful form, and  neat or distinct represen-\
tation of the things we would make, whether human figures, beasts or other ob-\
jects; of which, the principal are figures and bafs reliefs.\
The first considers man, woman and child, of all ages ; as likewise portraits\
or busts.\
\
The second respects the horse, camel; elephant, lion, and other beasts. And,\
The last regards the peacock, eagle, raven, owl, and other such creatures oc-\
curring in this art; all requiring an exact knowledge.\
Seeing therefore that so many things are necessary to be understood,  think it\
of the last consequence, that the artist before he begin sculpture, be well acquaint-\
ed.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
ed with the grounds of drawing, and for two reasons; first, in hopes of honour\
and advantage; and secondly, for fear of prejudice and reproach. These two\
considerations always attend the master, and one of them unavoidably depends on\
his knowledge and performance. For as the work is of great consequence and\
charge, as well in the materials as tools, and slow procefs, so if it succeed well,\
it brings reputation and gain, otherwise, greater lofs and blame.\
Atrue artist ought not to be without the following Works, viz. The Statues\
of Perriea,-the lconology of Casar Ripa,--Oudaan\'92 Roman Might, and other\
hooks of antiquities; also the principal histories, but chiessy, Les Characteres des\
Passions, by Monsieur de la Chambre, and other authors on the same subject; together\
with those of dresses, and of beasts and other animals. And for practice, he\
ought to be furnished with plaister figures, bafs reliefs, medals, busts, hands and\
feet, lions and lionesses, sphinxes, terms, and manv other things, which are to\
be bought ; as likewise models of wax and clay, and on paper.\
CHAP. III. Of Bafs Reliefs.\
THAT  may proceed in an orderly manner,  shall begin with bafs reliefs,\
of which there are three forts, viz. almost relief, halt relief, and faint, or\
\
slat : and the difference of these ought to be well considered, as they have three\
particular intentions in their proportions or divisions.\
The first fort, or almost relief, is commonly used in deep niches, with figures\
in full proportion, having three grounds behind one another; the foremost figures\
are almost relief, the second half relief, and the third somewhat less.\
The second fort, or half relief, is used in shallow square niches, frontispieces,\
circular-headed upper doors, and niches.  This has two grounds or depths; the\
first is half-relief, and the second somewhat fainter.\
The third fort is proper for frizes, pedestals, balustrades,, and medals. This\
has but one depth, or  single figure on one ground.\
In their ordonnance, four things are to be observed.\
. That the principal figure of the work have its full relief, and those of the\
least consequence most faint, and sticking to the ground.\
 That the greatest motion and action of the figures be always in profile, yet\
without any fore-shortening of the members.\
 That the setting on of the projecting parts appear natural, not forced.\
 That the work be eqully divided and distributed every where alike, not too\
full in one part, and too empty in another ; which is  point of great importance.\
Although these bafs reliefs seem chiesly to concern statuaries, yet they as much\
affect painting, on account of the particular relation the two arts have to each\
other, in that, one cannot be perfect without the other. The statuary borrows\
from the painter the ordonnance or disposition for the ground of his work, which\
he\
\
\
\
\
\
\
he afterwards put in practice : the painter on the other hand, learns of the statu-\
ary the method of modelling, as necessarily serving for \'e0 foundation in the per-\
formance of bass-relief. Wherefore  think  painter cannot possibly paint \
good one, unless he understand something of modelling ; nor  good statuary give\
satisfaction, without having some skill in painting.\
 judicious master ought to be exact in ordering these bafs-reliefs, that each re-\
ceiving its proper light, all may appear distinct, and without the least alteration.\
Sun-fhine or sharp shades make things look otherwise than they really are, by the\
mis-shapen ground-shades which on these occafions are seen in nature; when the\
work being much raised, has many deep hollows.\
 large and universal light is most advantageous for the first fort, or al-\
most relief.\
 light somewhat more from the side is most proper for the second, or half\
relief; because it has but few risings, and the work is therefore more free from\
ground-shades. And,\
 direct side light is best for the third or fainter sort, as giving it great deco-\
rum and elegance, though it be almost without shade.\
\
This doctrine touching the light, may possibly seem strange to some, viz.\
that it ought to be governed by the bass-reliefs or pictures which are to stand or\
hang in it, according as they are more or less relieved. But we must conceive,\
that  proper light ought to be chosen for each sort of bass-relief, from this con-\
sideration, that the light is not equally good every where : here suits  bass-relief\
in  deep niche, there one less rising, and here again one that is quite flat; the\
one being thus lighted from -side, and the other fronting. Nevertheless, it must\
not be thought, that according to the make of the room, the disposition of the\
windows, and the places fixed for  niche on each side of the chimney, it is in our\
choice to have in one of those  bass-relief of three grounds, and in the other\
one of two grounds, or one ; because that which is nearest to the windows receives\
 more fronting light than the other: Wherefore they ought to be alike hollow\
and raised. By  proper light, we mean that the work must be so ordered, that\
each part according to its light, get  good decorum. For instance, in the for-\
mer niche where the figures are much raised, they cannot give such large ground-\
shades, since the light falls on them  little fronting, but it may happen in the\
other, where the light comes more from the side; unless you placed the figures\
which in one niche are on the right side, in the other on the left, thereby to pre-\
vent the superfluous shades, elegantly reconcile the difference of the lights.\
The bass-reliefs in shallow niches with two grounds, require as nice an obser-\
vation and the same conduct is necessary in frizes, pedestals, and medals.\
Many err in placing bass-reliefs in frizes of chimneys, on pedestals and over\
room-doors, even upon the breast-work of the chimney itself, setting there more\
than half relieved, nay, whole relicved figures; as  once saw an almost relief on\
 single ground in  chimney-frize. In my opinion, it is very- improper to in ake\
figures of nine inches length so very distant from each other, and so little drape-\
ried (sometimes  figure has scarce three or four folds) the work looking then,\
(to speak in painter-like terms) more like  smooth dead-colouring, or rather old\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
and worn out than new made, and fhould by right be exeouted as faint and fine\
again.  have observed that painters, in representing bass-reliefs in such places,\
avoid all large shades as much as possible, especially in frizes, pedestals, and other\
flats; it being in my opinion, very proper that those parts of architecture keep\
their flatness; and as all ornaments, viz. capitals, foilage, modilions, triglyphs,\
and the like, are in such case commonly performed neat and curious, so our\
figures ought likewise to be perfectly finished.\
Some keep too much to the great manner: but the smaller the things are, es-\
pecally within doors and near, the neater they must be : for without-doors the\
case is different, because they receive light from all sides, and are less set off, be\
they ever so much raised. Wherefore statuary joined to architecture, in such\
manner as it ought to be, is the business of  judicious artist, and for which no\
one is qualified without great practice.\
As this study concerns  painter as well as  statuary, Ishall shew the former in\
how many different manners  bass-relief may be painted : and seeing the most ex-\
peditious is always the beft,  snall lay down that which by experience  have\
found to be the best.\
First,  paint my cloth neat and even with such  colour as my bass-relief re-\
quires, whether white, grey, red, yellow, &. between light and shade, or in\
second tint. Drawing my ordonnance on this ground,  correctly and strongly\
trace it over with-black lead, and after rub it with  dry cloth that it may stick fast\
and refist the varnisn without muddling. Then Ivarnish it all over and proceed to\
painting; first the shade, and then the second tint against it, leaving the ground\
for the light, and uniting the shade with the second tint airily, without softening\
them with  fitch,  scumble the second tint, either with  finger or stif pencil in-\
to the ground. Then  take another tint, as dark as my model directs, and\
with it give  ground behind my figures, leaving the work on the right side with-\
out the least relief. Being to finish,  rub the whole work, or as much as  can do at\
once, with  lighter tint than the first ground, and so very thin and even, that\
every thing may appear through it; observing here, that the white must be very\
stiff, and thined only with turpentine. On this wet ground  clap my main lights,\
which then as well as the shades, will gradually unite with it, without touching\
each other.\
The second and third sorts may be easily finished up at once (the re-touching ex-\
cepted) as having neither ground-shades nor hollows; the method is this.\
My\
cloth being prepared as aforesaid, Ifirst heighten, scumbling the main light into\
the wet ground, which by the running of the turpentine oil, is become somewhat\
tacky :  do the same with the shade, leaving the ground in this condition for\
the second tint. If the work is to be very neat,  rub it over with  good varnisn\
mixed with some fat white oil, that it may not dry so soon, and that  may with\
ease, and as long as  please paint upon it, heightening on the most relieved parts,\
and giving dark rouches in the hollows, scumbling also here and there some smalt\
with  soft fitch, and some yellow in the reflexions of the shades. If the back-\
ground ought to be  little darker, now is the time for doing it, because then it\
will no more go in.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The last sort needs no other ground than the first; and it ought to be neat and\
clean ; because the light on one side, and the shade on the other, make the work\
relieve and rise sufficiently : yet let us observe, that as often as we paint or re-touch,\
it must be rubbed over with varnisn, or at least where necessary, to prevent it'\
going in : for such is the nature of varnisn, that it will bear but one painting;\
\'f4therwise the work sinks presently.\
We shall now shew what is to be observed in painting figures in dep niches; \
work not to be performed either with respect to the figures or ground-fhades,\
without due knowledge in perspective, whatever applause ignorants may get from\
those who do not understand it.\
His blunder was great, who painting  figure in  niche with  stick in his\
hand, shewed the ground shade of the stick very plainly on the hollow of the\
niche, but gave none to the leg which supported the body, save  little on the\
plinth next the foot. Most sad conductl Another simple young fellow, seeing\
his master paint  grey figure in  niche, and being told that the ground shade\
was of much importance, and ought also to correct, and being at the same time\
shewn the model it was painted by, went immediately and got  niche made: but\
for want of  figure he borrowed his master\'92, and set in the niche, tracing there-\
in the ground-shade with black lead ; agreeable to which he gave all his figures\
in what action soever the same ground-shade.\
Now it is certain, that things painted on firm places ought, that they may\
look natural, to have their proper ground-shades according to the relief; well ob-\
serving,  Whence they receive their light, fronting or sideways.  How far\
they are from the light, in order to determine; as one somewhat short, sharp and\
strong, as being near the light, and the others longer, fainter and more melting in\
proportion as they go off from it.\
As  furtherance to the artist,  shall treat somewhat ofthe painting on wood-\
den vases, urns, cisterns and the like, or on other smooth objects.\
As things painted on smooth objects, standing in large and wide places, can\
have no relief or projecture on the sides when seen fronting; so rising and project-\
ing ornaments, such as raised figures, lions-heads, festoons and the like, are ve-:\
ry improper and unnatural on them, unless being fixed and immoveable, they\
were seen but from one side; for then you may paint as strong and relieved\
things upon them as you please, avoiding the side going off, since the smooth\
roundneis of the figure does not admit it. The moveable objects which are\
used, and seen from all sides, must have  fronting light, and be painted vey flat\
or faint, and with no rising swells; and the ground of what colour soever it is, be\
laid in such  manner that what is painted on it, whether figure or other object,\
be set off by  dark tint in its out line, and this to be darker or lighter, as it\
ought to be more or less rounding : yet the main light must be somewhat strong-\
er than the ground.\
As to the colours, there are many which agree well together ; Lapis Lazulli in-\
laid with gold; also green serpentine with white, as marble or plaister; touch-\
stone, porphpry, agate and others. On wood of any sort suits ivory-work, pro-\
vided the former be not of too light  colour, like palm or olive-trec. In the\
uile\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
use of gold, it ought to be laid on such  tint as you think fit, so as it may be\
heightened with shel-gold on the most relieved parts, and afterwards varnished.\
In these countries (Holland) statuary is of small account. Little advantage is to\
be gained by marble or other stone : and though here and there in  garden or\
other place,  figure or child is to be made in free-stone, yet that is too trivial for\
 good master. But it is otherwise in Italy, where there are so many magnificent\
buildings, and mostly enriched with carving and statuary. In fine, that country\
is  land of promise to one who understands his business. He gets money and has\
the esteem of the great. On this account \'e0 statuary in our country ought to be\
somewhat acquainted with painting, as being obliged to make  virtue of neceffi-\
ty. Iknew one who for this reason applied so much to painting, that he chang-\
ed the stone into cloth, and his chisels into pallet and pencils : for, said he, Peo\'ac\
ple here will scarce pay for cloth, much less lay out so much money for  block\
of marble. It is certain they cannot always carry such heavy baggage along with\
them ;  speak with respect to those who hang their houses, galleries, halls or\
apartments with cloths, and cause them to be painted with statues and bass-reliefs,\
which at any time, in case of removal, fire, or other acidents, they may roll up, and\
hang in other rooms, which otherwise they could not do; at least it is better\
than to paint every thing on the walls themselves, as was the former custom;\
since this country is not like ltaly or France, where the painting in Fresco (as di-\
vers palaces and churches of some hundred years standing can testify) sufficiently\
pays for trouble and charges.\
CHAP. IV. Of the Force, Property, and Management of Bass-reliefs.\
THINK an artist ought never to be at  loss for matter in this point,\
either for the pencil or chisel ; because it is to be furnished not only from\
tne fables, emblems and bacchanals, but likewise from scripture.\
 have formerly in the Book of Ordonnance, proposedthe story of Judah and Tha-\
mar; which according to bass-relief management, is with little alteration, (as well\
as many others) very improper for it, when you would represent two or three\
grounds in the same piece, though that story require not so much depth: And how\
sine would such  bass-relief become the hall either of  Jeip or Christian; And if\
herein the servant and the country house were on  particular ground, how plain-\
ly would the matter appear, if naturally expressed ; For though many imagine\
that  bass-relief is in the same case with  medal, which tends only to commemo-\
rate this or that occurrence, or remarkable story, Imust entirely deny it, since in\
my opinion, the chief intention of the former is in an instructive manner, to serve\
for adorning  building; and\'92the plainer; more artful and intelligible, the bet-\
ter it is, especially when the choice of subject is our own, and we can go to the\
expence of it. Yet painted bass-reliefs ought, as well as  good picture, to have\
their\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
their property ; as the ancients (who brought this art to such perfection) have\
sufficirntly shewn in their sine remains, which are our best models.\
 agree with others, that without an exact observation and enquiry into antiqui-\
ty, and the comments thereon, which some ingenious men have left us, we\
ghould bealmost strangers to the hieroglyphic sense of the antique bass-reliefs;\
or many of them are so foreign and dark that we can scarce apprehend what the\
ancients would signify by them.\
We shall therefore make some remarks onthe long and small, yet sine bass-relief\
of Meleager killed by his mother, when she burnt the fatal wood. It is certain\
that this story is faintly represented; but in my opinion, the master has omitted\
the bustle and violent stir of Meleager\'92 body, in order to preserve the elegance of\
the action.  find it also not strange, that few can understand this story without\
some writing under it. We there see the Parcae, or three fatal sisters, but nothing\
of the mother; and though we suppose Diana to be present and mourning, yet\
that circumstance does not fully clear the meaning. Meleager should rather have\
had his hunting equipage and dogs by him, in order to point out his person and\
inclinations. And though the burning of the wood seem in some measure to ex-\
press the matter, yet  think it too neatly cut and smooth, and should be more\
like afire brand. But my greatest wonder is, at the absence of the mother Althea;\
she who was  principal person,  great princess, and acted this tragedy out of\
revenge, and seeing it is one of the greatest effects of  revengeful temper, to\
triumph in the presence of those who are overcome. Moreover we see no active\
passions rule in any part of the composition. Nor can  say who the woman sit-\
ting by him is, whether his mother, Diana, Atalanta, or who else :  cannot be-\
lieve she is his mother, because he seems to be as old as she. Moreover we do\
not perceive in him any motion of  person in pain. Nor can  apprehend\
the design of the face on the round board below on the ground, it not being \
medal for ornament, though doubtless placed there by the artist for some reason.\
Some think it represents rage or trouble, or else fire, because the hair seems to be\
flaming. But the matter might have been better expressed by  pressing of the\
eyes, strugling of the arms and legs, contraction of the nofe, mouth, fingers,\
and toes and the trouble and pain of the dying person ; whercas here we see no-\
thing like it; but contrarily he seems to die very quietly, as his arms lying close\
to his body at full length sufficiently shew. Besides it is against the rule of em-\
blems to admit of any aid, where the fact can be performed by the person himself,\
much less the addition of two or three figures to express the meaning, unless they\
be statues; such as tyranny with Nero, ambition with Alexander, valour with Scipio,\
and so forth.\
It is true that painters used formerly, before they were acquainted with ex pres-\
sing the pasfions in the face and gestures, to write them on scrolls proceeding from\
the figures mouths, that they might thereby be understood; but as artists are now\
more enlightened, it would certainly be very improper to set  cock or spur by \
man sitting or standing, in order to shew his industry, or  scul by another in order\
to shew that he is dead, &.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
By these observations it is apparent that our Meleager should rather have been\
known by  sine action and motion; since the chief end of  representation is to.\
exprefs naturally, and with energy the nature of the matter; and this may as well\
be done in bafs-relief as paintied, if the story require it. Nevertheless we must\
observe, that there are some passions which do not work externally, and ought to\
be expressed by additions, in order to make them intelligible ; such may be Cha\'ac\
rity, Mercy, Piety, Liberality, and the like: but Anger, Madness, or Rage,\
Pain, Smart, &. (which disturb the body as well as the mind, by irritating the mem-\
Lers) do not require emblematic figures or aditional explanations.\
CHAP. . Of the Draperies of Statues and Bass-reliefs.\
MONG the Greck statues we find none, but what seem to be dressed in one fort\
of stuff; and these are the models for  good statuary of painter to govern\
himself by. But  portrait, which is likewise an ornamental image, must never be\
like  statue or stone figure, though white and painted with  single colour; even\
were Ovid with his train of metamorphoses present. No fine disposition of folds\
is here the advantage: if the stuffs be not like those of the Gree\'e8s, they are not\
proper for stone, and seem lefs congruous with antiquity.\
Let us therefore not flatter ourselves, that we can make any improvements, by\
seeking new stuffs for our figures; nor rely too much on the dexterity of our hands,\
that how brittle soever the stones are, we can work them and perform any thing,\
even folds as thin as paper, small flying draperics, loose hair-locks hanging on\
 &. But rather imitate the Greeks, in the thinnefs, pliableness,\
and looseness of their draperies, that the beautiful sway of the moving\
parts be not obstructed, but plainly perceived under them; unless, in the\
case of old people, who because of their stiffness, may be dressed in coarse cloth;\
and yet not as seeming to be  mere dress without  body, but sitting close to it,\
so as to discover the principal parts, with the end hanging loosely down, not stick-\
ing out.\
Flying draperies have no place among statue, or bass-reliefs: and though the\
latter represent histories, yet such draperies are not proper in them, unless on the\
second or third grounds ; where then they may be fixed against the ground and\
be no hindrance.\
In  medal little relieved, or on urns or vases, where flying and running figures\
can be represented in all sorts of histories, we may freely make as many of those\
draperies as we please ; because as we said in the third chapter, the principal mo-\
tion ought always to be in profile, either on  single or second ground.\
 willingly allow the Gree\'e8s to be the inventors of loose draperies, as being the\
most easy ; but that therfore we may not, now statuary is arrived at such perfec-\
tion, make use of all sorts of stuffs (which is  thing possible) seems to me very\
strange : for it is certain, that all things through long practice improve, and we\
daily discover and sce what was formerly unknoyn. Besides there are few laws\
which\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
which are not capable of amendment or enlargement; and though, as the proverb\
says, Old people are seldom bettered by younger, yet it happens in some things, es-\
pecially in this art.  speak here of laws only by way of comparison. Pray ob-\
serve, how little the famous Bernini at Rome has tied himself up to the Greek an\'ac\
tiquities. By the force of his judgment he has surpassed them; he has gone\
such lengths, that it was indifferent what he met with, whether flying, running,\
lying, standing, naked, or drest figures : he did every thing, not like the Greeks\
in  stone like manner, but with-draperies slying, ruffling, and swinging, as if\
they were \'e0 live people; and those not twisted like guts, but with beautiful and\
broad folds, sometimes loose, at others set thick or thin, tenderly and agreeably\
worked as art requires. But what am  saying ; we need not go abroad for examples :\
What fine draperies has not the famous statuary Keyzer made , It is certain he did\
not merely follow the antique; thinking it below his character to beat the com-\
mon road : he sought the plas Ultra, in order to go beyond.\
Add to these the great master Francisco Qu\'ebnoy, whom  do not name as dis-\
commending others, by passing them by in silence, but as an excellent pattern\
for shewing us  way void of error and reproof: for by saying, that Bernini per-\
formed what the Gree\'e8s never did,  mean that he dressed his figures in thick and\
thin stuffs, in order to give them as it feeems more motion ; the draperies swing-\
ing, flying, and ruffling, according to the liberty allowed to any master who\
can perform it.\
It may possibly seem to some, that  am trampling antique glory under foot ;\
but  declare  have no such intention: though  know that if some persons had\
the option, either to be  Praxiteles, or Phidias, or  Dutch Keyzer, or Roman Berni-\
ni, they would chuse to be the last; and for this reason, that art has in these\
later ages, met with improvements unknown to antiquity. But after all,  must\
say in reference to the judgment  have made, that though it be in our choice\
ro represent any stuff we can perform, yet as long as we find none more beauti-\
ful, proper or fine than those which the Greeks have left us for examples,  think\
we ought to follow them. As to what is slying, swinging, blowing, or\
ruffling (which is very improper in statues, as we have said)  shall leave that\
point to Bernini, and not follow either Keyzer or Quellin: but were  to do that\
honour to any person, it would be to Francisco Qu\'ebnoy.\
But let me not by any means, persuade artists to imitate the particular manner\
of this or that master; for every one has the liberty of chusing for himself, and \
preserve minc. What  have advanced is only  whet for the judicious, by mak-\
ing further enquiries.\
It is  great fault in artists to fix their thoughts on  single part of  figure, such\
as an elegant neck, handsom shoulder, back finely muscled, or beautiful thigh which\
they work with the greatest application and pleasure, in order to give it  softness;\
and if that succeed well, they are perfectly charmed with it; insomuch that we\
may often perceive in what part their greatest delight lay. Hence it frequently\
happens, that the parts of the same figure are very unlike in goodness; and the\
hands and feet, nay sometimes the face bungled for the sake of  well finished\
back. It must be granted, that the principal parts are of the most importance ;\
yet\
\
\
\
\
\
\
yet we are not ignorant, how much the lesser can either set off or deform  beau-\
tiful figure. What is  fine naked with poor hands and clumsy feet, Why was\
Van Dyke so famous for his portraits, but for having as much regard to an hand as\
 face, To an expert workman it is indifferent, whether he cut  block of mar-\
ble, or make  model in clay ; save that the former requires more time.\
But after all, this choice of handling and neatness is of no moment, if the\
figure be not well set or designed, because the greatest perfection lies in  conjunc-\
tion of both. Wherefore it is certain, that if Phidias and Praxiteles had been\
masters of Bernini\'92 handling and elegance, and this last, the knowledge of the\
Grecks, all three would have deserved the greater praise.\
 as readily own as  take for granted, that art owes its defects to artists them-\
selves, as well in painting and statuary, as architecture ; proceeding not only from\
masters keeping their pupils ignorant of their principles, experiments, and secrets,\
but also from obstructing their advances in the art : for though it were weak-\
ness to think the ancients did not understand it, yet the decay must, as  imagine,\
be principally imputed to the rcason  have given : from whence arose another\
mischief, to wit, an indifference in pupils for further improvements, especially\
Accordingly none will at this time seek the old path of his predeces-\
in statuary.\
fors ; it is now overgrown, and become so uncertain as hardly to be found ; eve-\
ry man runs blind-fold over the heath, without knowing whether.\
We observe, that the Gree\'e8s have commonly made more naked figures than\
the Romans : which  can ascribe to no other cause, than  choice of objects -\
greeable to their inclinations, and  desire to display their skill in the compositi-\
on and symetry of the parts of the human body. In their statues, they rather\
chose to represent deities than men, and in their bass-reliefs, rather bacchanals\
and sacrifices than histories. The Romans on the other hand, desirous by\
their statues and bass-reliefs, to transmit the memories of their emperors to\
posterity, found themselves obliged that they might not go against history, to\
dress their figures in the mode of the times.\
We shall now consider the necessary observations in painting statues and bass-\
relicfs. It is certain, that they must be very neat and white, because such works\
in stone being both hazardous, troublesome, and costlv, were never undertaken\
before the artists had chosen fine blocks of marhle for that purpose. Wherefore\
we ought to take notice of the stones, and their kinds.\
Light marble is various, one fort entirely white, another bluish,  third flesh-\
colour, &. being thus either in nature, or changed through time. They are\
all good when free from spots or eyes, and appear well against proper grounds.\
For this reason we see, that the ancients represented the best and most remark-\
able histories either in copper or white marble; as many remains on palaces,\
temples, honorary arches, columns, pyramids, tombs, &. can witnefs. single\
white has also this advantage above the coloured paintings, that it does not soon\
change, and when it fades, as marble itself is not free from it, it is all of  colour.\
The use of it is certainly attended with much less trouble, and not less natural in\
colours : moreover, we may sooner find ten masters for this sort of painting, than\
three for colours ; because it is but  single part of the art, and remains always\
the\
\
\
\
\
\
\
the same and without alteration; whereas the case of colours is quite different.\
The grey paintings represent only  wall, or piece of stone work, but the co-\
loured ones shew the life itsels, seen as through  window : wherefore the grey\
can neither recreate nor serve for particular pictures of delight ; nor can be of fur-\
ther use than in the places where they are set for ornament, of which they make\
but  small part; and were any thing else to be placed there, it would be but of\
the nature of the stone, and not please like  coloured picture. It is even in the\
the same case with  field in summer and winter. The north wind deadens and\
greys it, and the summer revives and makes it look green again, feeding the ve-\
ry soul with its variety of flowers.\
The white marble has  particular colour and tenderness; as may be perceived\
in the mixture of colours : wherefore it is of great moment to suit it well to its\
ground.\
Between grey stone it ought only to be tempered with white and black, and\
softened with light or yellow oker; but between reddisn or porphiry stone, with\
 little vermillion or Indian red, somewhat upon the flesn-colour, and this in\
shade as well as in the second tint. If you learn this colour from the life, vour\
work will have the utmost agreeableness.\
CHAP. VI. Of the Attitudes of Statues.\
DESIDES, the draperies of statues, something is to be observed touching their\
sways and postures ; which is apoint of the greatest consequence : where-\
\
fore we shall in the first place shew what statues are; next, whether they will admit\
of any other variety than what the Gree\'e8s have assigned ; in the third placc,\
whether those which since their times have been in use, are reckoned as good; and\
lastly, whether it be not more adviseable to follow the antique and good ones,\
than to seck after new and less good.\
Amidst the infinity of motions incident to nature in general, it is observed, that\
everv man has one particular to himself, and peculiar to his temper, one bustling,\
another slow, and  third between both: and this distinction cannot but be ob-\
vious, even to  man of small understanding, since from thence, and  propen\'ac\
sity for company like ourselves, proceed either our love or aversion for this or that\
person or their actions. And if this be granted, we may be assured that the an-\
cient masters (especially the Greeks, who was so famous for wisdom) nicely ob-\
served all those motions, as well the internal as external, and expressed\
them in their several works. Wherefore it may then perhaps be inferred, that no-\
thing in this particular remains for the improvements of after ages. But let me\
ask, Why we should not as well make use of our abilities and judgments in or-\
der to go forward; lthink we may, in other things especially; but passing by\
what is already done, we shall proceed to inquire what  statue means and\
signifies.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
 statue represents an idol in human shape : an idol  say, with respect to its\
origin and use, and (as far as statuary is concerned) formed after the best propor\
tion, either in gold, silver or other metal, and dexterously worked by the hand\
and judgment of the artist. The uses of these are to be set in temples, courts,\
palaces and other public places, but especially to adorn architecture. We find\
them as well in scripture as fables: for instance, in Mordecai, when royally ar-\
rayed he was led on horseback by Haman through the city. Also in Christ, when\
exposed by Pilate to public view.\
We likewise find matter for statues in profane, even recent stories : as for in-\
stance, in the late king William and queen Maty, of blessed memory, moulded\
from the life, and set up in the temple of honour, and such like. None of\
these pieces shew either active, passionate, or violent motions, but plain or grave,\
and majestic, suitable to the dignities of the persons they represent, and which\
we ought to consider as gentlemen or ladies, who standing at the doors or win-\
dows to see and be seen by the people are serious and without motion. Whence\
the proverb seems to arise, ec He stands like  stone figure, or block.\'92 or, like \
dumb and lifeless person.\
We shall therefore consider two sorts of statues, the unactive and the moving-\
The unactive are such as stand singly in niches and on frontispieces, and the mov\'ac\
ing or bustling are those which are seen in groups of two or three, on pedestals,\
triumphal arches, and fountains.\
Now it is certain, that these two sorts of statues must needs have particular pur-\
poses, and therefore particular places : for the former are seen from  single stand,\
for which they are properly made, and the latter are to be viewed round about\
from all sides. But of this we shall say more in the next chapter.\
As to this latter fort of statues, they receive not their appellations from the\
persons they represent, but from the actions they performed, or the misfortunes\
they underwent : an hetein lies the main point, since without them the persons\
singly of themselves would not be known; as in the stories of Seneca, Petus, Lao-\
coon, Pyramus and others: and these occurrences or accidents must be but once,\
and on one occasion attributed tothem. Suppose any ofthese persons were to berepre-\
sented by  fingle statue, as Laocoon with  serpent, Pyramus with  sword, &.\
What difference would there be between one who once committed such an act,\
or bore such  calamity, and one who in his life-time, had gone through  thou\'ac\
sand accidents, as Hercules, Theseus, Achilles, Hector, and many others who are re-\
presented by one statue , Wherefore we may easily conceive, that the ancients\
have in every respect so firmly fixed and orderly disposed their postures, that\
there is no room left either for alteration or addition. Besides we see that no ad-\
ditions of the modern masters are like the antique, either in quality or goodness,\
as is evident in the works of Quelin, Keyzer, Bernini, and many others, who\
made no distinction between statues and statues.\
IfI seem here to contradict myself, because having in the preceeding chapter\
set forth those three great masters almost above antiquity,  now place them be-\
low it, let it be observed, that  am speaking of statues, not of bass-reliefs; for\
herein they have neither excelled nor been equalled to antiquity in the beauty,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The ancients in their statues, had in view thr\'e8e principal conditions and natures\
of men; the gay, the heavy, and the moderate : the gay are active, full of fire,\
and slender like the Apollo; the second are melancholy, slow and listless, like the\
Antinous; and the third sort is of  composed temper between both, as the\
Mercurius radians, which recieves its light from below. All these were etched by\
Perrier. We also commonly observe, that the active and airy are seldom long\
without motion, now standing on one leg, then on the other : accordingly the\
ancients represented such  person standing on one leg, resting little or nothing on\
the other foot, but being to exhibit an indolent voluptuous melancholy one, like\
Antinous, we may plainly discover how heavily he stands on one leg and yet rests\
on the other foot, his belly sticking out, head hanging down, and hips excessive-\
ly rising. The contrarities of these two figures are worthy of remark ; one seems\
to fly, and the other to be sinking into the earth. As to the expression of the\
chird figure. (which is  mean between the two forts aforesaid) he as  well tem-\
pered person, is made standing firm on his legs, looking thoughtfully down with-\
out any turn, not too fiery or easy, nor too much sunk ; one hip,swelling  little\
more than that of Apollo, and somewhat less than that of Antinous, and though rest-\
ing on one leg, yet appearing more firm than the one, and more airy than the\
other,\
Now as the ancients knew how to divide those three different bodies so very\
nicely, according to their natures and action, so we need not question but they\
handled all their other figures in the same manner:  speak in reference to their\
qualities, as  still-standing Bacchus, Mars, Hercules, Saturn, &. Even the wo-\
men, goddesses, and nymphs not excepted; all which proceed either in  great-\
er or less degree from the the three standards before mentioned : this truth is evi-\
whether in models or prints. Let us then not imagine, that we are able to invent\
new actions for our statues, or others than those which are already found, much\
less that they should be better and more proper; but rather employ our thoughts\
more advantageoussy on other things, and in the mean time implicitly follow the\
ancients in  study so noble, and in which they took so much pains.\
The main point lies in the beautiful sway of  statue, well expressed according\
to the quality, condition, nature and intention of it. But hereby  mean not,\
that we are obliged to imitate the actions and postures of the ancients, without\
the least deviation; contrarily, every man has the liberty of excercising his inge-\
nuity :  propose their works only as patterns which  have always followed, and\
would have others do the same, without fear of being therefore called copyists, or\
their works copies. Such  moderation  think even very commendable, since\
the fable of lcaius teaches us, that high-flyers have often great falls; or, by avoid-\
ing Scylla, they get into Charybdis.\
There still remains . necessary remark, touching the explanatory additaments\
of statues; and to be brief,  shall shew their natures in three particular statues,\
and chuse out of many, the stories and figures of Lucretia, Dido, and Thisbe, among\
the women. Those of the men may on the same foot be easily apprehended.\
 re-\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
 represent these three women with daggers in their hand, to denote that they\
fell by those weapons.\
Lucretia is grave and majestic.\
Dido haughty and proud. And,\
Thisbe very plain and city-like.\
 exhibit Lucretia thus because she was  noble Roman lady, who being ravish-\
ed by Sextus Tarquinius, in discontent stabbed herself with  dagger. Now to\
make this known,  round shield or board, with the ravisher\'92 head thereon, is\
standing or lying at her feet, and on her right side lies  dog to point out her\
faithful love. On the pedestal appears the whole fact.\
The second,  queen of great spirit, has likewise  dagger, because on being\
deceived, she in spite and rage killed herself. The figure of Aneas  place near\
her, and on the other side  sparrow as the emblem of wanton love.\
But Thisbe, in honourable affection moved, or rather deceived, by Pyramus\'92\
imaginary death, stabbed herself for pure love and despair; as being unwilling to\
survive her lover. Near her on one side stands the figure of Pyramus, and on the\
other two turtles. Underneath these two latter appears the fact itself, as in the\
first.\
These  think sufficient examples for further representations ; as having shewed\
the difference in three, which are almost conformable to each other.\
CHAP. VII. Of the placing of Figures upon Pedestals, Frontispieces, in\
Niches, and other Places.\
YTis evident that statuary has  dependance on architecture, and is regulated\
by it : and as figures adorn and give life to  landscape, so statuary embel-\
sishes and makes architecture look grand.  good landscape painter know what\
objects are most proper for an ordonnance, and what forms they must have, whe-\
ther crooked, strait, standing, sitting, to the left or right, in order to produce\
decorum, as we have shewed in the chapter touching irregular objects: and  fkil-\
ful architect ought to be as well acquainted with the method of setting off his\
work with figures, bass-reliefs and other ornaments according to rule, that it may\
thereby become not only magnificient and elegant, but we may plainly perceive,\
it must be so and not otherwise. He should also know, why some figures ought\
to face, and others look from each other; why these must swell or rise outwardly,\
those be upright or sitting, &.\
Upon this account, the statuary ought rightly to understand the architect\'92 in-\
tention, ere he proceed to work ; as also what figures he is to make naked or\
cloathed, be they of men, women or children, on what side they ought to rise or\
swell, and how bent; and from what side seen, and whether they must stand\
high or low, and so forth. Being apprised of these particulars, he is then to exe-\

cute his thoughts in finding, according to those sways, fine actions, graceful mo-\
tions and elegant draperies, from whence may arise  general decorum. Thus\
much as to these two active sisters.\
In relation to the third, to wit, painting, which embraces them both, as\
needing their aid,  niust say, that it makes the elegancies of architecture and\
statuary, whether in history or landscape its chief study, so  judicious painter\
ought, for adorning his architecture with figures, bafs reliefs, &. to be tho-\
roughly acquainted with them, that he may naturally exprefs them with shade and\
colour; even so much as thereby to correct the inevitable mis-shapes still to be ob-\
served in nature.\
It is unaccountable, that among so many good architects, statuaries, and pain-\
ters, so few have understood the right placing of statues : they sometimes hit it,\
but not upon certain principles. Wherefore we shall endeavour to clear the point in\
few words and three sketches, hoping that no offence will be taken at my adapting\
the matter also to painting, since it has so near  corcern therein.\
As there is nothing in nature without imperfection, so in the use of things we\
ought to proceed with judgment, in order to chuse the best for the satisfaction of\
our own eyes, as well as those of the knowing and lovers.\
In the placing of statues in architecture, the same regard must be had wherever\
they stand or sit.  speak not of painting alone, but what generally concerns both\
the arts ; statuary in the first place and afterwards painting. See plates LXV.\
and LXVI.\
Behold the sketch in plate LXV. with attention, and my orderly disposition of\
the statues in different places, sufficiently to evidence in the regularity of my\
scheme to any one who has  mind to try the contrary.\
Here you are only to observe the out-lines of couples or pairs of figures, and\
their postures against each other; for  single figure acts for itself, but  pair or\
couple of figures shews the result of both.\
 have formerly asserted, what constitutes  beautiful action, namely,  good\
turn of the members and motion of the head, arms, hands and feet.\
The first example chiefly concerns statuaries, who, by observing that position,\
will shew that they understand it, and are able to order and make large things as\
well as small.\
The second example respects painters, though it be the same as the former, in\
reference to the out-line; but with respect. to shade, when we are confined to \
single and fixed light, we ought to chuse  proper and advantageous one, that the\
out-line, as our principal purpose, may thereby maintain its force, and produce\
the effect and decorum we desire, as you see here with its opposites.\
We have formerly said, that the out-line without the shade is of no effect; and\
that  beautiful action and out-line may lose their force, and the gracefulnefs be\
spoiled by an improper light; which mis-shape is very visible in sharp and broad\
lights, and more disagreeable than in stirring figures.\
The third example concerns those who paint figures, bafs reliefs and other or-\
naments, either in white, red, yellow or other coloured marble or stone. Here,\
as in\
observe not only the out-line, as in the first example, or the same shaded,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
the second, but likewise the colour of the stone, as well in the shade as light: \
say, especially in the shade, because therein appears the greatest variety, either by\
Another of our positions has been, that all objects retain their natural beauty in\
the shade, unless they receive reflexions from ocher things; likewise that white is\
the most susceptible of it, and by its cleanness, easily receives whatever colour it\
meets with. Consider also the great difference between the closeness and solidity\
of marble, and the thinness and transparency of linen. In the third example vou\
will find that white marble, not without reason, produces yellow or russet shades;\
wherefore you ought carefully to consult Nature, in order to imitate her with\
knowledge.\
But to return to the first example, let us observe how two opposing figures ap-\
pear in their out-line. First, upon the frontispiece where these two figures swell\
outwardly, the faces either regarding or turning from each other, and the arms\
the same; and the middlemost strait, without swell and fronting; and those on the\
outsides also with little or no turn, as being seen only forward : secondly, the\
two figures on each side of the steps likewise swell outwardly, yet more turning\
than the others, because being also seen sideways, they ought to be beautiful\
from three sides: thirdly, the foremost figure may have as much turn and action\
as you please, and be good quite round : fourthly, the figures in the niches are\
fronting without the least turn or stir, and the greatest swell is forwards. It is\
also very probable for the men to stand below and the women above ; because the\
woman tapers upwards, and thefore is more disappearing and uniting with the air;\
which in architecture has  fine effect. For this reason they formerly oftentimes\
set small pyramids on the tops of houses, instead of figures.\
The uppermost figures against the sky look best naked, because of their airi-\
nefs; those in niches must be massy and drest, and those below on the balustrade\
half drest. Thus much as to thefirst fketch.\
The second example shews the method to be used when it happens, that the\
shade causes  visible deformity on the swelling part of  figure, as to help it by\
the disposition of an arm, bit of drapery or hand ;  mean, in  painting where\
the light remains always the same, and to which statuaries are not tied, especially\
in the open air, because the light continually alters, but in  painting not; for as\
things are painted they stand. This remark is worth noth ing as well in stirring\
as still figures.\
In the third sketch,  exhibit \'e0a standing figure in  nich, and between them \
bass viol, supposed to be of vellowish or russet wood ; which colour, because the\
figure is of white marble, gives strong reflexions. On the side we see another\
figure between the greens ; and  third lying on the ground surrounded with the\
air: in all three  have one and the same intention, viz. to shew the cause of the\
mixture of the shades, otherwise, the figures will sometimes seem to be made of\
two forts of stuff, as the light parts white, and the shades of some other colour.\
 due observation of this enables us to answer for what we do.\

Although now by these pofitions about the stirring actions,  seem to contradict\
former ones, namely, that in painting or carving statues, we ought to give them\
but little turn, yet in fact  do not :  speak there only touching  single figure ;\
whereas here are many in company, and those set upon pedestals, fountains, and\
the like places, where they are seen from all sides, which creates  difference as\
well in their natures as circumstances.\
IfI am taxed with presumption for taking upon me to place figures, and set\
naked ones and women above, and men with those which are dressed below.  an-\
swer, that my conduct is founded on architecture, which intimates that the five\
Orders are peculiar to five different conditions of men, as Polyphemus, or the giants\
for the first order; Mars, as robust or masculous, for the second ; Apollo, for his\
slendernefs, for the third; Diana, or Venus, as womanisn, for the fourth; and lris\
or Cupid for the fith. This consideration will  think, as well embolden as\
justify me,\
To conclude this chapter, Ishall touch on heads, hands, and feet, because \
have found both here and in other parts, painters as well as statuaries very imper-\
fect in them, as if of less consideration than bodies.\
Some statuaries do not sufficiently vary their faces, making little difference be-\
tween youth and age, giving also much into the modern way of affectation and\
exaggeration,  mean  kind of fondness in artists for  particular manner ; as to\
make the eye-lids of their figures too large, which causes an heavy look ; and to\
cut the dimples on each side of the mouth and the hollows of the nose and neck,\
too deep seemingly shewing the fatness of women : whereas, they ought rather to\
be somewhat more expressive in the muscles; since, according to the turn of the\
head, those rise more or less, especially in thin and aged people:  speak only\
of giving  variety to the look and breasts : for, faces must not be always alike\
grave and lofty; there must be wanton ones as well as modest, large featured as\
well as tender, suitable to the bodies; the case is here the same with the neck and\
breasts, some are growing, others full grown.\
Much is to be observed about the make of the hands, and set of the feet, es-\
pecially when naked and without sandals; but the matter lies most in ordering the\
toes. The three foremost ought to be the longest, and close, turning out more or\
less with the tread of the feet ; whereas some turn them in, the great one lying\
strait with the foot, and the rest against it, which looks very uncomely. See the\
examples in plate LXVII. and the difference between them, of which the two up-\
permost shew the unseemliness, and the three others the elegance  speak of. And\
though many have casts of beautiful womens hands for constant use, yet these\
(as has been said of faces, breasts, &. ) cannot upon all occasions serve for the\
difference of the sexes ; for women have thicker and more tapering fingers, and\
smaller nails than men, who, according to theirbuik and age have more rising\
knuckles than women.\

CHAP. VIII. Of the Usefulness of Modelling.\
HAVING, in the second chapter touched upon modelling, which is  prac\'ac\
\
tice of great concern to  curious artist,  shall here deliver my further\
thoughts about it.\
The making models, whether in clay, wax, or other soft matter, is both use-\
ful, delightful, and necessary for  statuary as well as painter, indeed, for all\
who endeavor at any perfection in the art; for by this practice (in reference to the\
relief of things we are to represent, whereby it seems alvvays to have life itself)\
we obtain  firmness, and at the same time  bold handling. It disburthens our\
thoughts, and makes such lastings impreffions on the mind, that we need not be\
at  loss about the lifc. We must be sensible of the great advantage arising from\
it, because we can model in the aforesaid bodies, bais reliefs, foliage, and other\
ornaments from the antiquities, on all sorts of objects, as altars, vases, difhes,\
candlesticks, cisterns, &. and then paint them with such colour as we please;\
also gild or bronze them, according to the use we would put them to. By the\
same means we may have store of elegant sword hilts and helmets, Greek as well as\
Roman, to serve any occasion. In short,  good modeller can help himself out of\
any difsiculties. Therefore, let me advise you to fall bodily to work, and make\
bass reliefs, sphinxes, tombs, vafes, or any thing else necessary in the art. You\
may likewise get small wooden dishes and pots of divers kinds turned, and prettily\
adorn them with wax imagery of satyrs faces, playing children, dancing nymphs,\
&. Tliese things may be used in any manner of painting, whether the picce be\
sun-shine, or moon or candle-lights. If you would go further, you can divert\
yourself with modelling medeals in wax, and oblige  friend with  cast of -hem-\
Many of the most famous masters have practised modelling, as sufficiently ap-\
pears in their works. The truth is, we can make any thing we want, even what\
no body else has, and is no where to be purchased, to paint after, as from the\
lise itself.\
 shall say little of the method for making models, because it is very common,\
and every man has his own way : wherefore shall consine myself to flat bafs\
reliefs.\
Having sketched my design on paper, as large or small as  would model it,\
and neatly worked it up with lights and shades,   board painted with the\
same colour and tint as my design, and with  point trace it thereon, and sill these\
out-lines with wax or clay more or less raised, as occasion requires: then  work\
the stufffirst with singers, afterwards with  toothed tool, and lastly with  wet\
pencil in order to make it smooth and even ; which being done, and the board\
placed in the same light as our pictures are tostand or hang in, it serves for  mo-\
del to paint after. If now we are to introduce it in our pieces, whether in land-\
scape, frizes, shallow niches, &. it must be set either fronting or sloping, in\
such  light and at such  height as the point of sight directs. But if it be  bass\
relief,\

relief, more raised, the point of sight is placed in the middle of the piece : and\
though the raised parts on the extremities will then of course happen to jump over\
the out-line, even sometimes over other figures, according to the lengths of the\
pieces, as in  frize and such like. , to prevent that inconvenience, make use\
of more thanone point of sight.\
CHAP. IX. Of the visual Decorum of  Statue, with its Pedestal, as\

 find that the grace of the posture and sway of  fine statue arises only from\
\
 contrast in its outlines, from top to bottoni, affecting not only the\
(\
figure, but also the pedestal ; with this difference, notwithstanding, between na-\
ked and cloathed figures, that an ornamented pedestal gives the former greater\
elegance than  plain one Yet this latter fort likewise produces  fine effect, by\
observing, that the swells or scrolls of mens pedestals ought to be at bottom, and\
those of women on top, the course of which causes  contrast both in the forms and\
sexes. Sce plate LXVIII.\
If now it be afked, in the case of placing two naked figures together, viz.\
 man aud  woman, as Diana and Apollo, Venus and Adonis, &. whether the pe-\
destals ought then to be represented so unlike ; My opinion is, that they must\
not, as being contrary to rule and order. If both figures be men, the pedestals\
ought to swell at bottom; if both women, on top, and if  man and  woman,\
both ought to be plain. If there be  woman between two men, the side pedes-\
tals must be plain, and the middle one particular to itself, and the contrary.\
Plain pedestals, though bearing drest figures, vases or busts, suit not between\
two columns or pilasters, at least they ought to hollow in, not swell out.\
The height of  vase, placed between two figures, must not exceed three fourths\
of that of the figures, inclusive of the pedestal, that is, up to the breasts,\
and nohigher.\
 bust, with its pedestal, should not rise above man\'92 height, the pedestal not\
swelling out, but the contrary, as in the examples.\
Where two vases and  bust are placed in  garden between two figures, the\
outward pedestals ought to be of the same height with-the middlemost and plain ;\
the two others must hollow in or swell out according to the course of the vases, and\
be  third or half lower, yet retain the same breadth with the others.\
 vase twice as high as broad, and running up straight, ought to have \
square swelling pedestal. The contrary will produce the same decorum.\
If  bust stand between two vases, they must be level with the shoulders of the\
figure. The contrary is also good, provided the pedestal be somewhat bigger,\
and suited to the course of the vase.\

CHAP. . Of the Ornaments of the Frontispiece of Temples, Houses, &.\
 TOTHING can properly be done in statuary or painting, without due re-\
flexion :  speak not only of the manner and handling, but also with re-\
ficct to the circumstances of things. Even  good building may abate of its\
lustre, by  bad choice in the outside ornaments. Wherefore, w\'e9 shall shew what\
ought to be done in this point, by what follows.\
The Ornament on the Temple of\
Jupiter, should be an eagle grasping thunder.\
Mars,- Some warlike instruments, as armour, helmet, shield, sword, arrows,\
and standards.\
Phaebus, - sun in the center of the zodiac, with the twelve signs.\
Pallas,Medusa\'92 shield, and an helmet adorned with  standing owl, or lying\
spinx.\
Diana,Dogs, bow and arrows, and above them  moon.\
Ceres,-  plough, with ears of corn, and  fickle.\
Bacchus,-Two tygers,  thyrsis twined with vine leaves, and bunches of\
grapes.\
Mercury,-  winged cap on  Caduceus.\
Vulcan,An anvil, with hammer and pincers thereon.\
Vesta,-An oblation bowl, out of which proceeds  flame in the middle of \
cireling serpent.\
Cybele, -\'97 castle or key between two lions.\
The Ornaments on the House of \
Senator, consul, or magistrate, should be, the Fasces, and in the middle,\
thunder.\
Learned man or philosopher,- spinx with  burning torch, and also some\
books.\
General,- shield, with  griffin represented thereon, likewise  club and lions\
skin.\
Merchant,\'97 bale of goods,  pair of scales, and  yard measure.\
Phyfician,\
\'97The figure of Asculapius, and  staff twined with  serpent.\
Painter, monkey with pallet and pencils.\
Shepherd,- crook, with  scrip and flute hanging to it.\
Fisherman,--Some nets, ropes, rushies, and fishes.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The Ornament on an\
Hospital, should be Charity or Compassion, with the founder\'92 or town\'92 armis.\
Prison,All sorts of frightful instruments, as irons, chains, ropes, &.\
House of correction,-- Thefigure of Education, holding the bridle of  tamed\
beast which goes before her.\
All the Arts, as painting, arithmetic, architecture, &. may be expressed by\
figures.\
It is certain, that the design of temples, built in honour of the gods, was to\
place their figures in them for worship, either with prayers or sacrifices. Where-\
fore it is  great fault in ignorants to place without, in frontispieces or niches,\
what we ought to seek within those buildings, as may be seen in the temple of\
Diana at Ephesus, Apollo at Dolphos, Jupiier at Dodone, and many others, where the\
figures all stand without them.\

CHAP. . Of Still Life in general.\
HAVING thus far treated of the power and dignity of the noble art of paint-\
ing, together with the lustre and advantage accruing to those who tho-\
\
roughly consider and put it in execution, we shall now for the sake of weak\
capacities, proceed to Still Life, or immoveable and inanimate things ; such as\
flowers, fruits, gold, silver, stone, musical instruments, dead fish, &. and shew\
which\
\
\
\
\
\
\
which are the best and of most advantage. These may in their turns serve for ma\'ac\
terials for  natural composition wherewith to please all sorts of men, the great\
as well as the little, the learned as ignorant. Wherefore out of many, we shall\
fix on the following olijects, as the most beautiful, elegant, and agreeable.\
Flowers.\
.\
 Fruit,\
 Gold, silver, and other rich things.\
 Mufical instruments.\
These four forts, artfully ordered and performed, may serve for the ornament\
of halls and cabinets as well as the best paintings, provided they have  proper\
light and hang together. But we must know in the first place, what constitutes \
good still life piece, since though it be naturally handled, nothing but  good\
choice can charm the senses, and-bring fame to the master. It is weakneis to\
think that faded flowers should please, much less in  picture : Or, who would\
have  piece of ordinary unripe or rotten fruit in his best room, and among \
cabinet collection, seeing the life itself is so disagreeable ; Such rubbish  did for-\
merly admire; but, as they only shew the deformities of nature,  have no ap-\
petite to view them any more. But, to return to the subject.\
My opinion is, that the beauty and goodness of  still life consists only in the\
most choice objects : \'92say the most choice; as among flowers, the most rare\
and beautiful, and the same in fruits and other things. These will gain the maf-\
ter credit, especially with the addition of some particular significations proper to\
them. It is not probable that wealthy people should be delighted with old-\
fafhiioned plate and furniture, when they can have every thing more beautiful and\
elegant; and, as improbable, that judicious lovers of music should be pleased\
with the modern lyre, dulcimer, or bag-pipe. As for cabages, carrots, and tur-\
nips, as likewise cod-fisn, salmon, herrings, smelts, and such like, which are\
poor and mean ornaments, and not worthy of any apartment; he who is pleased\
with them may seek them in the markets.  as little approve of horse furniture\
and hunting equipage; though these latter with wild boars, stags, hares, phea-\
sants, partridges, and other fowls, depending on princes and noblemens fancies,\
are more tollerable.\
Having- thus in general touched on still life, let the judicious determine\
which sort is best and most advantageous cither to the painter or purchaser.\
As for me,  think eloquence very charming to the ear; but goodness alone\
makes beauty aimable. What is  fine flower, apple, gold cup, or well tuned\
violin, without good smell, delicate taste, proper use, and agreeable sound ?\
Goodness  say, ought to be perfectly apparent : the smell, taste, hearing, or sound\
cannot be painted; but may be in some measure expressed by occult fignifications,\
either in bass-relief by fables, hieroglyphics, or emblematic, figures, or by ma\'ac\
ny other things, if the will be not wanting.\
As to the nature and property of the plices for still life, they are two-fold,\
close and open; the one representing it as if hanging against  wall or wainscot,\
and the other as lving on  bench or table, or on the ground.\
We also suppose, that no objects used in still life ought to be represented less\
than the life.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
It is likewise improper, and against the nature of still life, to introduce, in any\
of the before-mentioned choices, coloured back-works, or vistos, either close or\
open; that is, landscape, architecture, or any kind of living cr\'e9atures, which\
would spoil the very name of  still life : moreover, it is difficult, if not im-\
possible, for such  painter to hit every thing; and granting he can,  yet ques-\
tion whether he would be pleased with the title of  still life painter.  say, then,\
that the depth of the picture is only to be represented by an hanging curtain, or\
 bass relief of wood or stone, of such  colour and tint, as best suits the general\
decorum; th\'e9 one darkish, and the other somewhat lighter. With Flowers, \
dark grey back ground suits better than  white, yellow, or red one. With Fruit,\
white and grey marble, but not yellow or red : yet, as  fine bass relief requires\
more sxill than  flower or fruit, and such like, you may, instead thereof, in-\
troduce  niche, with  god or goddess\'92 bust therein, proper to the subject;\
as  Flora, Pomona, Bacchus, Apollo, Diana, or others, according to the intent\
of your design, and as you would have it bear either  particular or general\
meaning, which each of those sigures will supply in abundance. Flowers are\
various, and, like fruits, may be divided into three sorts, to wit, the Spring,\
Summer, and Autumn; and having different qualities, are fit for many fine and\
uncommon designs, in conjunction with bafs reliefs or busts, as  have said, with\
this caution, that with slowers suit no fruit, but ears of corn, as being airy and\
pliable ; but among fruits may be some flowers, especially such as alude to\
rest and mirth; as poppies and rofes. And yet these agree best with grapes,\
either in garlands or festoons.\
Let us now, for exercise and improvement in this point, observe what the\
learned say. The white lilly is sacred to Juno; turnsol to Apolbo; the rose to\
Venus ; Diana and Somnus claim the poppies; Ceres, the corn-flowers; Juno, the\
pomegranates ; Bacchus, the fig-tree and vine; Ceres, or lsis, the peaches and\
ears of corn ; Venus and Apollo, the apples; Ops, or Mother Earth, every thing\
she produces throughout the year. Of instruments, the lyre is dedicated to\
Apollo, Mercury, and the Muses; the flute, to Pan and Venus; the trumpet, to\
Mars, &.\
CHAP. II. Designs for Bass Reliefs proper to Still Life.\
TITH flowers fuit Zephyrus and Flora, or Venus and Adonis, in\
\
courtship.\
With fruits, Ceres and Pomona, or Pomona and Vertumnus. With grapes,\
Bacchus and Ariadne and merry bacchanals; and if there be mulberries among\
them,  sleeping Silenus, with the nymph Agle, is most agreeable.\
With musical instruments, Apollo and the nine Muses ; Orpheus playing, or Arion\
on the dolphin. With.  timbrel, cornet, and cymbal,  bacchanalian sacrifice,\
feast, or dancing.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
To the three seasons, as Spring, Summer, and Autumn, in one piece, we may\
apply Venus, Ceres, and Bacchus sitting together, according to their ranks.  ex-\
clude the Winter, as improper and disagreeable, and admitting of no other than\
poor interpretations ; such as Hunger, Penury, &. which tnis season brings\
with it.\
That these bafs reliefs may have due decorum, you must observe, that in gar-\
lands they ought to be octangular; in festoons, round; and in groups, or\
bunches, square, and parallel with the frame, especially when disposed hanging\
above, below, and on the sides; but when in corners,  compartment suits better,\
and this to be square above, and semi-circular at bottom and both sides. Thus\
much as to close bafs reliefs in general. As for the relief, the slatter it is, th\'e8\
better, and without the least ground-shade, in order to prevent all mastery and\
confusion.\
Touching the other sort of still life, either standing or lying in deep niches,\
or on benches or tables, we have before observed, that it ought not to be repre-\
sented less than the life, and therefore must come quite forward in the piece, as\
appearing then in its full force and quality ; even much better with  light com-\
ing from without, than within;  front than side light.\
There are three sorts of grounds, which elegantly set off fruits. Grapes, espe-\
cially the blue, and cherries, blue plumbs, and all fruits inclinable to be dark,\
require one of free-stone; but apples, peaches, and apricots, appear better on \
dark grey ground. There is  third sort, as pumpkins, melons, oranges, straw-\
berries, and others, which best become  white ground, whether they be lying on\
 bench or table, or in  deep niche.\
 shall now describe some designs. which  hope will not be unacceptable to the\
artist. The first contains the three blooming seafons.\
Table, or Ordonnance-\
This piece exhibits  compass-headed niche, square within, and its depth equal\
to its diamcter: therein  place  beautiful vase, either of chrystal, copper, or\
gold, with flowers, of which  set the shortest stalk in the middle, and the others\
spreading on the sides : above, in the middle, on  ring,  hang two or three\
bunches of the largest sort of grapes : to the ring  fasten  small ribbon, on\
which loosely hang ears of corn, intermixed with corn-flowers, taken up and tied\
in the upper corners of the piece, and hanging down the fides : below, round the\
vase, lies sine and palatable fruit, of the largest and best fort; as melons, lemons,\
fresh figs, pomegranates, walnuts, as well as apples, peaches, China oranges, &.\
This is the substance of the piece.\
The disposition is thus. The festoons, in bunches of an hand\'92 length, are\
parted with greens, and tied, which greens cover the stalks of corn, and being in-\
termixed, as is said, with some blue flowers, produce an agreeable mixture, with-\
out mastery. The jaums setting them off, are grey stone, and the ribbon, dark\
violet. The grapes of the largest sort, tied to  copper ring, are, in the middle,\
white, and thosc hanging on each side, blue, with  green leaf or two : this group\
is\
\
\
\
\
\
\
is well set off against the shade of the hollow of the niche, without drawing the\
eye froi the principal. My intention is, to dispose the flowers into  large mafs\
of beautiful and light ones; the strongest and fullest to be in the middle, consist-\
ing of white, yellow and light red: the highest next the grapes to be  turnsol,\
and on the sides, others of less force and colour, intermixed here and there, with\
 beautiful blue one. And, because the vase, on account of the room which the\
fruits lying about it, take up, cannot stand quite forward, the flowers spreading on\
the sides must be in snade. The fruits  dispose contrary again; as the biggest on\
the left side, and the smallest and most tender, such as peaches, apricots, and\
plumbs, on the right: they should be ltalian fruits, especially the lemons, at least\
two fists big, as being the chief of the group, and governing the rest. If, besides\
the seasons, you would represent some other meanings, add  lyre, violin, or other\
musical instrument, which may be set or hung against the light side of the aforesaid\
hollow; and thus the piece is complete.\
And now, curious still life paintersl view this example with attention, and con-\
sider whether  propose to you any difficulty above your abilities. Ye flower\
painters, Is it more troublesome and artful to imitate  grape, apple, or peach,\
than  rose, lilly, or turnsol; And ye, who practice fruit only, What difficulty has\
 flower more than fruits,  pomegranate or melon, inwardly or outwardly ; Any of\
these may be set standing or lying before you, as long as you please; and so may\
an harp, violin, lyre, or slute: these can store you, and are all in your power, and\
vour eyes can determine the proportions, measures, and forms, of all that stands\
still, hangs, or lies, and the soft pencil, skilfully handled, brings them naturally\
and properly on the cloth. Why then, do ye so often obstinately build on  single\
fort;  beautiful slower will certainly please the eye, but more, in conjunction\
with some fine musical instruments. Your cloth may take in some of each, and\
vet, ye most times do it with  single sort. If it be  flower-piece, your cloth must\
however be filled, as it also must, when the subject is fruits and musical instru-\
ments. When we say, JA man is  fine still life painter, we are to suppose, he\
paints every thing, either standing still, lying, or hanging.\
Second Ordonnance, being the reverse of the Former.\
The chief object in this ordonnance, is  low or shallow basket of fruit, taking\
up in breadth the major part of the opening. This basket is silled with all forts\
of tender and palatable fruit. Instead of the grapes over it,  fasten to the ring\
 bunch of slowers with elegant greens, tied up, as in the former, and against the\
jaumbs of the niche, some musical instruments; as  slute, trumpet, bassoons, cor-\
nets, hautboys, &. On the right side of the basket, lies  Porcelain disn of straw-\
berries; and behind it, somewhat deeper in the niche,  wide glass of mulberries,\
&. The hanging festoons, on each side of the bunch of slowers, consist mostly of\
ears of corn and greens. The main light takes the basket of fruit, consisting\
mostly of lightisn white, yellow, and somewhat red ones, and the shaded side, of\
dark, black, or violet. The bunch of flowers over it, contrarily, is made up of\
blue, purple, violet, and  little white and yellow. The musical instruments the\
same.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
same. The other things; encompaffing these, as the ears of corn, and greens, ex-\
plain themselves.\
This piece, thus disposed and artfully executed, is  proper matching picture\
for the preceding.\
We shall subjoin  third ordonnance of  music piece, (implying harmony) no\
less elegant than the former.\
.\
Third Ordonnance.\
In the middle of the hollow of the niche,  place on  desk,  large book of\
music, opening long-ways, on one side whereof is pricked the cantus, and on the\
other, the bafs, either in church or chamber music. Over it, on the ring, Ifasten\
an ivory lyre, adorned with gold, and between its horns hangs  crown of laurel,\
with  small olive, or myrtle branch. All the wind-instruments, before-men-\
tioned, together with the violin, must be disposed on the sides, and behind the\
book, and forwards, some implements pertaining thereto, viz.  screw or two,\
piece of colophony, box of strings, bassoon or hautboy-reed, &. all encompassed\
by  beautiful festoon of flowers, intermixed with ears of corn.\
This piece fuits well between the two others.\
As for the shape of all the three, they will be better, and look more noble, if\
longer than wide.\
There remains another sort of still life, which with the preceding, would yield\
 great variety. It consists of all sorts of rich things, as gold, silver, crystal, and\
other glasses, pearls, precious stones, and mother of pearl. Such pieces are com\'ac\
monly called Vanitases. The famous Kalf has left many rare exaiples of these\
\
things, which deserve the highest commendation.\
Now, to shew that in this branch the artist has plentiful materials for bringing\
him from  trade to an art; or, in better terms, for enriching the productions of\
the hand with those of the head, whereby he may be reputed an artful master,\
\
shall sketch  fourth ordonnance, taking for the subject, wisdom, riches and ho-\
nour. Solomon only prayed for wisdom, and with it obtained riches, and honour.\
Fourth Ordonnance,\
 pl\'e2ce in the middle of the piece, every thing that is costly, viz. gold, silver,\
pots, tankards, salvers, cups of mother of pearl, crystal, candlesticks, heaps of\
gold and silver coin, full purses, &. On the ring above,  hang  small board,\
with this motto in gold letters, Sapienria Nutrix; or, instead of the writing,  put\
in  golden sun, on  fky-colour ground. On each side of it,  hang some books,\
festoon-wise, intermixed with laurels, naval and moral crowns, garlands of palm,\
laurel, myrtle, oak, &. and fastened to the upper corners of the piece, proceeding\
from the ring, and hanging down the sides. About them might be twined  small\
streamer, with these words : Laboris merces, sapientia nutrix; or Pr\'e6mia majora\
iaboribus.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Now; to bring Wifdom, which fs the principal part of the piece, into the mid\'ac\
dle, we may, in lieu of the sun and books, hang above, on the ring, the golden\
ffeece, and exhibit below, \'e0 sphinx, with some books and peach\'e8s.\
There are other sorts of still life, as dead fisni, cabbages, carrots, aamnips, &.\
which being too low and poor, and bearing no particular lignifications,  think\
unworthy to range with those before-mentioned, how well soever they be exe-\
cuted, much less to adorn the cabinets of great and wise men. But dead hares,\
partridges, pheasants, and all sorts of hunting equipage, may, as  have sald, be\
praise-worthy.\
\
\
CHAP. III. Representations of Still Life, applioable to particular\
Persons.\
ALTHOUGH  have before said, that the famous Kaff excelled in still\
life, yet he could give as little reason for what he did, as others before and\
fince : he only exhibited what occurred to his thoughts-; as  Porcelain pot or\
diss, gold cup, mum-glass, rummer of wine, with lemon-peel hanging on it,\
clock, Horn of mother of pearl, gold\'92or silver footed, silver dish of peaches, or else\
cut China, oranges or lemons,  carpet, and other ufual things, without any\
thought of doing something of importance, which might carry some particulai\
meaning, or be applicable to something. Neverthelefs, to shew that this may be\
done as well in still life, as in other representations.  fhall give the following\
sketches made applicable to particular persons.\
Table, or Ordonnance, adapted to  triumphing Warrier,\
Herein we exhibit some arms, viz.  steel breast-piece, an helmet, elegantly\
wrought, shield and sword, with the hilt representing an eagle or lion\'92 head, \
pike or spear, bent bow and  quiver of arrows, also iome crowns of laurel, palm,\
and olive. Above, on the frame, may be fastened on two rings,  gold chain, to\
which hangs an heart, beset with precious stones, coming down to the breastapiece,\
and over it may be the motto of the hero to whom we apply the subject. We\
exhibit further,  gold crown, bracelets and rings, an hat with feathers, and  dia-\
mond button, and  trumpet. Under these, fies an embroidered coat on the table,\
with  sleeve hanging down from it. On the wall, or in  small table, may be\
seen in bafs relief, Apollo having killed the dragon Python, or Perseus and Andro-\
meda; or  man in  lion\'92 sxin, tearing open  tiger\'92 mouth, and near him,\
 club.\

\
Comment on the aforesaid Objects.\
The breaft-piece was anciently taken for  mark of understanding and defence ;\
for, as it guards the breast, it preserves life.\
The helmet denotes an inclination for war, and  martial spirit.\
The shield also,  token of defence, was so much regarded by the ancients, that\
they made  prefent of it to conquerors, in consideration of their valour and con-\
duct. Virgil, in his ninth Book, mentions Aneas\'92 ordering  fhield to be prought\
to him, wherewith to reward the fidelity and valour of Nijus. The Argives had\
eustom of marching young men (who had by notable exploits merited the hongur\
with the shield of Enhippus carried before them triumphantly, through their towi\
and territories. We also read, that the palladium, which the ancients believed\
fell from heaven, was  shield, mysteriously representing the protection of the\
Roman people and empire; and, according to Numa Pampilius\'92 explanation, the\
shield implied success and prosperity, whereby he endeavoured to buoy and com-\
fort the Roman people, on their being sorely visited, in his eighth year, with  pesti-\
lence which threatened the destruction of all staly. The shields were moreover de-\
dicated to those, who had saved the town and common-wealth from any great and\
imminent danger; and to perpetuate such.  benefaction, and as  spur to virtue,\
they caused the story to be engraved or carved on their shields. The shield and\
pike also signify war, chiefly in retrieving the damages sustained by the enemy,\
and in putting them to flight, and destroying them. Yet weapons are of little\
advantage, if not used with wisdom and understanding : wherefore, we generally\
see Pallas represented with  shield and pike; the latter signifying force, and quick-\
ness of apprehension.\
The pike, or-spear, also denotes the spreading of  glorious name; for which\
reason, according to Plutarch, Lysippus adorned. the statue of Alexander with it, tho\
others represented him with thunder in his hand, intending thereby to immor-\
talize the atchievements of that hero. The pike or arrow also being thrown or\
shot at  mark, hieroglyphically signifies the spreading of  glorious name : yet,\
according to the ancients, the pike or spear not only implied royal grandeur and\
authority, but was likewise the usual reward for those who had shewed their bra-\
very in conquering the-enemy : as Pliny says, that Sicinnius Dentatus, for his ad-\
mirable walour, was presented with twelve pikes. Festus Pompeius-thinks that ge-\
n\'e8rals received the pike or javelin, in token of their being intrusted with the prin-\
cipal management of the war and empire; and, that therefore it was customary to\
tsell the prisoners publicly, sub hasta, or under the pike or spear.\
The sword, in reference to war, signifies fury, cruelty, fright, persecution and\
threatening with death.\
The bent bow is likewise  sign of war; and ithe arrows signify the people, or\
the enlargement of power; also velocity and quick motions.\
The crown-of laurel was the token of conquerors, and those who performed any\
glerious-act, -as the-ancient remains sufficiently inform us. And we learn from\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
history, that the Roman generals and commanders used in their triumphs, to\
present  crown of laurel to Jupiter Capitolinus.\
The ancient Romans also used to bestow  palm on those who triumphed, as \
general token of victory. And the palm-tree, though pressed by \'e0 heavy weight,\
will yet grow against it; wherefore in hot battles, it is esteemed  token of vic-\
tory, which can only be got by  firm resolution to refist and despise dangers and\
adversities.\
The olive is likewise  mark of victory ; the ancients adorning their trophies\
and warlike monuments with its branches, or decking the head, of the conqueror\
with  crown of its leaves.\
The gold chain was the Roman reward for valour and virtue; it not only re-\
compensing merit, but serving for  badge of honour, glory and esteem. The\
Roman history informs us, that the son of Tarquinius Priscus, though but fourteen\
years of age, charged the enemies in the open field and conquered them; where-\
fore to imortalize his valour, he was the first who was honoured with  gold chain :\
though according to others, Hersilius the first born of the ravished Sabines at Rome,\
first received that honour. We also read that Ricinnius Dentatus was sixty-three\
times rewarded with \'e0 gold chain, and twenty-five times with other gold or gilt\
presents.\
The heart beset with- precious stones, hanging down to the breast on  gold\
chain, signifies, that wholesome advice and deliberation spring from the innermost\
of the heart ; wherefore those who triumphed were introduced with this gold\
chain about their necks, in the utmost part whereof, or the heart hanging down\
to the breast, they imagined were contained herbs and balm, which secured the\
triumphers from malice and envy. Asconius particularly remarks, that the chil-\
dren of the nobles or free citizens wore those chains; but the Liberti or freed-anen,\
for distinction\'92 sake, had them only of silver and copper : to which Juvenal in his\
Satyrs alludes, saying, The poor must be content with copper.\
The gold crown and bracelets, which adorned both the shoulders and arms,\
were likewise the rewards of great actions. These gifts were preserved for poste-\
rity, as  spur for young people indefatigably to tread in the steps of their fore-fa-\
thers. Titus Livius, in his tenth Book says, That after the victory obtained over\
the Samnites near Aquilonia, Papirius on that occasion presented Sp. Nautius, his ne-\
phew, Spurius Papirius. four captains and  troop of pikemen, with bracelets and\
gold crowns ; giving the other captains, foot-soldiers and horsemen, bracelets\
and ornaments of silver, which they called Crnicula, or little horns. And Decius :\
the Tribune received  gold crown from Aulas Cornelius Cossus, for defending \
certain strong place belonging to the Romans, against the Samnites, and forcing\
them to raise the siege.\
The Romans also esteemed the rings as badges of honour and nobility : for ac-\
cording to Titus Livius, in his third Book, treating of the second Punic war, on\
Mago\'92 being dispatched by Hannibal to notify to the Carthagenians the bloody de-\
feat of the Romans in the battle of Canna, he poured out before them an heap of\
gold rings, taken as  booty from the slain; adding, to extol. the victory, that\
among the Romans, none but the great and noble were allowed to wear them. And\
towards\
\
\
\
\
\
\
towards the close of his ninth Book, he relates, that on Flavius\'92 being, in  pub\
lic asfembly, chosen Adilis, or superintendant of the public buildings, the no-\
bility were so distinguisned, that several of them laid down their gold rings and\
other tokens ofhonour and esteem. And the eloquent Ccero, in his fourth Ora-\
tion against Verres, reproaches him for bestowing in  public asfembly of the\
people, the tokens of honour, gold rings, on mean and unworthy people : with\
whom agrees Asconius, saying, That the Fasces, civic crown and gold rings were\
by the people looked on as badges of liberty and nobility, and always attended\
with honour and profitable incomes.\
The Greeks reputed the hat or cap as  token of noble extraction; wherefore\
they represented the head of Ubsses covered with  hat or cap, as being noble both\
by father and mother. For this reason, we commonly. see on ancient coins and\
medals an hat or cap circumscribed LIBERTAS.\
The diamond is indisputably the hardest, and for its sparkling the most beau-\
tiful and perfect of all precious stones, and (which is most surprising and remark-\
able) it resists the consuming fire, without losing any of its virtue or excellence.\
Wherefore it is used as an hieroglyphic of immoveable firmness in prosperity\
and adversity : accordingly, the ancients also attributed to it  supernatural qua-\
lity of freeing the heart from vain fear and despair, and that it never left  man\
either in his pressures or dangers, when principally he ought to be master of\
himself.\
The plume of feathers also signifies honour and nobility, and,\
The trumpet, esteem and an immortal name.\
The embroidered coat called Tunica Palmata, was an under garment commonly\
worn by those who triumphed ; acording to Titus Livius in his tenth Book : and\
Isidorus Hispalensis, in his Originum, lib.  says, That those who had conquer-\
ed used to receive  gown called Toga Palmata or Toga Picta, from the victo-\
ries and palm branches worked in it. And Macrobius, lib.  Saturnal, cap.\
 affirms that Tullus Hostilius first introduced this garment among the Romans.\
The twofirst bass-reliefs explain themselves, and by the third we mean strength;\
for the lion\'92 skin implies high understanding and resolution of mind, and the club,\
conduct and intrepidity.\
Second Ordonnance, relating to  Judge.\
In this we reprefent  pair of scales,  sword, looking-glass, septre topped\
with an eye,  board with  triangle thereon inclosing the number  and the\
image of truth, an hazel wand and fasces,  scythe, rod, ax, gold chain, staff twined\
with ivy,  large folio book, whereto is affixed the coat of arms of the common-\
wealth; and on the wall,  fruitful palm-tree in bass-relief.\
Explanation of these Objects.\
The fcales commonly placed in the hand of Justice, signify that weighing all\
mens\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
mens actions, sne affigns\'92to every one what God has decreed him; wherefore the\
heathens also represented Astr\'e6a ascended to heaven, and seated there between the\
lion and scales; intimating thereby, that  judge ought resolutely to punish trans-\
greffions according to their merit, without respecting persons.\
The sword likewise signifies justice and the severity of the law ; according to\
the apostle, :  ruler is the minister of God, and bears not the sword in vain, to\
execute wrath on him that doth evil.  looking-glass in the hand of Prudenoe denotes reforming of manners.\
The ancient Agyprians, by the hieroglyphic figure of the sceptre with an open\
&ye, fignified the absolute authority of equity and prudence ; which always watch-\
ing and penetrating mens actions, justly reward each according to his deserts.\
Platarch, in his doctrine of the Phythagoreans, intimates that the triangle is the\
most perfect figure of justice. Some palce the number . within it, because we\
therein see the godly character of the Almighty.\
The image of truth explains itself.\
The hazel wand fignifies ecclesiastical, and the fasces, secular dignity; or re-\
ligion and policy.\
The fcythe is is'the hieroglyphic of chastisement; as we read in the prophet\
Zechariah, that the scythe he saw in  vision, was going forth tocut off all thofe\
who stole or swore.\
The rod also implies punishment, for the support of good discipline and laws\
according to equity and justice.\
The Romans and some of the Greeks took the ax hieroglyphically for heavy\
chastisement; we see in the medals and coins of Tenedos, mentioned by Pollux :\
for the king of Tenedos, having published  law, that any person caught in adul-\
tery should be put\'92to death with the ax, and in compliance therewith not spared\
his own son, he commanded this story to be struck on the coins and medals, in\
order to be thereby immortalized.\
The Agyptians likewise applied the Bulla, or gold chain and heart to their\
judges; intimating, that making pure truth their only aim, they ought to be\
impartial, and give judgment without respect of persons.\
The staff twined with ivy signifies, that justice ought to be protected-: for by\
the staff is understood authority, and by the ivy protection, which should always\
flourish.\
The large folio book contains the statues and ordinances of the country.\
The fruit of the palm-tree represented in bass-relief, being of equal\'92size with the\
Jeaves, the ancients would thereby signify justice and equity. This tree also con\'ac\
sisting of lasting matter, and not altering or decaying so soon as-others, serves for\
 pattern of the- maintenance of justice without impediment or alteration : and as\
it never drops its leaves as others do, and refists alla pressure and weight, thereby\
is implied that judges ought not to be biassed, but withstand those who endea-\
vour to draw them from their-duty by fair words, gifts or intrigues.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Ordornance relating to  Lawyer.\
In this table we exhibit  plaister figure of Mercury winged at head and feet,\
standing on  square stone pedestal, having in one hand his golden caduceus twined\
with serpents, and in the other an olive branch. By him is  plaister sphinx.\
Also  sword and fhield,  lyre or harp,  burning lamp, an ink-horn with pens\
and  roll of paper,  sieve, some of the principal law books, and abible. In \
small vase or pot may be set an iris or two. Above on  ring hang three garlands,\
one composed of laurel and ivy, another of cedar and myrtle, and the third of\
oak leaves. On the wall, or in  small table, we see in bass-relief the fable of\
Minerva brought forth out of Jupiter\'92 brain.\
Explanation of the Objects.\
Mercury implies the impreffion of words upon the mind, and the force of elo-\
quence : wherefore the ancients believed, he was the messenger and the interpre-\
ter of the gods.\
The square stone whereon he ftands, fignifies the regard for and stability of the\
laws and rules whereby to direct our speeches : for which reason Mercury is stiled\
Tetragonus or square, that is firm and certain.\
His staff or caduceus intimates, that obstinate tyrants must yield to the laws and\
Huent charms of eloquence. By the serpents twined about the golden rod, the\
ancients mean that eloquence, tempered with ingenuity and prudence, can easily\
bring men\'92to reason. Some also would have the golden rod in the hand of Mer-\
cury to\'92signify, the excellence and eminence of honourable offices due to those who\
employ their eloquence (the gift of heaven) in their neighbours welfare and the\
common good.\
By the olive branch in Mercury\'92 hand is understood peace ; for the ancients be-\
lieved it composed \'92the differences of contending parties.\
His wings at head and feet, were affigned him to signify the readinefs and force\
of eloquence.\
The sphinx shews, that nothing is so abstruse or occult that  lawyer\'92 penetra-\
'ting judgment cannot clear.\
We compare jurisprudence to\'92the sword and Thield : for as  warrior thereby\
defends. himself and annoys his enemy, so  council gets his cause by dint of\
cstrong arguments, and well grounded conclusions.\
The ancient Romans signified by the lyre or harp, \'e0 man of great learning\
and judgment; for that instrument is composed of divers strings and sounds, pro-\
ducing fine harmony; like the lawyer when he reconciles the difference of things\
to r\'e9ason, in order to make contesting parties agree. By the harp or lyre we al-\
so understand, that harmony arises from different and dissonant cords, and that\
people of contrary sentiments meeting together, may by  good union, settle and\
transmit to posterity, an excellent form of government. And as Plato in his\
Timaeus, stiles the soul  concert or sweet harmony, so concord may be justly\
called\
\
\
\
\
\
\
called the soul of the state. The Gree\'e8s and Romans say, the lyre was partly in-\
vented by Mercury, and partly by others.\
The shape of the ancient lyre is this : it was bent like two horns joined to-\
gether, having  swelling belly-and on top- handle. It is said to have had but\
three strings, and these could produce seven tunes, making  perfect harmony.\
The three strings were assigned in imitation of the three seasons of the year known\
to the Aguptians, viz. summer, winter and spring, each consisting of four months;\
and they attributed the cantus to the summer, the bass to the winter and the tre-\
to the spring. Others say that this application respects man; whose body con-\
sisting of four elements, and the soul, in reference to its acts ofthree, thus makes\
Wherefore the\
Darkness flies the light of true knowledge and understanding.\
lamp is sometimes taken for the works done by its light; for as the night through\
its stilness is very proper for study, so the Greck poets also gave the night  name\
which signified the producing understanding, wisdom and gladness; as the mind\
is then apt for meditation. Accordingly the old proverb of the students is, Plas\
olei quam vini ; He spent more in oil than wine; meaning more time in dili\'ac\
gent labour of the mind to attain sciences, than in taking walks, feasting or other\
diversions. Epicharmus used to say, That he who would study great things, must\
not for the sake of ease, spare the nights.\
The Agyptians understood by the ink-horn, pens, and roll of paper, all things\
whereby arts and sciences might be represented.\
by the sieve, the same people hieroglyphically meant, the fruitfulness of in-\
struction in arts and sciences; also the writers of sacred and mysterious things :\
foras the sieve separates the good from the bad, so their lawyers, who were also\
stiled priests, knew how, through their prudence and wisdom, to distinguisn be-\
tween things concerning life and death ; accordingly they made use of the word\
sieve for expressing what is true and known. Others sav, that by that implement\
is signisied  man of great knowledge and perfection, who can discourse of things\
divine and human with equal penetration. Moreover, as the sieve separates the\
slour from the bran, so experience fits us for discerning between good or bad,\
right or wrong. Wherefore Virgil in the first Book of his Georgics, rightly\
stiles it Mystica Vannus lacchi, the mystic fan, or sieve of lacchus. Some apply\
to this point the saying of the philosopher Antisthenes; that it were great folly not\
toknow how to distinguisn the corn from the chaff; meaning the learned and be-\
neficial citizens from illiterate.\
Next to the Bible, the chief authors for law are, viz. among the Greeks, Solon,\
Lycurgus, Demosthenes, and Isocrates : among the Romans, Cato, Cicero, Hortenfius,\
and Caesar; their Leges and Orationes, also the Corpus Byzantinum and Corpus\
Juris or Justinianeum, compiled by Theophilus and Doretheus senators under the\
emperor Justinian, from  feries of ancient law books : among the Spaniards, Di-\
dacus Coverruvius, Francisco de Salgado, secretary to Phillip II. and Ferdinandes Vas-\
quius : among che French, Jacobus Cujacius, and Marcus Antonius Muretus : among\
the Germans, Fritchius and Carpzovius: and among the Duich, Hugo Grotius,\
Groenewegan, &.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The herb or flower lris is. an emblem of eloquence according to Haner, who to.\
describe that of the Tnojan embassadors, represents them as having eaten the bloomr\
ing lris; meaning their beingthoroughly szilled, in pleasing eloquence ; for that.\
flower by its variety of colours, is not unlike the heavenly tris or rainbow, whor;\
the ancients accounted the goddess of eloquence.\
The garland or laurel intermixed with ivy leaves, signifiesthat. lawyers are, for\
their excellent; labours. and parts.to be had in perpetual remembrance: for by the,\
laurel, the ancients understood  natural force and fruitfulness of understanding,\
and by the iyy, which though at first creeping along the ground, at last taps the\
highest trees and buildings, the fkilkor experience which lawyers obtain by con-\
tinual labour and practice.\
It will not be disagreeable to that body of men, that for imortalizing\
their names and memories, we add the garland of cedar and myrtle to the laurel\
and ivy ; fince touchang great and, eloquent men, we may very well conclude\
with Persius and. Horace, Cedro digna locuti, They have spoken things worthy to\
be cut in cedar, or to be everlasting ; for the cedar is among the trees, the amblem.\
of eternity, as never rotting or mouldering through age ; wherfore the Ark of the\
Covenant was also made of it. The myrtle signifies  mind enriched wich, many-\
endowments.\
Among tkeiarowns; with which the Romans used to. adorn the heads of legifla-\
tors and pleaders, that of oak-leayes was in great esteem, ag implyang the con-\
servation of. the town, andicitizens. Several reasons, are assigned for this soft of\
crouns, Some say, than originally the Arcadiaus were first-honoured with it fon\
the antiquity of their oracles. Others think it proceeded from that tree being sa-\
cred to Jupiter the patron of the Dodonaan oracle, and protector of towns; and\
that therefore it was very reasonable to crown those who had saved  citizen either\
by arms or law, with the leaves of that tree, dedicated to the tutelar god of all\
towna. Others. are of opinion, that the oak was the first made of all trees, and\
has been the first nourisher of mankind, and material for the oracles. We see tq\
this. day acertain medal with this Darick inscription, EHEIPRTAN, representing\
an eagle treading on thunder, and two oak branches bent garland-ways; which\
was. doubtless. the coin of Epirus, alluding to the oak of Chaonia and the Dodoncan\
oracle.\
\
By Minerua. Broceeding from Jupiter\'92 brain, we represent the nature and acti-\
vity of understanding and wisdom for gaining jurisprudence : she likewise implies\
mature and wary deliberation. Wherefore some hold, that. Jupiter knew Metis,\
or Counsel and Prudence, and then brought forth Minerva : for wisdom and un-\
dersfanding, are only attainable by mature deliberation-and advice.\

salt,  white linen girdie, bundle of flax, waggon-wheel, saphire ring, olive\
branch, sheet of paper, whereon are three conjoined circles inclosed within  fourth,\
and under them an equilateral triangle and  square. In  small picture is seen \
landscape exhibiting among other things  rock,  palm,  cedar-tree, and an hill\
sending forth abundance of water. On the wall in  bass-relief is an elephant rear-\
inghis trunk towards heaven, as also  stork and cock : but above all we must\
not forget the fruitful mustard-seed,  sprig whereof we have set in  pot or vase\
on the table with the other objects; an explanation whereof follows.\
Adamantius and others tells us, that the powers of the universe must yeid to the\
dictates of religion.  further explanation of the bible is unecessary, since it is\
sufficiently known to every body.\
The altar is accounted the hieroglyphic of piety, of whichl have treated in\
Book IX. page.   compares the lamp to the body, the habitation of the soul; and its\
fhiining light to the faculty of understanding. But in scripture we often find,\
that by the lamp are meant the doctors and teachers of arts, sciences, and mysteries,\
who should be set on the candlestick, in order to expel darkness, and light those in\
the house. In another passage it is said, That the light ought not to be hidden,\
&. And if the light according to Scholasticus in his Climax, come to be in dark-\
jnefs, What will not the darkneis of nature, or men ignorant of God be guilty of ?\
Some again understand by thelight, the gospel, others St. Joln tle Baptist, who is also\
alled  burning lamp. The prophets were also lamps, but burning dim, as speaking\
mysteriously: but St. John as with  finger has pointed out our- Saviout. Eucherius\
observes, that by the lamp is sometimes meant good works; and therefore the gos-\
pel says, ee Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good\
works, &.  The light or fire sometimes likewise, hieroglyphically signifies devo\'ac\
tion and. piety. If earthly things can in any ways unite us with the heavenly, no-\
thing in nature has greater affinity with the mind and spirit than fire, because it\
lights and clears every thing and makes us intimate with heaven.\
The philosopher Antisthenes, speaking of the breast-plate, commonly said,\
ie That virtue was  constant defence, because it could never be lost; for the arms\
of wisdom and understanding are lasting to those who are rightly arrayed with\
them.\
 In which sense St. Paul exhorts his congregation ee To put on the ar-\
mour of faith for quenching the fiery darts of the wicked, agreeable to Horace,\
-Quipectus pr\'e6ceptis format amicis.\
The apostle St. Paul fays, ce That the word of God is quick and powerful, and\
sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing afunder of\
soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow Intimating, that though the\
stone in the kidneys seem incurable, yet the word of God can convert and cure the\
hard stone of our unbelief For by our Saviour\'92 coming on earth, we. have learnt\
what the flesn and spirit incline to; and his doctrine has, like  two-edged\
sword, divided the spirit from the flesh, that we might afterwards lead  spiritual\
life\
\
\
\
\
\
\
life, as being not in the flesh but in the spirit, esteeming the corruption of the\
flesn  great gain, when through the spirit we obtain eternal life.\
Encherias thinks that the words in Psalm cxxvii.  As arrows are in the hand of\
 mighty man, so are the children of the youth, allude to the appostles and their\
misfion into all countries ; because in their travels they pierced mens hearts with\
the doctrine of Christ, as with  darting arrow and brought them from darkness to\
light : for by the arrows in several places of scripture, is understood God\'92 word\
penetrating the soul as with  two-edged sword.\
We find in sacred writ that the Almighty is to be praised with drums or tim-\
brels. And Gregory in the sixth Book of his Epistles to Athanasius, emblemati\'ac\
cally shews by the drum kind remembrance; for says he, ce As the materials of\
that instrument are long before prepared to fit it for sound, so  man should\
piously endeavour to thank his Creator, and loudly praise him for his benefits.,\
The bells hanging according to Moses\'92 command at the hem of the high-priest\'92\
garment, emblematically signified the publishing of God\'92 will; and his being\
heard by their tingling, on entering into or coming forth of the Holy of Holies,\
intimates that the ministry should always have the word and laws of God in their\
mouths, for rebuking, exhorting or comforting, according to the weakness and\
transgressions of men.\
The harp formerly represented all kinds of arts and virtues: and Eusebius thinks\
it takes its name from  Greck word, signifying as much as to instruct in excellent\
sciences. And thus the songs of Orpneus and Proclus among the heathens, and\
David among the Jews, have powerfully incited to good living.\
By water and fire, or the cistern and censer, the Agyptian priests understood \
purgation from spots and filth; even from the darknefs of ignorance by means of\
pure doctrine. Accordingly after funerals, the ancients purified themselves with\
water and smoaking perfumes, the latter hieroglyphically representing prayers\
and divine doctrine, as Hesychius bishop of Jerusalem writes.\
The same people meant by the sieve the fruitfulnefs of instruction in arts and\
sciences. Others the end of all things, as by often examining ourselves to learn\
quietness of life, and by due reflexion on what is past, present and to come, to\
make prosperity and adversity equal.\
Doctrine and instruction those people called sBo, which being interpreted sig-\
nifies plenty, or all that is necessary for life ; as if the study of sciences required\
 good fortune. Aristotle says, ecThe rich should study philosophy. And Zecha-\
riah  noted man among the Jews, et lf you have slour, you will learn the law:\
 The lawv implying\
if you have knowledge in the law you will want no flour. \
knowledge and sciences, and the slour every thing necessary for sustenance. But\
Ithink according to Agyptian wisdom, that this doctrine rather respects the soul\
than the body; for it is believed that the basket of unleavened bread, which\
Aaron and his sons only were to offer, hieroglyphically signified the tongue or\
word, or eternal and heavenly eloquence ; for as bread supports the body, so the\
word of God nourishes to eternal life. And because bread by  general consent,\
implies doctrine and instruction; to whom must we return our thanks, but tohimn\
who by his doctrine has enlightened our understanding, and is the fountain of\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
plenty and perfection. In this sense ithie bread \'e9alled the loavens or twbetenths of\
fine flour, offered, as in Liviticus xxiii. for \'92 meat offering, signified che law and\
the gospel; but according to our Saviour, when under temptation, that, Ie \
man did not live by \'92bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the\
mouth of God.\
In baking, the leaven has in seripture divers \'92significations : among others, it\
implies human scienc\'e9s. Now sciences are divided into human and divine, the\
former subject to the diversity of words, but. the latter constant and everlasting;\
for what is once truly perfect always remains so; and the fire which once warms\
will always warm, as long as it is fire. Eternal providence and government of all\
created beings are endiess; and thus nature, philosophy, ethics and theology are\
very conformable to the Deity ; but grammar, rhetoric and dialeftita ar\'e9 called hu-\
man sciences: wherefore, says Origines, ee The leaven is not used in offerings. For\
divines understand by it, human sciences, the matter and foree whereof fies onfy in\
words, which nevertheless are aids ; because the purity of speech whichtgrammar\
teaches, Thews the beauty and excellence of eloquence obtained by rhetoric, and\
the method of. reasoning and opposition, gained by dialectica, is an help to many\
other scienc\'e8s:\
Philosophers say, that the products of the earth are owing to falt. Divin\'e9s\
compare it to the gospel, alledging Leviticus, chap  ee With all thine offerings\
thou shalt offer salt : Or, in all your doctrines you must be governed by those of\
the apostles, who according to our Saviour, are the salt of the earth. The frank-\
incense put on the twelve cakes, according to the Jezissit rite, the seventy interpre-\
ters have rendered salt, to signify the apostolical doctrine.; for, as falt makes meat\
palatable, so, according to Hesychius, instruction ald exhortation cause in us \
smell and taste of divine wisdom ; whereby our good works, \'e0s. faith, hope and\
charity produce fruit acceptable to God.\
The Jewissi priests were commanded to set the people  pattern of chastity, piety\
and good behaviour, and to be always ready to walk in God\'92 paths, as appears by\
the white linen girdle, signifying the most sacred and mysterious doctrine, by which\
they ought to govern themselves and their congregations. Jerimiah\'92 girdle had\
the same meaning, as Gril largely shews. As the girdle was white linen, we are\
led to consider the first matter it was made of, to wit, flax.\
The seed of flax comes up as green as grass in  fhort time after sowing; and\
having blossomed and set its seed, it is then pulled, and rotted in water, and after-\
wards laid to dry in the sun; and then being beaten to  softness, it is combed\
and hatchelled, and spun into thread : after boiling in strong lye, it is made into\
 web of linen, and whitened for  dress to appear in before God. The care ne-\
necessary about this herb, which is an emblem of undefiled life, ought continually\
to be had in view, that laying afide things vain and unprofitable, we may, by\
means of science, render ourselves irreproveable, and through adverfity and temp-\
tations obtain the white garment of glory. The quick and easy growth of flax,\
shews how easily virtues and sciences are attainable, if we set readily about them.\
Hesychius understands by the flax, the frail efforts of mortals, and the thread of the\
Almighty\'92 will always remaining with us: wherefore it is the duty of the mini-\
stry\
\
\
\
\
\
\
stry By stheir constent labours, to given out the Pax swhereof ten prepare \'92 garment\
rf good works.\
\
Many among the learned\'92emblematically fignify by the waggont wheel, divi-\
hity ; because, the whe\'ebfnever touching the ground but in one point, so the soul\
lought to be elevated towards God. Thus divines are rightly compared to  wheel;\
fhat by forsaking earthly thoughts, their conversation should always be in heaven.\
The sapphire was always in great esteem, as emblematically representing sove-\
reignty and priesthood. Some say, that this storie draws heavenly influences from\
Jupiter and Saturn; and that those who wear it obtain all their desires ; as from\
Jupiter dominlon and authority, and from Saturn, the priesthood : but, according\
to the fathers; this\'92ftone represents the throne spoken of by Ezekiel, to wit, the s\'e9at\
\'92af God, erernal, good and Almighty : and Eacherius understands by the make of\
the hedvens, \'92the soci\'e9ty of the pious and elect : wherefore, says Hesychius, The-\
throne of sapphiresignifies\'92the tenth or empireal heaven ; for by the colour he un-\
derstands purity, clearnefs and heavenly light, always instructing the church in un-\
alt\'e9rable and pure doctrines.\
We learn from scribture, that the olive-tree was originally th\'e9 emblem of\
-peace.; for no sooner did the waters abate, but the dove, which Noah fent, soon\
after returnetl with an ofive-leaf, as  token that the wrath of heaven being ap-\
peased, God took, compafsion on\'92the remains of human race, and other creatures\
iin 'the ark; and therefore caused the waters to. r\'eatire into the bowels of the earth.\
The olive-branch, is also in scripture, the emblem of \'92 pious man; as we see in\
the gospel, that the  Light ought\'92to burn pure on the candlestiek, whereby our\
Saviour intimates, that both preachers and hearers should sill their Jamps with the\
coil of christian virtues. The sam\'e9 tr\'e9e, \'92for its continual verdure, is also taken for\
ithe efblem of hope ; accordingly, Basilius wishied we might be like it, because\
abounding with blossoms and fhining\'92greennefs, it always affords hope of what is\
\'92to come; or \'92the durable fruits of piety and mercy.\
The wisest Agyptians and Grecks did, when mens understandings were fimple\
tand void of sophistry, very properly calf the chain of certain sciences, Eneyclopa dia;\
\'92as being by three circles, so linked together, that the center of the one is the be-\
ginning of the other, and those inscribed within  larger, called theology : for the\
inner circles signify human scienc\'e9s, which, getting root by means of custom, rea-\
son and nature are perversely taken for infallible; but the circle inscribing them,\
denotes divine sciences. We understand the same things emblematically of the\
dress and ofnaments of the high-priest\'92among the Jezs; for his girdle implied ir-\
reproveabl\'e9 manuers; his priestly garb, truth; sound doctrine, and discourses, which\
with their explanations, let men into the knowledge of things, or philosophy; and\
his glitt\'e9ring robe, signified pure divinity, having no other tendency but  correc-\
ction of manners, and leading to virtue and heaven. Scripture teaches, that ee The\
spirit of wisdom enters not into the heart of the wicked :\'92 accordingly, Moses de-\
nied the unclean and sinful entrance into the tabernacle; thereby intimating, that\
those who improve in virtue and the knowledge of God, ought by the use of the five\
loaves(according to GriD) or the five tart books of the law, to prepare their hearts for\
the two fishies, or the doctrine of the Evangelists and Apostles, and therein to pre-\
serve.\

ferve. Next to the science for the improvement of manners,- divines should en-\
which the learned\
deavour at distinctness, plainness and order in their speeches,\
call dialectica; whose province is to determine controversies; and resolve doubts by\
reasoning justly ; for although, like Moses, they practised moral duties, and were\
received into the sanctuary, yet they touched not on sacred things, otherwise than\
by means of their speeches. After this, they enquired into natural philosophy, or\
physics, having for the subject, the universe, and all created beings; this science\
cleared their doubts and scruples, and prepared them for contemplating the glori-\
ous building of the heavens, in order to thank their Creator for the knowledge\
received. Their last study was theology, which as we have said, comprehends all\
sciences : this gives divines such  constant peace, as neither the regularity of hu-\
man deportment, purest eloquence, or the most exact enquiries into nature, could\
afford them. But this unchangeable peace and firm alliance with God, they ob-\
tain by submitting their knowledge, inclinations, and carnal affections to the rules\
prescribed by reason. This mutual friendship, which the Pythagoreans esteemed the\
main point in philosophy, leads us into the most secret part of the sanctuary, in or-\
der to view the glory of God, till at last, arriving at the highest degree of know-\
ledge, we courageously defeat Ofiris, or the enemy of our souls.\
Though the aforesaid instruction consists of four parts, yet Solomon, the wisest of\
men divides it into three sciences, to wit, ethics, physics, and metaphysics, which\
he has handled in his Proverbs, Ecclefiastes, and Song, or Canticum Canticoaum;\
teaching in the Proverbs, moral obligations; in Ecclefiastes, the nature of things ;\
and in his Song, the contemplation of things supernatural. This seems well to\
agree with the mention in scripture of the God of Abraham, lsaac, and Jacob; for\
Abraham\'92 obeying God in all things, shews an example of moral duties : lsaac\'92\
digging wells, and searching the depths of the earth, signifies physics, or natural\
philosophy ; and Jacob\'92 dream of the ladder, and the ascent and descent of the\
angels thereon, the contemplation of divine things. Both the Hebrez, Greck, and\
Latin divines have largely handled this subject. Even the elements seem to in-\
culcate this doctrine; for the earth, water, and air, by their wonderful conjunction,\
represent the different degrees of the sciences; the earth and moisture, implying\
the history of things, as  teacher of moral duties : the waters, disturbed by the\
winds, shew the turmoils happening in human actions, which ethics serve to allay :\
the air admonisnes, that, at length raising the whole force of our thoughts up-\
wards, we ought continually to contemplate the divine nature, called by the Grecks,\
Theologia, which is the top and limit of our understanding. We say nothing here\
of dialecticu, because it is subservient to ethics, physics and theology, in order t of those three sciences.\
By the equilateral triangle we signify, the aim and purpose of an holy and inno-\
cent life ; because, to make it both edifying and happy, three duties are necessary,\
to wit, to give our neighbour wholesome advice, to judge justly, and to do well;\
wherefore Pallas was, by the heathens called Tritonia, as naving the care of impar-\
tial justice. The Agyptians and Greeks, who were chiefly famous for emblematic\
learning, judicioussy understood by the triangle, the assiduity of human understand-\
ing, in searching into things heavenly, earthly and subterranean. Others would\
signify\

Socrates well agrees.\
The square-implies constancy and immoveableness ; because, however turned,\
it alway shews four lines, and as many angles; these, though mathematical obser-\
vations, are very applicable to those who love piety and other christian virtues, since\
they remain constantly with them, and embalm their memories to posterity. Ari-\
stotle, in his first Book of Moral Duties, and third Book to Theodat, is of the same\
opinion, believing that man, by comparison, may be called square, or perfect and\
pious. This quadrates with the Latin proverb : Quadragonum in se perfectum, &\
criminis expers ; . . The square is perfect, and not liable to censure. Ancient di-\
vines teach, that Noal\'92 ark, which God commanded. to be built square, signified\
the excellent pastors of the church, by whose instruction, notwithstanding any\
snares or heresies, men were led to eternal happiness : for Adamantius exhorts to\
build square libraries, n\'f4t of stone or wood, but of the books of the prophets, apo-\
stles and teachers, out of which may be abundantly learnt true wisdom and divine.\
mysteries; and renouncing sin, to turn and adhere to the true and immutable cor-\
ner-stone of salvation.\
The ancient Agyptians hieroglyphically signified by the rock, firmnefs and con-\
.\
stancy; wherefore David, speaking of God\'92 assistance, says,  Thou art my rock. \'92\
And our Saviour, imitating the duration of the church, says, ec He will build it on\
 rock :\'92 Agreeable whereto is the dream oof Nebuchadnezzar, in which he saw \
gede lalager whose head wat of gold, breast andarms of siver, bellpane duighoee\
hands, which smote the image, and broke it in pieces, which the wind carried\
away, so that no place was found\'92 for them; and the stone that smote the image\
became  great mountain, and filled the whole earth-\
The palm-tree, as having the lower part of its stem. thin and knotty, but higher\
up becoming thick, and agreeable for its continual elegant and spreading verdure,\
fignifies, that how abject soever the condition of the righteous may be in the begin-\
ning, they at last gain wonderful beauty in virtues and good qualities. But let\
me add the words of the pious and l\'e9arned Eucherius: ee The palm-tree,\'92 says he,\
ce differs from all others, because they are thickest downwards, and run tapering up-\
wards, and with more pointed branches; and these may be compared to worldlings,\
who slighting the best things seek theit satisfaction only in the frail and momentary:\
these men spare no labour or trouble in heaping riches; will even purchase tem-\
poral honours at the hazard of their lives.; but stop at once when they are to be-\
stow an hour\'92 service on their Creator, or to fuccour  distressed neighbour ;\
whereas, the pious may be rightly compared to. the palm-tree, which by its tender\
stem, despising earthly pleasures, exalts its virtue on high, that it may adhere to\
and obey the will of the Creator : wherefore it is said, that the righteous shall groW\
and blossom as the palm-tree. \
The cedar-tree, as yielding excellent and useful fruit, is the emblem of mercy\
and piety ; two virtues best becoming the pillars of the ehurch, who are ee Conti-\
nually to watch over the lost sheep of the house of. lsrael,\'92 and to practise works of\
mercy on them, according to. St. Jamus: \'e9esPure religion and undefiled before\

\

\
\
\
\
God and\'92the Father, is this, to visit the fatherless: and widpure in their afffictions;.\
and to keep himself unspotted from the world.  read in the-Psalms, that et From the springing waters of lsrael comes forth\
the praise of the Lord in the congregation of the saints:\'92 by whiclt, divines un-\
derstand the books of the law and prophets, which as springs. of living waters,\
supplied the Ifraelites with the knowledge of God, and being silled with his Spirit.\
their holy men composed hymns. to the glory of his name. Several commenta-\
tors on fcripture and illustrious instruments of the church, would signify, by thet\
springing waters, the apostles and first/teachers; and Euthymius and the primitive\
fathers, the preaching of the gospel. And David, in Ps. civ. says, ec He sends.\
the springs into the valleys whioh run among the hills; they giye drink to everx\
beast: of the field; thereby intimating, that. no place is so hilly or unattainable,\
which God\'92 law cannot penetrate. \
Writers mention, that the elephant (who is. known to be the most docible of\
quadrupedes, and by nature superior to other beasts) particularly loves charity and\
piety ; for as soon as the new moon enlightens the earth, he purifies himself in \
clear river; and when fick, takes grafs and other herbage with his trunk, and\
slings it towards heaven, as if-he thereby invoked\'92the divine affistance in his weak\
condition.\
Scripture, as remarkably speaking. of the stork, emblematically means  purified\
understanding, and  mind exalted above earthly things; for this bird always builds\
on the tops of the highest houses to. save himself from the wiles of beasts; and\
after hatching his young, is at continual war with the snake, which always creep-\
ing on the ground and into the- holes. thereof, is an emblem of viscious affec-\
tions : wherefore, in imitation of the: ftork, men should exait theirminds and seek\
 dwelling-place in heaven; where they will be freed from. all the wiles of the\
flesn and the crafts of the devil.\
The ancients understood by the emblem of the cock, the immortality and- divi\'ac\
nity of the foul; and Pythagoras commanded his followers ta feed and nurse the\
cock ; meaning that they should feed their souls with the knowledge of divine\
things : wherefore Socrates when dying, full' of hope of  speedy-union of his im\'ac\
mortal soul-with- the-deity, said he was bound in duty to offen  cock to Ascula-\
pius, meaning the phyfician of the soul ; for, knowing his dissolution was at hand,\
he believed he should now be cured of all his infirmities. Plato\'92 followers and\
commentators say, that the offering  cock, implies the soul\'92 departure for hea-\
ven, to publisn for ever the glory of Phaebus.\
:\
By the mustard-seed are signified things, which from small and mean begin-\
nings, produce plenty of fruit : wherefore our- Saviqun fays, ee lf ye have faith a grain of mastard-seed, &. For though the seed of this-plant be small, vet,\
being duly husbandedt in good ground, it yields  plant furpassing all others, which\
in  fhort time becomes  tree for fowls of the air to build in : and such is the\
fruitfulness of divinity, which proceeding from small seed, soon becomes  tree,\
the expansion of wfiose branches shades the whole earth, and yields  place for the\
fowls of the air to-lodge in;- or, according to. Hesychius, ee Men taken up with the\
contemplacion ef divine-tkings Ocher:learned nien say, That this. seed implies\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
the wonderful power of God, which, as small and contemptible feed, lies hid in\
the reading of scripture, and despised by many for its tartness; but on chewing,\
strengthens and oleanses the stomach, corrects vapours and humidities disturbing\
the brain, and refines the taste, in order to our more exact search into the writings\
of wise men and divine mysteries : for, according to Horace,\
Nemo ades ferus est, ut non mitescere possit,\
Si modo cultur\'e6 patientem commodat aurem.\
Or,\
The breasts remaining wild we need not fear,\
After good learning has admission there.\
But waving Horacs; our Saviour charges us ee To search the scriptures;\'92\'92 which\
some disciples, on  certain occafion, finding of too sharp and disagreeable  taste,\
thought too hard, and not to be understood; but being prepared with this seed,\
they will appear better to us than we at first expected; dispelling the darkness of\
our understanding, and purging it of all earthly humidities and evil thoughts, till\
with Hagar, we in any distress discover the fountain of living water in the wilder-\
ness of this life, wherewith to refresh and strengthen our fainting souls : more-\
over, the mustard-seed coming up green, and being with difficulty to be rooted\
out after sowing, implies the constant rise and propagation of divine truths : and\
those who have once tried the agreeable taste of the plant, will never be drawn\
from ufing it: this sprig having got root in the heart, will grow and produce seed\
which wild beasts cannot tread down, cold or heat wither, or persecutions extir-\
pate. By the same seed is also signified,  bright and vigilant soul, and an high\
understanding ; for they who are seized with the lethargy, have their heads, after\
shaving, rubbed with it for their recovery : and thus our circumcised hearts are\
likewise with the mustard-seed, cleansed from the lethargy of sin, for conversion.\
Pythagoras once tasting  leaf of this plant, afterwards much admired it, and found\
that its spirits flew upwards, as if alcending to heaven; for the virtue going up\
the nose to the brain, purges it, and clears the understanding.\
Democritus said,\
that  few grains of it boiled with other greens made them soft and tender: let\
us, in like manner, so mix the emblematie mustard-seed with our divine-thoughts,\
that when become tender, they may send  steam and sweet savour up to heaven,\
where our souls, united with God, can no more be affected with hunger, thirst\
or drowsiness, but continually employed in praising the Almighty.\
In this last ordonnance relating to  divine, we have crowded together  great\
variety of objects, only to shew how fruitful this subject is in materials : for di-\
vinity comprising philosophy, physics, dialectica, rhetoric, logic, &. and each of\
these affording plentiful matter, the ingenious artist may, by consulting good au-\

CHAP. IV. Of the Origin, Nature and Quality of the Roman Tri-\
umphal Crowns, and other Rewards of Honour.\
WE learn from history, how noble the ancient Romans were in gratifving\
 the virtue, valour and conduct of their citizens, soldiers and commanders,\
besides their ordinary pay, with triumphal crowns, jewels and other presents, as an\
example to others to tread in the same steps, for the good of their country : and\
we judge this point very proper to be handled next to still life, as it will conduce\
to make the emblematic sense of  good piece more perfect.\
After  commander had gained either  great advantage or victory over the\
enemy in  siege, battle or sea-fight, he according to custom, made an exact in-\
quiry what persons had behaved with the greatest valour and resolution : and then\
placing himself on  stage, raised for that purpose, and returning thanks to the\
gods for the victory obtained, he commended the army in general for their steady\
adherence, and each company in particular which had shewed the greatest courage :\
then naming them one after another, he extolled their valour, stiling them friends\
and lovers of their country, and telling them how highly they obliged the com-\
monwealth by their loyalty and brave behaviour : and thereupon, in the name of\
the senate, he distributed among them many rich presents, consisting of crowns\
of gold and silver, girdles, gold chains, bracelets, rings for ears and fingers, ar-\
mour, shields, pikes, swords, javelins, standards, sine horse furniture, and other\
elegantly wrought warlike instruments ; which none durst use or wear, but those\
who had purchased them in the manner aforesaid. The Roman story abounds\
with such occurrences, but especially Titus Livius, who relates that the consul Pa-\
irius Cursor bestowed gold bracelets among four hundred men, and afterwards\
magnificently rewarded  whole legion. He tells us the same things of Scipio\
when he waged war with Spain and other countries : and we read, Lucius Antontus,\
son of Lucius Fubius Quadratus, was twice dignified by the emperor of Tiberius, with\
gold ornaments for the neck and arms.\
But besides the native valour and military discipline for which the ancient Ro-\
mans were particularly famous, we learn from Pliny and Salinus, that oftentimes \
single person by his virtue and valour obtained all the aforesaid ornaments; as we\
see in Marcus Sergius, who received almost oll those tokens of honour, and even in\
the battles of Thrasimenus and Trebir, and the bloody one at Canna, (in all which\
the Romans were defeated by Hanibal) he obtained  civic crown. It is related of\
this Sergius, that having in battle lost his right hand, and fixed an iron one in its\
place, he so managed with his left, as one day to slay four armed men one after\
another; and that in fights and skirmishies he had received twenty-three wounds\
in the fore-parts of his body : and yet this man is inferior to Lucius Sicinnius Den-\
tat\'e6s,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
tatus, overseer of the city of Rome ; of whom Pliny, Solinus, Valerius Maximus, and\
Aulus Gillius unanimoussy report that his great merit had gained him from the se-\
nate, above three hundred and twenty honorary presents of all forts, and that he\
nine times made his entrance in triumph with the generals, whom by his valour\
and conduct, he had assisted in their conquests; and that he could shew  great\
number of lances and pikes unironed, which as so many tokens of honour fell to\
his share ; as also eighteen gold and eighty-three silver neck-ornaments, twenty-\
five costly horse-furnitures, an hundred and forty bracelets, fourteen civic crowns,\
eight castrenses, three murals, one obsidional, and  know not how many naval\
or rostral crowns: he had received forty-five wounds, and those in his fore-parts\
only; disarmed the enemy thirty-four times, and fought one hundred and twenty\
battles : in  word, he was stiled the Roman Achilles.\
The crowns bestowed on men of particular merit, had degrees of dignity, and\
particular names suiting the nature of the victories; as, corana obsidionalis, cixica,\
triumphalis. ovalis, muralis, navalis and castrensis.\
The corona obsidionalis, or obsidional crown, was the most excellent of all ; for\
when  Roman town or camp, besieged and reduced to extremity, was relieved by\
 Roman captain, the commonwealth rewarded the action in the most noble man\'ac\
ner, viz. This crown, though made of grass, was accounted of more worth than\
if of gold and enriched with precious stones: the grass was pulled up in the field\
of battle, wherefore this crown is said to be sacred to Mars, which Boccatius seems\
to affirm) possibly because the grafs grows mostly in open places and fields of en-\
campment. The great Quintus Fabius was, in reward of his merit, by the general.\
consent of the senate and Roman people honoured with this crown, when in the\
second Punic war he delivered the city from the approaching ruin and extremity\
which Hannibal had brought it to. Amilius Scipio had the same gift in Africa, for\
rescuing the consul Manlius and his forces out of the power of the enemy. Calpur-\
nius obtained the same honour in Sicily ; as did also the incomparable Lucius Sicin-\
nius Dentatus.\
The corona-civica, or civic crown, was given to him who hrd preserved  Roman\
citizen from imminent danger, or released from captivity : this crown was made\
of oak sprigs and leaves with the fruit hanging at it, and by the general\'92 order,\
who gave it to the person set at liberty, put on the deliverer\'92 head : but though \
person had saved  king or other great ally of the Romans from falling into the\
enemies hands, yet he got not this crown which was only due to him who had freed\
 Roman citizen from death or slavery. Pliny says, this crown was also presented\
to him who slew the first of the enemy besieging  Roman town. It was next in\
dignity to the corona obsidionalis, and worn on several occasions, especially on the\
great festivals and solemnities; and in the plays and other public sports, those\
who were honoured withit sat next to the senate, and at their entrance were re-\
ceived by them with all the marks of respect. These persons, with their fathers\
and grandfathers, were entirely exempted from all charges and taxes, as having\
begot sons so beneficial to the commonwealth; they were also at liberty to accept\
or refuse public offices. Several Romans obtained this honour, especially the afore-\
said valiant Lucius Sicinnius Dentatus who fourteen times gloried in it; as Capitolinus\
did\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
did six. The brave Marcas Sergius likewise received it from the senate, and in \
word, all those who in an extraordinary manner had benefited the city or country.\
The famous Cicero was fo erowned by  partieular decree of th\'e8 senate, for having\
happily delivered the city from the imminent danger of the Catiline conspiracy.\
Thefe crowns though seemingly simple, as being made of grafs and sprigs of trees,\
were yet of greater account than thofe of gold and jewels: they were of oak, be-\
cause the acorn was the most ancient food, and because that tree was sacred to Ju-\
piter the tutelar god. The victors in the Capitoline games, instituted by Domitian,\
as also stage-players muficians and poets, were likewise crowned with oak-\
leaves.\
The corona triumphalis, or triumphal crown was given to the general, who hav\'ac\
ing overthrown the enemy in  pitched battle, had thereby either saved  Roman\
ally, or annexed some dominion to the commonwealth ; wherefore he was also in\'ac\
troduced inta the city in triumph riding in  gilt chariot drawn by four, or accor-\
ding to some, six white horses : this crown was made of laurel, faered to Apodlo for\
its greennefs and red berries, and signified that the victory is attended with much\
trouble, danger and bloodfhed. Sextus relates that the soldiers used to follow the\
chariot of the conqueror, also crouned with laurel, to purify them on entering the\
city from the blood of the slain. By the fuffiage of the fenate, the victors in the\
wrestling games were honoured with the same crown : and it was anciently given\
oo men eminent for heroic poetry and eloquence : wherefore Hefiod says, ee The\
musea had crouned him with  sceptre and erown of laurel.  Roman priests\
and footh-sayers. likewise crowned themselves with laurel; even those who followed\
the army wore  sprig of it on their helmet, instead of  feather, because the tree\
was accounted and oakled by them  foretelling one.\
The coronz ovalis, (given to  genenal or other prime person, who had beat the\
enemy with little refistance, or having undertook the war without the exprefs com-\
mand of the senate had gined some considerable fortress, town or place) was made\
of myrtle-leaves,  tree facred to Venus. This crown denoted that the war was car-\
ried on without great bloodshed ; and therefore public rejoicings were made for it,\
but without much triumpb. When  victory was gained over slaves or pirates\
and robbers, the victors had the same sort of crowns, because such enemies were\
judged unworthy of feeling the Roman valour. The principal generals who ob-\
tained this, and the triumphal crowns aforesaid,  fhall mention among the\
triumphs.\
The coroua muralis, or mural crown, was the reward of  soldier or officer, who\
in asfaulting  town of the enemy, first advanced  ladder, and valiantly mounted\
the walls and made way for conquest. This: crown was of gold, reprefenting\
the battlements of the town-wall they had conquered; or else being like that\
which the poets afcribe to Cybele, the mother of the gods or Mother Earth ; round\
it were engraven lions, the emblems. of valour and generosity. Suetonius relates,\
that common soldiers received it as well as captains and generals, on  public\
testimony from others, that they first gained the top of the enemies walls. Manhus\
Capitolinus was, according to Pliny, first honoured with this crown : and &ipio gave\
it\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
it to  Trebellius and Sextus Digitus, on their jointly first mounting the enemies\
walls.\
The caroua navalis, or naval crown, was given to him who in  sea-engagement,\
first entered into an enemy\'92 ship, and made himself master of it. This crown\
was also of gold, and its circie set round with ships prows, Marcus Varro disdained\
not to receive it at the hands of Pompey the Great, for subduing the sea-rovers.\
Augustus presented it to Marcus Agrippa, on his gaining the upper hand in the sea-\
sight off Scily, as he also did to Sylla, and several others. The senate gave it, to-\
gether with  gold shield and other honourable gifts to the emperor Claudius, for\
having soon after he obtained the imperial dignity, vanquished three hundred thou-\
fand barbarians, in rebellion, against the empire, and sunk two thousand of the ene-\
mies ships.\
The same crown was the present of the ancient Athenians to those who fitted out\
ships of war for the public service, or first. landed and intrenched on the enemies\
ground.\
The Romans in process of time, placed an hedge-hog on the circle of this crown,\
because that creature\'92 defence lying in his sxin wherein he rolls himself up, he\
was esteemed the emblem of  sea-fight. This crown is ascribed to Diana, or the\
moon, as she inffuences the sea and its floods.\
The corona castrensis, was given by the chief commander, to him who in battle\
first entered the enemies camp. This crown was  gold circle, to which were af-\
fixed palisades of the same metal. They also had it who first destroyed the pali-\
sades of the enemy, and th\'e8reby opened  door for victory. This crown was\
the reward of  great number of Romans in those times of valour.\
Besides these degrees of honour, the Romans bestowed several privileges on those\
who excelled in warlike atchievements, causing them in the public pleadings, to\
fit in the sella cuyulis, or the pretor\'92 ivory chair, as we read of the great Scipie; and\
it often happened since all things centered in the voice and consent of the people,\
that some of the soldiery were invested with greater power and privileges. All\
generals who by conquest had enlarged the empire, were allowed to set up their\
statues in the consular dress. Augustus, to eternize the memories of all such gene\'ac\
rals as had augmented the state, ordamed, that next to the gods, the first veneration\
should be paid to them ; and for that purpose built  gallery in his palace, wherein\
to set 'their statues with all their honorary titles, notifying by proclamation, that\
he did this for bimself and succeslors, as an example to posterity to imitate the\
virtues and valour of such illustrious personages. Moreover it was  laudable and\
constant custom of the senate, to affign the children of fuch as fell in battle, the\
liberal enjoyment of the pay of their deceafed parents ; and to the old and maimed\
soldiers, as many lands in the provinces they conquered, as would comfortably\
support them and their families for the remainder of their lives. On this footing,\
the city of Seville in Spain and the fruitful country round it, were made  Roman\
colony by Julius Casar, and Corduba and several other places in divers parts of the\
world were applied to the same purpose. In  word, Roman services never missed\
 reward ; and for this reason the commonwealth produced more brave men than\
any other nation whatsoever ;. every one exerting himself to attain all the degrees\
of\
\
\
\
\
\
\
of honour by the strictest virtue. But on the other hand, the vicious and coward-\
ly were in proportion to their offences, as severely punissied, either by depriva-\
tion of their honourable offices and future hopes, or else by being whipped with\
rods till the blood came, or loaden with irons and madt slaves. Titus Livius re-\
lates, that  troop of Appius Claudius, cowardly deserting  certain post which they\
were set to guard, was rigoroussy punished, by every tenth man\'92 being put to\
death according to lot, without respect of persons. Julius Frontinus writes, that\
Marcus Antonius caused  certain troop who had not dulv defended  town-wall\
and fortification, to undergo the same fate. There were many other methods for\
punishing the disobedience of the Roman soldiery, which  shall pafs by, and con-\
clude with Horace.\

CHAP. . Of the Solemnities of the Roman Triumphs.\
TWO motives generally incite  man to do great things, either in times of\
peace or war; to wit, honour and immortal fame, or riches and profit.\
Generous souls always aspire at the former, and reject the latter, as below them.\
The Roman governinent knew perfectly well how to make its advantage of these in-\
ducements, in the encouragements given to its subjects; and we shall begin with\
the triumphs, by which they honoured and rouzed the valiour of their heros.\
The triumph was an entrance and welcome of  general, by decree of the se-\
nate after an happy expedition and the conclusion of  war, whereby, in the\
most solemn and pompous manner they shewed him their great esteem. On\
the day of entry, the inhabitants of all the towns flocked to Rome, and the whole\
citv, temples, streets, gates, houses and windows were hung with all sorts of\
costly stuffs, in gold, silver, and silk, and beautifully decked with great variety of\
green branches and flowers. In  word, nothing was wanting to shew either the\
power, magnificence or joy of the Romans on this occasion. The senate, clergy,\
nobility and most eminent citizens (and therefore the greatest part of Rome) richly\
dressed, met the conqueror without the town gates. He sat in an ivory chair,\
called sedes curulis, in  gold chariot sparkling with precious stones, and drawn\
cither by four or six white horses magnificiently equipped, and was dressed in \
garment of purple and gold, called toga palmata, crowned with laurel and the staff\
of\
\
\
\
\
\
\
of command in his hand, or else  winged image of Victory holding  crown of\
laurel or  palm branch.\
Sometimes this figure was placed behind him, holding\
in its right hand  crown of laurel over his head, as we see it both ways in the\
ancient bass reliefs and medals. The prisoners of war dressed like slaves, and\
with shorn heads, and the king or general, with the most eminent of the van-\
quishied were led in fettered couples before the chariot, which the Roman legions-\
followed in troops or companies, on foot and horse-back in their order, richly\
armed, and with their pikes and lances twined with laurel, as  token of general\
joy ; but they who had most singulized themselves in valour, marched on each\
side of the chariot with crowns of laurel on their heads, and palm branches in\
their hands. Before the conqueror went likewise some carriages laden with the\
arms, banners, gold and silver vases, jewels, gold and silver coin, taken as booty\
from the eneniy, together with the gifts and presents he had received from the\
friends and allies of the Romans. Next came some castles and towers of wood, ele-\
gantly carved, resembling the towns and fortresses gained of the enemy. In their\
passage the army feigned some battles, in so lively  manner as thereby to affect\
the spectators with all sorts of paffions, as forrow, joy, and fright. The variety\
of those sights was so great and excessive as to spin out the cavalcade for three or\
four days; and being arrived at the capital, all the arms. and booty, called Ma-\
nubiae, taken from the enemy, were hung up and deposited in the temple of Ju-\
piter, as an eternal memorial of the virtue of the conquerers. Here the senate re-\
turned them thanks for the service done to their country, and commonly chusing\
the victor as  coajutor in the government, the joy concluded with  magnificent\
entertainment. But for forming  better idea of these triumphs, and the order\
therein observed, Ishall, as far as my memory will permit, give some examples\
of them out of the Roman histories.\
Plutarch describes the triumph voted to Paulus Amilias, for his victory over the\
great Perseus, king of Macedonia, in this manner.\
First, the people of Rome and the neighbouring towns magnificiently dressed,\
appeared at the doors and windows in the balconies, garrets and on tops of\
houses in great multitudes, as spectators of the solemnity. All the temples in\
Rome richly adorned, were set open. The houses and streets were wonderfully\
garnished with all sorts of costly hangings and filled with greens, flowers, choice\
perfumes, and  thousand other fine and delightful things. And as the concourse\
of people was very great, men with staves were appointed to make and preseve \
lane or passage through them, for the march of the triumphers. The first day\
was spent in the procession of the banners, standards, ensigns, statutes, colosses,\
pictures, and figures, all placed on carriages elegantly painted, and slowly driven.\
The second day was taken up with the passage of the bright armour of the van-\
quishied king and Macedonians, placed on neat chariots or carriages made for that\
purpose. To these succeeded three thousand men, partly carrying the gold and\
silver coin in three hundred and fifty large silver dishes and vases, each weighing\
three talents, and carried by four men. The remainder of these men bore\
fountains and stately vases of filver, artfully wrought. On the third day appeared\
the first company, preceded by  great number of pipers, drums, hautboys and\
trumpets,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
trumpets, making  warlike mufic, as if preparing for an onset. These were\
followed by  hundred and twenty cows, decked with gilt horns and sacred linen\
coverings, and all sorts of green garlands wreathed with flowers, led for victims,\
by beautiful voung men richly dressed, and succeeded by  company of children,\
carrying gold and silver dissies for the use of the sacrifice. After these came the\
bearers of the gold vases with gold coin, in numberseventy-two, followed by several\
great officers of the retinue of Antigonus and Seleucus, late kings of Mucedonia, and\
even of Perseus himself,carry ing the excessive large gold vessel, weigh ing ten talents,\
and enriched with all sorts of precious stones and diamonds, which was made\
by Amilius\'92 express order. Next to these appeared the body-chariot of the con-\
quered king, and therein his coat of arms, diadem, or royal head-band, crown\
and ceptre. Then followed the children of the unhappy prince, attended by \
great numnber of his courtiers, as stewards, secretaries, and other such domestics,\
weeping and lamenting their slavery in such  manner, as, considering the vicitude\
of human affairs, to raise compassion in the spectators; especially the sight of the\
three innocent children, two sons and  daughter, who by reason of their tender\
age, were insensible of their unhappy condition. After these appeared the father\
dressed in black, according to the custom of his country, and walking full of\
terror and concern on this occasion. Next to him came his friends, favourites,\
and confidents, who fixing their eyes onhim, and bitterly weeping, moved many\
of the Romans themselves with tears in their eyes to pity both their and the king\'92\
forrowful condition. To these fucceeded the gold crowns which the ancient free\
cities had presented to the conquerer, as  gratulation for his victory : and then\
came Amilius himself, sitting on  gold triumphal chariot, dressed in  purple\
garment richly wrought with gold, with  larurel branch in his hand, and \
crown of the same on his head. He was followed by the army, horse and foot,\
orderly marshalled under their proper ensigns, having garlands of laurel and palm\
branches in their hands, and singing hymns in praise of the victor and victory.\
Thus Paulus Amilius made his triumphal entrance into the famous city of Romt,\
where he offered the booty in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and returned the\
god thanks for his victory and triumph.\
All other triumphs were managed much in the same manner, with abatement\
of some circumstances, according to the pleasure of the general who was honoured\
with them.\
And, though we find the solemnities regulated by laws, precisely directing in\
what manner, at what time, and through what gates and streets the cavalcade\
was to pafs ; yet, as for the plays, shews, and other less appertenances, they were\
lessened or augmented at the will of the victor, with  liberty to chuse the chariot.\
History tells us, that the chariot was commonly drawn by four white horses; but\
we also find bulls used for the same purpose. Pompy the Great, having subdued\
Africa, made his entry on  chariot drawn by elephants. Suctonius relates, that\
Julus Caesar triumphed in one with forty elephants. The emperor, Gordianus\
triumphed in the same manner. Caius Marius having subjected Afiica and extend-\
ed the Roman jurisdiction into Agypt, was drawn by the same kind of beasts. Sci-\
po Agricanus triumphed with-elephants for the same reafon. The emperor Augustas\
on\
\
\
\
\
\
\
on his victorious return from the East, and ending the war with Anthony, was, by\
the confent of the senate and people of Rome drawn by four elephants. The em-\
peror Vespasian had the same honour on finishing several great wars in the East;\
the elephants denoting the. conquest of countries, where those creatures breed.\
Flavius, in his histories, tells us, that the emperor Aurelian, who was king of the\
Goths, made his entrance on  chariot drawn by stags. But, Marcus Antonius made\
use of tame lions, intimating, that in the civil wars, he would make the most va-\
liant submit to his commands : which Cicero in his Orations, called Philippicae,\
objects him, saying, That his triumphal chariot with lions, implied an arbitrary\
man aiming at monarchy.\
The Roman generals when they triumphed, had also  custom of carrying one\
or more young children in their chariots ; as we gather from Cicero\'92 speech before\
Murena. Some used to be attended with  great number of strange wild beasts,\
as lions, bears, tigers, rhinoceroses, panthers, dromedaries, and such like ; as\
Josephus, in his histories of the Vespasians, mentions. Others had vocal and instru-\
mental music and other diversions. Among these triumphs, those of Pompy the\
Great, Casar, the two Scipio\'92, brothers, and several emperors had something\
singular, as Blondus in his Treatise, intitled Rome Triumphant, largely discourses.\
The triumphing conquerors were likewise allowed to set up their statues in temples\
and public places, and to erect columns and costly structures of marble, called\
Arcus Triumphales, whereon were carved in bass relief their battles and victories\
for eternal monuments to posterity ; remains whereof we see to this day at Rome\
and elsewhere. Herein the Romans imitated the ancient Greeks, who, for  memo-\
rial of great actions, set up trophies, made in the following manner.\
In the place of victory, they fixed the highest tree to be found in the neigh-\
bourhood, and then chopping of the branches, they, in honour to the victor,\
hung on the remaining limbs, the arms of the vanquished, calling that tree, Tro-\
phaeum, from the Greek word Tropi, which signifies overthrow, slight and giving\
way, because the enemies were in that place put to flight. The Romans afterwards\
made use of them for the same purpose; for Sallustius in his Memoirs relates that\
Pompey having conquered the Spaniards, planted his trophies on the tops of the\
highest Pyrenees. And this custom afterwards grew into such esteem, that they\
were made of stone.  But according to scripture, the usuage was very ancient\
among other nations ; for it appears in chap.  of  Sam. that Saul having\
vanquished Agag, king of the Amalelites, and being come to Mount Carmel, set up\
an Arcus Triumphalis, or Place. In  word, the honour of triumphing was ac-\
counted by the Romans as  token of the highest esteem ; and therefore, to obtain\
it, their generals spared for no toils or dangers in warlike atchievements. Add to\
this, the riches commonly arising from such glory, by the presents made them\
by the allies and the booty of the enemy.\
In my opinion, historians have described the matter so circumstantially, on\
purpose to put princes and governors in mind of rewarding the deserts of their\
generals, soldiers and men of merit, and that the uuskilful, cowardly, and unfit\
for command iight not be ranged with those who willingly sacrificed their for-\
tunes, capacities and bodily labours to the benefit of their country. Accordingly\
to\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
to Paulus Orofiris three hundred and twenty persons have been honoured with the\
Roman triumph, of whom the emperor Probut, in whose feign the fabric of the\
Roman monarchy began to decay, was the last.\
Let us here subjoin  Grecian triump. Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, or the il-\
lustrious king of Sria, having heard of the aforesaid glorious triumph of Paalus\
Amilius, was so puffed up with ambition, that he resolved to make  fort of one\
furpassing it in magnificence. To which end he caused proclamation to be made\
throughout his kingdom, that at  certain time, he would at Daphnes hold  grand\
and uncommon tournament : which curiofity drew out of Greece and the neigh-\
bouring countries  great concourse of people ; and the cavalcade was in the\
following manner.\
First, marched five thousand Grecian young men armed Roman like, followed\
by as many Mysians finely habited after their fafhion. Next appeared three\
thousand Thracians and five thousand Galatians, followed by  vast number of other\
nations, called, for their silver shields, Argyraspides. After these came two hun-\
dred and fifty ranks of sword-players, called by the Romans, gladiators ; and then\
 thousand knights, with chaplets of gold about their heads, and their horses\
costly equipped with gold embroidered housings, and gold and silver bridles.\
These were followed by  thousand other knights, called companions, afsociated\
with some of the king\'92 friends and confidents. Then appeared  thousand\
noblemen on foot, and after them  thousand other knights, called the king\'92\
troops. Next came one thousand five hundred knights in gold armour over\
which they had coats of armour richly embroidered with gold and silver, and art-\
fully adorned with all sorts of animals. To these succeeded an hundred chariots,\
each drawn by fix horses, followed by forty others, each with four. After these\
appeared  chariot with elephants, followed by thirty-six of the same kind of\
creatures, and those by eight hundred boys, having garlands aud crowns orna-\
mented with gold in their hands. Next came  thousand fat oxen with eight\
hundred Indian elephants teeth. After these were carried an infinite number of\
idols and figures of deceased persons who had been famous for arts and sciences,\
dressed in gold and silver stuffs adorned with precious stones, with their names,\
dignities, and actions written on the pedestals. Then came slaves bearing idols,\
representing night and morning, mid-day and evening, and an infinite number\
of gold and silver vessels of great value. Next appeared six hundred of the king\'92\
pages dressed in gold stuffs, followed by two hundred ladies carrying gold boxes,\
silled with all manner of rich perfumes and ordoriferious balm, and these by forty\
sedans of massy silver, carrying as many ladies, and those by eighty gold sedans\
with ladies dressed in gold, silver and jewels. The streets abounded with all sorts\
of rich oils, balms and perfumes. This cavalcade lasted thirty days successively,\
attended with plays, tournaments and shews ; during which time every person,\
after perfuming himself, was allowed to fit at the royal tables, one thousand five\
hundred in number, and to feast at the, king\'92 expence. To proceed to the\
Romans.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Another solemnity obtained among them, cafled ovatio ; which was inferior\
to the triumph in fome of its requisites: for instance, if the victor was not of\
consular or proconsular dignity, or had met with little resistence from the enemy,\
or gained the victory without great blood-shed, or had overcome people of fmal\
worth, or, as we faid, speaking of the corona ovalis, when the war was under-\
taken without the express command of the senate, &. in such cases, the victorg\
were solemnly welcomed with the ovatio, in the following manner.\
The general entered the city on horse-back, or as anciently, on foot, crowned\
with myrtle, ( tree facred to Venus) because the victory was gained not in \
martial manner, but in  manner becoming that goddess and women, as Aulus\
Gellius says; and the troops in their possession appeared not in arms, and instead\
of druins, trumpets, and other warlike instruments, their music was flutes and\
other soft founds. The general entered with the booty in an orderly manner,\
followed by his army, and the senate solemnly received him without the city-gates\
highly commending his actions. Histories tells us, that several great generals\
sued for and accepted this honour. The first was Posthumius Libertus, on his having\
subdued the Sabines, and next Marcus Marcellus after the conquest of Svracuse. Sue-\
tonius telates, that Augustus, after the battle of Philippi, and on finilhing the war\
in Sicily, obtained that honour. And Pliny says, that several generals denied by\
the senate the honour of the great triumph, were decreed the ovatio ; which was\
so called, from the general\'92 offering  fheep, in Latin ovis, when he came to the\
is derived from the shouts of the people, who used to cry, Oel or else Ove \
Whatever the truth is, this solemn entrance was always called by the Romans,\
ovatio.\
Other triumphs of these people Ishall for brevity omit speaking of. He who\
wants further information may read Appianus Alexandrinus and Ammiannus Marcellinus,\
the former describing the triumph of Scipio Africanus, and the latter that of the\
emperor Constantius.\
CHAP. VI. Of the Manner of the four principal and public\
Grecian Games, and to whose honour instituted.\
HHE antiquity and manners of the Grecian games being somewhat unknown\
to many curious artists, Ithink it will be acceptable to give  fhort descrip-\
tion, as well as  can, of the four principal games so highly and so often extolled\
by the Greek and Roman writers.\
The first and principal were called the Obympic games, held near the city of\
Obmpia, in the province of Elis, and instituted in honour of Jupiter Olympius, by\
the Idan Hercules and his four brothers, P\'9coneus, Idas, Jasius and Epimedes, meet-\
ing together from Mount lda in Candia, and being five brethren, they were stiled\
the\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
ldaan dactyls. These games being celebrated every five years with great solem-\
nity, the ancients therefore reckoned their time by Obympiads, thereby under-\
standing  period of five years. They consisted of five sorts of exercifes, viz.\
running, wrestling, boxing, throwing the coit, and leaping. The place of exer-\
cise was fenced in with pales, and no spectator was suffered to come\
within it.\
Some pretend these games were instituted by Jupiter, after he had destroyed the\
giants who attempted to storm heaven ; and that Apollo had got the preference in\
out-running Mercury ; that Mars bore away the prize in wrestling, boxing, &.\
Others prove, that each of the aforesaid bretheren invented his game and ex-\
ercise, and that being five in number, they were from the five fingers named\
dactyls, Dactylos in Greek signifying  finger.\
The Greeks called these five exercises Pentathlon, and the Lattins Quinquertium.\
Two of them had  dependence on the legs, viz. running and leaping; two on the\
arms, as coits and boxing, and the wrestling respected both arms and legs. The\
victor in all the five exercises was by the Greeks called Pancratiastes ;  word com-\
pounded of Pan and Kratos, signifying  bestowing  whole force of the body.\
prize was adjudged to him who gained his point most dextrouslsy. Accordingly,\
they struck with fists and elbows, kicked, bit, scratched, and sprained the\
fingers, hands and other parts of the body. They even endeavoured to thrust out\
each others eyes with their thumbs. In short, no artifice was omitted for gaining\
the victory.\
We shall briefly relate in what manner the aforesaid five excercises were\
performed.\
The circus, wherein they run on foot was originally  stadium, or six hundred\
geomitrical feet in length : but in the fourth Olympiad they doubled it. This\
race was at first on foot, and in alight dress; but afterwards on horse-back and in\
armour. men called runners on foot, were also admitted armed srom top to\
toe ; this excercise being judged very proper for the bodies of warriors. The\
first victor herein was Demaratus of Herea : and the hymns sung in their honour,\
sufficiently testify their running in armour. But the first who got the prize in run-\
ning without armour, was Chorabus of Elis, after  long contest with him about\
it. Arrachion of Phigalia obtained the prize in the second and third excercifes; and\
Polycrates of Messene  man of noble extraction, got much honour and glory in\
the fourth wherein he was victor.\
The wrestling was undertaken after the body had been thoroughly anointed\
in order to prevent  gripe, and then daubed with fine dust to dry the sweat.\
Thus prepared, the wrestlers entered the lists, and began with seizing the hands,\
then the arms and body under the short ribs, &. Thus endeavouring by va-\
rious methods of strength and dexterity in kicking, pufhing, and othet tricks to\
fling one another on their backs ; for  fall on the belly went for nothing. Be\'ac\
fore they entered the ring they caused their parts to be soundly rubbed, to make\
them more supple and agile.\
Boxing\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Boxing and fighting with flings were the most dangerous exercifes. The for-\
mer was anciently performed with ox-leather thongs tied about the hands, by\
But\
which with wonderful activity they dealt each other with very hard blows.\
the slings consisted of small leather straps, armed at the ends with little leaden balls,\
the blow whereof when it happened on the head, laid the adversary dead.\
The coit was  flat, round, heavy piece of stone or lead, to try the force of\
armsand hands, and to see who could sling highest and furthest : an excercise still\
in use in many places to this day ; but with this difference, that the ancients with\
 leg lifted up, threw the coit at  mark set up on  small pyramid, and resembling\
 pine-apple.\
The fifth excercise was lefs perilous, as consisting only of divers manners of\
leaping.\
The ancient garlands or crowns given as  prize to the victor on these occasions,\
were made of olive leaves, but they varied according to the times; for they\
were afterwards composed of couch grass, willow, laurel, myrtle, oak, palm\
and wild parsley leaves ; as Plutarch in the life of Cato Uticensis relates. But when\
made of olive leaves, they chose  select kind called Calistephancs, . . beauti-\
ful crown, having hanging branches like the myrtle, very proper for twisting\
garlands. The leaves of such garland differed much from others, in that being\
white without, the green when twisted was inward ; whereas the others were\
white within, and appeared green without. Hercules and his bretheren first\
brought this plant into Greece from the northern countries, as Pausanias in his\
Olympus tells us.\
The Phythian games were instituted long before the lsthmian, yet after the Olym-\
pic, and celebrated in honour of Apollo for his victory over the frightful serpent\
Python. Some think they were so called from Pythos, the place of celebra-\
tion, or else from the Greek word Pythestai, to consult ; because they there con-\
sulted the oracle, in order to know the events of things to come. The exercifes\
in these games only differed in the Olympic in this, that the Phythian were performed\
under the sound of all sorts of vocal and instrumental music. These games from\
time to time, had several alterations in form and solemnity, after the institution of\
the Pancratium or Quinquertiam: and it is related, that in the first \'e0 Pythiades,\
wherein the most illustrious heroes and gods of the ancients, entered the lists for\
the sake of the prize; Castor prevailed in the horse-race, Pollux in boxing, Callais\
in running on foot, Zethees in running in compleat armour, Peleus in throwing.\
the coit, Telamon in wrestling, and Hercules in the Pancratium, or all the games.\
In each of these games and exercifes the victors were crowned with laurel,\
which in particular was consecrated to them; because the ancients believed, by\
what they have feigned of Peneus\'92 daughter, with whom Apollo was so much en-\
amoured, and who was metamorphosed into that tree, that the god took  singu-\
lar delight in it. But others will have the institution of the Phythian games to\
be long before Apollo\'92 amour with the beautiful Daphne: and before the laurel\
 Pythiades signifies  certain number of years in the Pythian games.\
bore\
\
\
\
\
\
\
bore that distinction, both the triumphal and victors crowns and garlands were\
made of palm or oak-leaves ; as Ovia in his first Book of Metamorphofis teftifies.\
Plutarch and Pausanias relate, that Theseus on his return from Creia, adorned the\
victors in the games instituted in honour of Apollo with garlands of palm,  of praise and renown ; for the laurel was not known till after the Phythin\
games were settled, and when known it gave rise to the aforesaid fable of Daphne;\
and both the tree and leaves being found of so. extraordinary  make and nature,\
illustrious victors and men of learning were commonly crowned with it. Some\
again say, that Apollo affected the leaves and blossoms of the apple-tree, before he\
chose the laurel, and therefore the victors in running, wrestling, &. ought to be\
crowned with that; as the poet Archias in his Mytholog. lib.  cap.  relates,\
But Lucianus afferts, that though in the Phythian games, the garlands of laurel be-\
gan to prevail, yet they were intermixed with sine yellow apples Some writers\
even affirm, that the laurel of Delphos bore such large berries or fruit, as almoft\
to gain\'92the name of apples. But the true reason of this difference proceeded\
from the several alterations made both in the prizes and times of holding those\
games ; for originally they were celebrated every ninth year (from the number of\
nymphs feigned by the ancients, to come from Mount Parnassus, to offer to Apcllo\
on his having overcome the Delphic monster Python) and afterwards every\
fifth.\
The Nemaan games were kept in  wood of that name, situate between Phliuns\
and Cleona, two cities of Achia, in honour and memory of Archemorus, otherwise\
called Opheltes son of Lycurgus, on account of his being killed by  serpent in this\
wood. Which accident some relate thus : Oedepus having through mistake mar-\
ried his own mother, the widow of Laus king of Thebes, begat on her two fons,\
Eteocles and Polynice to whom he resigned the royal dignity, on condition they\
governed by turns: but Eteocles as the eldest, having obtained the first year\'92 admi\'ac\
Fistration, refused to admit his brother as  partner to govern the second year ;\
who thereupon in discontent, soliciting the aid of Adrastus king of Argos, whose\
daughter, called Argia, he married; the king in conjunction with his other son-in-\
law zydeus, raised  great army, in order to wage war with the Thebans and bring\
them to reafon. The issue of-this war was the death of the two \'92others in \
duel; and their bodies according to custom, being laid on  large pile of wood\
to be burnt, the flames happened to divide and seperate, as if they bore witness\
of their immortal hatred of the two bretheren in their life-times, which ceased not\
with their deaths. Now in the army which Adrastus sent to Polynices\'92 assistance\
were seven commanders, who being arrived in the island Lemnos, pertaining to\
Thracia, and seized with an extreme thirst, met Hypsipyle, carying in her arms\
the child Opheltes, son of Lycurgus. (priest of Jupiter) and Euridice, whom being\
 native of that country, they intreated to shew them where to get some water.\
Whereupon she in haste, vet fearful of laying the child on the ground, as for-\
bidden by the oracle, before he could walk, set him naked on the grafs by  bed\
of wild parsley near  fountain, where  serpent lying perdue, suddenly wound it-\
self about the childs neck and throttled him, while she was gone to draw water.\
The commanders being apprised of this accident, killed the serpent, and to solace\
the\
\
\
\
\
\
\
the father, instituted in honour of his son so suddenly lost the aforesaid games, to\
beheld every third year: wherefore originally only soldiers and their descendants\
were admitted to them, though in procefs oftime they were free for every person.\
Theagnes in his Memoirs of Agina, Book  chap.  relates, that Hypsipyle fled from\
Lemnes to Nemda, on account of  combination among the women to kill the men,\
only out of jealousy, because by the instigation of Venus, highly ineensed against\
them, they had to do with other women. Accordingly they all put their de-\
sign in practice, except Hypsipyle, who endeavoured to save her father\'92 life by\
hiding him in  baker\'92 trough. (This happened soon after the departure of the\
Argonaats, and their arrival in this island. ) But being discovered, they flung him\
with the trough into the sea and condemned Hypsipyle to die for not agreeing to\
their general resolution. She hearing this made her escape, but in her flight,\
was taken by pirates and sold for  slave to Lycurgus, whose wife Euridice, de-\
firing fhe might be put to death for the misfortune of her child, she hid herself in\
 remote and solitary place ; where being discovered by the sooth-sayer Amphiaraus,\
to the two sons of Euridice, Thoas and Eunoenus, who made diligent search after\
her, she was through their intercession, and the commanders testimony of her\
innocence, pardoned and re-admitted into favour. Others will have it that Her-\
cules instituted these games, on having killed in the wood Nemaa  terrible lion,\
who devoured all before him and laid the country waste. Some say they were set\
up in honour and memory of Archemorus; but that Hercules after having slain the\
Nemaan lion, with whose skin he covered his head and body, broughth them un-\
der \'e0 regulation, and dedicated them to Jupiter ; appointing their solemnization\
to be every three years, on the  day of the month. called by the Corinthians,\
Panemos, and by the Athenians Boedromibs answering to our month of August: and\
the rather, as Theseus had in that month happily vanquished the Amazons. But\
oth\'e8rs are of opinion that it was done in memory of Opheltes, who by his own death\
presaged the fate of the Lacedemonians, at war with the Thebans. Yet some think\
that 'this was another Opheltes, son of Euphetas and Geusa, who being laid on the\
ground by his nurse, while she went to shiew some commanders  fountain, was\
killed by  serpent.\
The Nemaan games were therefore instituted in memory and consolation of\
Lycurgus, Etridice, and Opheltes, and the judges who determined the prizes, were\
dressed in black and mourning garments. For Opheltes was afterwards called Ar-\
chemorus, because Amphiaraus had at his birth presaged him an early and untime-\
ly death. Archo signifying in Greek begining, and Moros death; as if they said\
ee Dying shortly after his birth:, in which sense speaks the poet,\
ee Naseentes morimur, finisque ab origine pendet ,'\
That is, ee We begin dying from our births, and our beginnings and ends have\
an inseparable union.\
The excercises in these games were the same as in others: but the victors\
were crowned with green parsley, mostly used in funerals, to perpetuate the me-\
end\
mory of Archemorus. Whether the Greek Selinon, with us common parsley\
the\
\
\
\
\
\
\
the petroselinon, or stone parsley be the same, let the botanists determine. Originally\
the victors were crowned with garlands of olives; but after the defeat of the\
Medes they began to be presented with one of wild parsley, in memory of those\
who were slain in that bloody battle : and afrer this regulation, the said herb, in-\
stead of crouning the head on occasions of joyful meetings, served only in times\
of sorrow and mourning. For, according to the Greek saying, this herb is very\
earthy, as spreading  long time over the ground, and often bearing to be dug up\
in order to get \'e0 deeeper root. The seed or it also on sowing, is longer than others\
in coming up; wherefore it was necessary, that the mortal Greek Ophelies, after-\
wards (as we have said) called Art hemorus, should be crowned with earthly honour.\
For of the four principal games which we handle in this chapter, two according\
to the poet Archias, are sacred to mortals, and the others to deities: the mortals\
are Archemorus and Meliceria, whois also called Palamon; and the gods are Jupi-\
ter and Apollo. The wild parsley is not without reason appropriated to these\
ganies; because some think it sprung from the blood of the child, killed by the\
serpent; yet this contradicts these who say, that Hypsipyle laid the child on this\
plant ; which therefore was alreedy known at that time. We shall now proceed\
to the Isthmian games.\
This solemnity was performed at night in the Isthmus of Corinth, parting Morea\
from the continent of Greece ; and had rather the face of  facrifice and its mysteries\
than of  festival. It was instituted by Sisyphas son of Aolus, on his finding there-\
on the ground, the dead body of his kinsman Melcerta.\
Plutarch writes, that Theseus, after having killed the bull of Minos, and performed.\
other great exploits, errected  pillar in the lsthnius of Peloponnesus, where in imi-\
tation of Hercules, who consecrated the Olympic games to Jupiter, he instituted\
the Isthmian in honour of Neptune.\
Yet according to Pausanias and others, these games were not set up for that\
reason, but in remembrance of Melicerta\'92 dead body found there unburied ;\
touching which there goes this story : Learchus and Meliceria were the sons of\
Alhamas and Ino. Athamas made raging mad by Tifiphone at Juno\'92 command,\
attempted to kill his wife instead of  wild beast, tearing the young Learches out\
of her arms, beat out his brains against the stones. Ino affrighted hereat, either\
through sorrow, or the insluence of Tisiphone\'92 poisoned serpents, betook herself\
with the other child Melicerta to the mountains Geranes, situated between Megara\
and Corinth. But she sinally also yeilding to rage, cast herself with the child\
from the rock Moluris into the sea; where she was metamorphosed into  sea\
nymph, and called Leucotha, and he into  sea god, under the name of Palamon\
The dead body of Melicerta being afterwards brought on shore by  dolphin,\
Sisiphas king of Crinth, who was bis uncle, commanded him to be buried in the\
isthmus, and  circus to be there erected for the celebration of the aforesaid\
games.\
But the poet Aachias says, that on Ino\'92 slinging herself with Meliceria into the\
sea,  dolphin landed their bodies on the \'92chaenuntian shore, where Amphimuchus\
and Lonacinus took them up and brougnt them to Sispphus king of Corinth; and\
then-\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
then they were deified, she by the name of Lezrothea, which in Greek signifies the\
white goddess, and he by that of Palaemon.\
Leucotha, called by the Latins Matuta, is day-break ; and Palamon, or Portunus,\
the vehemence of storms and billows ; for pallein, in Greek, signifies to toss, move,\
and pusn violently against each other ; whence comes the name of Palamon : he\
was the son of Matuta, or Morning ; because the winds commonly begin to arise\
with day-break.\
Others tell us, that Melicerta\'92 dead body being cast on the shore of the Isthmus,\
and lying unburied, it caused  great plague; and that, on consulting the oracle,\
touching the cause of the infection, answer was made, that Melicerta ought to have\
\'b0  magnificent funeral, and solemn races and games should be appointed to his ho\'ac\
nour and memory. The Corinthians obeyed, and the body was accordingly taken\
up by Amphimacus and Donacinus, and in an honourable manner buried in the place\
aforesaid; and the games and funeral rites being instituted, the plague ceased ;\
but afterwards it broke out afresn on their omiffion of the solemnity; wnerefore, in\
this their utmost distress, the people, re-consulting the oracle, were told they must\
for ever celebrate the games they had begun in memory of Meliceria, and distri-\
bute the rewards to the victors. But Musaeus, describing these games, says, that\
the custom was to perform, every five years, two forts of games and races in the\
Isthmus; one in honour of Neptune, near his temple; and the other in memory of\
Melicerta.\
The prize in the Isthmian games, was originally  crown of parsl\'e9y, elegantly\
wreathed; but afterwards,  garland of pine-leaves, on account of their neigh-\
bourhood and agreement with the seas. Besides these crowns, the victors were\
usually presented on their return, with  palm-branch, as Pausanias says. More-\
over, the conquerors at such times were so much honoured, as to be met by their\
fellow-citizens, and brought some mil\'e9s upon their shoulders. They made not\
their entrance through the common gates, like other people, but triumphantly\
over  stately bridge or passage, made over the walls for that purpose, and their\
names were cut on pillars set up in the public places of the town, to perpetuate\
their memories.\
We shall, to conclude this chapter, subjoin  fhort description of some particu-\
lar garlands or crowns, sacred to the heathenisn deities.\
The Phaonicians, as Euscbius testifies, honoured and worshipped the herbs and\
plants. The Grec\'e8s in imitation of them, rendered almost the same duties, not\
only to trees, but also to herbs and flowers: these maintained that the Charities, or\
Three Graces were the very crowners of Pandora. Pherecydes says, that Saturn was\
crowned before any others : yet, according to Diodorus, Jupiter claims this honour\
for his conquest over the giants : but, not to pretermit the Agyptian monuments,\
Isis first crowned herself with green sprigs and ears of corn; of which, according\
to the Agyptian writer, Leon, she was the inventor.\
The oak and its fruit, as Apollodorus writes, were sacred to the goddess Rhea,\
otherwise called the Earth, that mortals who proceed from it, might wear the\
badges of their universal mother: the same tree was also peculiar to Jupiter, the\
tutelar god.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The pine and its fruit were consecrated to the goddess Cbele, whom the an-\
cients believed to be the mother of all things; because she, carefully containing the\
seed originally given her, does by the warmth of the sun yearly bring forth new\
shoots. The pine-apple in its shape, also resembles  rising flame, and keeps its\
seed in small and separate cells, which by the earth\'92 heat, in time springs up and\
grows. We likewise see  certain medal, with the head of Gbele on one side, and\
 small garland of pine-twigs on the other, and inscribed EMTPNAIAN, . .\
those of Smyrna. The Arcadians believing Pan to be the god of the universe, de-\
dicated the pine-apple to him also.\
Saturn, Jupiter, Apollo and Asculapius were crowned with laurel ; Saturn as the\
god of triumphs; Jupiter, for his victory over the giants ; Apollo, for the love of\
Daphne, metamorphosed into that tree ; though before, the palm was sacred to\
him, on his killing the Delphic dragon; but Asculapius wears it for no other rea-\
son, than that it is useful for several remedies.\
The ancient Romans, on their nona capretinae, or festivals kept monthly, in honour\
of Juno, crowned that goddess with fig-leaves, as  memorial of the city of Rome\
(reduced to the utmoss extremity by the Gauls, who demanded of the senate seve-\
ral noble virgins as hostages) regaining its fre\'ebdom by the contrivance of the vir-\
gin Philoris, who shewing the Romans how to slide down from the walls, by the\
branches of  fig-tree growing thercon, and sacred to Juno, gave them an oppor-\
tunity of falling on the enemy when drunk and asleep (which sne had cunningly\
inticed them to) and by  great slaughter, to obtain  compleat victory over them.\
The pomegranate was consecrated to Juno, by the people of Mycena. The white\
lilly is alfo sacred to her, and therefore called Flos Junonius, or, according to some,\
flos regalis; not so much out of respect to the queen or goddess, but because that\
slower almost surpasses all others in height.\
Minerva who is said to be  virgin, rightfully laid claim to the olive-tree, which\
affects purity and chastity, as well as she.\
 find no trees particularly sacred to Mars; but it is notorious that the herb\
commonly called dog\'92 grass is appropriated to him.\
They who are conversant with poets, know that the myrtle-tree signifies delight\
and  mind richly endowed. The ancients say that tree surpasses all others in ten-\
der and beautiful leaves, and their continual greenness and smell, which recom-\
mends it to Venus, the most beautiful, most tender, and most perfect of the god-\
desses. In- old times, men on festival days used to put into each others hands\
branches of this tree as tokens of joy, and that they should join in chorus : and\
Horace says that in Lent-time, when the earth by her variety of flowers seems to\
rejoice, we ought to adorn our heads with wreaths of myrtle. The apple-tree sig-\
nifying love, is also sacred to Venus; and the ears of corn to Ceres.\
The ivy dedicated to Bacchus, was in great esteem among the Agyptians for being\
always green and not shedding\
its leaves till after harvest: they mostly used it in\
garlands, and the kind bearing\
black-berries was especially consecrated to Bacchus,\
who by that people is called Ofiris, and from whence this green also borrows its\
nanie ; for they called it Cenofiris, . . the plant of Ofiris : and Dionysius, which is\
likewise the name of Bacchus) having carried his victories into India, built there\
Nsa,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Nysa,  large town, and planted it round with ivy to perpetuate his memory : this\
plant is facred to Bacchus, either because he as well as Phaebus is always represented\
youthful; or that the tongue and spirits of father Liber are tied. up, as the ivy\
catches hold of any thing that it comes at : for though Horace says, ee That the\
drunkard is in his cups free from all care, even the greatest poverty,\'92\'92 yet it is as\
true, that the liquor captivates the senses, taking away all power of judging. The\
same plant is likewife an emblem of age, not only for its growing mostly\
near old trees, buildings and ruins, but also as wine which is old and. worked off,\
is highly esteemed : wherefore Pindarus as well as Horace mostly extols it. The\
vine was also sacred to Bacchus ; accordingly he is often represented crowned with\
the twigs thereof: though after his conquest of India, he likewise wore laurel ; for\
he, as well as Saturn, is accounted the god of triumphs. The vine was also pecu-\
liar to Rhea : and the crown of its twigs which adorns the head of Hecate, implies\
only the subtilties and snares which father Faunus, by the operations of wine (lead-\
in men to extravagance) laid for his daughter.\
 he cypress is sacred to Pluto, god of hell, and of the sprigs and leaves of it the\
ancients made garlands. It is reckoned  mournful tree and proper for places of\
burial, because, when once cut, it fhoots no more. Its branches, set in the ground\
near tombs, or carved on them, signify that the deceased endeavoured by prayers,\
to be reconciled to the infernal gods : wherefore Horace says, ee Men are attended\
to hell by no other tree than the unhappy and hateful cypress. Pluto\'92 crown is\
also composed of the herb adianthum, otherwise called capilli veneris. Some have\
crowned him with Narcissus flowers and their leaves;  flower proper for deceased\
persons, on account of the unhappy end of the youth who was transformed into it :\
wherefore Phurnutus says, that the hellisn furies, Alecto, Tisiphone and Megara, hed\
garlands of the same flower about their heads, as servants and executioners of the\
commands of Pluto. The pine-tree has much agreement with the cypress,it being\
also the emblem of death; for, when once cut, like the cypress, it never shoots\
out again ; wherefore, and for its bitterness and sharpness, the pine-apple, both\
in ancient and modern acceptation, signifies death.\
The double-coloured poplar was sacred to Hercules; because naturalists, by this\
hero and the two colours of that tree, imply the two different times which su-\
perintend and govern all things ; for one of the colours being white, signifies the\
day, and the other which is dark, the night. Some have also ranked the poplar\
in the number of unhappy trees ; for, in the isse of Rhodes, the funeral games in\
honcur of Tlepolemus were celebrated, and the performers of them crowned.\
with it.\
The peach-tree was sacred to lsis and to Harpocrates; the plane-tree to the\
Genii; and  garland of flowers to Ariadne. The bacchanals, in celebrating tke\
vine-fcast of Bacchus, were coifed with greens.\
If the curious reader desires further information in this point, he may consult\
the histories of Claudius Saturninus, wherein he will find the origin, causes, qualities,\
and every thing else relating thereto, in such manner as to observe, that there are\
no beautiful flowers, green branches, leaves, roots, &. but what are peculiar to\
the head of some person or other.\

CHAP. VII. Of the Military Dresses and Arms of several Nations,\
particularly of the Greeks and Romans.\
HE distinction of nations cannot be well represented without due regard to\
their warlike accoutrements, dresses and manners.\
It is certain, that many\
painters have been herein very deficient, as appears by their works, who on better\
consideration and greater experience, have afterwards corrected their errors. But\
 mean not, by exposing the mistakes of other men to palliate my own;  have\
had my faults as well, and perhaps greater than they;  am sensible, that even\
in my very best time,  was not free from some great blunders, which to this day\
 am concerned for, and which, though  might conceal,  nevertheless lay open in\
the course of this work : and since  am speaking of mistakes,  shall here ob-\
serve some, as necessary to this chapter.\
Testa, in  print of the dragging of Hector\'92 body, represents Achilles, though \
Greek, with  Roman head-piece, which he posfibly did to keep the light together\
and to preserve the face : he also exhibits both those heroes naked ; and Achilles\
without arms : the sword in his hand makes him look more like  gladiator, than\
 general, and the scabbard by his side has no tie or girdle about his body. How\
can he use the sword, when with one hand he holds the reins of the horfes?\
These things are very improper and unnatural : but perhaps his inducement was,\
that he might shew the beautiful body of the hero with greater advantage. In\
the last place, the town walls appear so low as to be easily reached over.\
Poussin likewise, in the print of the death of Germanicus, has intermixed Greek\
with Roman helmets. Let it not be thought, that we are unjust to the merits op\
such great masters, by so nice an examen of their performances, fince my purpofe\
herein is only by shewing other mens faults, to correct our own. But  am as wil-\
ling to shew mine, as they occur to my memory : witness, my Anens receiving the\
aris of Venus, where  have also made  Roman helmet : and my father, in his re-\
presentation of Seneca, introduces one of Nero\'92 captains standing by him, with \
Greek head-piece. Now, art allows not such liberties either in military furniture\
or any thing else. Each nation has its particular dress, manners and customs.\
How ean we exhibit an Agyptian prospect, without shewing some tokens of that\
country ; as palm-trees, pyramids and people dressed in the Agyprian mode  let me recommend care to every person, and that they do not build too\
much on other mens works. It is better to be nice than negligent. Let us un-\
derstand  thing never fo well, we may yet err through hafte or careleffness.\
Thinking it presumptuous to enumerate all the particulars of the military or-\
der of the ancients. as being largely handled by several authors ; we shall therefore,\
according to our small ability, and for the service of curious artists, only touch\
brieffy\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
briefly on some of the principal matters relating to their arms, believing the re-\
sidue will follow in the course of their practice.  shall begin with the Greeks.\
The Greek foot were divided into two forts, pikemen or heavy-armed, and\
archers or light-armed. The pikemen used  buckler,  fort of boots,  pike\
twenty or twenty-four feet in length, and  sword: the stoutest had for defence, \
Macedonian round shield of four feet diameter. The archers bore bucklers of\
wicker, bows, short pikes and flings : they wore long hair and beards, and hel-\
mets or head-pieces somewhat projecting over the face, handsomely wrought with\
imagery or foliage, set off with plumes and other elegant ornaments : their military\
dresses always excelled in variety and elegance : their coats of armour reached\
down to the knees, cut out on the shoulders and below, into straps which were\
often adorned with lions-heads : some instead of straps, had twisted fringes. The\
generals and nobility wore buskins of young lions or tigers-skins; or else neat\
fandals : but the inferior sort had plain sandals with strings: their swords hung by\
by their left side by  sinall hook on the girdle, and on their right side was \
dagger.\
In the Roman military order, the young men between seventeen and twenty-five\
years of age were appointed. for velites, or swift footmen or light-armed; the\
hastati, for darters or pikemen ; such as were in their prime, for principes; and the\
aged, for triarii.\
The Velites wore  small buckler of  foot and  half long, an head-piece, \
sword and  lance three feet long, and  thumb thick, armed with  sharp trian-\
gular pointed steel or head, of  foot in length: some carried slings; others,\
bows-\
The hastati and principes wore  fhort coat of armour, that they might be the\
fitter for march and the management of all forts of arms; they had long breeches,\
reaching half-way the legs, and close at the knees, and helmet, and  large oval\
buckler two feet and an half in the transverse, and four or five feet in the conjugate\
diameter : they were girt with swords on both sides; that on the left much longer\
than the other, which, like  dagger, was but  span long. Their other weapors\
were, two darts or wooden staves; one thia like an arrow, and three cubits long,\
breadth of the hand, with  pointed iron head as long as the staff, and let half-\
way into the wood, and beset with hooks : this iron next the wood, was  finger\
and an half in thiknefs.\
The triarii bore the same arms as the principes, except that instead of the darts,\
they used pikes, formerly carried by the hastati, (and from whence they took their\
name) who left them for the darts. The richest armed themselves with com-\
modious body-coats instead of breast-pieces. The Romans generally wore short\
hair, with shaved chins, but the hair growing on each side of their cheeks :\
yet we must observe, that Scipio was the only person among them who had long\
hair. The Roman helmets clofing with the forehead, were made either of dou-\
ble leather, iron or brass, and crested on top, like the Greeks, but less sumptuous ;\
except those of the generals and other commanders, which were plumed. Some\
also had winged helmets, and on the crest,  snake or dragon or an eagle\'92 head.\

We find likewise, that the ancient Romans, in their marches, carried  saw, \
basket,  spade, an axe,  bridle,  fickle, and provision for three days. The\
Herculani of the old troops, and the Joviniani, or, according to Vegetius Jovi-\
ani, were two select Roman legions consisting. of six thousand men each, and\
serving in Selavonia, to whom the emperor Diocletianus, who caused himself to be\
stiled Jupiter, and Maximinianus Hercules, after they had gained him the imperial\
dignity, gave that name in preference to all other legions for their valour. These,\
besides their large swords and oblong shields, had darts, the insides whereof were\
run with lead, and called Manorbarbuli, which for their heaviness forwards,\
swords, they so galled the enemy and their horses, as to gain the emperors several\
great battles.\
The Roman horse wore an helmet and breast-piece like the foot, had  cross-\
shield by the horse\'92 side,  long sword on their right side,  javelin intheir hands,\
and in their quivers three or more arrows broad-ironed, yet sharp pointed, and\
not inferior to the javelins. The ensigns, both of foot and horse wore lions sxins\
over their military dresses, and the trumpets the same, save. that the two fore-\
paws of the skins were by these latter, tied under their chins, serving them also\
for cloaks. These skins were not merely fleaed with the hair on, but also sitted for\
service, and underneath either fringed or elegantly cut out.\
The Numidians and Cretians under Roman command and aiding them on horse-\
back, as need required, were armed with bows and arrows, and also with slings,\
wherewith they dexterously flung stones. Pliny writes, that even the scorpio (\
machine of war) with which anciently they used to throw large stones and timbers,\
was the invention of th\'e9 Crerians.\
The Ligurians, who for  long time valiantly kept the Romans at bay, were well\
disciplined soldies; armed with  breast-piece, an helmet,  fhield, and in \
close dress. They were also very expert in throwing the javelin.\
The Scythians,  barbarous people and horsemen, wore crested helmets pointed\
on top ; they carried bows, daggers and battle-axes.\
The Scythian women, called Amazons, oftentimes appeared in  combat, as\
Vincentius says, in antique silver helmets and breast-pieces, because their country\
abounded with that metal. But according to the ancient memoirs, their military\
dresses were only adorned with serpents skins wrought in silver. They had the\
left breast bare, but the right, which was scared, that they might with greater\
ease use the bow and cast the dart, covered like the rest of their bodies. Their\
garment buttoned below, reached not quite to their knees. Their defence was \
target or large round shied cut holow at one of the extremities into the form of two\
conjoined crescents, having  part in the middle for covering and guarding the\
arm and hand. One of these cuts served for managing the lance and the other to\
look through. They likewise carried axes and hammers.\
The Goths, together with the great Attila, descended from the Scythians, were\
armed with bows, arrows, long and strong spears or lances, shields and helmets.\
The horsemen full armoured and carrying strong lances, hammers and clubs,\
would leap on their horses without the help of the stirrup or other advantage, es-\
pecially\
\
\
\
\
\
\
pecially on smooth ice, or on snowy ground, where they generally fought their\
greatest battles. Sometimes, as need required, and in the heat of battle they\
would in full gallop throw themselves on another horse, turning and winding\
with incredible swiftness, even catching up  lance from the ground, &. An\
evidence what great warriors these people-formerly were.\
The Persians and Spartans were very much alike in dress, except in their head\
ornaments. The former wore turbans, and the latter caps like  night-cap, yet\
pointed on top and curling forwards; or else iron head-pieces, like the Romans,\
but plain and without  crest. They had long hair and their beards almost hid\
theirears. On the other hand, the Persians shaved both head and face. Their\
vestment girt about the middle, reached below the knees: they wore also long\
open breeches and wide stockings and shoes. They used scaled arms, round\
shields, greaves or shin armour, scimitars hung on the right thigh, crofs the body\
aud the dagger on the same side, but at the girdle. At their back was the\
quiver.\
Darius the last king of Persia, was commonly arrayed in  rich purple mantle\
intermixed with white stripes, fastened on each shoulder with precious stones, and\
before with  gold chain or hook. His coat of armour wrought with gold, was\
embroidered on the breast with three golden eagles, having spread wings and\
tails and bills turning towards each other, and between the wings and tails were\
seen the following letters, NIKHTIKSTATON, signifying, Always Con-\
queror. At his golden girdle, girt loosely and womanisn, hung  scimitar, the\
scabbard whereof was beset with precious stones.\
The Dacians wore gowns hanging down to the heels and open on the sides, and\
over them  coat of mail which reached to the middle. Their helmets sat close\
about the head and ran up to apoint. Their arms were bows and arrows, dag-\
ger and javelins; and their horses wholly guarded, except the eyes, with scaled\
coverings.\
The Parthians, Medes and Assprians were guarded like the Persians, save that the\
Parthians wore long coats of mail covering both man and horse, and the Assprians\
brass head-pieces.\
The Phrygians and Armedians used helmets, short spears, javelins and daggers,\
wearing wide stockings and shoes like the Persians.\
The Carthaginians were as elegant and magnificent in arms as the Persiuns.\
The Macedonians and their neighbours differed little in their dress and arms from\
the Greeks. And,\
The Romans and Trojans the same.\
The Lacedemonians first began to carry  shield, sword and axe.\
The people of Caria were the first who served for pay, carried shields, bore\
armour, and had plumes or feathers on their helmets.\
The Thracians wore head-pieces of fox skins, coats of armour, party-coloured\
dresses, and stockings of skins. Their weapons were darts, round shields and\
daggers.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The Athiopean horse wers guarded with an helmet, coat of armour reaching\
half way the thighs, powdered, with iron eyes and proof against cuts and pushes.\
Their arms were  round shield,  lance,  scimitar, and clubs plated with iron.\
Those who had no helmets wore long and hairy or woolly red caps, like the Ma-\
malukes in Agypt. The foot to strike terror in their enemies, wore fkins of lions,\
tigers, leopards, and other wild beasts; anil had for weapons large bows, pikes,\
arrows, and slings. The emperor himself wore  costly silver diadem about his\
head, and carried in his hand  silver crucifix. He was dressed in gold stuff full\
pleated over  silk shirt with large ducal sleeves, and from his middle hung \
loose garment of silk and gold stuff. His body guards, covering their heads\
and shoulders with beasts skins, carried  sword,  dagger, and  javelin.\
The Indians were cloathed in wood, and had bows of reeds, and arrows  yard\
and  half long tipped with iron.\
The Arabians wore girt coats, and used crooked but handy bows.\
The Lybians were dressed in leather, and had burnt javelins.\
The Agyctians bore  shield and broad sword.\
The inhabitants of the Baleares, now Majorca, Minorca, &. had slings.\
The Atolians, lances and javelins.\
The Scoitzers from ancient times were good soldiers, as appears by their contests\
with Julius Casar, used large and long shields for defence. Their arms were\
strong spears, pikes, and clubs.\
The Gauls carried large shields and long swords.\
The people of the territory of Abruzzo, anciently called Samnites, were good\
horse-men and darters.\
The inhabitants of Marchia Anconitana, anciently stiled by the Romans, Ager\
Picenus, or country of wood-peckers, were likewise good soldiers, and bore \
shield,  pike, an helmet and sword.\
Thus  think to have made some provision for further enquiry, that artists\
may not be at  loss. He who wants more information can read Virgil, Ammianas Mar-\
cellinus, Vegetius, Polvbius, and Herodotus Hallicarnassus; which last, in the life of\
Xerxes, lays down all the particulars relating to each people and all sorts of bar-\
barians. Vitrueius also has written  treatise of the Roman military exercife.\
Homer in his lliad speaking offights wherein some had gold, brafs, and steel ar-\
mour says, ee He pussied him in the belly, but pierced not his armour'\
And in\
another passage, ee He dealt him such  blowon his steel-breast as to make it strike\
sire and resound. Now ifit be afked what sort of armour this must have been,\
of massy gold and other metal; and whether it could be possible for any person\
to move, bend, and turn, in such armour as shewed the muscles and limbs sat\
close to the body ,  answer they could not, and that the notion of their having\
been thus is wrong.  think those are also out of the way who suppose they are so\
represented for the sake of decorum, and that this is reason enough, without con-\
sidering whether it be posfible or not ; since other reasons may be assigned, which\
can give better satisfaction without forcing nature. For my part,  believe that\
the arms and their use were anciently as now, and the coats of armour were like\
our buff coats, made of leather. They may possibly have been so contrived as to\
shew\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
shew the muscling; but granting it, they must be much sitter for use than if of\
steel or solid gold. Wherefore  cannot but think they were made of leather,\
and of all sorts of colours, wrought or embroidered with silver or gold, even\
covered over with gold like our gilt leather, and set off with scales, foilage, and\
other such ornaments.  remember to have read in my youth, in  certain\
ancient Latin treatise yet extant, dedicated to the emperors Theodosius and Valenti-\
nian, and entitled, eeThe great Number of the Roman Forces ;\'92\'92 that the Roman ar-\
mours, breast-pieces or military coats (as there called) were lined with wool,\
and covered with the skins of wolves, lions, and other wild beasts of Libva. Ne-\
vertheless, to support the opinion of the poets,  add, that they had gold, brass, and\
steel breast and belly-pieces fastened with small hooks and buckles on the shoulders\
and sides, to ward off blows ; but they were plain without muscling; and not put on\
but in times of preparation for battle. Wherefore they are much to blame who\
introduce such accoutrements on every occasion; as for instance, Scipio in his tent\
with the young bride, and sitting in full armour; or Alexander with Roxana, Rinal-\
do courting Armida; and other such occurrences.\
CHAP. VIII. Of the Origin of the several Ensigns and Shields and\
their Devices, for distinction of Nations and particular Persons.\
Ttbeing in painting absolutely necessary, first to distinguish the nations, and\
next the personages among them of high and lesser degree, by tokens either\
devised by themselves, or appropriated by others ;  think proper to handle this\
point largely, in order to shew the greatness of the Roman power, and the many\
foreign troops entertained in their service :  say both painters and statuaries, es-\
pecially the latter, ought to be acquainted with these things, that in representing\
either  particular nation or hero, they may on their shields, exhibit the proper\
badges of dictinction whereby to be presently known by persons conversant in an-\
tiquities. This knowledge is as necessary for history painters, since histories fre-\
quently make mention of  congrefs of several nations and their heroes in one\
place, without describing their arms and banners;  point which cost me\
much trouble to gain, but proved of greater advantage in the uses  made\
thereof, and which  introduce here as having some relation to the preceding\
chapter.\
On consulting histories,  find the ancients instead of banners, made use of \
bundle of arrows or boughs and greens tied together, which they called mani-\
pulus, or an handful, and the ensign bearers, manipularii. Titus Livius the\
nice Roman historian and antiquary, tells us that Romulus, having by accident ap-\
peased  tumult with few people, from that time represented it in the ensigns and\
arms by  wisp of hay ; causing this token, as an happy one, to be born be-\
fore him in the ensuing wars. The Romans afterwards painted on their ensigns\
and\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
anc standards simall red flames, in. token of suecess; az in the battle with. the. Sa-\
bines near Eretum, where the arms of the former appeared by night as if on fire,\
without being damaged. Thus the standards and ensigns of the legions, by the\
sight whereof the soldiers knew the wills of their generals, were from.time to time\
augmented. They had also at different times, divers other tokens.; as open right\
hands, the image of their emperors insilver or gold or gilt; and. sometimes there\
hung under them  small pendant, having the general, or peoples motto,\
. . QR. They likewise bore in their banners, the representation of\
wolves, minotaurs, wild boars, horses, bulls, and dragons, till at last they fix-\
ed on the eagle for the chief field standard. The Romans used the wolf, minotaur,\
wild boar, horse, bull, and dragon, for the following reasons; the wolf, partly\
as he was sacred to Mars the god of war, and partly because his penetratron is\
so gre\'e2t, that he can see as well by night as by day : whereby they meant that \
prudent general ought always to be on his guard, so as not to be surprised by\
the stratagems of the enemy. By the minotaur says Vegetius, they signified, that\
as this beast kept himself in the most hidden part of the labyrinth, so the designs\
of  general ought to be kept secret. The wild boar, because no peace or cessa-\
tion of arms was made without it. Vide our gth Book, page,  treating\
of the offerings. The horse as being of great account among the Romans, and the\
proper sign of war. Th\'e9 bull because the ancient Romans pretended, that the\
word Italia was derived from stala, which now--days signifies  calf or bull. The\
dragon they commonly painted on the baniiers of the foot, and each century had\
one ; whence the bearer of it aceording. to. Vegetias, was called dragonarius. Am\'ac\
mianus Mercellinus tells us the manner of carrying it. ee They tied, says he, to\
the tops of their gilt pikes, which were gold fringed and beset with- peapls- and\
precious ftones, dragons made of woven stuff and hollow within, which on\
being advanced in the air, opened their frightful mouths, and made  grumbling\
noise as if full of wrath and fury ; bending and moving their tails-with the wind.\
Of which Claudianus speaks : ee Et cessante vento multi taucere dracones . . The\
dragons were all sileat when the wind abated. This enfign according to Ammi\'ac\
anus aforesaid, was of  reddishi purple. The eagle surpaffing all other birds in\
courage and boldness, is not improperly called the Roman eagle ; for to what cor-\
ner of the known world has he not extended the Roman dominion-; What resisting\
nation has not felt the effect of their deliberations, and the valour wherewith\
they put them in execution; And yet  know from history, that the eagle was in\
use long before among the Persians : for Crus the founder of that monarchy, bore\
according to- Xenophon,  golden eagle with- spread wings on  long pike, as if he\
would sly over the universe ; which custom his sucessors retained as  royal token. By\
 consent of the soothsayers, all nations anciently ascribed- to this bird, the honour of\
belie ving he prognosticated good luck and happy success in any undertakings. In\
which sense Justinus tells us that Hiero when young, who was of mean birth on his\
mother\'92 side, making his first campaign, an eagle flew down and sat on his shield :\
which was judged as  presage of his becoming in time an excellent general\'92and \
king; as afterwards came to pass. The poets even say that-this bird implies prosperity\
assigned\
\
\
\
\
\
\
assigned to any person by divine Providence. This opinioh bwes its rise to the\
relation of Anacreon, the first writer of antiquities, that Jupiter intending to de-\
stroy the giants who threatened t\'e9 storm heaven, the powers of which he offered\
to, was by the aecidental flight of an eagle, asfured of an happy and fuccefsful\
victory ; which afterwards obtaining, he always bore  golden eagle in his arms and\
banners, as \'e0 perpetual memorial thereef. From Jupiter the Getians asfumed that\
bird and from them the Candiots. Aneas the Trojan introduced him among the Latines\
and from them the Romans, in process of time cam\'e9 to use him for their arms: though\
Lipsius is of opinion, they assumed him after the example of the Perfians. The\
Juscans beaten by the Romans in their last conflict near the city of Eretum, on the\
borders of the Sabines, presented Tarquinius Priscas king of the Romans, their\
king\'92 regalia, to wit,  gold crown,  purple garment, and mantie of various\
colours, also an ivory chair, and an ivory sceptre with an eagle on top, which he\
and his fuccessors always bore. After the banishment of the kings, the senate\
took the eagle from their sceptres, and set them on their pikes, exalting him\
above all their other arms, whether the wolf, minotaur, horse, wild boar, &.\
Marius when  child, happening to find an eagle\'92 nest with seven young,  pre-\
sage of his two consulats, often placed the said number in his arms; and in his\
second consulat asfigned the eagle to the Roman legions, using him only in battles\
in order to spirit the soldiers and asfure them of victory. The other military\
tokens were set on the tents, but Marius took them down; and from that time\
no legion was without two eagles. But Josephus, in his fourth Book, gives\
each legion one eagle ; and by the number of eagles they counted their legions ;\
as Hirtius says that Pompey\'92 army conssisted of thirteen eagles. Dion also affigns\
each legion an eagle. This eagle stood with extended wings, on  pilum or staff,\
which according to Vegetius, was sive feet and  half in length, armed with  sharp\
triangular iron of nine ounces. The bearers of it they called aquilifere. Thefe\
eagles were but small, and of silver, and many had the thunder in their talons.\
The Romans first used silver eagles, as did also Brutus; because silver is the\
brightest metal and most like the day, and therefore most properest for  military\
token : but afterwards they made them of gold, as more stately and surpassing\
the silver. The: Romnns first used silver tokens as being originally frugal and\
saving; but at length they yielded to none, even not to the Persians, in luxury\
pomp and shew,\
Julius Caesar so highly prized the Batavians, in Ronian pay, that he made them\
his body-guards; intrusting them likewise in the sharpest engagements, with the\
carriage of the first and chief standards of the Roman eagles.\
The Herculeans of the old troops, mentioned in the preceding chapter, bare\
on their ensign  blue eagle with spread wings, in  silver field cornered with\
gold.\
The young Herculeans carried in th eir standards,  golden eagle sitting on \
stem of,  tree, in  blue field bordered with gold.\
The new Jovinians had in their enfigns  golden eagle, with  diadem or royal\
fillet about the head. This \'e9agle was either black or brown, in  gold field, and\
the wings werelset off with red and blue, and had  small gold-shield on his breast-\
But\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
But those of the old troops carried  purple eagle adorned with red and gold in\
 blue field.\

golden bull in  silver field.\
The banner of the first company of life guards of the emperor Theodosius, com-\
manded by  colonel of the foot, had the figure of an half man with extended\
arms, holding in the right hand  rope, and in the left an hat; thereby inti-\
mating, that the stubborn and rebellious should be chastised, and the obedient\
made free.\
In the second banner was  golden bull on the jut of  red hill, with  Moor\
or black down to the middle, holding  piece of thick rope in the right hand,\
and  cap or hat in the left; shewing that they might make prisoners and slaves,\
and set men at liberty.\
The Thracians carried the idol Mars in their standards.\
The people of Smyrna, the image of Fortune. And,\

reign, carried in its ensigns  golden horse in  red field bordered with\
gold.\
Another foot legion set up in the emperor Constaus\'92 time, whence it was called\
Constantia, had also  golden horse in  sky blue field, and above him, in the\
middle,  red globe, against which he was rearing and throwing. himself out\

back. And,\
The Goihs,  she-bear.\
The banner of the Salii had two half wolves rearing up against each other, and\
fixing their eyes on  rose which was over their heads, in  gold field bordered with\
purple. It is no wonder these people blazoned the wolf, seeing they claimed Mars\
as their protector.\
The regiment of foot caHled Jovianum, which had the fifth post of honour\
among the Romans, bare in the emperor Diocletianus\'92 time,  red hog sitting up-\
right on its hinder parts, in  blue field bordered with gold : and for this reason;\
the\
\
\
\
\
\
\
the poets have feigned that Jupiter when achild and lying in the wood was nursed\
by  sow, and this regiment having the name of Jupiter, it therefore carried the\
hog in its standards, in memory of that occurrence.\
The foot regiment of guards established by the emperor Honorius, bare two\
demi-red hogs rearing against each other, in  silver shield and gold field.\
The Trojans likewise carried an hog, in  gold field.\
 Phrygians had also an hog.\
The regiment called Tertiodecimani, had.  leaping blue dog, in  silver field\
centered with gold, and bordered with dark blue.\
From the time of Constantine the Great down to those of Theodosius, Honorius,\
and several successive emperors, the Romans had  foot regiment called Menapii,\
whose device was  leaping red dog, in  silver field, centred with  small gold\
shield, and under it another dog, lying on his back and flinging up his legs. This.\
bodv was in high esteem for the honour it gained in vanquifhing the Thracians.\
The Cynopolitans bare Anubis, in the fhape of  dog.\
The Cortonenses devised  silver dragon, in  red field ; on the sides were two\
rings, that on the left of avery deep red, and the other of silver.\
The Lacedemonians had the Greek letter , or  dragon.\
The Indians bare the image of Hercules; but their horse according to Suidas,\
carried dragons.\
The Nervii, being the body-bowmen\
of the emperors, had for device, two\
demi-caducei or wands twined with serpents, in  purple field bordered with gold\
and red. In the centre of the shield was \
gold ring on  sinall gold column,\
round which the afore said serpents winding, their upper parts making  semi-cir-\
cle, and their heads regarding each other.\
The Saguntiuns had for device two red ferpents; and as Ammianus says, of purple,\
crossing each other, like the Greek letter , in  fky-blue field bordered with\
red.\
The company of Bienians, serving under the general of the foot in Sclavonia,\
bare in their banners  deep blue serpent with  bent tail towards the ground,\
with  man\'92 head looking backwards, in  blue silver-like sield bordered with\
gold.\
The Marcomani had  gold demi-serpent in  silver field, and between the\
fiead and the under part was  gold half moon.\
The Curians bare  gold serpent coiled up, in  grey field bordered with silver\
and blue checkers.\
The legion of foot, called the sixth Parthian, serving in the East, had, for de-\
vice,  yellow caduceus, or Mercury\'92 wand, in  blue hield edged with purple and\
silver.\
The legion of the angrivarii, carried  red staff topped with  round ball, out of\
which issued two serpents, bending to the middle of the shield as if kissing each-\
other, in  pale blue field, with  double edging of purple and gold.\
Among the ancient legions was  regiment, called Valentiani, establishied by the\
emperor Valens on his waging war with the Thracians; these carried in their stan-\
dards\
  \
\
\
\
\
\
\
dards,  small red column and two half-moons of the-same colour, over two gol-\
den hares jumping against each other in  silver field.\
The Libyans had three hares.\
The ensign of the Roman legion, called Augusta, was an exact red cat, set off\
with gold, in  silver field, and turning her head side-ways, as if going backwards.\
The Apini had  blue cat walking upright, in  crimson field, set off with\
gold.\
The ancient Alani, Bugundiones and Suevi, also carried  cat; thereby intima-\
ting, that they could bear the yoke of servitude with as little stomach as the cat\
cared to be locked up.\
The Agyptians carried  crocodile, or else  cat.\
Not long before the decay of the Roman monarchy, they had  legion in pay,\
called Cornuti, whose device was  red falcon in  gold field, set off with blue and\
red.\
The inhabitants of Peloponnesas bare  tortoise.\
The Baotians,  sphinx.\
The Loerenses,  locust. And\
The Aslyrians, in memory of Semirami  dove.\
The Arcadians, who set up for tbe most ancient people in the world, and to\
be co-aval with the moon, therefore carried the moon in their ensigns; and\
sometimes, the god Pan, who is the emblem of the whole earth.\
The Parthians had  broad sword or scimitar in the hand of  winged arm.\
The Greeks, commonly had two crowns.\
The Medes, three crowns.\
The Macedonians, Hercules\'92 club between two horns.\
The Cappadocians,  cup.\

ancient Romans, was of  dark blue colour, having  star with eight points in\
the upper part, and in the middle,  circle embellished with gold.\
The Tr\'e6zenenses bare  trident.\
The imperial standard of the emperor Theodosius had  crofs, in which sign he\
put all his confidence.\
Constantine, in the battie with Maxentius, had for his banner,  long staff\
having on top  crofs-piece, both plated with gold, and above,  crown, beset\
with precious stones, on which were engraved the two first letters of the name of\
Christ in Greek, to wit, \'e0  in the middle of an :  name he likewise bore on\
his helmet : to, the aforesaid crofs-piece hung  pendant, embroidered with gold\
and pearls: under the aforefaid name and the standard of the cross, he obtained\
 glorious victory over the tyrant Maxentins.\
Lucianus writes, that the Pentagon is the emblem of an happy enterprize and\
good success, proceeding from the following consideration. Antiochus the First,\
sirnamed Soier, . . Saviour, waging war with the Galatians, and perceiving, by\
the daily increase of new dangers and difficulties, that the issue would not be so\
prosperous\
\
\
\
\
\
\
prosperous as he could. wissi, dreamed, or so pretended, in order to spirit his. sol-\
diers, that he had conversation with Alexander the Great, who advised him to take\
for his emblem, the common word of falutation, in Greek TrEIA, or,  wifhi you\
health and prosperity, and to give it to his commanders and soldiers for the ge-\
neral watch-word, and have it carried on their arms, shields and banners, as be-\
ing to ferve him for  token of victory : whereupon he described to them the\
fffape of this emblem ; which was, three triangles drawn through each other with\
five lines, constituting  quintangular. figure, and on each angle one of the said\
letters. Antiochus, having done this, obtained  flgnal victory over the Galatians.\
There are still extant several coins and medals of Antiochus, bearing the said pen\'ac\
tagon or quintangular figure.\
The Argonauts, or thofe of Argos, had the letter Ain their ensign, as being their\
mitial letter ; yet they bare likewise afox or rat.\
The Jews had the letter , the token of salvation.\
The painted and engraved shields (in-reference to which, many of the learned\
would derive the Latin word stutum,  shield, from sculptura, because it was cus-\
tomary to engrave or reprefent glorious actions and histories upon them) were\
anciently  certain sign of the valour of those who carried them : and, lest the sol-\
diers in the heat of battle, fhould mistake their comrades, each legion, according\
to Vegetius, had particular marks on their fhields; and on the infide of which was\
written cach soldier\'92. name, and what company he belonged to.\
The shields or targets were of different makes at the place where they guarded\
the hand: as, those of the first Armenian order had two indentures cut out down the\
fides; as we have said in the for\'e9going chapter touching the shields of the Ama-\
zons. These shields were of  fky-blue colour, with  silver field. Those of the\
second Armenian order were quite round, of . purple colour with  sky-blue field,\
bordered with gold.\
The Vesontians bare shields with four small ones at the angles, making  square,\
two whereof were of silver, and the others of sky-blue, double bordered.\
The fhield of the Menapii had  silver field with  gold dog in full speed, as if\
running to. the outside.\
The Mantineans bare in their arms and shiields, the Trident, as  sign, according\
Pindarus, of their being citizens of that town.\
The Romans, after Adrian\'92-time, carried in their crescen-tlike shields, in  silver\
fleld, two gold demi-horses curvetting against against each other, and called\
Mauriferoces, or stout and fearleis; whereby some alude to Italy.\
The Spartans bare  dragon.\
The Gree\'e8s, the god Neptune.\
\
\
The Trojans, Minerva.\
The Lacedemonians carried the Greek letter , for their signification. And\
The Messenians, formerly an excellent and valiant people, an , for the same\
reason.\
The Athenians often bare an owl in their arms.\

The Jecos affirm, they were,the first who made distinction between people of\
high and low degree, by particular tokens : accordingly, those who were of emi-\
nent or noble families, wore in their shoes - waxing moon.\
The Assprians, Egyptians, Persians and Greeksfor that reason used the same token :\
whence it is probable the Turks, in process of time, took it for their standard.\
The Romans likewise, in token of nobility, wore  waxing moon on their shoes;\
which therefore they called lunulati calceei.\
The Athenians expressed the antiquity of their descent, by  grafshopper; as\
Thucydides relates in the beginning of his history, stiling them Porticigal\'e6, from\
their custom of wearing gold grasshoppers in their head-ornaments and their ge-\
nerals the same on their helmets) for distinction between the foreign and native\
Ancient writers assure us, that most heroes bare some device or other on their\
shields; some of which  shall here set down, without regard to dignity, or pri-\
ority of time wherein they lived.\
Ofiris, sirnamed Janus, bare in his ensign,  sceptre topped with an eye; and\
sometimes, with the addition of an eagle, the sun, or such like object: and lsis\
carried  moon.\
Hercules, called by some, the great Ofiris, bare  lion with  battle-ax in his\
paws; or else the seven headed serpent, Hydra.\
Mars had  wolf, and on his helmet,  magpye.\
Pallas carried the head of Medusa on her shield and breast piece; and on each\
side of her helmet,  griffin; and on top either  sphinx or owl.\
Theseus\'92 device was  minotaur with  club on his shoulders; and oftentimes,\
an oX.\
Cadmus bare  dragon.\
Castor had  silver star, in  blue field : and\
Pollux, the same, in  red one.\
Nimrod, the first king of Babel, bare  ram : And\
Ninus and Semiramus,  dove ; to which the latter added  leopard, because he\
had overcome and killed one.\
Hector carried  lion sitting in  purple chair, with  halberd in his paws.\
Ulysses  fox, and on his helmet,  dolphin.\
Pausanias, in his Greek history relates, that the Elisians carved on Agamemnon \
shield,  lion\'92 head, in order to afright his enemies; and thus subscribed, et Be-\
hold the terror of the world.  Homer is more elegant in this description.\
Pyrrhus bare an eagle; or, according to some, the Nine Muses, with Apollo on\
Mount Helicon.\
Achilles had an oak-tree.\
And\
Paris,  golden head.\
Alcibiades  shield was of ivory and gold, and thereon  Cupid embracing the\
thunder.\
Alexander the Great bare  lion, and oftentimes the image of Victory; or else,\
the Bucephalus, or  wolf, or  ram.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Ofcus, king of Tyrrhenum, now Tuscany, carried in his arms and shield,  ser-\
pent, which according to Servius the Roman writer, was also the device of the\
kings of Agypt.\
Judas Maccabeus had  Basilisk.\
Scipio Africanus bare the pictures ofhis father and uncle in his shield; and his\
head-piece resembled an elephant\'92 head.\

Pompey the Great,  lion with  sword in his paws : this was also the device\
of his seal-ring, delivered after his death to Julius Caesar.\
Julius Caesar, carried in his standard these\
words, THE MOTHERVENUS; and\
on his shield,  double-headed eagle.\

Sylla\'92 device was ApoLlo oF DELPHOS.\
Marius\'92, the lares, or houshold gods.\
Maecenas bare  frog. And\
Vospasiamts, the head of Medusa.\
He who would have  thorough account of the shields, targets, helmets, &.\
of the Greeks, Trojans, and other nations, may satisfy his curiosity in Homer and\

CHAP. . Of Flowers in general.\
XXX\
THE spring being the most delightful seafon of the year, it is no\
\
\
wonder that flowers have  particular charm above other ob-\
\
\
\
jects; and this not only in nature, but also in  painting; which\
\
\
\
though ever so indifferent, lovers often prefer before  fine piece of\
\
hiftory or landscape.\
It is remarkable, that amidst the various choices in the art of painting, none is\
more feminine, or proper for women than this; and the reason is plain. Itis\
also to be noted, that of those choices one is as- perfect as the other, with respect to\
art were it ever so singular; and though this choice is but  small part of the whole,\
yet\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
yet it is attended with as many excellencies : for as  bunch of grapes carries its per-\
fection, so the least grain does the fame. But though both the parts as well as the\
whole, fall under the fame rules, and one master understand his branch as well as the\
ocher; yet he who has from his youth applied himself to this or that single choice, let\
has progrefs therein be what it will, can perform nothing else that is good. We have\
many instances of excellent mafters who departed from the general to particular\
choices with applause,but of none who have done the contrary without discredit. \
reckon discredit as bad an exchange as copper for gold, or water for wine. Of the for-\
mer fort are innumerable Italian and French as well as Looo Duich masters; but of the\
latter few, among whom Vereist alone claims the laurel, to the wonder of those who\
knew him when he painted flowers: for if ever  painter excelled in that branch, he\
was the person : neither Mario da Fiori, father Segers, or de Heem came up to such\
 pitch; and yet through  bad exchange, he at last fell from an agreeable spring\
sons : first in confirmation of my asfertion, that he who can perform the most difficult\
things, may easily, even without trouble attain those of less consideration; but\
not the contrary without disadvantage and discredit. Secondly, because my de-\
sign is to treat of flowers, as an effectual admonition to those who would bestow\
their time with advantage on that single choice.\
Flower painting is certainly  commendable study ; but as there are double and,\
single slowers, so there are two forts of flower painters; the one singular and simple\
and the other rich and ingenious; of which latter sort we have but few, and\
of the former abundance. Three things are especially necessary in  good flower-\
piece, first, choice and beautiful flowers : secondly good disposition and harmo-\
ny : and lastly, neat and soft penciling. First, the flowers must not be poor or\
lying or standing, they always keep their proper quality and shape, . . that\
the round seem not by too extravagant  spread to be triangular, square or ob-\
long, whereby to mistake one flower for another; that the most noble and beau-\
tiful have the predominancy, and that by their placing they produce an agree-\
able mixture of coulours, delighting and satisfying the eye; consisting in so\
ordering the strong and striped with the faint ones, as to exhibit  lovely rain-\
bow. Lastly, that each flower be well expressed according to its nature and\
quality ; as one thin, another thick, this soft and limber, that set and stiff; one\
shining, another dull and glossless.\
We are in the next place to suppose, that it is impossible to be  master\
without  firm and exact draught, and thorough acquaintance with perspective, to-\
gether with good knowledge of the colours and  their bodies, and which will\
stand best; and lastly,  due enquiry into the nature of slowers, that they may\
be handled accordingly.\
He who would follow this study in good earnest, ought to be master of  flow-\
er garden, which he should carefully cultivate, that he may in the seasons, be\
furnished with sine and choice flowers : for though modelling be  great affist-\
\

He who is afirm and nimble draughtsman, and  good\

manager of water colours has  double advantage, and may in time get  treafure\
of beautiful modelled flowers, bearing good prices and great esteem among the\
curious. After the flowers, the green leafing of them is of great importance,\
through its various qualities and difference in texture and colour, causing  flow-\
er piece to look natural and more decorous.\
CHAP. II. Of painting Flowers in Halls, Apartments, Galleries,\
but principally on Cielings for Ornament.\
 is the business of  good flower painter principally to aim at what is praise-\
worthy. What great things, what glorious occasions is there for  master\'92\
famel But this lies not always in the representations of garlands of slowers,\
pots, glafs-bottles, butterflies, flying beetles, cobwebs, or drops of water,\
any more than in neat penciling and bright colours, with which we think to\
set the world in  gaze. Such trifles are too low, and the repetition too irksome,\
for the taste of noble fouls. What opportunities do not daily happen in palaces,\
gardens, galleries, and apartments, for shewing our skill and ingenuity ; Suppose\
to yourself  lofty room built with white marble, and set out with fine pictures\
and bass-reliefs, for the common recreation of young gentlemen and ladies:\
this room may be embellished above, and on each side of the niches, with fine\
and large festoons of flowers: between the pilasters and over the bass-reliefs\
much green ; yet somewhat lefs in case any landscapes be there ; and on the\
white marble may be all sorts of beautiful coloured flowers. On red marble con-\
trarily, white and yellow ones, &. according to the rules of art, and in large\
parts : now light, then again dark leafing as the matter and ground require.\
But of the several grounds and colours of flowers suitable to them, we shall here-\
after treat particularly. On the cieling there may be thin branches of airy foil-\
age, also intermixed with slowers, here festoon-ways, there in groups, sastened\
with ribbons or rings, and having in some places loose sprigs and leaves project-\
ing from the ground, and returning their proper shades thereon (which though\
the life is not to be had, may by some such made things be performed) that\
they may seem more naturaly to hang off. Such flowers and leaves ought to\
be strongly and boldly handled, but yet so as to seem fastened to the work ; well\
considering the colour and lightnefs or darkness of the ground, and chusing for it\
flowers of such colours, that some may look as if sticking to it, and others\
coming off. Now if many festoons be to hang in such  place or room, they\
must needs have  like length, breadth, and fullness, and be placed equally\
high or low. What difference is it to us, whether the proprietor desire to have\
slowers or fruits, or  mixture of botht For the festoons may be filled with\
peaches,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
peaches, apricots, mulberries, plumbs, &. hanging on their twigs. Over the\
representation of  bacchanal some bunches of white and blue grapes, intermix-\
ed with pine-apples look becoming. On the alcove may hang loosely over it\
papavers of all sorts of colours, interspersed with poppies, tied here and there\
with ribbons, as most proper for that place.\
Why should not such sorts of ornament be agreeable when naturally dis-\
posed and painted ; especially if well lighted, and the ground shades duly expres-\
sed on the ground; The company before-mentioned may possibly raise mirth\
enough among themselves; but so pleasant  sight must needs be  great\
addition to it. Let us therefore take hold of every opportunity that offers, and\
in the mean time exercise our talents in the attainment of  great handling. Let\
us exchange our small cloaths for whole walls ; our pots and bottles for vases;\
and  mudling for  beautiful manner. Let us enquire what flowers are painter-\
like, and which the principal; conjoining their sense, application, and colour\
together with their proper grounds.\
CHAP. III. That  Flower-painter should understand Perspective :\
Also the Mistake of representing Things improperly.\
TE have already asferted, that  good flower painter must needs under-\
stand perspective; and yet (which is to be lamented) few know any\
thing of it; possibly, supposing they have no occasion for it, and that therefore\
this branch is so much easier than history, or any thing else which cannot sub-\
sist without perspective, as indisputably requiring more by-works, viz. archi-\
tecture, landscape, or other object causing ground shades, which never hrppen in\
their work\'92: and should they at any time be non-plus\'92, they can get help from those\
who are acquainted with perspective. If therefore they have but  point of sight,\
they think that sufficient; and yet not for the sake of the flowers, but solely for the\
corner of  marble table or slab whereon they set  flower glass, as if the light-\
ing or shading of the flowers were  matter of indifference; this from -side, that\
fronting, one from below, another from above ; whence their pieces have usually\
many points of sight, sometimes as many as there are flowers. But it cannot be\
otherwise, since they often paint after models ; placing  slower on the left side,\
which stood before on the right, and the contrary, or else below or above ; which\
they imagine no-body will discover because they cannot see it themselves.\
Another ridiculous custom of some flower painters, in my opinion is, that in\
painting any glossy bodies, such as flower glasses, gold, silver, or copper, vases,\
after the life, they fail not to shew therein the panes of the windows, and after-\
wards to hang the pictures in halls and galleries which have none. Here let\
me take notice of an extraordinary nice and finished piece of that nature, paint-\
ed by  certain known gentlewoman, wherein not only some stalks of the slow-\
ers\
\
\
\
\
\
\
ers appeared naturally through the glafs, but afso her own picture in her posture\
of painting, with such an air, as evidently shewed it was she who sat in it; nor\
did she forget to represent also the windows and panes, sky and clouds. We need\
not question, whether she endeavoured by the depth of her penetration, to sur-\
pass her master in that piece of work. This case is -kin to that of  certain\
young artist, who painting  looking glass fronting, brought into it all that ap-\
peared behind him : people could not be persuaded it was  looking-glafs, though\
painted dark and dull, and it had  frame about it; and his protestations, that\
every thing was taken from the life, stood him in little stead ; wherefore to salve\
the matter as he thought, he painted himself in the looking-glass sitting at his\
easel ; and to make it more perfect underwrit, ee This is  looking glass, and\
that is-me.\
CH AP. IV, Of Flowers on all Sorts of Grounds.\
HAT white is set off by black, and the contrary, needs no demonstration;\
and on the other hand, white on white, and black on black, causes \
sticking together; of which particular notice ought to be taken, that slowers\
may have their due force and effect; so ordering them, that some seem to stick\
to the ground, and others to come off from. it, The most proper grounds for\
flowers are these.\
The colour of blue tomb-stone-\
Dark-olive or green serpentine.\
Light-grey freestone.\
White marble, but of  second tint.\
This observation would rather spoil  good ordonnance than have the desired\
effect, if we did not maturely weigh what uses we would put thefe grounds to,\
as also where the flowers most properly ought to have the greatest strength, and\
where the greatest weakness, in order that the principal ( mean, the fixed stone\
and wood work) may not thereby be overpowered.  say strengh, with respect to\
force and beauty ; but  mean not by weakness, that the colour, light or shade\
should be weakened or sullied : however  shall in the sequel, explain what  mean\
by that word.\
Any colour suits on white; but the darkest most beautifully. Warm colours\
are preferable to the broken ones, and the most weak ought to be on the extre-\
mities; but sew white ones, and those with caution. What  now say concerns\
the disposition; which  shall more plainly handle in treating of festoons and\
groaps of flowers.\
The black grounds, though quite different from the preceding with respect\
to great force can give little reffexion, and therefore do not admit of light or\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
weak slowers ; but neverthelefs fall under the same rules and observations as flow-\
ers on  white ground ; because the greens by their union, have  relation to the\
ground and colour.\
Red and yellow suit not but with dark grounds.\
All flowers and greens look well on  grey ground.\
All weak flowers, as violet, light purple, blue, apple-blossom and white,\
agree with  warm ground.\
Flowers have  particular decorum on  gold or silver ground; and still\
greater on copper or bronze, by reason of their darkish lustre; since the colour of\
gold is too strong, and that of silver too pale.\
\
\
CHAP. . Of the Disposition of Flowers and their Colours in\
Festoons and Groups.\
YYAVING hitherto treated of flowers in general, we shall now prooed to\
their disposition in groups and festoons.\
\
.  shall compose each group of particular emblematic colours, as-yellow, red,\
purple, violet, blue and white; which  consider as follows.\
The first group yellow, having for its principal flower  turnsol, African or\
marigold,, anemone, &. which  stile upper power or eternity.\
The second red, as peonies, papavers, roses, &. signifying power or might,\
The third, purple flowers, roles, papavers, tulips, &. implying nobility.\
The fourth, violet, as fritillaria or fritillary, &. signifying inconstancy.\
The fifth, blue as iris convolvolus or bind-weed, implying constancy.\
The sixth, white, as the lilly or white rose, &. signifying purity.\
It must be observed, that though in these groups the capital flowers be of \
particular colour, yet they will admit of other small ones about them of vari-\
ous eolours suiting therewith; as,\
With the yellow, purple, violet and blue.\
Red, light-yellow, apple-blossom, dark blue and white-\
Purple, white, yellow and light blue.\
Violet, fose-colour, orange, light red and afh-blue.\
Blue, purple, orange, light yellow and white.\
Two capital colours, as deep yellow, vermilion or blue must never be placed\
or upon one another.\
by\
White suits any where, except on deep yellow or deep red.\
Dark green agrees with all light flowers. And,\
Pale green with dark flowers.\
Under these groups, there should always be either  motto or verse.\
As for festoons, they may be handled in the same manner, yet with less con-\
finement : if the emblematic colour have but the middle place that is sufficient :\
the other parts may be filled up with such colours as we please, provided they\
have somewhat less brightness than the principal : for instance, let the mid-\
die\
\
\
\
\
\
\
die flowers be large and high coloured, as Africans or marigolds, yellow and\
red ; on the right side may be purple, as rofest, anemones; and on the left blue,\
as iris flos principius, hyacinths, &. The purple side mixed with little white and\
less yellow ; the blue side, with yellow and red; and the yellow in the middle,\
with violet dark blue, little purple and white.\
In  second festoon, white may possess the middle place, as white roses, lillies\
and others; on the right side may be yellow, and on the left pale red. The yel-\
low may be diversified with purple, violet and dark blue, the red with pale yel-\
low, white, violet and dark blue ; and the white in the middle, with rose colour,\
violet, purple and beauriful red.\
In the middle of athird festoon, may be red, as papavers, anemones, &. On\
the right side, striped flowers of purple and yellow, violet, and pale yellow, di-\
versisied with dark blue and beautiful red ; but on the other side, all plain\
flowers.\
The white may be intermixed with slowers of any colour, except light yellow.\
The intermixture consists of small flowers : but the single coloured, whether in\
the middle or largest, as also those on the sides require their particular small di-\
versifying flowers, . . the single coloured with speckled or striped; and the\
-contrary.\
If either group or festoon, full or close flowers should always be placed in the\
most relieved part. The open ones are mostly set on the sides in order to create\
shade. For instance, let the middle part of  festoon have the largest, finest and\
fullest slowers, such as red and white roses, papavers, &. Between the middle\
and the extremities,  lesser sort, as tulips, anemones, narcissuses or daffodils,\
gilli-flowers, malva rosea, &. Further towards the extremities, the more long\
and smaller ones, as astragalus, ranunculus or crow-foot, convolvolus, flos\
principis, borage, barbatum nigri, violets, &.\
On the relief of the festoon, between the largest and middle fort, may be \
mixture of the smallest flowers. If the middle flower be yellow, those further off\
ought to be purple or red, and such as are towards the corners white and blue;\
the longer the weaker, that the strongest colour may keep the middle. But if\
white have the middle place, the other parts must not eclipse it with yellow and\
red.\
 complete festoon must have an orderly disposition, not only with respect to\
the flowers themselves, whether large or small, but also in the placing of double\
and single ones : as first, white roses and centifoliae, next single roses, and lastly\
wild blossoms.\
As for the colours, there are single and half coloured flowers : the single co-\
loured are peonies, rofes, &. and the others striped or speckled with two or\
more colours ; as anemones with white and red, striped roses, tulips, &. Which\
ought to be so regularly ordered, as to raise in the eye  balancing mixture, and\
to unite the strong and weak, that the one do not project too much, and the other\
too little, and that at  distance, and at one view, the festoon may have its due\
sway. Yet if here or there it be either too weak or too strong, you must recol-\
lect\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Wherefore observe, that yellow and red are strong\
lect how it may be thelped.\
colours; and contrarily, blue and violet weak. If too much yellow and red\
come together, place somewhat blue or violet between ; and if too much blue or\
violet, some yellow or red.\
To begin  festoon well, you ought first to mark out its course as you will have\
it, either thick or thin : next lay on the green with such leafing as you think\
proper, but somewhat large and with due light and shade according to its light,\
Being dry, lay in the flowers flat, first the principal, each in its place, with \
single colour, red, blue or yellow, of such atint as will best admit of painting\
upon it, the light and shade after the life\'92 or models. The flowers between with\
their leafing, are put in over the green, on finishing. The grounds, whether plain\
or in bass relief or other ornament, ought to be neatly finished with the first green,\
to save you the trouble afterwards of paring away something here and there.\
CHAP. VI. Continuntion of the ordering and placing the Flowers..\
ry-WO observations ef consequence in  festoon, group, or garland, still\
r\'e9main ; to wit, the ordering the flowers and their places of hanging.\
Jt is easy to conceive, that many small things coming together, produce, at \
distance, only  confused mafs, and little affect the senses as having nothing in\
them to make any impression, or is worth remark and though each flower have\
it is particular name, shape, and colour, yet they are only considered in general,\
under the name of flowers; because of their being placed either too high or too\
distant. Such festoons or groups look well on paper and in hand, or on tea-tables,\
toilets and the like, either in painting or needle-work. On the other hand, large\
flowers may be seen distinctly at  distance, in their qualities, shapes and beauties.\
Then each flower gets  name; this is  rose, that  papaver, &. In  word,\
festoons, groups or garlands, placed high, or to be viewed at some distance,\
ought to be disposed in great maffes, and separate, with few speckled or striped\
flowers, either large or small, as having no effect-but. when seen near. Where-\
fore it is necessary to take, in their steads, others of single colours, in order to set\
off the work with more force and distinction, and to give the eye satisfaction.\
For this reason, when\'92seen in hand, they ought to, unite, and out of hand, to\
look more seperate and distinct. But  shall explain this by some examples;\
chusing two groups, one agreeably uniting so as to be viewed near, and the other\
the contrary.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
In the middle of the former is  white rose, and behind it  centifolia, behind\
which is  purple, and behind that  peony. Now these four colours differ but\
half  tint from each other, composing together an half ball gradually rounding.\
The latter contrarily, though having also  white flower in the middle, has be\'ac\
hind it  purple one, and behind that  dark violet,  colour darker than that of\
the peony. And these will create  greater force than the former, as starting\
more suddenly from each other, and differing  whole tint, as the others did but\
an half-one. Whence it is evident, that the more distinct the tints are, the more\
lively and strong they will appear.\
For further satisfaction, Ishall subjoin five other examples of festoons, as full\
again as those in the preceding chapter, since they sometimes happen to be of\
different sizes, and therefore requiring more flowers.  divide them thus.\
Th\'e9 First.\
In the middle yellow, next white, then purple or violet ; and lastly, yellow.\
\
The other side the same.\
The Second.\
In the middle white, next yellow, further blue, and the last yellowisn white.\
The other side the same.\
The Third.\
In the middle red; next blue, then yellow, and lastly violet. The other side\
the fame.\
The Fourth.\
  then blue, and lastly light red.\
In the middle purple, next pale\
other side the same.\
The Fisth.\
In the middle violet, next orange and other yellow, then blue, red and violet.\
The same on the other side.\
The three last ought to be intermixed with white, and the two first with variety\
of colours, as it best suits, in order to- unite the parts with each other.\
Three sorts of flowers are proper for intermixture, vizi yellow, red and blue,\
all in their greatest beauty.\
If the work consist mostly of red and yellow, it'ought to be intermixed with\
blue; and if of blue, you must take yellow; but if of all three, you are to use\
white, so distributing it as to refresh the eye. \
NoW, for proof of all that has be\'ebn. faid,  shall shew here two methods of\
great use to  flower painter, though they may seem trifling.\
Painting all sorts of flowers on cards or pasteboard, as rude as you please, even\
but  single spot for each, and five or six of each colour, or as many as there are\
tints,\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
tints, red, blue, purple, yellow, violet. Let these be capital flowers.\
make smaller ones for intermixture, of red, blue, yellow, and white, as beautiful\
as possible. Cut all these afunder, and lay each colour orderly by itself in  little\
box. Then paint up  green festoon or group on pasteboard, and thereon place\
such flowers as you please, shifting and changing them according to your design.\
And thus you will perceive the truth of what has been before spoken.\
The other method is this. Take \'e0 parcel of slowers of all sorts, made of paper\
or filk, and with wired stalks, as they are sold by the tire-women. Now, if you\
would make  group, festoon, or basket of flowers, or any such thing, order and\
shift those flowers by and upon one another, as.- they suit best; and thus you may\
exercise yourself in winter time, when you cannot have the life; because those\
flowers never wither. Green festoons may also be furnished after the same man-\
ner, and flowers hung on them according to your desire.\

CHAP. II. Of the Art of Engraving in general.\
THAT  may treat of this art in  methodical manner,  think proper to ob-\
. serve flrst, wherein its excellence consists ; secondly, its performance;\
and lastly, the qualifications of an etcher and engraver.\
The art of engraving is questionless noble and praise-worthy, because it re-\
spects painting, as painting does nature : for, as the latter has nature for its mo-\
del or object, which it faithfully imitates with the pencil ; so engraving likewise\
copies painting, either with the needle or graver, in such manner as only to stand\
in need of colours-; which when required, may be added to it. Painting con-\
sists in  neat and good outline, proportion, light and snade : and these are also\
the foundations of engraving. Painting distinguisnes between common light and\
sunshine : engraving does, or can do the sanie. In. fine, whatever the one per-\
forms with the pencil, the other can express with the needle or graver, and as\
neatly, whether sluffs of all kinds, wool, silk, sattin, linen, glass, water, gold,\
wood, stone, &.\
Its performances are to the sight, what fame is to the ear. Painting has but\
one original, but engraving hundreds. Fame can tell the many wonders of paint-\
ing in its absence; but engraving makes itself every where present ; slying over\
the universe, as well as the sounding trumpet of fame. It keeps an eternal re-\
gister of every thing that is praise-worthy : and as the intire welfare, even happi-\
ness or unhappiness of  good painter, depends on the certainty or uncertainty of\
\
the engraver, as Ishall shewin my remarks on prints after paintings or designs\
so the latter ought to disengage himself from prejudice and inclination to this or\
that particular manner, and exert his sxill in an exact imitation of what he is to\
engrave or etch after any manner or any master, be it flat or rising, dark or light,\
without addition or diminution, except with the licence of the painter or designer.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
His work must be like  clear looking-glass, which exhibits all objects true and\
without falsity. As to the manual operation,  fine handling is  great step to\
grace ; and in order to it, the knowledge of three things is absolutely necessary,\
to wit, the art of drawing, perspective, and the doctrine of light and shade :\
these as principals, compose the theory of the whole work. He ought also to be\
very diligent in hatching with the pen or red chalk, in order thereby to get  firm\
handling: and it behoves him as well as the painter, to draw after the naked life\
and dressed laymen. He should likewise be furnished with prints, both engraved\
and etched, of the most famous masters.\
CH AP. III. Of the general Elegance requisite in  good Print; and\
of the Difference between Book and other Prints.\
 grace of  well-etched or engraved print confists first, in  bright light.\
 dark shade ; by which  understand that the faint hatching on the\
lighted parts be kept almost imperceptible, and the shady touches contrarily\
strong and. dark. Secondly, that the naked, or carnations, be hatched fine and\
somewhat dull, and the draperies courser and rougher, accordingto their qualities;\
yet all without any outline, either on the light or shaded side, even so that the ex-\
tremities be only formed by the tint of the grounds against which they come.\
But to give the work the greatest perfection, and shew the judgment of the\
master, the tints of the colours should also appear as much as possible : yet as \
print does not so intirely consist of fine ordonnance, beautiful figures, elegant\
by-works, and neat cut or etched strokes, as in  good general harmony, so this\
harmony ought to be principally studied.\
The engraver will be commendable, sometimes to express in his work the co\'ac\
lours, if the matter require it ; such as the white and black in the day and night,\
good and bad angels or spirits, &. These two observations are absolutely neces-\
sary in  book-print: the others before-mentioned are only requisite in such as\
represent  complete picture : for there is  great difference between book and\
other prints : the former express the matter which is represented, even were it\
designed in white marble, bafs relief, nay, in snow or sand; and the latter con-\
sider only the master who painted it, and his art, together with that of the engraver\
and his capacity. For this reason, book-prints stand in need of explanation, but\
other prints not : for the colour is in the one, what the writing is in the other.\

CHAP. . of the Difference of Engraving and Etching.\
ACCORDING to the general opinion, and not without reason, etching\
is accounted more loose and designer-like than engraving, because\
\
there is no difference between etching and drawing, as to the handling;\
but the difference between drawing and engraving is very great. The\
management of the needle is the same with that of chalk or the pen :\
the plate lies flat and firm like the paper to draw upon. But wefind the contrary\
in engraving ; wherein the graver is held almost parallel with the plate, and the\
latter is moveable on  qushion or sand-bag. And as to force, there is also less\
occasion forit in etching than engraving.\
Now to prove that etching must needs be more designer-like than engraving,\
let us only make our remarks on both in the course of their bufinefs, each having\
 design before him; and then we shall find the reason to be, that in the one, both\
the drawing and plate are fixed before the artist, and he only moves his hand ;\
whereas the other cannot go forward without stirring, the plate being continually\
turning, and both the hand and arm employed in directing the graver; by which\
means, engravers are often hindered from perceiving the difference between their\
work and the pattern, before  part, nay the whole be finished. Wherefore, in\
my opinion, etching is superior to engraving in exactnefs and speed.  say speed,\
because three or more plates may be etched before one can be engraved. Etching\
is also most designer-like, because of its near affinity with drawing, as we daily\
experiment; for where one painter or designer engraves for his pleasure, an hun-\
dred take to etching, and make good progrefs therein ; because of the slow ad-\
vances in engraving compared to etching, whether in figures or buildings, but\
especially landscape. And since painters or designers care not to have their de-\
signs censured and corrected by others, they chule rather to etch them themselves\
than to set about engraving; an art not to be mastered without much expence of\
time, in getting knowledge how to handle the tool, whereby it would become\
rather labour than diversion.\
Many engravers etch for pleasure, because of its easiness; but seldom any etcher\
handles the graver, unless in case of necessity. Tothis perhapsit may be objected,\
that as each painter or designer has  particular choice wherein he labours most,\
as one in the ordonnance, another in nicety of draught, and  third in the neat\
finishing of some particular things, therefore the title of designer-like in etching,\
is not absolutely due to painters or designers. To which  answer, that undoubt-\
edly the word must not be understnod to relate to modern designers, because it\
was in, use before etching was brougt to its present perfection; as appears by\
Caracci, Titian, Antonio Tempesta, &. who excelled in design, andused the needle\
with noother view than to give the world the designs, which they counted capital\
and most praise-worthy, for the encouragement and consideration of the less\
knowing.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
knowing. Whereby we plainly perceive, that their intention was only to put\
forth their own performances in such  manner as safely to be relied on ; accord-\
ingly, we scarce see any more in them than an out-line : but this is so firm\
and correct, that however slightly the other parts may be scratched, these works,\
thus, of their own hands, are more valued than those of the best and most famous\
engravers or etchers.\
We have example in the print of the woman by the well, etched by Caraea\
bimself, how much it differs from that done by Le Potre, and another by Bissop.\
What  vast difference is there between. Perrier\'92 and Bissiop\'92 works; as\
to the designer-likeness and looseness of-handling. And in landscapes, between\
Titian\'92 and Perelle\'92,  could, if need required, produce more proofs of the an-\
tiquity of the word, designer-like; but shall wave them, and acquaint the read-\
er how oddly  took to etching, and how strangely  drudged before  could\
gain my point.\
Having in mny youth an inclination for etching, but no knowledge of what\
was good or bad. as seeing no other examples than the old and poorly en-\
graved prints of Raphael, Michael Angelo, Paul Veronese, Tintoret, &. which yet\
were excellent for their fine out-line, and few etched ones; my slender at-\
tempts may be easily guessed at. Indeed  cannot but still think of it\
with wonder; for  began not with copper or steel, but  piece of pew-\
ter and  nail about  finger\'92 length, which with great pains,  ground to\
 point after my own way, first  tried only singie strokes, and then cross-\
hatching, which looked strange enough. And instead of  rolling-press, \
rubbed the backsides of my proofs with the nail.. This however did not\
abate my curiosity; which daily encreased, though my work appeared so\
black as to be scarce intelligible. My father seeing this, could not forbear\
laughing; and for humour sake, gave two or three of my proofs to Bartho-\
let, and he again to Natalis the famous engraver, who bestowed on me some\
little instruction and  small copper-plate to try on. But what drudgery\
had  undergone before  scratched this beautiful plate  Bosse\'92 Book of etch-\
ing happening to be publisned about that time,  left off plaguing myself,\
and cheerfully set about splitting of wood, providing needles, boiling grounds,\
cleaning plates, buying aqua-fortis, wax, &. When before,  knew of no\
better ground than thick and foul oil, out of the smushi-pot, boiled to \
blackneis; which gave me no little trouble to get off the plate again after it\
was bit, and which therefore  was obliged to put into the fire till it was\
soft as lead. Things so far succeding to my wishi,  happened to see some\
prints of Vovet from France, which spurred my curiosity: and  should cer-\
tainly have made early and good progress, had not my father Leen fearful \
might six my thoughts on this study to the neglect of painting. Wherefore\
he dissuaded me from it, saying. it was too soon to enter on so difficult \
pastime; and instructing me in other things as delightful as advantageous.\
Marrying some years after,  went to Holland, were  re-asumed this noble\
art with great pleasure, and which  do not repent of; though some think\
it the cause of my misfortune. The truth of this God knows : yet had \
saved\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
faved candle and ufed more day-light for it, perhaps my old age might\
have proved more comfortable to me; but alasl those two noble sisters,\
painting and etching, are now vanished with my sight.\
Let the reader judge, whether he ever heard of  stranger way of etch-\
However,  mention it here to shew, that  diligent man, getting\
ing.\
better instruction, may in time gain his point. It is certain, that few young\
men would have had patience enough to drudge as  did, without instruction;\
but that an industrious tyro, after leaving his master, may possibiy improve\
through diligence and study is very natural; even so as to excel him in\
neatness, smoothnefs and expedition, as well in etching as engraving,  mean\
in the use of the graver and needle, but not in knowledge. By knowledge\
 understand keeping the likeness of  beautiful face, hands, and feet, accord-\
ing to what we say in the second chapter, that the knowledge consists in \
correct out-line, proportion; light and shade, and perspective : for we com-\
monly see the greatest faults committed in the aforesaid parts, for want of know-\
ledge, and not inuring themselve to draw by hand large things after small, and\
the contrary, but accustoming themselves to squaring;  practice not difficult\
to  swineherd\'92 boy, if he understood the division of squares and management\
of chalk. But they may yet be eroneous in tracing their object on the plate,\
though drawn upon squares; for missing the out-line in the least either inward-\
ly or outwardly, it presently becomes too little or too big: but the tyro cannot\
see this for want of due knowledge : and though he may be sensible, that here\
or there he has  little missed the out-line, yet he passes it over as  matter\
of no great moment; and if he propose to help it in etching or engraving, he\
may possibly forget it before he come so far in the work : he commonly thinks\
no further than what is already on the plate. Whence we may easily conclude,\
that he who knows what constitutes beauty, can be as little sensible that  small\
difference in  face, arm, or hand, is of any great consequence. Another diffi-\
culty, no less than the former, is, that though the tyro have the out-line cor-\
rectly drawn on the plate, yet he may run over it when he comes to shade or\
hatch. And as this fr\'e9quently happens,  shall here give the reason of it.\
In either engraving or etching anything, the off-work, whcther buildings,\
landscape, or even grounds, ought always to be begun first, that by reserving\
the principal things for the last, the hand may be prepared to handle them\
with more boldness. Now the tyro being to engrave or etch  ground be-\
hind his figure, be it naked or dressed, he will not only (especially in engraving )\
end his hatching against the out-line, but sometimes exceed it ; whereby the\
parts, whetiier arm, leg, or hand, must needs loose their truc proportion and\
quality : gatthus the almost imperceptible and tender rising muscles, folds,\
the work goes on; and when they come to sce the mistake, they scrape, burn-\
isn and rub, to bring it right again; which  grant is well enough in case of\
need. But alas  hoy seldom is it practised ; ff it be something of no great\
consequence, it remains as it was without further inspection. This  know not\
by hearsay but experience, Wherefore they who have an inclination for en-\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
graving, should apply to  painter for instruction in beautiful proportion, and\
in drawing every thing by hand, whether prints, drawings, paintings, plaister-\
figures, even the life itself. For painters first teach the theory, or knowledge of\
proportion, and then the practice of colouring; whereas many engravers begin\
with the practice or handling,\
As for the scraping, burnishing, and rubbing out, before-mentioned, it is \
point which ought to be well understood, because it affects not either the too\
great darkness or hardness of the hatching, but the out-line; as  shall shew by\
the example of the faces in plate LXIX.\
In the face , the hatched ground runs over the out-line of the cheek ; where-\
by it appears more sunk in, as in that of , and thus the out-line is lost. Now\
this face being to be finished, and the cheek brought right again, so much must\
be scraped off within the line as to give the chcek the former swell; and if the\
face be  fourth part less, the difference will be so much the greater, especially\
in  portrait, and greater still if it be in profile ; as face  shiews, wherein we see\
how little soever be taken off with the ground from the tip of the nose, mouth,\
and chin, it will produce another aspect: whence it it is evident, what  vast\
alteration this must cause in the likeness.\
In this art as well as painting, it is  constant rule to be begin with the\
painters : for when the principal figures are finished, the whole piece is reckoned\
into the work ; here somewhat more strength, there more faintness, &. But\
what we now speak of, to wit, scraping, concerns engraving only ; whereas in\
etching, nothing is done but stopping, unless things are already bit.\
If it be afked, whether what is stopped up can be repaired -before\
it is bit ; as in , when the hatching, which takes away the swell from the\
cheeks, is stopped up with stop-ground, Whether then the former roundness can-\
not be fetched out with  fine needle on the same ground, that all may bite to-\
gether ,  answer, that this will make bad work : but if something be wanting,\
it must be touched up with the graver. However,  shall shew another method :\
make  burnissier pretty hot, and rub it gently and speedily over the part you\
would have out, and then it will close up the hatching, so that you need neither\
stop up nor bite. Now etch thereon what is necessary, and thus all may be bit\
at once. These observations, especially that of not carelessly spoiling the out-line\
as in the examples  and , are very needful.\
Let any person now consider, how little  fine ordonnance of  famous maf-\
ter, when put out of hand in such  condition can be like the original. And\
vet this is too often the case. However,  assert, that without the former know-\
ledge it is impossible to become  good master. For he who makes  Blunder-\
ing design, and perceives not the mistakes to be apparent and convincing, can-\
not possibly mend them. Even great masters sometimes blunder; as we see in\
Audran\'92 battles of Alexander after Le Brun, what poor hands and fingers he has\
made in some places, as thin as pencil-sticks; especially those which are wide\
open, as the captive Porus, and in Darius.  cannot too much wonder, that\

in so glorious  work, Audran did not correct such mistakes, since he was one of\
the best engravers ever known. This indeed is but  small matter with respect\
to so great  work ; nevertheless it makes the same imperfect and becomes \
charge upon Le Brun. But this work had less justice done it here in Holland in\
the copies of Schoonebeek, who seems to have used his utmost endeavours to.\
spoil it: for there is neither design nor keeping observed. All the postures,\
which in the originals are fine and beautiful, he has turned into grimace ; every\
thing is lame and crippled.\
CHAP. . Remarks on Hatching.\
HE course of hatching yields great pleasure to the eye ; because it makes\
\
every thing appear in its nature and quality, whether wood, silk, steel,\
water, silver, wood, stone, sand, &. each of which, in engraving and etching,\
require  particular exprefsion : yet in etching it is more expeditious, especially\
if you can somewhat handle the graver. The French artist Audran excelled herein.\
The St. Bruno of Bartholet, engraved by Natalis, is admirable for the naturalnefs,\
which, by particular hatchings and the utmost neatness, appears therein.\
Now, when  great artist has shewn his utmost sxill in  plate, and all things\
are worked accordiag to rule, yet we find it almost impossible to make people sen-\
sible what true art is, and wherein the knowledge of  good print lies; most\
men, now--days, being taken with sine strokes, without regard to ill order or bad\
design.  sad reflexion for those who know better \
Again, an engraver or etcher is not so happy as  painter or designer; for\
these last compose what they please, or at least what they can, and the engravers\
must follow them, be they ever so indifferent. Yet this were no great matter, if\
they might but etch and engrave with as much freedom as painters use with\
their pencils or crayons : this would spirit them to produce finer things, as other\
ingenious men have formerly done, who had their liberty, and did not tie them-\
selves up to any person, as many now--days are obliged to do. How seldom\
have they an opportunity to work after  fine picture or finished drawing: This\
has often induced me to think, that many  good master understands more than\
his works shew : happy are they, whose circumstances will permit them to exe-\
cute even but  single plate, according to their skill and pleasure. But alas \
the times will not allow it in these our free and noted countries. Moreover, we\
see many artists sigh and groan under the difficulties laid on them by some pain-\
ters and designers, in sometimes sending them such rude drawings, that the\
round can hardly be distinguished from tne square; the sharp from the blunt; or\
wood from stone; even such as they themselves could not sunderstand, swere\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
they to receive them from others. If the engraver happens to hit the design, the\
master claims honour; but on failure, the engraver is sure to bear the scandal :\
for this reason, it were to be wishied, that engravers would, before they begin \
plate after such  drawing or sketch, consult the painter or designer, for  reso-\
lution of all their doubts, and that they might proceed with certainty.\
 also think it not only useful but necessary, that the designer be particular in\
his expression of all the materials : for instance, that the basement-story of \
building shew to be of rough stones, the columns and pilasters with the imagery\
and ornaments of marble, &. that the engraver may exhibit the former rough\
by broken strokes, and what is sinooth and polished, by neat and more curious\
ones, with the graver; etching the by-works somewhat coarser again; the wood\'ac\
work with long and broken strokes humouring the grain; the trees, according to\
the course of the boughs and sway of the leafing; the grounds, serpentine, and\
also broken. These observations ought to be heeded in general, as well as in\
the particulars, together with the diminution of the off-scape; yet not in the man-\
ner of some, by wide strokes, but by closing and making them fine. On this\
footing, there would be lafs complaint of the designers, and these not think\
themselves injured on seeing their designs so ill followed. Things thus worked\
according to rule, would certainly prove fine. and the more, in  work of conse-\
quence and bearing  price:: though to one who understands his business, this\
management is no more trouble than the contrary.\
 have seen drawings of Goltzius, wherein he had plainly expressed all the par-\
ticular objects. The tender or smooth bodies were well washed, also neatly scum-\
bled with red or black chalk. What was rough or coarse, he had handled boldly\
with the pen or black chalk; by which means, the one appeared darker, and the\
other lighter in the shade, as if it were  picture. But it is no wonder, that we\
see not such things done now--days ; for Goltzius used to make his own pat-\
terns : and as  good painter considers what ought to be ftone, wood, flesh,\
white or black, before he colours, so Goltzius did the same, when he was to engrave\
any thing. He would express every thing in his patterns, though he was ever so\
certain of his art, in order to do his whole worst after  slight sketch, and that no-\
thing might escape him; on  belief that we ought not to trust to our memories\
in  matter of consequence : wherefore  shall illustrate this point by an example\
in Plate LXX. wherein  introduce several different bodies : for, besides the icor-\
rectness of draught,  have alfo expressed their different colours. The wall, ,\
is rough stone;. the child, , tenderly shaded; the vessel, , of bright copper;\
the vase, , white polished marble; the pedestal or foot, , of free-stone; the\
wooden pale, , (whereon hangs  cloth) veiny ; and the sky and off-scape, ,\
as it goes off, the fainter and finer: by this method of expression,  have still\
another advantage ; which is, that if liy accident  should leave my plate half\
done, another hand, by this means, may understand my meaning, and finifh it.\
Hereby, even  painter may direct another ; who, else, would rather chuse to\
have the works, he might leave behind him unfinisned, rubbed out, than that\
another, who did not rightly know his mind, should finish them.\

CHAP. VI. Curious Remarks touching Stipping.\
ANY imagine, they can represent the roundness against the main lights,\
 by stipping; but they will find themselves mistaken, since it causes  great\
fungriness; and therefore the method cannot be good : hatching looks better,\
and has more affinity with the shades. Stipping is sometimes useful in case of\
need, when we care not to cross-hatch on the light; and also, when the shades\
are hatched too wide, in order to express the restexions somewhat the plainer, in-\
stead of crossing them over again, especially again the light; though it is better\
to go over them again with asine single stroke : and if you find this will not do,\
then you may, with  finer needle, continue the same hatching somewhat far-\
ther : but  better method would be, to lay it at once as far as it ought to be,\
and then somewhat to stop up the ends or extremities: he who neglects this, is\
obliged to make shift with stipping; yet that must not be too close. The best\
way is, first, with  fine needle, to continue the hatching  little further, and\
hatching, as was old Visscher\'92 way in his boors after Ostade, whereby he prettily\
expressed the colour of  face, and fetched out the main light touches. Stip-\
ping is very helpful, and also expeditious to one who has not got the firmness of\
hatching; for the points thus lengthened answer the same purpose; and then you\
can proceed with certainty, especially if vou use the same needle with which the\
hatching is continued in the light, round the relief; the shades, again, ought\
to be softened with the same necdle that made them; then the stipping of the\
large needle in the shade will not be too visible : yet, would you work the last\
stipping in the light with  smaller needle, you may ; but, because the shade ends\
more suddenly than the relief in the light,  should use no others; for the stip-\
ping is  nice point to him who will be curious. The stips ought also to be\
equal,  say, equally distant, and not to come between the extremities of the\
strokes. If it be afked, whether any thing hatched too wide, can be darkened\
with stipping, instead of  third stroke ; My opinion is, that it may; and that\
any slight thing can be performed in this manner: but the work is more tedious.\
Things so touched up look very neat; for by strong strokes, fainter ones, more\
faint and points, we can very commodioussy darken an object more or less at\
pleasure. Boulanger has in my opinion, over-stipped his prints; which makes\
them look rather like miniature, than any thing else ; wherefore  cannot much\
com-\
\
\
\
\
\
\
commend stipping; And why ) Because of the inequality and hungriness of the\
points or stips, occasioned by touching one harder than another, whereby, in\
biting, one penetrates the copper more than another, be the dot ever so small:\
add to this, the impossibility of making the stips perfectly round : they will\
always be more or lefs longifh; as may be easily proved by  magnisying\
glass.\
( have seen, in engraved prints of Goltzius, the faint tint upon the relief cross-\
hatched, as well as in the shade; but this is only proper for engraving, espe\'ac\
cially in high finishing; because in etching, the cross hatching expresses  com-\
ing shade ; and then it may be very well effected by stipping, as broad-lighted\
objects want not so much darkness in the light.\
Now, if any thing should happen to be amiss, and you would beat it out and\
mend it, take  proof and fasten it neatly behind your plate, and then beat out\
what you would have away : this may be done even to an hair; and if you care\
not to strike on the paper, you may mark the place with  sharp point on the\
copper, so as to see it; which will do as well, though the spoiling  proof is\
but \'e0 trisse : yet the proof, when once dry, is no more fit for this use; where-\
fore the work must be done as soon as the proof comes from the prefs; for,\
being wetted again, it will always be uncertain, and unlike the plate. In order\
to find these little places or misbit spots with still greater ease, ( method which\
many engravers make  secret of) take  fine thread or string, and put it cross-\
wise about the plate, tying it on the edges, so that the center of the crofs\
come exactly upon the misbit spot or place : then laying the plate backside up-\
wards, on  smooth and hard stone, beat the place gently with  pointed ham-\
mer; and then, with some stuff taken from the oil-stone, rub it out : thus you\
may find all the places, how small soever, even to an hair, on the backside of the\
plate.\

CHAP. VII. Of Etching Bass-Reliefs.\
 we have asserted that each object requires almost  particular handling,\
 so  think bafs reliefs call for it : for many who can etch well after  fine\
picture or drawing, are at  loss when they come to imitate and represent  bass-\
relief: they lay the strokes therein as in other objects; though in my opinion,\
the difference be very great ; especially if we would not handle them in the man-\
ner of Perrier and Pietro Santi, but according to rule; though the former under-\
stood it the best of the two, since his works better preserve the stoniness and de-\
sign; and yet he has added some things of his own : but the other has done it to\
such\
\
\
\
\
\
\
such excess, as thereby to render his works obscure : his folds indeed are fine,\
yet superfluous and improper for stone, and more like gold, silver or bronze; ap-\
pearing better in  print than in stone. In my opinion, Santi understood not the\
naked proportion, muscling or motion ; wherefore  cannot by any means al-\
low him the preference : the truth is, they are good for  drawing; but were\
they to be compared with the life, we should discover  great difference. In the\
next place, it is absurd to imagine, that so many bass reliefs as are found at\
Rome and in other places, both under cover and exposed, in and upon the tri-\
umphal arches, frizes, niches, pediments, pedestals, ancient walls, tombs, co-\
lumns and vases, from whence these two artists made their collections, should all\
stand in so precise \'e0 light, right and left, as they represent them in. Certainly,\
some of them must have been lighted from above, from below, fronting, even\
from all sides; and  cannot think they drew them by candle-light, but rather\
shaded them as they thought fit.\
 was once afked, whether, since the bafs reliefs stand in many different places,\
moulds or models have not sometimes been taken from them by one or other,\
from which they shadowed their drawings, disposing these models as usual, in\
We\
the left or right light, as they thought proper; which is not improbable.\
might likewise light some from above, others from below, from  side, fronting\
and from behind, in order to use them on any occasion ; which would be  great\
help to those who know little or nothing of modelling.\
We have said, that we think the bass-reliefs of Perrier better in design than\
those of Pietro Santi, but much inferior in finishing; though the works of the\
latter, for the reason before assigned, have no affinity with the stoniness: and\
yet some think, that were the figures three or four feet high, they would have\
another look ; for then the parts would appear more grand ; and those of Perrier,\
on the other hand, too slim and dull; which  do not disown; nevertheless, it\
must be agreed, that this observation is good, in order to shew the difference\
between carving in stone, and chasing in gold or silver : but it is likewise true,\
that had Perrier finished his drawings as well as Santi, they would have been\
much finer and more useful; for it is easier to leave out superfluities than\
make additions. It is not improbable, that Santi\'92. intention, by his method of\
management, was, that he might be of greater service to painters, statuaries and\
chasers, than Perrier.\
We have affirmed, that Pietro Santi has possibly added much of his own. Now,\
it is also not unlikely, that Perrier drew his objects from  greater distance than\
Santi, whereby he could not see all the minute parts; and  cannot but at the\
same time think, that Santi designed most of his bass reliefs after undamaged\
within-door work, in halls, chambers, and other inclosed places ; whereas Perrier\
possibly took his from without-door work, fuch as pediments, frontispieces, frizes.\
and the like, half eaten up by the weather. We might still subjoin, that\
Perrier worked only to shew the world that such excellent things were at Rome,\
and at the same time to display his light and firm manner of drawing ; whereas\
Santi had not only  view to profit, but also to be generally useful to curious ar-\
tists and others. How true this is let the virtuoso determine.\
As\
\
\
\
\
\
\
As to the right handling of bafs reliefs,  think it absolutely necessary, that\
every thing be etched equally coarse or sine with one and the same needle, with-\
out any difference with respect to stuffs ; as being the best method for represent-\
ing the stone-work well; unless it were but  grey one with  fore-ground and\
off-scape, when the strokes ought to diminish or grow faint, according to\
perspective.\
There is likewise little observation made about the lights of bass-reliefs,\
for oftentimes, things painted sharp and in sun-shine, are exhibited in the plate\
with  common light, through the roundness of the shades; and somerimes we see\
the contrary : but these are liberties tihich neither etchers nor engravers ought\
to take. He, whose province it is to imitate, let him exactly follow the beaten\
path. In relation to etching bass reliefs,  sharp light or sun-shine is very im-\
proper, and renders them disagreeable. But as for embellishments in sun-shine,\
the matter is of less moment.\
CHAP. VIII. Of Engraving; and the Management of the Strokes.\
Tis to be wondered, that among the many arts and manual operations, en-\
Igraving is so little, and etching so much treated of; the reason whereof is\
past my apprehension. Many painters and lovers, for the encouragement of\
those who would make it their business, or to shew their skill, have ear-\
nestly strove to say something of it : but no engraver has, to my knowledge,\
undertaken the tafk ; possibly, as not thinking themselves sufficient for it; or\
else, because they would keep it as  secret from each other. But the most pro-\
bable reason, as  think, is, the late appearance of this art; which is evident,\
since the Romans till their latter times knew nothing of.\
It is certain, that engraving as well as painting, is founded as much on\
theory as practice, and that both depend on established and positive rules, which,\
if orderly followed, will make  man  master: Why then, are they not made\
public, for the information of the curious in what they want to know; Must\
not he, who intends to go to  certain town or village, be first told where it\
lies, and then the ways to it, chusing the nearest as beft,\
It is not strange, that more engravers have applied to painting, than painters\
to engraving ; because the latter have so many excellent books for their encou-\
ragement, publisned by judicious masters; whereas, engravers have not one\
touching their practice. But as every thing has its time, so we must hope for\
it in this.\

In the mean time  fhall boldly enter the lists, and, according to my small\
ability, impart what  know of it; but the practice or handling,  shall not touch\
upon, as not having the greatest skill therein : what, however,  mention of it,\
as unavoidably necessary to what  purpose to say,  submit to those of better\
knowledge; hoping my endeavours will not be taxed with presumption, since my\
only aim is, thereby to rouze noble genius\'92, and, by my small spark, to kindle\
 greater fire ; according to the Latin proverb : Parva sape scintilla magnum excita-\
We have before-mentioned, First, On what basis engraving is founded. Se-\
condly,  good engraver\'92 qualifications. Lastly, What constitutes an agreeable\
print : wherefore, we shall now discuss the management of the strokes in objects,\
according to their natures and courses, with respect to perspective ; and as well in\
etching as engraving, together with some examples for illustrating the point, and\
preventing and correcting mistakes.\
In Plate LXXI. is  wheel marked , having eight spokes, or points ; as\
also  staff, set upright in the ground, crossed by the horizon. This wheel shews,\
that each spoke ought to have  particular course, according to its turn, and that\
the strokes muff be governed by the extremity of each spoke, as may be here\
seen. The foremost runs circular; the third, almost straight, &. Compare\
also the foremost spoke one, with the hinder one five, how much they differ in\
force ; for one approaches, and five retires : which cannot be otherwise according\
to perspective Again, the strokes drawn with  ruler, and running off towards\
the point of sight, grow gradually finer and fainter. Now though the short\
or cross-hatching ought, by established rule, to be more visible and strong than\
the long, yet few are observed to make any distinction therein.\
We have said before, that each object, whether flesh, stone, grounds, &. re-\
quires  particular stroke; and among others, that wood especially must be thick-\
stroked along the grain, and consequently cross-hatched with  finer stroke : but\
now we shew the contrary ; for the cross ones are stronger than those running\
with the grain which here cannot be otherwise. If some say that  contradict my-\
self, in making the crofs-strokes thus against the grain; Ishall, for their satisfac\'ac\
tion, shew my reason for it. Observe, then, that any thing turned, has no other\
grain than what the chisel makes; and as the turner works against the grain, and\
the wood retains more or less marks of the tool, it must be expressed accordingly\
in engraving. But  second question may be, Whether it would not do as well,\
if both the hatchings were equally fine or coarse;  answer, It would, as to the\

shade; but not with respect to the stuff: for it would be more proper to stonc,\
copper, wax, and. such-like : nevertheless these observations are generally little\
heeded, though also founded on certain rules of this art.\
As for the staff, it shews, that the strokes, beginning round from below, grow\
straiter as they approach the horizon; and above the horizon, the same, but in \
reversed manner.\
Now let us consider the other example, in Plate LXXI. wherein the retiring\
parapets shew the diminution or faintneis of the strokes, not only in such, but in\
any other objects, according to their distance in going off; the one in  greater,\
the ocher in  less degrec. Hertby we may plainly discover the perverse notion\
of some men; namely, that diminution implies growing scanty or wider. See ,\
with  single stroke from one end to the other. Now, although the off-strokes\
scem neater than the near; yet they are not so in fact: but as the place dimi-\
nisties, so the strokes close and thin in such manner, that they become neither\
closer nor more fcanty. The diminution of the figures and the three vases bears\
the same construction : neverthelefs,  am sensible that many, even old masters,\
do otherwise in handling their retiring objects, figures, trees, off-scape and sky,\
more coarsly behind than forwards.  have even observed, that they close-hatch\
the nearest and darkest sky, and work wider and wider towards the horizon; but\
this more in etching than engraving; possibly to save the trouble of using two or\
more needles, or of stopping up, which is properly the point this example aims\
at : for  do not afk here, whether it creates more troubl\'e9; but shew what may\
possibly be thought of less moment than in fact it is : for instance,  place the\
three figures, No.    ten or twelve steps apart; and at the same distance\
on the parapet, three vases; also numbered    whereby may be plainly per-\
ceived, how much the one differs from the other. But although in these figures\
the meaning is sufficiently to be understood; to wit, that the finer they are, the\
more fine and close the strokes become; yet  have added the vases to them, for\
the sake of those who may be curious enough to count the strokes: when they\
will find not  stroke more or less in the one than the other; which in the figures\
would be tedious work. Observe, in the next place, the ground-shade of each fi-\
gure against the parapet, each growing faint according to its distance, and with\
what certainty the accurate tints of the figures may be perceived thereon ; even to\
know how much they diminisn and grow finer; and at the same time, how much\
the light differs. But let it not be thought sufficient, that the shades diminish or\
grow faint, and the white remains all over the light; since we know that the\
plan or ground cannot shew its level otherwise, than by means of light forwards,\
going off darker and darker: for instance, were  white figure or white stone stand-\
ing forwards, and you would place such another further in, where the ground is\
darker, you must govern vourself by the ground where the first object stands, as\
being subject to the same rule, if things be well finished. If the plan or ground\
be finished, the figures ought to be so likewise. Are they airily handled and\
broad-lighted, the ground must be the same: and though the ground in its co-\
lour, be more or less dark, yet that is not regarded in this case; because we are\
speaking only of the diminution of the tints, consisting of white and black.\
Suppose\
Dloitized by GOOgle\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
Suppose the floor were of white marble, and the figures the same, or in white\
draperies ; the foremost would be broad lighted, and the more distant less and\
less white, were it even in sun-shine; nay, if the light came from behind, or from\
aside, the most distant would only keep an utmost heightening, and still less, were\
the colours expressed in it; as they who understand perspective well know: nor\
can it be otherwise ; as may be seen in the first example in the child\'92 hand hold-\
ing the end of. the hindmost spoke, which plainlv appears to have little or no\
whiteness : and as for the stuffs of the objects, as linen, cloth and such like, some\
may rather think them possible to be so worked than the naked ; because, having\
already engraved forwards as neat and fine as may be, we can therefore further\
in, not express any thing finer or neater: but  say, that as things having the\
utmost neatness, do not become neater by distance, nor alter in the eye, but dis-\
appear : so, when the objects are very remote, neither silk, linen or woollen is to\
be distinguished, so far as it concerns the hatching; but the coarse parts always\
keep their forms : and this observation respects not only the three stuffs, but\
also figures, stones, grounds, trees, &. Here some perhaps may say, How can\
the strokes possibly unite the light, when they, as they retire, ought to be closer\
and closer, especially when the air, (which, on the horizon, is clear and bright\
and free from clouds) unless they widen more and more towards the horizon,\
were they never so faint: To which  answer, as experience will prove, that when\
the strokes thus thin and grow faint in their going off, they certainly disappear\
and die away ; nay, become at last invisible, and unite enough with the light,\
even were it sun-shine, though they be ever so close: and such  length  think\
the graver can go when skilfully managed. In etching, the needle can do the\
same by stopping up.\
However,  question not but my proposition will be taxed with impossibility\
and puzzling novelty especially by such as are not thorough engravers, who may\
blame me for thus disclosing the grounds of this noble art, and so plainly shewing\
truth : but my answer in the first place, is, that  find myself obliged in duty to\
do so, since all my wishies tend towards its arriving at the greatest perfection. Se-\
condlv, because what  lay down is prescribed by certain rules of the mathematics;\
though sew are senlible, that the art of engraving, in general flows therefrom, and\
that different objects require different handlings; but rather believe, that  good\
method of drawing will easily lead to engraving:  notion true enough in etch-\
ing, though even therein the point lies most in the biting and stopping up.\
As\
to engraving, vou must certainly be conversant with the handling and force\
 of\
the graver; two points not to be attained without great experience : though\
the beginning, it is better for an etcher to have no handling at all ; becaute he\
may then gradually the better bring the graver to the needle, and in an uniformity\
of strokes adapt the one to the other, and make them harmonious : whereas some,\
relying too much on the graver, use it here and there in their slovenly works, with-\
out any difference, and that with incredible carelessness; sometimes cutting  fore-\
ground, stone or stem of  tree, neat and smooth, which ought to be rough and\
knobby ; when at the same time they are working  face or marble figure with\
the\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
the needle. This must be owing either to their carelessness, or desier of ease or\
their ignorance ; since such doings are against reason and common instruction.\
 could mention many such disorderly prints : among others there is one of the\
raising of Lazarus, done by Berry, wherein the figure of Lazarus, with so much of\
the linen as comes about his body is etched, and the rest of the linen lying on\
the ground, neatly engraved, whereby one part looks like linen, and the other\
like silk: the one is here and there stipped, and the other is not. But perhaps\
the plate was not well bit. It also sometimes happens, that we are obliged to\
rub out things, which makes good my affertion : for, if the fault lie in the plate,\
the master ought, as much as possible, to help. it by his knowledge and judgment.\
Could he handle the graver, Why did he not shew it and make things agree ; And\
if he was not master of the graver, Why did he not better follow the strokes of\
the needle \'92 Had he insteed of cross-hatching, made the strokes somewhat finer and\
triple hatched them, and used some stipping, then it would have been passable.\
There is another print with an ornament round it, representing  sacrifice of\
Flora, or the Spring, which is also wretchedly etched and engraved : for the fore-\
most figures, as Charity, Piety and Time, and every thing else on the fore-ground\
are neatly finished and mostly engraved ; but the figures on the second ground so\
slight and poorly etched, as not to have any agreement with the others; the\
strokes even look as if they were dabbed on and drawn with  shaking hand, in-\
stead of growing fainter every where, which would make the work neat and in-\
tire. This artist might have known, that he could not make the graver and the\
needle agree.\
 am sensible some will determine, that many things, such as water, silver,\
gold and such like smooth and shining bodies, can be more conveniently express-\
ed with the graver then the needle: but, in my opinion,  fkilful hand can\
give every thing its naturalness.\
It is very strange to me, in the old prints, that the masters have in nothing re-\
prepsented the natural qualities, but etched every thing after one manner whether\
nudities draperies, air, grounds, or stone ; except water, and yet not this with thin\
and thick strokes, but only crofs parallels, and those very unlike, oftentimes close,\
and then wide, as if they were scratched again, they have not expressed any\
colour and always made the water dark and brown. Now, to create  difference\
in shining bodies, my thoughts are, that you first lay the strokes strong and pa\'ac\
rallel, and of  reasonable width from each other, and then close them by putting\
thinner between ;  mean in water, black marble, polished steel and such like ; for\
by this method we produce  certain stir shewing the smoothness and glitter.\
If it be afked, Why in etching, the strokes which are close and thick sometimes\
fly up, though the plate be in good condition, and the ground neither burnt nor\
too hard ;  answer that  have found by experience that when the water is too\
strong, and at first bites too sharp, we must then take our chance ; because the\
plate being cold cannot grow warm so soon as the ground, which therefore is for-\
cibly lifted from the plate and presently rises; and the sooner if the strokes be\
close and thick ; which happens not so easily in the tender parts, wh\'eare by the\
thinness and width of the strokes, the water has not so much power to get under\
them.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
them. To prevent this, the water must be somewhat weakened and the ground\
and plate gradually made warm in order to make them unite with each other;\
especially in cold weather for in the warm months of June, July and August, it is\
not necessary, because we then use harder grounds.\
Now to kuow whether the ground be in good condition,  make  scratch or\
two, with  large needle in  spare place of the plate; and if the ground come out\
of the strokes like dust ; it is then too hard, but if in curls, it is in good temper,\
especially if you can blow them off. If they cannot be wiped off with  soft fea-\
ther, but stick to the ground, it is then too soft. This is  nice point. It fome-\
times happened to me, that here and there they remained in the strokes.\
Some etchers also frequently give themselves needless trouble when they put\
out the out-lines, which are made too strong on the light side, with stop-ground,\
which youknow, always flows more or less overthem especially if the place be hot:\
but consider what trouble they must afterwards have, when the out line is gone;\
for they are obliged to renew with the graver all the strokes running against it.\
Wherefore, the best way is, to trace the drawing neatly on the plate, and mark\
at first softly with  small point, the dark touches, as those of the eyes, nose and\
mouth on the snaded side; yet not on the light. But to help them in stopping up\
their too strong strokes,  shall assign  better method than that of the stop-\
ground.\
Take thick-ground white-lead, thinned with oil of turpentine, and spread it\
with  small pencil over the out-line so as just to cover it and no further; but\
be very careful not to do it over more then once, lest you take off the ground;\
for the oil afterwards evaporates and in the biting, you must also not wipe over\
it with the featiier. This is an invention of afriend of mine and though  never\
experimented it, yet question not its success.  mention white-lead ; but you\
CHAP. IX. Of the Black Art, or Mezzotinto\
HOUGH no figure of this art is to be found in Caesar Ripa as having been\
unknown to him, yet since in our times, through its foundation laid by\
princes and the kind affistance of great men, it is arived at so great perfection ;\
 hope the following figure will not be unacceptable to the profefsors and lovers\
of it.\
Figure of the Black Art, or Mezzotinto.\
Here you see  young and plump virgin, of  frefh complexion and ami\'ac\
able countenance, dressed in black velvet, lined and faced with sky-blue pow-\
dered with gold glittering stars. She has  broad gold girdle embroidered\
with black bats which diminisn towards the arms. Her head attire is wanton\
and\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
and modish, adorned here and there with small flowers. About her neck is \
gold chain to which hangs  medal, exhibiting  burning altar, and these\
words, MAGNAE BRITANN\'c6. In her right hand is  small tool, like \
lancet, together with  feather ; and in the left  table, whereon is painted an\
head on  black ground, representing Nature. She poises airily on one leg, as\
if she were dancing.\
Explanation.\
The Art is represented young and plump, to fignyfy that she is still growing.\
The black velvet gown and stars imply that, like the stars she is sprung from\
dark night. The golden girdle and bats give us to understand, that though her\
productions are not very lasting, yet she makes great gains. The chain with\
the niedal and altar thereon, proclaims her lustre; and the words round it\
allude to an offering of thanks to Great-Britain, to whom she owes her origin\
and glory. The table, with the figure of Nature shews, that she excels therein.\
The rest explains itself.\
Why this beautiful figure bears the name of the Black Art  never heard,\
though her practice sufficiently gives us the reason, to wit, that she proceeds from\
black. And though the art of etching also seems to be derived from black,\
yet it is done in quite  different manner; for the former comes forth from the\
light, and the latter from the shade; the one heightens and the other\
shadows.\
We have already said that etching is in speed, superior to engraving; but\
the black art is more expeditious then either of them; and in neatnefs has\
not its fellow; it may even compair with  painting, how soft and sluent\
seover, abating for the colours. Indeed in duration and wear it is the weakest;\
but on the other hand its expeditiousness brings in more money.\
This noble art preferable to any engraving in representing uncomon lights,\
as candle, torch, lamp, fire, and the like: wherefore,  think it does not im\'ac\
properly bear the name of the black art. It is remarkable not to be above\
fifty ycars standing, and yet is ariyd at so great perfection ;\
those other arts\
have required more time. But England where the climate is healthful and\
temperate, has contributed much, to its neatnefs and lustre. There it had\
its birth and furtherance : for prince Rupert gave us the first example. Where\
fore we may rightly stile it noble. The first print  saw of this prince was of an\
old man\'92 head, with  cloth about it, taken, as far as  know, from an Italian\
painting. It was designed so sine and great, and broad handled, as if washed with\
the pencil by the best master : it even looked, by reason of the natural softness\
or melting, not to be less than black art. The same prince also invented  cer-\
ain metal bearing his name, which it will retain for ever,\
 doubt not but this art will in time become  delightful diversion to painters,\
for thr\'e9e reafons. One for its easiness in learning; two for its neatneis; and,\
lastly, for its conveniency.\
\
\
\
\
 \
\
\
\
\
\
. It is easily learned, by any one who is accustomed to draw on grounded or\
blue paper; because there is no difference in operation between the scraping on the\
plate and heightening on the grounded paper, beginning with the greatest light and\
sparing the shade; as we have shewed in our drawing-book, touching the handling\
of crayons or chalk pencils. Wherefore  affirm that it comes nearer to  paint-\
ing than etching or engraving. And it is so easily apprehended,  mean in theo-\
ry as to be learned in lefs than three days.\
 It is neat and free from soil and smell; as not requiring either  stop-ground,\
grease or aqu\'e6-fortis.\
Lastly, the conveniency arising from it may be easily conjectured ; as it is more\
expeditious then either etching or engraving.\
But many are so eager in this art to learn neat scraping, as to neglect the princi\'ac\
and when correct design is wanting in  plate or print, What judicious person will\
approve it: Indeed we cannot manage here as in etching, where the out-line may\
be traced on the plate with  needle for the white sometimes goes out, or is so faint\
as scarce to be seen ; besides it is inconvenient to scrape figures against  light\
ground; though artists generaly use to work the figure first, and then the off-scape\
against it. Now to prevent this inconvenience, first scrape vour back-ground, and\
spearthe neat out-line; rather keeping  little out from it tillthe figure be finished:\
afterwards you may gently scrape nearer. Thus you will not so easily run over\
the out-line as when vou begin with the figure.\
painters and that of engravers ; for the former making it only their diversion, do\
not finish things so very highly as the latter, who have been brought up therein,\
and make it their constant bufiness. Painters are satisfied with shewing only good\
design and general decorum, because when they were neatly to finissi one plate,\
thay can work another.\
This art is certainly easy to  person of good knowledge: but if the work be\
not light enough at first, go over it  second time. Indeed you must not think to\
finish up at once, because till  proof be taken, you cannot possibly know what con-\
dition your plate is in. Do like the painters, first to dead-colour with broad\
parts and then finisn. Now having  proof, you can give the work its main\
heightness, and thus with patience finisn every part ;  point requiring neither\
much time nor study, but  little observation. There is published  print of \
little satyr, which in an hour\'92 time  scraped loose in my hand, as  walked in \
garden; and, after  proof taken, finished in another hour. Few learn this art,\
because, as Il think, they cannot be persuaded how easy it is, and with what few\
circumstances attended. But should the lovers set about it, we may possibly in\
time see it become too common, and etching and engraving neglected ;  mean in\
objects pecular to theb lack art, such as portraits, night and candle-pieces, spectres\
and inchantments, apparitions, flowers, fruits, silver, gold, china-ware, crystal, arms\
and herbs. Who will be able to etch or engrave those things so perfect and nat-\
tural\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
tural as thay can be scraped; but in figure, architecture, bass-reliefs and landsca pe,\
the art is weak, and not at all so proper as engraving.\
It is  great pity, that both this beautiful art and the artist have so bad   ame\
as if the one were witchcraft, and the other,  magician, though nothing but mere\
art-works.  long to hear what name the Italians will give it. The French and\
English, agreeable to the Dutch call it, the former, 'Art noire, and the latter the\
black art. An improper and unnatural name, unless they mean first, that the\
artist works the light out of the black ground; and in the next place, to distinguish\
it from etching and engraving.}
