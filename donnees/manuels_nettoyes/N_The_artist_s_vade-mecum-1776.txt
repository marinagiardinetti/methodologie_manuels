E Of
RA WIIG is the Art of reprefenting by Lines and Shades:
& the Figure of any thing feen in Nature, or whatever form:
we conceive in idea; it is the nobleft Operation of human inge—
truity, and may certainly be reckoned among the Qualifications
which are the Characteriftic of  Gentleman. The Study of it
ought to be encouraged in every Vouth, whatever Station of Life
he may be placed in; for besides its great Ufe to all Perfons con—
cerned in the way of Art, it muft be extremely agreeable to 
Gentleman to Sketch  fine Building, beautiful Prospect, Piece
of Art, or uncommon Appearance in Nature. Befides, Drawing;
erables us to fee things in  plainer and clearer Manner, and
remember their Form, Shape, and other Circumftances, much
better than can poffibly be dene without  Knowledge in this
Art. In all Ages it has been carefully cultivated by the moft-
 Nations; and the great Men who have excelled in it,
have been homoured by the Protection of thofe Kings and Prin—
oes who had  Tafte for the Liberal Arts. It fets before us the
moft magnificent Buildings; the moft delightful Gardens, the
Beauties of Art, or the Productions of Nature, in to ftrong and
juft  Light, that one might imagine one' felf on the Spot;;
and this in  Language underftood by all Mankind.
The Implements for Drawing, are fmooth-grained Charcoal,,
Black-Lead Pencils,red, black, and White Chalk,  Port-Crayon,
Hair Pencils, Crow-Quill Pens, Indian Ink,  Ruler, and  Pair of
Compaffes.——Charcoal is proper to Lketch with, as any Strokes
made with it may be brushed out with  Feather if wrong, and
the Black Lead Pencil gives the correct out-line; Red Chalk is
proper to draw large or Academy Figures with, and Black Chalk
the fame, especially on colour’ Paper, where the Lights put in
with
  the ART of DRAWING.
with White-Chalk, has  beautiful Effect.——It is beft to begin
drawing from fome of the leaft complex Examples as they are
placed in this Collection. Every thing should be drawn at firft
with Strokes juft vifible, and afterwards corrected by altering
what is amiss, made as like the Original as poffible. In this
Manner  Learner should draw the feveral Fearures, in different
Pofitions, well, before he attempts an Entire Head or Face: for
he cannot do the whole together, until he is Mafter of the Parts.
This done, draw Faces and Heads, from forme in Outlines only,
ketch the Out-line, and finith from the same (haded. Before  in this particular,  will here give the moft approved
Proportions of  Face and Head, and the better to underfland
it, shall defcribe one viewed in Front; in which Pofition it'
Outline makes nearly the Shape of an Egg divided by Lines, as
in the Examples. The upper Divifion for the Hair, then to
the Top, and next to the Bottom of the Wose, the lower one
to the Chin. This laft Part is fubdivided equally into three;
the uppermoft is the Diftance between the Nose and Mouth.
The Breadth is divided into five equal Parts, of which one is
the Eye, another the Diftance between the Eyes; from the
Outfide of the Eye to the Side of the Face is another Part, the
Mouth is  little more than one, the Nose  little lefs. The
Eye, in Front, is divided into three, one of which is the Pupil
or Sight; the Ear is the Length of the Nofe.
One of the greateft Beauties in drawing  Face, and which
is abfolutely neceffary to it, is to place the Features truly in their
Places; that is, the Middle of the Forebead, the Nofe, and the
Moutb, exactly under one another in  Line, and the Eyes on
 Line, properly croffing that on which the Forchead, Nofe, and
Mouth are placed: If you would fee how thefe Lines curve in
the feveral Attitudes the Head may be put into, there is  very
ingenious method in doing it, by getting  Piece of Box, or other
fmooth-grained Wood, turned in the Shape of an Egg, make 
Rraight Line on this Piece of Wood from the Middle of the Top
to the Middle of the Bottom; then make cross Strokes on it at
the


On the ART of DR  WIN .
 proper Diftances (as before directed in (peaking of the Pro-
portions of the Head,) for the Eyes, Nofe, Ec. and by fetting
this Piece of Wood in Variety of different Attitudes, you will fee
how the Lines curve on thofe Occafions, and according to thofe
Curves you muft place and turn the feveral Features. By this
means,  think, you will eafily underftand this Rule for placing
the Features properly, which is one of the moft difficult Points,
and, at the fame time, to abfolutely neceffary, that it is impoftible
to do any Head well without it: And next proceed to Blands,
Feer, Oc. and for due Proportions of which, fee the Examples:
After you draw thefe Parts well and with Eafe, try an entire
Figure, of which  shall here give you the moft approved Mea-
fures and Proportions.—The Antients commonly allowed
Eigbt Heads to their Figures, but we ordinarily divide the
Figures into Ten Faces from the Crown of the Head to the
Sole of the Foot, viz. from the Crown to the Forehead, one
Third of  face.
The Face begins at the Root of the loweft
Hairs upon the Forehead, and ends at the bottom of the Chin.———
The Face is divided into three proportionable Parts; the firft
contains the Forehead, the fecond the Nofe, and the third the
Mouth and the Chin; thence to the Pitbetween the Collar-bones,
two Lengths of  Nofe; to the Bottom of the Breafts, one
Face; to the Naval, one Face; to the Genitories, one Face;
to the upper Part of the Knee, two Faces; the Knee contains
half  Face; to the Ancle, two Faces; to the Sole of the Foot,
half  Face.  Man’ Arms ftretched out, is, from the longeft
Finger of his right Hand, to that of his left, as broad as he is
long; from one Side of the Breafts to the other, two Faces: The
Bone of the rm, called Humerus, is two Paces; from Shoulder
to the Elbow, thence to the Root of the Little-finger, the
Bone called Cubitus, with Part of the Hand, contains two Faces;
from the Box of the Shoulder-blade, to the Pit betwixt the Col-
lar-bones, one Face; the Sole of the Foot is the Sixth Part of
the Figure; the Hland is the Length of  Face; the Thumb 
Nofe, Ec. Thofe meafures are general, but liable to Exceptions,
varying

 from the Quality of Persons and Movement of the Miaf
cles. Be careful to make  juft Symmetry and harmonious Cor-
 in the whole Figure, not one Leg of rm big
Ct
or longer than the other, not the fhrivelled Face of old Age
with the plump Lips of Vouth, the Body of  Bacchus with the
Limbs of an Apollo; or the Shoulders of an Hercules with the
Waift of  Fribble. It is proper here to take Notice of hew
great Advantage to  Perfon who would draw  Human Figure
well, it is to underftand fomething of the Anaremy of it; 
mean to much of it as relates to the Bones and the Mufcles;
and, as appears externally: More than this would be to him
mere Matter of Curiofity; but thus much is worth the Pains
of every one to become Mafter of, who is ambitious of Know-
ing the Foundation of the Art; for it will be  Means of piv-
ing Grace, Strengib, and Bearuty to his Figures, and he wilk
be able to exprets the proper Parts of the Limbs, which prin-
cipally operate in every Action, not blindly, and by Chance,
but with Truth and Certainty; which is efteemed by every
one, who is beft able to judge, one of the greateft Beauties in
 Figure: There is  proper Work for this Purpofe, entitled,
 Compendious Trearife of Hnatomy, adapted to the Arts of
Painting and Defign; in which to much only as is neceffary
to the Painter, with  concife Explanation of it, is collected
together from the more minnute Parts, which are neceffary to
the Surgeon or Anatomifl.
In Drapery, cleath your Figure properly and elegantly, and
neither with fome Moderns, by mafty Folds, lofe Sight of your
original Intention, nor by fervilely copying the Ancients, imi-
tate wet Linnen; and it will be  great Help to proportion, if
whatever is intended for Cloarbing be sketched naked; of which
preferve as much as poftible, yet carefully avoiding the above
Extremes.
Next in Courfe, tho' firft in Art, is the Expreftion of the
feveral Passions of the Soul, which is the moft difficult and beau-
tiful Parts of this Art. . Le Brun, who has treated this
Subject

 with great fuccess, fays, that Passon is  Motion of
the Soul, which makes it follow what it thinks good, and 
from that which it thinks hurtful; and what caufes any paftion
in the Soul, produces particular Aetions in the Body; in the
Face it more particularly fhews what it feels, which for that
Reafon is called the Mirror of the Soul. The moft capital Sub-
jets extant of this Kind are . Le Bruns Expressions of the
Passions of the Soul, where the principal Paftions are beautifully
exprefted by that great Mafter, in Hleads almoft as large as the
Life, with an Abstract of his difcourfe on each of them: Thefe
Heads, befides their fefulness in this Particular, are likewife
Some of the beft Examples to draw after, either in red or black
Chalk, that are to be met with.

Sbadow might almoft be pared; fo shall only fay, in the

be effaced: On the contrary, if your Lights are too open,
you may advance on them with Shade at Pleafure. In Com-
position to ditpose your Objects, that both Light and Shade may
fall in Mass, and be careful that your Principal be placed to
Advantage when you copy Nature (the nobleft School for Art).
Obferve the Operation of Ligbt, which, confidered and observ-
ed from its Fountain, will alone instruct, being unerring in its
Progrefs, and rendering the Beings moft confpicuous neareft to
our View.
Thus far relates to the Human Figure and it' immediate Ap-
pendages, which are the moft difficult and important Subjects of
this Art. Thereare, however, other Part which merit the Re-
gard of the Learner.
The drawing Flowers, Fruits, Birds,
Beafts, and the like, might be the Subject of fome of your firft
Attempts, not only as it is  more pleafing Employment, but as
it is an eafier Talk than the Drawing of Faces, Hands, Feet, and
other Parts of the Human Body, which require not only more
Care, but greater Exactnels and more judgment. There are
but

but few particular Rules for your Instruction on this Head
you have  Variety of Examples in this Collection, which copp
with great Care and Exactness, and be fure to make  correct
Out-line before you begin to Shade. Drawing of Land/capes,
Buildings, Cc. for  Gentleman, is the moft entertaining and
wfeful in the whole Art: To be able on the Spot (as is before
obferved) to take the Sketch of  fine Building, or beautifiel.
Prospect of any curious Production of Art, or uncommen Ap
pearance in Nature, or whatever elfe may prefent itfelf to view
on our Journies or Travels, in our own or Foreign Countries,.
may be thus brought home and preferved for our future Ofe,
either in Bufiness or Converfation; and is the beft Method of
bringing to Mind again thofe Beauties that have once charmed
us. Trees or Houfes, though of the fame Size, will appear
otherwife, according to their Nearness or Diftance; thofe at 
Distance appearing less than thofe on the fore Ground, and thofe
that are farther off, yet less. This Propertion you muft be care-
ful to repretent accordingly, becaute it is that which principal
ly gives the Appearance of Diftance, and is one of the greateft
Beauties in  View or Landscape, as may be feen by the Ex-
amples annexed, and are beft inculcated by the Appearance of
Objects according to their Situation in Nature.
The foregoing Rules are neceffary to be Known, and will rear.
dily advance  Student; therefore he who intends the imitative
Arts for his Profeffion, should well attend to them.—But the
Gentleman who means no further from his Purfuit than an Ac-
complishment, may be lets folicitous in the Dicipline of Rule;
fince, though he become no great Preficient, . Taffe only will
enable him to judge properly of the Works of fuch eminent
Mafters who have, or may hereafter improve the GRAPHIC Arts.
