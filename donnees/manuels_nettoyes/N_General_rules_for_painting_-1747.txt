  .  In  II  cerious Art of Painting in Oil
and Water-Colours has ever been
 admired and approved, as
 Mafterpiece of other Arts and

Sciences, wherein Art fo exactly imi-

tates Nature, that Motion only feems
to be wanting; and many fuch rare Pieces have been
painted in both Ways, Oil and Water-Colours, that
they have at the firft Blush deceived the Eyes of the
Curious, who have taken them for real living Beings.
And tho' the Eye and Hafnd are mainly required
herein, the one to direct, and the other to operate
yet the Mind or Imaginatiopn muft furnifh cut  great
 of the Curiofity, having Ideas, or the true
Shape of Things, always in  Readinets. This cannot
be dene haftily; but muft be done by  fteady Prac
tice, and curious Obfervations; and, in this Under.
taking for Painting in Oil, is, to prepare yourfelf with
fuirable Materials. In the firft Place, you muft take
care to get good Pencils, of all Sizes preportionable
to your Work;  Pallet or Board to lay your Colcurs
on, whilft you are ufing them; an Eafle to place yeur
Cloth fain’ upon  Frame, on, or againft;  Mcll-
Rick or Stay made of Weod, not subject to hend,

about  Fard long: At one End tye  Ball of Cottofs
with Leather over it, fo that with your Left Hand,
holding it againf the Work, you may fupport your
Right Arm with it, whilft you are working.
The next thing to be confidered to the Cloth, and
the Outlihe drawn thereon, is the preparing your
Colours, which in Oil-Painting muft be with Linfeed-
Oil, unless for Linen, and then Walnut-Oil is  great
deal better; for it will not turn yellow, as the other
in time will, when mixed with curious Whites. You
muft grind your Colours on  Stone with  Muller,
ill they are as fine as Butter; or you may have them
in Bladders at the Colour-Shops, atid fome you mix
an your Pallet with your Pallet-Knife Never put on
your Pallet more than you think you shall ufe; for
they will Ikin over and (poil, which might be pre-
vented by putting them under Water. To clean your
Pencils, dip them in Oil of Turpentine, and fqueeze
them between your Fingers in  Tin Pan made for
that purpofe, where you generally lay them, and
your Colours that are in Bladders. The Colours
are in Number Seven, viz. Whire, Black, Red,
Green, Fellow, Blue, and Brown; the Whites,
White Lead, and Flake White; the Blacks, Sea-
Cole Black, Ivory Elack, Lamp-Black, and Eorth
of Collen; the Reds, Red Lead, Vermilion, Lake,
Indian Red, and Ornatto; the Greens, Terveret,

Verditer, and Verdegrife; the Yellows, apruce Oaker,

Pink or Fiment, and Mallicot; the Blucs, Shmait,  and Ultramarine; the Erowns, Umber, Spa-
ish Brown, Burnt Oker. Thefe are the Chief to
be laid in Oil; but lvory, Spruce Oker, and Umber,
muft be burnt before they are ground; and, as fir
Malticor, Vermilion, Ultrantarine, Stialt, Erpiment,
you may temper them on your Pallet without Grind
ing. Bur, for the mixing and tempering your Co-
lours; To make  Violet, take Iudico, Whice Lead,
and Lake; mix them well, and thhe more or lets of
each Quantity will make the Colour deeper or lighter.

To make  Scarlet, take Lake, Red Lead, and  fmall
Quantity of Vermilion: To make  Flame Colour,
take Red Lead and Mafticot heightened with White:
To make  Light Green, take Pink and Smalt; as you
fee Occafion, lighten it with White: To make  Pur-
ple, take Spanmh Brown, Indico, and White. To
make  Bay Colour, mix Spanish Brown and White:
To make  Murry Colour, mix Lake and White. And
fo, by often tempering Colours, and Practice, you
may find out  thouland Tints.
But, in the ufing them, be cautious of taking too
much Oil; for which Reafon, thofe who would have
their Pieces keep freth, make ufe of as little Oil  can, and keep their Colours the firmer, by mix
ing with them  little Oil of Spike, which foon eva
porates, but ferve to make them run the berter, and
renders them the more pliable in Working. Ano
ther Caufe of Colours lofing their Beauty is, when
the Painter works them too much in mixing them;
for, being jumbled together, they change and corrupt
one another, and take away the Vivacity. Therefore
you muft be careful to ufe them properly, and lay the
Colours each in its Place, without mingling them too
much with the Pencil or Bruth; alfo not to temper
adverfe Colours together, as Blacks with others, par-
ticularly Smoke-Blacks; but to ufe them apart as
much as poffible; and, when you would give the
more Force to your Work you should stay till it. is
dry, to touch it over again with Colours that will not
Kill the firft laid on. In the mean time they ought to
learn, and qualify themfelves with the Proportions
and Connection of the Part of Drawing, as well as the
Colouring, and how to fix the Sketches or Out-lines,
and often to view and examine exquifite Originals,
and all the Infenfibilities and Sweetneffes of the Art,
which you will artain by viewing the Works of the
Kilful Mafters, rather than by Practice alone: After
you have done some Part of your Piece, fet it by for
fome time without looking on it; then view it again;
by which means you may chance to difcover fome

 choofe thofe Subjects that are Noble and Beau-
 tiful, even in the atmoff Degree of Perfection,
that have fomething of Magnanimity and Greatness
in them, is the true Characteriffick of  Painter, and
whofe Sketches or Out-lines are noble, which will be
diftinguith’ pure, and without Alteration, clean, and
united together, compos’ of great Parts; yet thofe
but few in Number, and diftinguithd by bold Co-
fours, and fuch as are related, and are harmonious,
to each other. To fucceed well in your Attempts
this way, you should know how to draw very well:
The Colours us’ in Water are Carmine, Ultramarine;
Lakes of all Sorts,
Vermilion, Brewn Red, Mafticot
Fellow and Pale,
Indico, Ivory Black, Lamp-Black,
Spanise Brown, Umber, Gall-Stene Brown, French
Pink, Orpiment, Gamboge, Neples Vellow, Bladder-
GGreen, Verditer, Sea-Green, Flake-White: Thefe
Colours are tempered in Sea-Shells, or in (mall lvory
Cups made on purpofe, with Water, in which hath
been before diffolv’ Cum hrabick, and Sugar-
Candy: For Example, In  Gill of Water put the
Quantity of the Top of yeur  humb, of Gum-Ara-
bick, and half that Quanticy of Sugar-Candy; this
faft prevents the Colours from fealing when dry, which
they commonly do without it; and, when the Vellum,
Paper, ( are greaty, mix  little of the Gall of an
Ox, Carp, or Eel, especially of this laft; it will give
them  Lutre and Vivaciry not natural to them: If
yeu ufe Sea-shells, you muft firff foak them for twis

or three Days in Water; then clean them well in hor
Water, to clear them of  certain Salt which poils
the Colours When you have done this, pour Cum-
Water into the Shell, together with the Colour you
ufe, and temper them with your Finger till the Whole
be very fine: If you find your Colour too hard, leave
it to foften in the Shell before you mix it. Then,
when mix’, fet it to dry; and to do by all, except the
Iris-Green, and Sap-Green, and Gamboge, which
muft be tempered with Water only; but Ultramarine,
Lake, and Spanish Brown, muft be more gummed
than other Colours. To underfland when your Co-
lours are fufficiently gummed, you need only make
 Stroke with your tempered Colours upon your
Hand, which will immediately dry. If they break
and fcale, they are too much gumm’; and, if
they rub off by paffing your Finger acrots them, they
are not gumm’ enough. Take care alfo, that you
put not in too much; for it will have an hard and  Effect; your Colours will be glutinous and stick
ing. Good Pencils are of great Importance to the
Work To choofe which, wet them  little, and twirl
them on your Finger: If they keep their Point, they
are good; but, if they break into many Points of dif-
ferent Lengths, they are good for nothing: When
tey are too tharp-pointed, with only Four or Five
Hairs sticking out beyend the reft, you may blunt
them carefully with  Pair of Sciffers, or lighted
Candle: It will be proper to have Variety of Sizes.
Having (poken of Colours and Pencils,  shall next
shew how they are to be ufed. Firft of all, if you
would paint Flethor Drapery, or aught elfe, you muft
begin by Skerching or Drawing with large, bold, yet
clear Strokes: Endeavour alfo to drown your Colours
into each other, that no Line of Separation may be
feen between them; and foften your Strokes with the
Colour on each Hand of them, fo as to be equally
blended with, and confounded into each other. Some
Plices are touch’ all over alike; yet foas, when it is
finished, you may perceive the Vellum, Paper, Coc.

in feveral Places quite through the Work; which is
indeed too flight  way, and should rather be called
Wathing than Painting: The beft way is as follows:
Lay  full flat Ground all over, where your Fleth or
Drapery, Gc. are to be, of the Colour you defign it;
which, being done, you will find much eafier to be
wrought upon, and may be either heightened or
deepened at Pleafure: Take  special Care, that when
you temper or mix your Colours with pure Water,
and when you perceive they have loft their Gum by
often putting Water therein, you temper with Gum
Water, till you find they are in good Order again,
for either  Complexion or Garment; that you mix
them well with your Finger, and not let them be too
aterith; likewife preferve all your Colours from
Duft. In Landlkips it is impoftible to exprets the
Various Examples; they are innumerable, being as
many as there are Painters and Fancies, therefore
not to be comprifed within Rules. But, for the gene-
ral, obferve thefe which follow:
Always begin with the Sky, Sunbeams, or lighteff

Parts, firft; next, thofe Beams that are yellowith;
next, the Blueness of the Sky. Work your Sky
downwards towards the Horizon, fainter and fainter,
as it draws nearer and nearer the Earth, except in
the tempeftuous Skies. Work the Tops of Moun-
tains, far remote, to faint that they may appear loft
in the Air: Makelow Places, and fuch as are near
the round, of the Colour of the Earth, of  dark-
yellowith Brown, or Green; the next to them, of 
light Green; and fo fucceffively as they lofe in Di-
ftance, make them abate in Colour Do not make
any thing that appears at  Diftance perfect, by ex-
preffing any particular Signs or Tokens that it has;
but express it as weakly and faintly, as it appears to

the Eye. Always place Light againft Dark, and Dark
againt Light; by which means you may extend the
Prospect, as if very far off: Let all the Shadowslofe
their Force, as they remove from the Eye; always
making the Grongeff Shadows neareft to hand. You

need not be over-curious in the firft Working; but
rather ain at  good, free, and bold lmitation of
Nature, than an extreme neat, fet, or silf Way:
Be not difecuraged it the Roughness of your Colour;
for you may work that down, and touch it by de-
grees with the other Shadows, tho' you do not do it
at the Firft: After this, (weeten and heighten your
Shadows by degrees, according as the Light falls.
Then touch it in fome Places with Arong Touches,
and bring your Werk up together in thefe Places io

before the others; but viewing and working all the
Parts curioutly . ke, as if all the Picture was painted

Plants, Flowers, and Ground, are all to be finithd

may be of particular Efe when you work after Frints,
where you have nothing before you but Black and
White; but there is this Difference between Painting
in Water and in Oil, that in the laft the Colours are
taken off from the Pallet juft as they appear to you,
to that in this Cafe you have nothing to confult, but
tuch  Light and fuch  Chade. Now it is fer from
being the fame in Water-Colours, where often it hap-
pens, thit the laft Colcuring you lay on does not pre-
ferve iis Colour, but partakes of the Colour beneath,

White, Green, Carmine, Blue, Orpinent, Befter,

dab it over with your Finger, that the Turpentine
may feem rough. This done, take the foaked Print
and lay it on  clean Cloth even; then press it with
another, to take out the Warer; then lay it on the
Glats, the Print next it, beginning at one End,
Stroaking outwards the Part already fixed on the
Glass that neither Wind nor Water may be retained
between, to wrinkle it; then with  little Spunge, or
your Finger, wet the Back-fide, and lightly, by
Alegrees, roll off the Paper carefully in the Lights,
which are the tenderest; and, when the Print ap-
pears very tranfparent on the Back-fide, let it dry
about two Hours, then varnish it over with Tur-
pentine, or Matick Warnifls, till you can fee through
it; and  Night' drying will prepare it to be work’
oir with Colours.
If you would have all the Paper off, to that nothing
but the ink of the Print should remain, lay it as before,

Warnifh mix’ with Turpentine; and this, unlets you

Silver requires Seed Lac Varnifh, and the beft White

to prepare the Prints, if they will not bear the Colour,
do them over with fome thin Starch, which will take
off the Greafinets of the Printing, and make the

In Colouring you muft be sure to leave the Lights;
which has Two Advantages; viz. If the Lights be
left on this Occafion, the Whiteness of the Paper
ferves inflead of the fe of white Paint, which is 
very heavy Colour, and, if not finely prepar’, will
turn black, and would rather confound thote that have
been prescribed to be laid on, than do them any Ser-
vice; but the Colours, as will be directed, where
there is no White laid on, will thine agreeably into
the Whice of the Paper.
 am more particular in this, becaufe fome Perfons
will lay ablue Flower all over with one Colour, tho'
it be thick enough to hide both the Light and the
Shades of the Print; and then it will look like  Peny

Blues, and Greens; but this avoid, and be fure you
leave your Lights broad, and frumble the Lights
into the Shades of every Colour; but leave the middle
of the Lights open on the Papers; for as the Paper
is white of itfelf, it makes  beautiful Hleightening and
Roundness.
In painting the Leaves of Trees, Plants and Iferbs,
Regard muft be had to the Colour of the Greens, that

blue, Coc. fometimes ligater, and fomerimes darker,
then touch the Verges of the Lights with  little
Ultramarine Blue, and over the Shades, either fome
London Blue, to run  little into the Ultramarine, or

the Print being left void of Colours, will then give

Life and Spirit to the Colours fo difpos’. All

Lights, juft to give  little Glare into the light Parts of
the Colour of the Print; and on the Shadow-fide
you multlay on  ftronger Colour, that will force the
reft to appear forward; but do not daub over the
Shades with too heavy  Colour; let it be fuch as
may be tranfparent, it poffible, and foften into it the
light Colour that was laid on before; on this Occa-
fion, the Pencil muft be us’ but lightly, with  very
little Gum-water in it, and it muft be us’ before the
Colours are quite dry. In Greens, Verdegrife is the
lighteft; therefore that Colour should be touch’
into the lighteft Parts of all Greens, from the Place
where the lighteft Part of the Shade ends; and then

fate Twenty-four Hours, or till the Gums are well
diffolved, with often Shaking, to keep them from
clogging together; then, with Flannel Strainers, Straiff


it into  Lin Tunnel, placed in the Mouth of an-
other empty Bortle, till it rifes thick, and no longer;
then ftrain the thick Part, and fettle that again, and
keep the fine Varnifh for your Ule: This way is as
well without the Danger of attempting to boil it,
which endangers firing the Houfe, and the Perton'
Lifc.

Venice Turpentine, Animx, and Benjamin, and in
another Bottle the Green Maftich, and Sandarack, in
 Fint and  half of Spirits; pour very finely the
Anima and Benjamin the better to diffofve in the
Spirits, and then pour them off into  large Bottle.

Gums along with you, and to injure the Varnifh.

Ser, and is known from the Counterfeit, by being
fqueczed between your Finger and Thumb;
giving

made in Germony; and is of  fine bright Cclour,

dark, duil, though Silverith Colour, having  Re-
femblance of drotly Gold.
 Coppers are Three Sorts, Natural, Adulterace, and
Artificial. As for the Natural, being cleanted, it may

lay other Metals on; as in etching or heightening
GGeld orsilveron; but the Artificial is of  higher

Proportion of Warer, and the Bufiness is done.

Two Drams: Grind and mingle them; infufe them
in Urine Oue Pound, with Two Scruples of Gum-
Arabick, or  Dram at moft.
To takke ink out of printed Books, Pictures, and
Drawings: Wet  little iqua Fortis upon it, and it
will be speedily out; then wath it over with  little
Alum-Water or Vinegar and it will kill the Rynd
 which othervic will either eat the Paper, or
make it yellow Spirits of Virriol will do the fame.
And as this Eflay carries with it all along, as linked
in  Chain, Pleafure and Profit, it cannot but be
grareful to the Fancies, especially of the ycunger
Sort, who putting in Practice what beft fuits their
Minds, may much pleafe others, and accomplifh
themfelves. And fo, the whole Work not compre-
hending many Sieets,  ffrill omit what more  juftly
might tay; and, fubmitting to the Centure of the
candid and ingenious Reader, take Leave to fubfcribe
