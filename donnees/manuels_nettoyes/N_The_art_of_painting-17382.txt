 Light comes from the right side,  little fronting, and the\
Weather is rainy. The Air is Winterlike, yet calm. The Trees are\
but thinly leaved, except some which can endure the Winter, as Cy.\
prets, Laurel, Elm, Briar, Cc. which mult give the moft Green\
here. The End of the Fore-ground, on the right side, to the Foor\
of the Goddefs, is in Shade, by  Buth and some fmall Trees. Vinus,\
Capids upper Paits, the dead Body, with the Ground, and the Tree\
againtl which it lies, are flrongly lighted. The Stone forwards, under\
Adnis, is mottly thaded with the Fore-ground, by fome Cypreffes on\
the right Side, quite forward in the Corner. Some Pieces of the\
Term which reprefents  Fuaus or Satyr) lying fomewhat further,\
receive  little Light. The Boar, whofe Hind-parts are hidden be\
tween the left side of the Stone and the Tree flanding by it, partakes\
allo of that Shade to almoff his Neck. The happy coul flying with\
the winged Meffenger,\
intt by the Tree or Chariot, is, with him,\
from the Feet to the Mildle, thaded by the Leaves and Branches of\
the Trees; and are farabore the Horizon, to that the Green of the\
Trees almoll touches their Heads. The Sign Cup,icorn, in Token of\
the firft Winter-month, appears in the Air, very faint and lighter\
than the Air; Tis juft over the Charior, where the Sky is darkett.\
As for the Colours,  order them thus. Tenus is in an airy Dress of\
pale Rofe colour, with  blue Veil over it. Adonis, with his right\
Shoulder and Breaft bare, has  light Fillemor Vellment, with Vio\
let Reflexions; his Cheeks are paie, and Lips livid, and to are his\
Hands and Feet, yet he has  beautiful Skin. Jenus is very clear and\
tender-skind; her Face and Hands warm. Cupid is of  middling\
Complexion, not to clear as the Goddefs, and fomewhat more roly\
than Adonis. Tenus has light Hair; Adonis, light Chelnut, and Cupid,\
brown Hair.\

that, by this Triplicity, are lignitied the three particular Delights or\

   . KIII. The Fable of Dryope, for the Embellispment of\
Landskips.\
 VIN  in the preceding Chap. delivered what  had to fay\
touching  fine Fable, and the myfterious Senfe of some Circum-\
stances,  find myfelf obliged, by the Satisfaction which feve-\
ral of the beft Arcifts have found therein, to gratify their Defires,\
and to give an Handle for Exercife, in skerching fuch another.\
 have cholen for this Purpofe, the Fable of Dryope, and will  it as much as poffible to the Ornament of Landskips, making it\
 Without-door Prospect.\
The Story, according to Ovil, is this. Dryope, infentible of the\
forrowful Difafter that was to befal her, on  certain Time took \
Walk by  Lake encompaffed with Myresss, with intent to make the\
 \

 of the Place, Prefents of Garlands of Flowers. She took\
with her, her little Son Amphifus, not  Vear old, accompanied by her\
Bifter fole, with  Basker of Flowers and wreathed Garlands. Near\
the Lake food  Tree, called Lotos, bearing red Bloffoms; of which\
the rathly broke  Twig to pleafure her Child; but perceiving Blood\
to iffue from it, and that the whole Tree was thereby violently agi-\
cated, the was much affrighted; and the more, when, in going thence,\
the fell her Feet to fatten into the Earth; for the was transformed into\
 Tree.\
 exhibir the Subject (See Plare  IV.) in  delightful Valley, (ac.\
cording to the Tellimony of the Poet) planted with Myrtles, and en-\
compatted by  Brook. In the middle of the Piece,  place, as the\
Principal, the Tree Lofos, full of red Bloffoms and thickly leaved.\
From this Tree Dryope broke off the Sprig.  make it to thake and\
more to violendy, that the Trunk of it is by that means become dif\
corted and winding. On the left Side,  place the rath Dryope, of \
beautiful Air, and bla--hair\'92, having her Son Amphifes about the\
Middle, in her left Arm. She advances with her left Foot towards the\
Tree,  lide drawing back the right. Her upper Parts fall back Hill\
more. In her right Hand, lifeed up, the holds the bloody Sprig; at\
which the flares in Confaiion. Her left Thigh comes forward. Her\
upper Parts (way to the lefe; her Breatl is almoll fronting directly -\
gainil the Light; her Face in Protile more or lels turns back; and her\
Feer are by this time fixed in the Ground. We fee the Childs hind\
er Parts; and us Head is fer off againtt her Breaff. Her siffer on the\
right Side of the Tree, flanding over againtt her,  reprefent with\
light Hair, and in the wimoll Concern, wringing her ciafped Hands  her left Check. Her Head, turned to the right, hangs over\
her right Shoulder; her Breaff heaves; and her under Parts draw\
quite back. Her Knees are bent, her right Foot finng out, and the\
left drawn back, as if the were fainting away. She is about  of\
 Years of Age. The Nymph, who lupports Drgege, is placed be\
tween her and the Tree, holding her Back with her left Hand, and\
with her right, uncovering the Leg, and thewing to the Sifter, at whom\
the looks, that the Foor has already taken Root. Another Nymph,\
who is taking the Child, has her left Side fronting, yer her Back\
parts are mostly vifible; the is on her Knees, the left forward, the \
ther quite drawn back, puthing with her Foot againtt  Water-veffel,\
which, at the Brink of the Water, the overturns.  third, on the\
right Side, comes running, quite aftonithed, with  Lap fall of Flow-\

 the points, with her left Hland, towards the others, and looks to\
the leff at her Companions ficting on the Bank of the River, which\
partly runs between the Trees towards the Point of Sight. The one\
arifes, and looks forward with Amazement, and makes it known to\
the other fitting towards the Water; who therefore, fupporting herfelf\
on her left Hand, turns her upper Parts to the right, in order to look\
back. They have mottly Chaplers either on their Heads or lying by\
them.\
Thus much, as to the Difpoficion and Actions of the moveable By-\
ornaments; which confifting of Virgins, each is contralted according ro\
ber Paffien. We now proceed to the immoveable Ornaments.\
On the left Side, on  rifing Ground, between the Trees,  place\
 large fronting Priapus-Term, without Arms or Legs, mottly in the\
shade againtt the Offskip, which frongly throws off the foremoff\
Croup. On the right side forwards, half in the Water,  fet  square\
large rough Stone, whereon lies  Garment or Veil, and  Parcel of\
Leares and Flowers. In the Pannel of this Scone is carved  Fatality\
in Balsrelief. Behind it, and between the Nymph with the Flowers,\
 place on the Ground  Basket of Chaplets.\
As for the Season, Tis laid between Summer and Winter, in the ripe-\
ning Aucumn, and in fine Weather for the Time of Vear. The Ligbt\
is  side one  lictle fronting. The Sun may be put in, or left out, as\
every one pleafes; becaute tis not meationed or infifted on in the\
Fable.\
 shall next proceed to delcribe the further Circumflances of this Or-\
donnance; fince, without thewing the Light and Darkness, Harmony\
and Colours, Tis imperfelt, and not like Narure. It matt be granted,\
that the Harmony and Sbalowing, ofcenrimes thew themfelves, and that\
the Light is fufficieatly apparent to him who undertands Perspective\
Bur whether there may not occur fill someching beyond the common\
Guess and Judgment,  very much question. As for the Colours, they\
mall needs be exprefted; fince, without it, tis impoffible to know or\
penetrate mine or any other Painter' Thougt ts.\
 therefore affign Dryege, as the principal Charalter,  blue Sattin\
Garment; one Flappet whereof goes over her right Shoulder, and comes\
under her Cirdle, and the other is in her left Hand; with which the\
holds the naked Child about the Middle, when the Remainder, with\
an under Flap tucked in the Girdle under her left Bresfl, covers all\
her other Parts down to the Feet, except the leff Leg and Foor, whichh\
is rooted in the Ground. Her under Garment, as likewife the open\
Rr  VI\
Of Landskips.\
 abor her lef Arm, is yellowith White, with green Reffexions.\
Her Garment next the left Leg is open. The foremofl Nymph is al.\
mort mked, having no other Covering than  fine white fmall Scarf\
about her Middle. The Drefies of Dryope and Lole are intermixed\
with Gold, in order to make  Difference between them and the\
Nymphs. The Nymph, who is naked to the Middle,  dress in  dark\
green Gown, gathered at the Navel, and faftened by  Girdle. Jol\
has an arry Garment, clote-fleeved, of  bright Rofe-colour, girt with\
 broad Girdle of dark Violet embroidered with Gold; and under it\
 flowered Coat, open below, and giving Freedom to the Legs. The\
Sione forward is greyith; and the Vetiel dark Red. The Ground next\
 Water is gratty; and thus,  variegate the whole Fore-ground.\
The Nymph, who, on the right Side of the fecond Ground comes\
running, has  greenith Brealtgarment, loofe and untied, without\
Sleeves, and faftened but on one Shoulder, the sedd Brealtand Legs be\
ing bare. The other, firting further behind, on the Edge of the\
Rver,  leave quire naked. Her Companion has  small green Scarl\
The fone Priagus is dark Grey, inclinable to Violet.\
As for the Liget,  think, that the major Part ought principally to\
fall on Dryoge and the two Nymphs next ber, and on what elfe belongs\
to that Group. The Refidue may be litle, and moftly foreign liybted,\
either from behind, before or fidewife; yet in fuch Sort, as that the\
Caule thereof, and of the Shades (as, by what and from whence) may\
plainly appear: Otherwife, they will be but loofe Fancies, without\
Foundation\

Some may\
my Purpofe; becaute  alliga Dryoge  blue Garment over  yellowith\
whice one, judging, not without feeming Reafon, yet without knowing\
my Incention, that the contrary would look more decorous; namely,\
the Light over the Dark; becaute the greateft and ftrongeft Mass of\
Light, falling on her middle Parts, to wit, Belly and Legs, the naked\
Child would be more beautifully fet off, if her Breaft or upper Parts\
were dark, than againtt the yellowith-whice. This with Respect to\
the Light,  willingly allow; but not, as to the Colour; for  deligned\
ly made the Garmentblac, in order to make the naked Nymph bear\
riful. and yet, with intention that that Part might keep  ftrong and\
broad Light: For this Reafon,  have cholen  Stuff for it according.\
ly; it being known that Satuin has  Glols, and almoft the same Force\
as Gold or Silver Stutts. The red Garment of Lole, as being  beaw\
Set off\

Chap.  the dark Ground: Bot the Blue has here, on account of the\
great Mass, more Power, tho' having more Light about ir; for the\
Red is but  fmall Spot.  have, as much as poffible, confidered the\
Probabiliry of this Reprefentation, and the Harmony in the Dilpofiti-\
onof the Colours; affigning each Figure its particular and proper em-\
blematic Coloar, not only in the Draperies but alfo in the Nudities,\
giving one  fair and tender, another,  more brownith Skin, and to\
forth. Each Figure has likewife its particular Charalteriffic; the\
Head of the Water-nymph is adorned with white Bell-fowers; that of\
the Woodnympb, with wild Plants; and that of her who comes running\
forward, with Field-fowers. If it be wondered, that  make Mention\
of Sattin; fince we rarely hear, it was in Ufe among the Anciets; \
fay, the Obtervation is jull, with respect to Staruarres, but not, as to\
Painters; becaute  have met with feveral old Pictures, whereinI have\
seen Sattin reprefented: Bur how long that Stuff has been known to the\
World,  cannot tell, nor shall enquire. In the meantime, it mult be\
allowed to be  beautiful and elegant Sruff; as are alfo the changeable\
Silks, tho' in alels Degree, and more proper for youg People.\
If any Difficulty arile from my incroducing into this Story  Priapus-\
Term, fince theres neither God, Man, Faunus, or Satyr in the whole\
Piece, nor the lealt Sign of any, indecent Action,  will give him my\
Reafon; which is, that the Poct, relating the firft Caule of the Difafter\
befalling this unhappy Woman, afcribes it to the Tree Lores; becaute\
when  Woman, and Priapus could not farisfy his Lult with her, he\
in Revenge, transformed her into that Tree bearing her Name, laying:\
 Curfe on thofe who violated it; and fill recains that vindictive In-\
mour; wherefore  place him here, as the firft Promoter of the Ac\

tries) nor mentions, what Sort of Leating it has, or its Virtues, or\
whether it be of  moiff or dry Nacure, or where it grows moll plen-\
tifully; wherefore, as far as  have mer with them,  shall produce\
the Teltimonies of fome Authors about this Tree, together with the\
emblematic Senfe and Explanations they affign:  very proper Part of\

Fring Sun, opin, and as he goes down, close, and at Night, double;\
wherefore, when we incroduce no Sunpine, they mult be reprefented\
deubied or suunt.\
As for the myterious Seaje, we mult know, that the Egyptians paid\
more Honours to this Tree, than any others, on  Belief, that it was \
AEharor between heavenly and earchly Things. Iis moreover ufed,\
to repreient the Suns Rifing and Seiring; especially with the Addition\
of  CoiI peringon it, by which, they lignitied, the Morning vapours,\
which the Sun' Approach difpels. And, becaufe it opens and thuts its\
Leaves with the Suns Riling and Setring, tis fucred to Apollo, as  Tree\
peculiar to him, and out of Respect prving its Leaves to him only.\
The reugh or heiry Loros was allo much venerated by the Romans;\
who offered the  Locks of Hair to it, & as they did, thole of joung\
Mlen to Ipolle, or to his Son Esculapius.\
The Greeks facrificed their Hair, in the same manner, to the Rivers\
of their Country, as having  certain Relation to this Tree; which they\
imagined had fuch Intercourse with the Gods, that they made it their\
Sest: And therefore it was plunted in Moruffes.\
Lumblickus reftifies, that thefe Treesrequire much Moisture; wheace,\
the Ancients inferred, the firz Cause of Procreation: Therefore calling\
the Occean, the Father of all Creatures: nd, obferving the round\
Leaves, round Stem and round Fruit, they would, by this moft perfed\
Fisure, intimate, the Perfection of the higheff Deity,; especially, when\
 Childwas reprefented firing on the Tree. Which Ovid likewife al\
Iudes to in this Fable, when (as Mir. Pope has rendered it) he fays,\

Wte hhall now proceed to,\

The Story is this. As foon as Andramen was advertifed of the for\

covered with Greens. Both the Father and Son hung about her Neck,\
and wept; and, with the Child, at her Requelt, kifled her for the latt\
Time, Whereupon the was divefted of her human Shape at once.\

in this, lideways. Dryope, all but her Head, transformed into  Myr-\

 little to the left of the Point of Sight. Andramon takes her abour\
the Neck, and Kiffes her left Cheek. His aged and forrowful Father\
complains of the forrowful Milhap to  Nymph Handing near him,\
with his right fland tearing open Dryope' Linnen, in order to thew\
her the Body; which beholding, the raifes her Shoulders, turning her\
Head away, and looking down. Another Nymph, having the lirtle\
Amphises in her Arms, lifts him up, in order to kifs his Mother. fo.\

On the second Ground, on the right Side,  fer\
the Term of Priapus, crols hung with Feffoons of Flowers and Greens\
bied under the Navel; and before it  Gnall fmoaking Altar, with\
tome People offering. On the left Side, on the Fore-ground,  place\
the large (quare Stone, half under Warer; with  Nymph leaning on\
it. Thele are the Heads of my Defign. The View is on the left\
side of the Point of Sight, and confitts of Hills and Waters; and,\
becaule  reprefent an Evening, the Air is full of Vapours and dark\
Clouds; and the Trees, by reafon of the Wind, are in Agitation\
Now, as this Piece is the Feltow of the former, all Things thould,\
of right, be equally full of Work; but becaute this Ordonnance has\
the greater Variety, as exhibicing jome Aen,  have been neceffitared\
to depart  little from the original Diupolition, fince what is introdu-\

open Hand up at her Head; her Breaff is bare, and in the Light.\
Her under Parts are fronting, and her right Leg fiung our. Andra-\

The Numph, who, on the right side, where the Ground is fome.\
whit lower, is litring up the Child, falls back in her upper Parts,\
with her Head hanging forwards; the refts on her right Leg, having\
the leff lified up against the Tree; her Back is fronting, and turns to\
the Light, and her under Parts have  contrary Sway. The Child,\
whofe upper Parts only are feen (the reft being hidden by her Head)\
firetches our both his rms forwards, towards the Tree,\
preffing one\
of his Feet againt her Body. Jok, fitting (quar between her and the\
Tree, leans her left Shoulder againtt it, with her Head coming for\
wad, and her Hand on her Face, having  Cloth in her Lap. On the\
left Side, without the Piece, at the End of the Fore-ground,  place\
two Nimphs; one, with her Legs in the Water, and refting on her\
right Elbow, and holding her Chin, and with the other Hland under\
her right Arm pit; the other ficting with her Legs behind the former\

dremon to the Shoulder, is in the Shade of the Greens of her Head\
and Arms. Andramon, as  Man of Repute, has  thort greenith\
grey colour\'92 Cost, embroidered with Gold; his upper Garment is\
reddith Purple, dark and warm; and his Legs, up to the Hips, are in\
the Shade of the Tree. The old Aian is drell after the Persian Man\
ner, in  Gown reaching to the Calves of his Legs, of  light Fille-\
mot Colour, with large Violer Stripes and Gold Leaves; his upper\
Garment, fleeved and quite open, is beautiful Violet; he has shoes\
and wide Stockings; his Cap, like  Turbant, curling on Top, lies\
with his Staff at his Feet; and his Hair is grey. The Nymph by his\
Side, is half shaded by him; that is, her whole right Side, from the\
Shoulder downwards, except her Knee, which the advances; her Vefl-\
ment is greenith Blue, inclining fomewhar to dark. The Nymph\
with the Child has an airy blue Garment, girt about the Middle; her\
right Shoulder is bare, and the Flappet of her Garment ruffied about\
her Legs by means of the Wind. The Virgin behind her, and be-\
tween the Tree Lores, has  white Garment. The Priaphs-Term, be-\
tween the Trees is by them, moftly shaded; and off from it, paffing by\
the Point of Sight, the major Part is filled up with small Trees, which\
are dark or in Shade, and brightly fetting off the foremoff Group.\
The two naked Nymphs, on the left Side, receive little Light. The\
Air on the Horizon is full of Vapours and melting; becaute  do not\
give here the Sun to bright and clear as in  fine Morning, nor to\
Rrong as at Midday, but more or lets vapourith, and therefore the\
whole appears of  Ruffet Colour. The Cloudsare large, thick, and\
heavy.\
The Sky might allo be properly enriched, by exhibiting in it, the\
three Purce or Fatat Siffers; fince, having done their Buliness, they\
are again afcending. In fuch Cale, Atrepos, with the Thread and\

The Boat, tied to  Poft, lies fomewhar fidewife and fore-thortened.\
The Waterman' right Side is fronting, inclining to the Land, with\
his Back directly in the Light; he receives with excended Arms, the\
Garment and Basket of Flowers which lole gives him. His Vellment\
is light Grey, gire with  large black Girdle, which is buckled; his\
right Shoulder is bare almoft to the Middle. Joh appears with her left\
Side fore right, and her Breatt fwaying towards him; giving him the\
Basket of Flowers with her right Hand, on the Arm whereof hangs\
her Sifter' Garment; her under Parts are fronting, and her Feet clole,\
with Knees  little bent; the turns her Head to the left, wiping her\
Eyes with  Flappet of the Vail which the has about her Neck. An.\

is fepping cowards the Boat; his upper Pares turn to the left, his Breat\
fronting, and his right rm put out fideways, in order to thew the\
Waterman, as has been faid, the Place he would be carried to; the\
purple Garment is faltened on his right Shoulder, and from under his\
Arm llinging about his Body, he thereby partly covers the Child; and\
with another Flappet of the fame, which he has in his left Hand, he\
supports and holds the Child, on his riting Hip againtt his left Brealt.\
The Child holds him fall about the Neck, with is left Hland in the\
Opening of his under Garment, leaning back with its upper Parts from\

it fares to the right side; one of its Feet is feen hanging down between\
the Foldsof the Garment, and touches the Hill of its Father' Sword\
The old Man, who follows him, has his Back turned towards the Point\
of Sight, and leems to fall back, with Concern; his Face is towards\
Heaven his right Leg is put forward, and his left, whereon he flands,\
drawn fomewhat back; his right Arm is crofting his Body; and in\
that Hand he holds his Statl, against his left Breaft; and thrufting our\

In this Reprefentation  have had an Eye to three principal Circum-\

Relief where tis to be had; if not in Town, eliewhere; wherefore,  re-\
preient Necefier in both Futher and Duughter coming for Relief to\
the tublannal Man\'92 Country-feat, who lives in Plenty. The further\
Circumltances, as, the Bidge, Town, and Horns of Plenty explain\
themielves\
 do not place lean Hunger near Frifsckton, contrary to what  have\
formerly fad, namelr, Thar, aton  Passion can be expressed in the Per-\

Kilnger is placed here for two Reafons: Firft, becaute Want cannot be\
Perfectly expretied here in irs fuil Force, through  present Intermin-\
thie with something elfe; as, the Happinets of having found the Means\
whereby to relieve it; to wit, toe Aloney. Secondly, becaute Frisick.\
ron is not fonaked, that his confumed Body, according to the Poet, can\
be thewed as Occafion requires.\
The Reafon of my putting in the Dog, is, not only for the Enrich.\
ment of the Dilpolition, but alfo to thew, that he who poffeffes much\
Wealth, should likewife warch it Mforeover, tis ufual for the Coun\
try People, but chiefir Men of Subltance, to keep thofe Creatures as\
well for Pleature as Ule.\
This Fable is feldom seen in Painting, or exhibited in  Print other\
wife than in Ovids Metamorphofis, and that in to limple  Manner,\
that withour the Explanation under ir, tis fcarce incelligible; for, what\
can be inferred from an old meagre Mans receiving  Purfe of Money\
from  Gentleman; with  young Woman appearing between them:\
How can the Inequalifr berween Riches and Poverty be confpicuous,\
when they are as like in Dress as if they were Brothers and Sifter; and\
this, in  Landskip, or the Middle of  Field, where is neither Houle,\
nor other Token of their Habiration?\
The Conclnion of  Story is not all char' neceffary to be read; we\
ought to know the Origin, the Fall and Sequel of it. Firtt, it' re\
cellary to know the Man and who Erifichion and his Daughter were, to\
exprets this naturally in their Persons and Dreffes. Secondly, we should\
Know by whom they are paryned, and in what Manner; and lattly, br\
erom, and by xFar Afcans made cafi. After  full inquiry into thele\
Particulars, Tis then Time to contider, how to reprefent them with at\

Sweet Repose difturbed by Lewdness. An Emblem.\
Here are feen three young Nymphs of Diungs Train, tired with\
Hunting, repoling in the Shade of the Trees,  hitle off from the\
Road, and near  foamy Water: Which some Fauni and Satyrs eipy-\
ing, they were refolved to have fome Sport with them. Wherefore\
acquainting their Affociates with the Marter, they filently advanced\
cowards the Place in  Body; bringing with them one of the largeft\
Priapus-Terms they had, together with two Panthers,  Veffel of\
Wine and Some Grapes. Being arrived, and feeing the Nymphs al-\
molt naked, and faft alleep, they planted before the Place the afore-\
said hideous Scarecrow; and then fofily fole their Hunring-equipage,\
 Quivers, Arrows, Bows, Cc. and hung them on its Genitals, fail-\
eaing them with the Straps, which they buckled. They moreover\
deck\'92 its Head with one of the Nymphs Vails; flicking their Thyr-\
fes in the Ground round about it, and adorning them with Vizors.\
Not Ropping here, they feized as many of the Virgins Garments as\
they could, and toffed them upon the high Limbs of an adjoining.\
Tree; and to prevent the Nymphs climbing up, in order to regain.\
them, they tied the two Panthers under the Tree; and, after having\
let down the Wine and Grapes, pleated with the Project, they coveri-\
Iy retired to  peeping Place, to wait the Iffue on the Nymphs awak\
ing. Each of the Gang had brought with him his Intirument, as,\
the double Haurboy, Cymbal, Tabor, Timbrel, Cc. wherewith, be\
caule Twas Evening, and they might lleep too long, to beat up their\
Quarters. But the Plot foon mifcarried, through an unexpected Ac-\
cident; for, another Nymph, who was poltibly feeking for her Com-\
pany, happened to arrive at the Place; and leeing the Panthers lying\
under the free, and thinking they were wild, thor at them and killed\
one. The Satyrs, feeing this, came out of their Lurking-hole, and\
purfued her; but the elcaped by Flight. They then concluded, they\
had waited long enough; and, oblerving that it grew lare, and that\

But, being now thoroughly awaked, the Tirm prefented before them,\

(but especially when other Scoffers thewed them the Cloaths on the\
Tree) highly provoked them. To take to Flight was not advifeable;\
one piuhed them this Way, ancther, that Way. During this Game,\
 Noile of Cornets was heard; which fuddenly put an End to the\
Laughter; each made off leaving all Things as they food. The\
Term of Pringus fell to the Ground, and the Panther at the Tree en\

Nymphe appeared much athamed, and profirated themfelves at the\
Feet of the Goddets; to whom they related their Misfortunes, and\

would not enlighten the Night till the had revenged the Infolence.\
Some accordingly made towards the Woods, others to the Brooks, and\
the Refidue took the Field; in  little Time, part of them were made\
Captives; for of the three who purfued the Nymph for thooting the\
Panther, one was catched in the Net, and five others, together with \
Baccbanal, were foon after haled before Diana, in lrons; whom the\
tentenced to be tied, two and two together, by the Feetard whipped by\
the three affronted Nymphs with Thorns and Holmleaves to teverely,\
as almoft to kill them. Three others the adjudged to be hung by their\
Tails on the Limbs of Trees, with their Heeds juff touching the\
Ground. Not yet appeafed, te cauled him, who was taken in the Ner,\
to be therein planged into the Water, by two or three Nymphs, till he\
was julf expiring, and the Water came out of his Mouth. The Bac-\
chanal mull he all this; on whom was beflowed an hunting Knife,\
wherewith, if the thought fir to releafe the Delinquents, to cut off their\
Tails: Which after mach Reluctance, the was at laft prevailed upon to\
do; and then, tying their Hands behind them, Diana faid  and shere yourfelves to the reft of year wanton Gang, and tell\
them, that thus feill puniss all those who dare to mock the chaft Diana\
and her Retinue.\
Is not this now, tho'  feigned Story, Matter fufficient to furnith\
many Landskips  The Landekip-painter ought to obferve here  Re-\
pretentation of different Pasions; Bashfalness in the Nymphs; rean-\
ton Joy in the Satyrs; Severity and Refentment in the GGoddets and\
Diftress in the Iafolents.\
You fee here the alluring Pleafure of committing  Crime, and the\
Bithfulness and Difliets of thote who fuffer the Evil; but at the same\
Time, the grievous Confequences, and Punithment attending Wicked\
nets and Infolence. In fine, the Sweets and Punifhment of Evil, ard\
the Reward and unexpected Relief of Virtue.\

Painting; which has fuch  Power as to affect People two different\

 bound about the Head with  nafty Clout, having  Skin\
as yellow, as  baked Pudding, Killing Vermine; or in fine, any fuch\
paltry Figure? Would you not rather conclude fuch Things to be the\
foll of  Painter.\
For my Part,  believe, that the Difference between the Fine and the\
bigly istoo great not to make  Diffindion between them.  am well plea-\
ied, that some call the Works of Bambeccio, Browwer, and Moller,\
and the Landskips of Bruegbel, Bril, Bloemart Saury, Berchem and\
such Mafters, Painter-like But  oppofe to them Raphael, Correggie,\
Poufin, te Bran, . and in Landskip, Albani, Genenille, Poufin,\
the German Polydore, and such as follow them in their Choices.\
On this Occation,  shall, ere  conclude, alfo confider the Word\
Defigser-like;  Word which is as much perverted as the other: For\
Iaffance crooked Trees abounding with Knots and Hollownelfes,\
rugged Clods of Earth, burften and sharp Rocks, human Bodies ro-\
buttly and roughly mufcled in Michael Angelo' Manner, Faceslarge.\
featured, long-nofed, wide-mouthed, hollow-eyed like Testa'; thefe\
Objects we have extolled for Designer-like, tho' as abfurdly and im-\
Properly, as tis to fetch Light out of Darknets, and Virtue from\
Vice.\
The Mafters therefore are very imprudent, who encourage their Dif\
ciples to feek and draw in fo troublefome  Way, after fuch Objects,\
as tending to nothing elfe than learning them to make rough Out-lines.\
Do they not chuse  round about-way to bring them into the right\
Path? Nay, how many die in the Purfuit, who, had they taken the\
other Way, might eafily have got through? Wherefore, tis more ad-\
vitsble to draw alter the beautifal and fedate Simplicity and Great-\
ness of Raphael, Touffin and other excellent Mafters, than after any\
of thofe other palery and mif thapen Objects. This muff be agreed\
that if the bad and deformed be Painter or Defigner-tike, the beauti-\
fat is not so: The Cafe admits of no lteration; and confequently\
the worft muft be beft, and the beft worll. If both be good, there\
is no room for Choice; and you may, at that rate, mingle Beauty with\
Deformity, Joy with Sorrow, Ripeness with Unripeness, Gods with\
Beggars But fince Beauty is attralting, and Deformity offentive, this\
certainly is true Painter-like, which fuppoles the best and moft agreea-\
ble Objects; which alone ought to be called fo, and fought for.\
fet there are Occafions, wherein both muft be obferved; either that\
the Story requires it, or that, by Means of Deformity, we are to fet\
off what is beautiful, and make it predominate: But then the Paint-\

to fix on Things of moft Importance.\
In my Walk,  cane into an agreeable Country, feemingly the Seat\
of blessed Souts where nothing was wanting which could tend to the\
Repoie of the Mind; every Thing was beautiful and orderty: Blind\
Chance had no Hand in this;  could plainly perce.ve, with what Ar-\
dour and Pleaiure Natere and Art had mutually bellowed their Benefits\
upon it: The Roads or Palfages were to neat and level, that in walking\
you hardly feemed to rougch the Ground:  sweet and refrething lyind\
reigned there; which fo aliryed the Sun' Heat as to make it indifferent\
whether you lat in it, or in the Shade: The rich-leaved Trees, as beau-\
tifal in their Siems as their Greens, moved almoff infentibly; when\
the young and tender Sprouts, as yet bat thinly leaved, carelled by\
the mild and gentle Air, feemed to rejoice, the filver Leaves, by \
fweet Motion, glittering like Medals. The Sky was fine blue,\
loofing gradually in thin Air towards the Horizon: The fmall Clouds,\
not violently driving this Way and thar, moved flowly and quictly till\
they got out of Sight. The white Swans beheld themfelves in the\
clear Brooks; freely winding and turning without feeling whether\
with or againff the Stream.\
In this delightful Region,  found  very beautiful Fountain, the\
Bafon of which, was of whire Marble; furnished towards the Road\
with rocky Bowls and Scollops to receive the Water; the Figures,\
flanding upon it, were moft elegantly chosen; round it, food low and\

food forwards two large Vafes of ffeth-coloured Marble, in Shape\

and without Covers; but, infiead of an Ipbigenis, the faint carving\

Sweep, the Figures were orderly difposed, and in all Parts alike and\

Trees; along the Brink of this River were planted only grey and\
whitith Willows, not all alike Rreight and large, but some leaning over\
the Water, others clole-branched and leaved, others again, thin and\
young, difcovering the Glitter of the Water: On the right Side,\
where the Rond run high, tood, as  lay, large and heavy Trees of\
Various Kinds, fuch as Oak, Affi, Lime, wild Olive, Pine, Cypress,\
Gr. Some with freight Stems, round Tops, fwaying Branches, and\
fine Greens; between which, tome tender Suckers, with their finall\
and upright Stalks and airy Leaves, afforded an inexprettible elegant\
Variety. The brown Cypreffes, Iiden with their Frair, added no small\
Laffre to the green of the other Trees; to my great Delight. Under\
thofe Trees grew some wild Simples, and various Kinds of large and\
fmall-leaved Planrs intermixed with Thiftles and Thorms in an agreea-\
ble and moft Painter-like manner. Thefe under Growths, but efpe-\
cially the Grass on the Sides, were in many Places duffed by the Read;,\
which, by their Union, cauied  charming Decorum.\
At proper Dillances, along both Sides of the Rosd, were placed,\
for the Kafe of Travellers, tome low Free-fione Seats, in the Form of\
 long and narrow rchitrave, fapported by two (quare Pillers.\
Going on,  came to  Crossway, where  found  Ferm or Gaide\
fet up. Here, not to gowrong,  was at  Stand, which Way to take:\
In this Doubt  recollected, that those Guides have commonly their\
Paces towards the Way Strangers and Travellers ought to go. This\

was much cleaner; thinking that in fuch  Place it could not well main\
tain it' Beauty and Whitenets; but my Wonder ceafed on perceiving,\
that there were no high Trees over it, but that it had  free Air;\
annother reafon was, that being to low as to be reached over, poffibly\
some Drafifman had been at the Place, and wiped it clean: On fuch \
Conjecture,  took some Water out of the Vaie into my Hand, and\
rubbed  Part of the Shoulder; which confirmed my Sufpicion; for  that fome Parts, were already become fmooth and gloffy,\
by being handled and rubbed.\
Stepping  litile further,  faw another Sight as fine as the former;  fine with reffect to Art. It was an ancient Tomb er Sepulchre of\
light red Marble, intermixed with dark grey, and whice Eyes and Veins;\
with  Lid or Cover of Lapis Lazuli. This Tomb was fupported by\
four whice Marble Sphinxes without Wings, retting on  large black\
marble Plinth, which through ir' Duftinets, feemed to be lightiff.\
grey. The Ground under it was rugged, yet level for three or four\
Feet round the Plinth. This Work was generally encompaffed with\
Sand extending to the Sea-thore, which it faced; and ten of  Steps\
further, the Sea was feen foaming. In the middle of the Belly of the\
Tomb, was  found Bass-relief, within  Compartment of Oak-leaves;\
it exhibited  flying Eagle, with Thunder in its Bill; whence  con-\
jeltured, it might be Pbacion' Grave; and the rather, becaufe there\
food near the Corners three very old and large Cypreffes; of which,\
the hindmoff was as yet whole and found, but the forward ones, by\
Weather or otherwife, to damaged, that one had loft it' Top, and the\
other was on one Side, half unbranched and bare. Behind this Tomb,\
Rood  large Pedeftal of greyifh-blue Stone, on which had formerly, as\
it feemed, been fet an Urs, now fung down, and lying near it half\
buried in the Ground: it was fomewhat broken and damaged:  could\
make but litrle of the Carving upon it, fince that was underneath, and\
the Ear or Handle of the Orn lay upwards; wherefore, in order to\

This Work thus feeming old, and yet the Tomb with all ir' Orna-\
ments as new as if juff fet up,  thought it muft have owed its Prefer-\
vation to fome heavenly Infiuence.  was to entertained with viewing\
it on all sides, that  was wholly taken up with it; without reffecting,\
that as Fortune favoured me,  ought to haften to other Things of Con-\
fequence before it grew too late; yet Irefolved, tho' fayed all Night,\
not to leave the delicious Place before  had exactly deligned, in my\
Pocket-book, every Thing remarkable in it.  then weat ten or twelve\
Steps forwards from it, in order to have  full View of every Thing\
thereabouts; and firting down, there opened  perfett Ordennance;\
for, on feeing the Trees behind and on one Side of the decumbent\
Nymph, and on the other Side an eaty Afcent with  fmall Cottage in\
alow Ground behind it,  could not but obferve how elegant and be-\
coming all the By-works kept themfelves. The Trees behind the\
Tomb appeared dark, and thereby flung it off frong and brightly; the\
Objects on each Side appearing faint. Further on,  dilcovered  imall\
Bridge; and in the Offskip, fome Hills, C all which  prefently\
skeiched and shaded; marking for Shoriness of Time, with Letters or\
Figures, the Colours of the Stones, and their Tints, together with the\
Lighrnets and Darknets of one Object againft another, and alfo againft\
the Skv.\
Having done with this, and walking further on the right Hand, \
ame to  very large and weighty Bridge, of one Arcb, which had an\
exceeding great Span ending, in the Crown, in  Point. This Opening\
difcovered an even Plain, reaching almoft to the Horizon, with Cottages\
and Houfes here and there, in  Village-like manner: They were not\
meanly boarded and plaiftered like ours, but regularly built with\
Stone, tho' plain and without Ornament. This Bridge came from be-\
kind the Trees on the right Hand, and preferved  Communication\
over the Rosd, with an high and large Rock on the Sea-thore: It was\
poffibly placed here for the Sake of  dry Pallage to the other Side in\
cale of Floods.\
Going under this Arch,  found myfelf in the open Field, near an-\
other fort of common Buildings, which, at  Dittance,  could not per-\
ceive, on Account of some intervening Trees. Thele were Herdfmen'\
Hatirations, and built with mean Marcrials, yet in  fine manner with\

with circular Windows over\
the Ground. Some hid fquare Doors,\
them; of eife round Frames, Ruck infteed of Bastrelief, with\
Rams, Or, or Gosts Sculls, cut in white Stone, according\
to the Condition of the Inhabitant. The lower Windows were in\
Form like the Deors, and  Dismeter and half higher than wide; or\
elle, twice the Brealth in Height. The upper Windows of fuch as\
had two Stories of fall Garrets, were moftly round. Some but fingle.\
ftoried, hil Craipats-herded Doorways; and over them, long Octan-\
gular Wirdows; and if ary fnaller over them, they were square. The\
Roots were generally ffittilk, and tiled for bringing off the Water for-\
wares. Some, in my Opinior, much excelled others in Grace; having\
over the Doorways, fnall Baiconies with Compats-doors into them,\
and the Wincows on each Side (quare and equally high; and over them,\
roted ones again. On each Side of the aforefaid Doors or Entrances,\
were made in the Walls, (quare Vent-holes, like Niches contracting in-\
wardly, and cross-barred with Iron. The Pediments were Doric or\
lonir, and of whirith Stone; the lower Story grey, and the rell Free\
fone; tome were painted light-reddith, others white Free-ftone or grey.\
Some Doors had Pillars or Seatson each Side. Some Houfes  faw allo\
joined with Walls, wherein were round Holes. Here and there ap.\
peared large Gates, as of Neat-houfes; one was open, and feemed to be\
like  Place covered in; moff of the Windows had wooden Shutters,\
which hinged on Top, and kept open by Sticks. Thofe Houfes, to\
secure them from the Overflow of the River running in the Neigh\
bourhood, ffoed much above the Level of the Way. In fine, Lomit-\

Somewhat further, and without this Villige,  came up to  round\
Temple, having  lofcy and elegant Fronrifpiece. It was afcended by \
Flight of ten or twelve Steps, with  Free-ftone Balluffrade on each\
Side, adorned with two Sphinxes, facing each other, which were head\
ed with Caps and bodied with Houlings or Coverings, after the An.\
tigue Manner. Landing on thefe Steps,  came up to  Portico, front\
ed with eight Columns, Entabiature and Pediment of the Lonic Order;\
the Pediment had  fine intire Bats-relief, not much rifing. The Co\
lamns were continued round the Temple, twoand two together, refting\
ORR Plinths and Bafements.\

other Ornaments, than fimply thofe of the Order.. The contiguous\
Houfes were low and excenfive; with high Chimnies of Towers yield\
ing, in my Opinion, ia fine Decorum. Behind thefe food  clofe Plan-\
tation of Trees, moftly Pines and Cypreffes, which added no small\
Luflre to all this Stone-work. On each side of the beforementioned\
Steps was  Fountain or square Bason, adorned with two pretty large\
Lioneffes, couching on Pedeftals and (pouring Water.\

Chap.  the finest Things in the Wirldto introduce into oir Pieces: When \

me, with the Addition of  Stump of  Tree, and  small dark Ofship\
behind it, they tagether immediately compose  perfett Ordennance. Obl\
you sannot imafine, hore extraordinary and sull of Variety these: Objects\
are. Thisus the fineft Plate on Earth for  curious Arrift: All is Pointer-\
like Every Thing ties so loose, pretty and wild, that few good Maffers\
would refuse coming bither to defiyn these Wenders; and nothing but the\

viewed him from Top to Toe; he farall in an Heap, with  Board in\
his Lap; and  fmall ink-horn, and  magnifying or Spectacle glats in\
his Hand; on his flead he had  Night cap almoff down to his Eves,\
with his left Leg over his Hlat, poftibly to fave it from the Wind; \
small Light, coming from between the Trees, thone on his Lap. Poor\
Man! thought , horw feelingly you can talk of what is Painter-like; and\
what Satisfartion you muft find in thofe things; if there be any more Artifts\
of your Stamp, this must be the place ro find them in. The Truth is, dhre thore\
Iviewed him and heard his Talk, the more  blamed my own Judg\
ment fornot difcovering fuch Beauties as he did. Now, perceiving he had\
done,  went towards him to fee his Work; but before  could come up\
to him, he had packed up his Alls, and was gone another Way. Behind\
the Trees, near the Place where he had been firting,  found another\
Spark, who ftood and drew after  small Rivalet fult of bio and littfe\
Clods of Earth and Pebbles; which he neatly detigned on Drawing-pa\
per, and marked with their different Colours. His whole Porcofolio\
was full of fuch Painter-like Trumpery; fuch as, muddy Water, decay-\
ed and broken Stones, Picces of Wood, barren Shrubs and Busbes, rough\
Grounds, Toads, Snakes, Ecc.  asking him, What Branch he made\
his Study? He antwered, that he had not yet prattifed any; but hoped,\
if he could get all thofe Things, and perform them well, to become \
good Landskip-painter; for, laid he, those Objects are souncemmon, that\
the beft Mafters give themfelves the Treable to jeck them But, cominued\
he,  cannot but wander, that some fearch here and in other Places, and\
can fcarel find  Piece to their Gedt, nay, often return without doint\

was strange, any Man should run about in Error in to wild and defolate\
 Place.\
Going on,  came to  large and bideous Rock, fplit through, and hav-\
ing one Part hanging forward full of Charp Angles, open Hollows and\
Curs, over run, hereand there, with Mots and barren Shrubs On the\
right side, was  deep moraffy Valley, going off very feep, and on\
the left appeared an inacceffible rained Burlding, like an Heap of Stone,\
Twarming with Adders, Smakes and other venomous Creatures: Behind\
me the Ground was to uneven, full of Ops and Downs, and pathless,\
that  thought it impoftible to get from the Place. On the Point of\
returning back,  faw  Man creep, on all four, out of one of the\
Holes or Hollows of the Rock, and thereby cleared  Paffage for me.\
This Man told me what wonderful Things were to be feen on the other\
Side; but  was fcarce crept half through, before  heard  frightful\
Thunder-clap, which thook the whole Rock; wherefore, redoubling my\
Speed, and being got through,  found, that the Top of the Rock was\
tumbled over the right side; which made me fuddenly recire from\
theme, fearful char another Part might fall upon me. What allo raited\
my Avertion, was, the Sight of  lomb crassed to Pieces, and almott\
funk into the Ground; and near it, lying  Piece of  lorge Trunk, of\
whice Marble.  could perceive, by the Bafe, that it had been \
Torm; and being curious to know, what might be hidden behind it, \
got on the Tomb, and faw, through the Trees, downwards  frightful\
Pool  therefore took to the left; where  thought the Ground was\
more level: Three or four Steps from thence,  law  white Paper\
Hintering before me along the Ground; and after it  Blue one, fome-\
what larger; both which Iranafter and took up. The biue Paper ap.\
peared to be  Drawing after the aforefaid Tomb, when intire and\
Handing, which made me judge, that he muft have been  good Maf\
ter who had thus improved it in the Draught. Poffibly, thought  he\
is hereabouts My Conjecture was not groundless; for, flepping  little\
further,  found the poor Wreech lying under  large Oat which had\
been thunder-ftruck; the Stem was cleft from Top to Bottom, and \
large Limb lay acrots the Mans Body: His Porto folio lry near him,\
emptied of all his Drawings  his Sight affrighted me; and approach\
ing near,  heard him ligh: He, perceiving me, called out prefencly\
for Help:  cleared the Limb from off his Body as well as  could;\
whereby, and after much Pains, he ditengaged himself from the Leaves.\
He was, to my Wonder, no where hurt, lave  little in his left Hand,\
yet of no Contequence.  recurned him his Papers, and asked him,\

He antwered, he had: When, goins to thew it to me, he, in Amare\

also tumbled down, and my Drowing scarce finished! We then went to-\
gether fixther up, towards the left, and regained moft of his Papers\
He fold me, that his Companion had left him, and run away on the\
Approach of the Scorm; which induced me to think, he was the Per-\
fon who came creeping on all four through the aforefaid Hole. On our\
coming down, we found many already drawing after the broten Tree un\
der which the good Man had lain, with the uimoff Application; Twas\
their unanimous Opinion, never to have feen  Tree more Painter-like.\
This talk furprized us both. He shewed them his Drawing, and faid,\
that the Tomb was the only Object he found intire thereabouts; and,\
this being demolithed, there was nothing left to pleafe him. But this\
they fcoffed at and anfwered him, that fuch Things might eafily be\
made out of one' Head, or found in Prints. In thort, Twas great Di-\
verfion to me to fee one as horly clambering up one Place, and another\
creeping through fome Hole, for the fake of deligning the Rock and\
Tombrumbled down, as if they were going after  reature.\
Taking Leave of this Perfon,  purfued my Way: But was obliged,\
for the take of  ruinous Fountain, the Vafes, Mouldings and other Or-\
naments whereof lay across and slopped the Way, to take to the right\
Hand. On the Remains, adorned with Bals relief,  found not one in-\
tire Figure, every thing being exceffively mouldered, fouled and over\
run with wild Plants and Shrubs.  Bafon lay awry, with  Cormer\
funk into the Ground, broken and full of Earth or Mud.  Boy, who\
had been fitting there, came and asked me, Whether  could not tell\
him, which Part of this Heap of Stones was the moft Painter like? \
have been long making  Charce, lays he, of fomething good out of it, but\
the Number confounds me; the Parts are all so broken that  cannot find\
to much as  whole Hand or Foot:  have, thewing me his Drawing.\
pitched upon this amang them, with much ado.  believe verily, there\
was not fuch another undamaged Bit in the whole Ruin, tho' of little\
Confequence: It was  Plinth with the right Leg and Foot of Apollo;\
Wanting the great Toe. He faid, that he, with eight or ten others,\
had been drawing every thing after the Heap, except this Frigment;\
the Foot of which was not, according to their Fancies, broken enough.\
 comforted him with faying, that he had pibked our the ivery belt thing\
of all, when he owned, that he made the Choice through the Perfua=\
fion of another, who was now gone away, to whom the Leg, by\

thought, ought to be fet in  right Way; and his simplicity pleafed\
IIc.\
Turning then to the right Hand, as  have faid,  came into  dif\
mal Place, which, by the Largencts of the Pavement, and Arch-work\
tupported by great Pillars, feemed formerly to have been  Palace. It\
was here to lonefome and gaftly, that  was feized with  cold Sweat;\
wherefore  mended my Pace, in order to get out of it, and being got\
to the other side, and ten or twelve Paces from it,  found myfelf again\
at the Lake before mentioned; near which lay  shattered Tomb,\
with the Corps half tumbled out. The Head and one Arm refted on\
 large Root of  Tree lying near it ; the Lid was almoff flid off, and\
juft on the Totter; and  Smake, from undermeath, was creeping into the\
Tomb!  Sight frightful enough.\
The Sun, now on the Point of fetting, darted his refulgent Rays\
between some heavy Clouds; the Sty was moreover dark Blue, and on\
the Horizon yellowith -striped; which, along through the Trees, Arongly\
glirtered in my Eyes  faw  grave Man carefully defigning this Sky\
in Colours. in pafting by,  faid to him, \'97 Sir, you bave met\

portion of Divition of the Parts, not only of the Face, but of the\
whole Body, that the Sitter may be known by his Pilture; which\
may be moft agreeably done by mmixing the Fashich with what is Paint-\
ortike; as the great Lely did, and which is called the Painterlike of\
antique Manner, but by the ignorant Commonalry, the Roman Man-\
DCT.\
Next, we mult be thoroughly judicious in the graceful Choice of the\
Light, and the Place where the Perfon is to fit, that the Face may\
appear to the beft Advantage; and then the Body is to be difpoted to\
the moft natural and becoming Pesture.\
The next Bulinets, and which gives it the greateff Luftre, is, the\
Colouring; that each Perfon and his Parts may have their preper Cor\
Bur, atid fuch as appears in his daily Converfe, not fuch as proceeds\
from extraordihary Emotions. Let the Arciff beware of inclining to\
any particular Manner, like fome, whofe Work is thereby better\
known to be theirs, than the Friends of the Sitter know the Pictun\
\
to be his.\
As for the Chostr of Light, in order to apply it moft advanidgiont\
ly for the Benefit of either Sex, irs certainly  Matter of great Mo\
ment;\
No.  Periraiture.\
Book VII\
 fince the fair Sex commonly partake of more Delicacy and\
Grace than Men, to they muft have  Light as beautiful and agreea-\
ble as their Perfons.\
But tere we proceed further, it will not be improper to look into\
the Origin of Pertraits, in order thereby to thew the Aim of thofe\
who caufe themfelves to be drawn, and the Profirs which Mafters get\
thereby.\
The Ancients uted to caule thofe, from whom the Common-wealth\
had received extraordinary Benefits, either in War or civil Affairs, or\
for Eminence in Religion, to be reprefented in Marble or Metal, or\
in  Pilture, that the Sight of them, by thofe Honours, might be \
Spur to Pofterity to emulate the fame Virtues. This Honour was firft\
begiun with their Deities; afterwards it was paid to Heroes, and of\
confequence to Philosephers, Oraters, religious Men, and others, not\
only to perpecuace their Virtues, but allo to emhalm their Names and\
Memories. But now it goes further;  Perfon of any Condition whar\
foever, have he but as much Money as the Painter asks, muft fit for\
his Picture; this is  great Abufe, and fprung from as laudable \
Cante.\
in Noblemes indeed is  very commendable Cultom; becaute, be\
ing defcended from great Families, the Luflre of thefe ought to thine,\
to encourage their succeffors to keep up their Glory, and to prevent\
fullying it by unworthy Actions.\
As for  General, of Admiral, who has died in the Bed of Honour,\
Gratitude,  think, obliges us to raife  Monument to his Glory,\
and to animate brave Souls in fucure Times, to imitate his Virtue.\
But whats this to the Vulgar; Pride only fpurs them to it. The\
Rich do it, that their Children may boaft of it; the Mafter of  nume-\
jous Family does it, that the World may know he is  Father; be\
who has fired  Magazine of the Enemy muft be drawn, with this\
great Action, tho' perhaps there was no body to hinder him. Has \
Ctizen' Wife but an only Babe, he is drawn at half  Vear old; at\
ten Vears old he fits again, and for the laft Time in his twenty fitth\
Year, in order to thew her tender Folly; and then the flands wonder\
ing how  Man can to alter in that Time; is not this  weighty Rea\
fon!  reproveable Cultom, if Painters did not gain by it. But  Portraits are allowable, when  Lover is ablent from his Miftrels,\
that they may find each other their Piltures, to cherifh and increate\
their Loves;  Man and Wife to parted may do the fame\

 to return to the original Matter;  muft warn the Artifts not to\
give in too much to what is common; or humour ignorant People to\
much, as not to referve to themfelves some Liberty of doing what\
they think proper for the fake of Reputation: Surely, this cannot be\
Rrange Advice; for  Mafter, who prefers Money before Art, has no\
more dangerous  Rock to (plit on, lince the ignorant Multitude ufually\
infiff to be drawn according to their own Whims. One fays to  good\
Matter, \'97 Draw me thus or thus; let me have one Hand on my Breaft,\
and the other on  Table; another mult have  Flower in his Hand, or\
 Flower-pot mult be by him; another muft have  Dog, or other\
Creature, in his Lap; another will have his Face turned this or that\
Way; and fome, who would be drawn in the Reman Manner, muft\
be fet off by  Globe or Clock on . Table, whether fuch Ornaments\
be proper, or not: On mentioning the Reman Manner,  find that it\
fignifies,  loofe, airy Undress, fomewhat favouring of the Mode, but\
in no wife agreeing with the ancient Roman Habit.\
But many other Inconveniencies attend Portraiture; as firft, the Ig.\
porance of thofe who fit; for fome of them, having no right Notion of\
their own Mien and Shape, often refer the judgment of . fine Por-\
trait to the Eye of  Child, or Servant; and what they fay, Monficur\
and Madame believe, either to its Praife, or Difcommendation.\
 second Inconveniency arifes from  wedded Inclination which any\
one has to fuch and fuch Objects; judging, as they like or diflike, not\
only of Pictures, but even the Life wtelf; for, tho' they may be\
afraid to pass Sentence on  fine Hiffory, or Landskip, yet  Por-\
trail mult not efcape them, as thinking it within the Reach of their\
Capacities.\
Thirdly, we find many Artifts never pleafed with other Mers\
Works, but, being full of themfelves, delpife every thing they fee\
tho' as good as their own; and this perhaps on no better Bortom, than\
 Pique againtt the Arciffs Converlation, Talk, Dress or Money; or\
elfe becaule of his greater Fame and yet, if ten Perfons happen to\
appland  fine Pilture of this Eye-fore Mafter, they will, at that\
Juncture, chime in with them, to fereen their Prejudice. And, on the\
contrary, if but  fingle Perfon afterwards find fault, they immediate-\
ly turn the Tables againtl ten others. Again, if  Piece of their\
Friend be brought on the Carper, tho' never to faulty, they will ap\
pland and jullity it at any rate, tho' againft their own Convictions of\
Confcience. But this partial and prejudiced Humour is moft prevalent\
in thofe who know leall.\

Temper, diflike their own, but appland every thing other Men do:\
Thele indeed are not to noxious as the former; becaute they only hure\
themfelves, whereas the others hurt every body.\
Fifthly, there are  prejudiced Set of Men who find no Talle, but\
in ealy and grave Airs and Poftures; others in firring and hurrying\
ones; others in ftrong and violent ones; fome think, that Womens\
Draperies ought to be loofe and foft; others will have them of Vel.\

How can  Portrait pleafe to many Opinions! It is not like an Hiftory\
full of Figures, where we can introduce Variety of fedate and firring\
Action, more or less beautiful Colouring, loofe or fet Draperies, dark\
or light Grounds, coc. Becaule this is but  fingle Figure.\
Our Bufincts then, muft be to find  Way between this Soylla and\
Cbarybdis, to enable the Artiff to paint  good Portrait; for he who\
makes due Reffection on every thing, can prepare himself to overcome\
the aforefaid Difficulties\
  AP. II. Of the Defetts in the Face and other Parts.\
HE Defects which are feen in Nature, or in fimple Life, are\
threefold.\
 Natural ones.\
 Accidental ones.\
 Usual ones.\
The Noturalones are,  wry Face, fquint Eyes, wry Mouth, Nofe,\
C Accidental ones are, Loss of an Eye,  Cut on the Cheek or \
ther Part of the Face; Pies of the Small-pox, and the like.\
The Usual ones are, thofe Habits to which we accultom ourfelves\
from our Infancy; to wit, Contraction of the Eyes and Mouth, of\
Cloting of Gaping of the latter, or drawing it in fomewhat to this or\
that side, upwards or downwards, Cec.\
As for other bodily Infirmities, how many have wry Necks, Hunch-\
backs, Bandy-legs, withered or thort rms, of one Chorter than the\
other;\
\
\
Of Pertraiture.\
Chap.  dead or lame Hands or Fingers? Among thefe, some are una-\
voidable; and others may be either left our, or handfomely hidden.\
The Neceffary ones ought to be feen, becaute they belp the Likeness;\
tuch as  wry Face, fquint Eyes, low Fore-head, Thinnels and Fatnels,\
 wry Neck, too fhort or long  Nofe, Wrinkles between the Eyes,\
Ruddiness or Palenets of the Cheeks, or Lips, Pimples or Warts -\
bout the Mouth; and fuch like; among thofe which may be bidden\
or left out,  count  blind Eye,  Wound, Wen, Mole, Pies of Small-\
pox, too many Pimples, Coc.  red, blue, or hairy Spot; as allo\
habicual Ulages; fuch as hanging Lips, Pinchings of Drawings of\
the Mouth and Eyes.\
 think allo, that the common and usual Dress of  Perton is  great\
Addition to Likeness for no fooner is the Dress altered, but the Look\
does the fame, and thews itfelf either more or lets pleating and agree-\
able; and thereby the Perfon becomes more or less known: To obvi-\
ate which,  advife the Artiff above all things to get firft  true Like-\
ness of the Face, and paint it to the Sitter' Satisfaction; and then he\
may freely manage all the reft as he thinks fit, and thereby get Ho-\
nour and Commendation; fince the Life itfelf, in fuch  Drels, cannot\
any more alter.\
The Painter should likewife dilcover and know, as much as poffible,\
the Natare and Temper of the Perfon fitting, and in what Circum-\
Rances lies his favourite Pleafure; that he may, when fitting, be en-\
certained with Talk pleating to him, and his Air thereby kept fteady\
and ferene, and his Pofture natural and eaty; avoiding every thing\
tending towards Sorrow, or frightful Relanons; for thefe are apt to\
ruffie the Mind, and to to difcompofe the Face, that it cannot eafily\
be got right again: But if the Sitter himself do, by his Talk, difco\
ver his own Bent, the Painter ought to humour it to the laft, whether\
it be jocofe or moderate, without Exaggeration of Diminution; yet\
with luch  Variety, as not to prove tirefome, and make the Face al.\
ter. He who cannot thus manage and furnith out  Difcourfe, will be\
the longer ere he hit the Likeness: Some will even fit three or four\
Times, and each Time with  different Air; and were they to fit ten\
Times,  fancy fomething new would still offer.\
Another Hindrance may be, that Painting-rooms are often hung\
with fuch finutty Piltures as frequencly put Virgins to the Blnth, or\
alter their Countenances. But tho', for Improvement, fine Pittures are\
neceffary to be always in View, yet, in  Painting room, there ought\
not to hang the wanton Pilture of Mars and Venus catch\'92 by Vulcan;\

or Diana\'92 Bothing, tho' done by Van Dyk; or feseph and Potiphar'\
Wife; for tho' thefe may hang in  Corner, yet when the Eye has\
once carched them, it will retain them; becaute their ideas make con-\
tinual Impreftions on the Mind, even againtl its Will; and therefore\
the bare Remembrance of fuch Things muft put  young and chafle\
Virgin to the Bluth. Mult it not create  Longing, to fee  Picture of\
two Besgar-boys fall greedily on ripe Fruit, the one eagerly biting \
Piece of freth Melon, and the other,  Bunch of Grapes, with the\
Jnice falling down his Chin on his naked Breaft? The Room then\
should be hung with every thing modell, as fine Landskips and Flow.\
er-pieces, which will amufe the Sight without difturbing or tiring the\
Mind, or altering the Countenance; fine Portraits alfo will animate \
Sitter to keep him ferene, and make him emulous of their Airs: \
large Lookingglats may be likewife of Service, if to hung that the\
Sitter can fee himself in it, for, thereby difcovering any Dilagreeable.\
nets in his Look, he will correct himself, in order to have as good an\
Air as he detires; and by fuch Methods as thefe  Painter may be.\
come great.\
We will now proceed to confider, how many Millakes fome Painters\
commit in relation to the firff Obfervation of natural Defetts; thefe\
endearour, to their utmoft Power, to exprets punctually the Deformities\
and Defelts of  Face, without Scruple, to wit,  blind of fquint Eye,\
or the like, tho' they know that tis an Enemy to Grace, and on no\
other Ground than  falfe Belief that it creates  greater Likeness\
But who loves to be reproached with his Defects, when they can be\
artfully hidden? What would become of Grace: which reaches, that \
Painter should make as beautiful  Choice as poftible; which thefe ble\
mithes obfcure:  think therefore, that we cannor lay too great  Stress\
on what concerns the Make, Posstion and Turn of  Face, that the Eye\
be not offended with Blemith, or Deformity, or the Posture look dify-\
freeable.\
How monlrous is the Picture of  certain Admiral, who seems to\
ftab himself with his Staff of Command, and has  defective Eye turn\
ed directly to the Light; becaute, according to the Saying, he is bet\
Known by it: Would not  more Profile-view have fixted him better,\
or to have fiung the Side with the blind Eye into Shade? Would it not\
be ridiculous to paint the Duke of Lnxemburgh in Profile, to reprefent\
him the becter, and that his Hunch -back might be the more vifible,\
for no other Reaton, than that moft People knew he had one?\

  abhors Deformity, and we cannot behold it without Averfi-\
on, and  quick Tun of the Eye from it;  squint eyed Perfon cannot\
see himself in  Glass without inward Trouble; especially one of the\
fair Sex, who, in other respects tolerably handsome, cannot bear to\
fee an laftance of her Deformity in another, but will bathfully look off\
\
or down to the Ground; how much worle then mult it look in  Pic\
ture? The Life may be fometimes feen on an handlome Side; which,\
in an ill cholen Picture, we can never expect: Whence it' natural for\
one, who has  Blemith or Defect in an Eye or Check, always to turn\
the bell side to the Light; in thort, we do not defire to do any Thing,\
walk, fland, fit, talk, but with  becoming Air Have we fore Eyes,\
we hide them under our Hlats; or if  lame Hlip, we endeavour to walk\
briskly; have we some Humour or Pimples in  Cheek, we either hide\
them with  Paich, or paint the other Side like it; have we bad Teeth,\
we keep the Mouth thut; or  lame Hland, and hide it not under our\
Coats, of in our Pockets. If Naturealts fo, how can fuch Defects pleafe\
in  Picture? Such  Flartery then, as is agreeable to Art; is not only\
allowable, but commendable, efpecially when the Sitter is to dispoted\
in Pofture that the Painter himself cannot perceive it.\
Ask any one who wears  Piece of black Silk over an hollow Eve,\
whether he defires to be drawn from that side;  believe not:  Per-\
ton with  wooden Leg cares not that the Deformity should appear in\
 Pilture; fuchi an one ought to be drawn in half Length only; but if\
the Heroe inift upon the introducing fuch  Leg, on  Suppofition\
that is an Honour to have loft  Limb in his Country' Service, the\
Painter mult then comply with his Defires; or elle contrive it lying on\
 Table covered with red Velvet : if he defire it after the Anique\
Manner, it muft be contrived in  Bats-relief; wherein the Occation af\
it may be reprefented; or it may hang near him on  Wall, with its\
Buckles and Straps, as is done in Hantingiequipages; of elfe it may\
be placed among the Ornamehnts of Archirelture, to be more in View:\
But what Praife or Advantage will an Arciff get by this, when  judi-\
cious Mafter fees the Picture! He may verhaps plead in Excute, that\
the Sitter would have it fo: This indeed  cannot argue againft; becaute\

 cially to the Female Sex; who, whether their Pictures are drawn\
\
on their own Accounts, or through the Defire of others, imagine\
ther deferve fuch Homage; nor ftops it here, for altho' they may\
poffess  colerable Share of Beauty, yet that' not fatisfaltory enough;\
they muff be ffaccered, and their Pictures painted in the moft beauti-\
ful Light; and unhappy is the Painter who abates but half  Dram of\
fuch  Beautr.\
For thefe Reafons the Maffer is obliged to have  principal Regard\
to Light and Coloar; but to the Light chiefy, fince its well known\
that mothing gives greater Offence to ignorant People than Shades, and\
sill more, when they are Rrong and broad: They believe they (peak\
to the Purpofe in objecting, \'97 Well, how can it be poffible that my\
Nock and Check should have firch large shades; when  daily confult\
Hiy Glass, and find my Skin all ofa Colour and White? And they the\
Painter is blained: But are not fuch Reafons weak and abfurd? Since\
if  Man, how tenacious foever, meet another; who, by long Abfence\
and Alteration of Drefs, is got ort of his Memory, he will naturally\
forn him to the Light, in order to know him and his Features. This\
Condolt has been wonderfully obferved by Baroces in his Picture of\
Mary, paying  Vific to Elizabert when big with Child; in which, by\
his Method of placing the Figures, and the Accention of the Faces,\
we teem to hear them talk, looking earneftly at each other.\
 Ithink thote Mafters have hads the beft. Choice, who have cholen\
 Frot-tgbs, and thereby kepr their Colours moft natural and beau\
tful; fince this Light is certainly moft advantageous, whether the\

Chap:  have no fixed Place; as we shall further thew in another Chap\
ter; as alfo how far and on what Occafions we muft confine ourfelves\
to that Rule.\
The beft way to fettle this Point is, to follow thole who have chof\
en their Light almost frenting, and, as before faid, such  Colour-\
ing as naturally appears to the Eye, belides  good Choice: SinceI chink\
the Cafe of placing  Portrait to be the fame, as that of curious Cbi-\
ns. which, whether it fland high or low, thew itself every where beau\
tiful. My Reafon for this is, that Objects, which have fuch  Front-\
light, have an exceeding, fine Effect, and  ear Relief, when they come\
againft  dark Ground; and hill finer, when the Light falls on them\
somewhat from on high, if the Sitter and fome Accidents do not hinder\
it; in which Cafe, Reafon and our Eye mult beft direct us. View\
but this Finels in  Pofture painted leaning over an Harch, or out at\
Window, and what great Decorum the Touches and Shades about the\
moft relieved Parts caule in fuch an Object; as Leonarde da Vinci has\
well obferved.\
Of the Accidents, which  juft now spoke of,  shall mention two\
of three; fome Perfons may be too long and charp-nofed, or too hol-\
low-eyed; for fuch  low Light is moft proper; but where tis other-\
wife, an high Light. In this Manner  judicious Mafter ought to help\
the Defects of Nature, without adding to, or taking any thing from\
them: Vet, to the Sorrow of impartial Malters, the contrary is too\
much feen; for, as  have faid, that Hiffory-painters chule and follow\
what they have the greateft inclination for, to it is with many Portrait-\
painters, their Work is better Known by their particular Manner,\
than the Sitter by his Picture.\
Permit me here to make  Comparifon between thofe two great\
Malters, Titian and Van Dyk, with respect to the Judgment  have\
heard made on their Works: Of the latter it' faid, that in the\
Delign, Grace and Choice of  Portrait figure he was the moft skilful;\
nevertheless Pye feen many of Titians (who, in moft Men' Opinions,\
has the greater Reputation) which feemed to me incomparable, tho'\
lets agreeable: Here my Polition, about the particular Choice of\
Mafters, takes effect again; becaute  think, that the Defect in, .\
greeableness is peculiar to Titidn' Country, and limits his Choice,\
and therefore he is the lels culpable; when, on the contrary,\
our Region prefers what is gay and elegant, before the majeitic and\
grave; and Likeness is the chief Object both of the Sitter and the\
Arciff, every thing: elfe being looked or as By-works and Ornament:\

 poor Judgment methinks of People of Senfel For if  Portrail have\
not, befides Likeness, an agreeable Difposition, the little Knowledge\
of the Mafter will prefently appear. Iis true, that we meet with ma-\
 odd Faces in the Life, especially among vulgar and clownith Peo-\
ple, yet  fay, that, be they ever fo rude, Agreeableness should be ob-\
served in their Piltures. By fgreeubleness  underftand the Difposition.\
of  Posture in general; as when the Face has an advantageous Turn\
more or lets to the Light, up or down, in order to create handfome\
Shades, and to thun unbecoming ones; for every Face requires  parti-\
cular Obfervation; one, an high Light, another,  low one; this \
Side-light; that, an almoft fronting one:  fpeak not yer of many \
ther Requifites, fuch as the Sway of the Neck, Shoulders or Breaff;\
or of  proper Back ground; all which Confiderations are effential to \
fine Portrait, as well in respect to the Naturalnets and Colour, as to the\
Motion: But of the Light and Back-grounds we shall fay more in the\
sext Chapter, and now return to our Comparifon. Some think that\
Von Dyks Pamtings are but Watercolours, compared with Titians,\
whofe Pitures have to much Force in Colouring, Lights and Shades,\
that those of the other cannot fland in Compecition with them, nay,\
that his Colouring is inimitable, and whereby that of Van Dyf ap-\
pears faint and weak:  ridiculous Opinion indeed! However, that\
Vax Dyk and Tirian differ much in Colouring,  allow; but neverthe-\
tets think, that we need not run to the Iations to prove it, fince, if\
the Stress lay in frong Colouring only, Rembrant need not give way\
to Titias: But whence arifes the Miltake ? Moft Men chime in with\
thofe fimple Judges who approve no Hiffories, Landskips, or Portrails,\
that are not painted in the Iralian Manner. My Opinion is, that the\
whole Marter lies more in the Difference of Climates, than in the\
Handlings of the Matters; for let an Englifsmans Piture hang near\
an Iabias', both handled with equal Skill, and each reprefented ac\
cording to his Hue and Nature, there will appear  great Difference\
between them; the (weetening Sofinets of the Englishmon will charm\
as much on one Hand, as the flrong and glowing Colour of the Iation\
on the other: On which now of thefe two Pictures has the Mafter be.\
flowed the moff Pains? re not both Praife worthy, as having each\
expreffed the Charaffer natural to his Figure?\
But pot to go abroad for Comparifons, with respect to particular\
Climes, our own Netberland affords Differences enough: Two Brothers\

them is brought up to the Sword, and endures all the Facigues of\

 have difcovered  great Overlight in fome Artifls, which is, that\
when the Face was finished, they had no further Regard to the Life.\
but chofe  Pofture, at Pleafure, our of Drawings of Prints, without\
confidering whether it faited the Perfon, and whether the Dress was\
proper to the Condition and Countenance of the Sitter; nay, whether\
the Head march\'92 the Body: Certainly,  great Heedlessness! For if \
Body mull be added, what more proper than the Life irself: And tho'\
the Layman be good, and helpful, yet its not equal to the Life.\
Many difregard this, thinking they have done enough in hirting\
the Face: But all the while they are prepofteroutly joining an\
airy Drapery to  fedate and grave Head, and  grave and fliff\
Dress to  merry Face. But further, the Hands are intirely neg-\
letted; if  Pair of fine ones can be got of some other Mafter, thefe\
are made Ufe of, without Regard to the Life, which may per-\
haps have hort, thick and coarfe Hlands: How can thefe Thingsagrec?\
is it not almoff the same as to drels Florg with the Drapery of feffc, and\
Vefta with Floras? rcifts lay.\'97 We have the Prints of Van Dyk,\
Lety, Kneller and others for fine Examples; and as Lely has followed\
Van Dyk in graceful Action and Draperies, fo we have  Liberty to\
imitate him, and others. \'97 To which  willingly agree; but then\
we ought to do it on the fame Footing as he did; in his Poltures he has\
pot meerly, and without Alceration followed Vun Dif, and Killless\
without judgment; as may be feen in his two celebrared Pictures of\
Well Goynn and the Dof \'97. The one,  wanton and bux-\
om Lady, he has to reprefented; and the other, being  Widow, and\
more fedate, appears more modefl.\
By this Rule we muft walk in the Ufe of thofe great Mafters; but\
if Things be done without making Dillinction of Perfons, and their\
Conditions, the Arciff will work to his Dilhonour. He who fleals this,\

that fince the Life, however we difpofe it, either from or near the\
Light, fronting or in Protile, yer supports itfelf, tho' the Light be not\
advantageouly cholen, which  Portrait cannot do; we therefore mutt\
needs, in order to make if appear as it ought to be, accommodate the\
Light to the Disposicion of the Face; for lnftance, when the Face turns\
fomewhat fideways, the Light muft be adapted to it; when it' quite\
in Protile,  Side light will be best, becaufe then  great Mass of Light\
remains together, to wit, in the Forehead, Nofe and Cheeks, which\
are not broken by any Groundthade, but united by the Roundnets;\

Order, that it may look narural Each Colour of the By-work, ought,\
according to it' Lightness or Darkness, to have it' moderate Shade and\
dark Touches, as the Matter, it contifis of, is either folid, or thin and\
tranfparent; and in Proportion as the Objects leffen, to mult the Force\
of their Colours diminith, as shall be furcher illuftrated in the following\
Chapter, to which for Brevity we refer: We fee an excellent Example\
of this Management in the famous Nelfcbers artful Portraits, wherein\
he has judicioutly handled the darkeff Shades, and -Touches,\
according to the natural Ferce of the Colour.\
For the better underftanding of further Obfervables,  have found it\
proper to meation some other Particulars concerning the Dilpolition of\
Lights, according to Occation, contilling in Light againft Dark, and the\
centrary; and tho' every Thing thereby becomes relieved, and is fee\
off, yet that is not fufficient; for the placing of Colours againtt eachr\
other on suitable Grounds; and  Contraft in the Objects, whether move-\
able or immoveable, is of great Confequence and Decorum: And al\
tho' we have handled thefe Things at large in the Book of Colouring,\
yet we find it neceffary, to recapiculate them here, with respect to Por-\
traits, and the reciring Grounds or Viftos behind them.\
Obferve then, whether  fair and beautiful Face will become  light\
Grey, or lighrith blue Ground; and whether  warm Complexion and\
Rrong Colouring againtt  glowing or yellowith Ground will pleafe the\
Eye:  fpeak of the Face, not the Draperies, tho' both together make\
 Portrall: But let the fair and beautifid Fuce of  Woman be placed.\
againlt  warm Ground, and then the light Parts will not only be thereby\
fing off, and look more agreeable, but the Shades willallo be foften-\
ed, and appear more tender; for it' unnatural, to force  fair and ten-\

ment; as fome by their glowing Shades and Rellexions have endeavour-\
ed to do; whereby their Faces, on the shaded side, look as if  light-\
ed Candle flood behind them, which penetrated their Skin: This is as\
unnatural in the open Air, as within Doors.\
This Example of  Woman is enough, to prove the contrary Coadntt\

Whence its evident, that Back-grounds contribuce very much to the\
charming Grace of Objects; nay, Idare fay, that the Decorum thoftly\
depends thereon: And tho' many imagine, that  dark of black Grond\
always becomes  Portrait, yet  no Rule, fince, as before has been\
Laid, each inlividaal Coloar of the Objetts requires  particular Back.\
groand: Belides, it tuch Things were to be taken for Rules, the rt\
would fmell too much of an Handicrafe; for  dark Colour againt \
dark Ground can have no good Effect, and that of  whice, or pale \
gainft it, will be too hard; therefore  Medium mult be pudicioutly ob-\
ferved in bock, that one Colour may fuit with the other. in the Drage.\
ries the Conduct is the fame; one Perfon beft becomes light; and another,\
dark Cloths; Blue fuitsone, and Red, Vellow or Green, Cc. another:\
The Arrit muft then take care not to force Nature, but help her as\
much as poffible, and reprefent her alwars moft begutiful.\
If any one would know my Reafon for thinking, that many Errors\
arife in this Part of the Art, it is, That the Colours of the nated receive\
more or lets, or too much Force by the By-colours of Grounds and\
Eackornaments: It fares with them, as it is laid of the Camelion, who\
changes his Colour as often as he is placed by different Colours; tho' this\
is occationed by his elegant and thining Scales, when, contrarily, the\
human Skin is dull and not fhining: However, we shall find, that he,\
who paints  Portrait twice, and each Time on  contrary Ground, yet\
with the fame Temperament of Colours, will perceive  very great,\
nay, incredible Difference: As  have on feveral Occafions experiment\
ed in the Life; to wit, That when some Virgins were in  Room hung\
with Vellow, they looked fickly and grey, notwithflanding their freth\
Colour; but contrarily, being in  Room hung with Violet, their Co.\
lours thewed themfelves very beautiful; whence it appears that the Al.\
terations are offentimes occafioned by the adjacent Objects: Let him,\
who doubts this, make Trial of it in  Portrait, by laying  Ground,\
with Watercolours, on Paper, and after the Face is cut out, placing it\
againft the Picture intlead of  Back-ground. But,  think, there is \
conveniet Way of preventing the aforefaid lceration; namely, by\
fixing againft the Wall, behind the Sitter,  Garment, Cloth or fome\
thing elle of the fame Colour, of near it, which we chufe for our Bick-\
ground:\
\
\
\
Of Pertraiture.\
 Thurrwe may be fire of hitting the right Colour, and make\
the Painting look agresable\
in order to repreient an extentive Back-ground, and chieffy in  small\
Picture, be it an Apartment, or Landskip, some Sbadiness should be con-\
rived between the Figure and the Diltance, as  Column, Curtain, Body\
of  Tree, Vale, Coc. Thete Objects being in Shade, or of  dark Co-\
lour, the Lights falling on the Off-works, will not prejudice either the\
Faceor Drapery; tho' both be light; but on the contrary, the Figure..\
as receiving the foremoll and greatelt Light, will thereby be relieved,\
and look more agreeable.\
As for the Drageries, fince they confill of different and various Co\
lours, each of  particular. Narure, and little agreeing with the Co\
lour of the Face, they alfo require each  particular Ground, beft\
fairing and unicing with it; to the end that, tho' differing among them.\
felves, they may have  perfett Harmony with each other,, to that the\
Eye be not taken alone with the Face, or the Draperies, Ornaments.\
or By-works; but, by this fweet Conjunction, infentibly conducted alli\
over the Pilture.\
It will not be improper to treat alfo about Eafiness and Sedarenels:\
in Polture, opposed to Stir and Bultle; and the contrary: Namely, that\
the Picture of  Gentlewoman of Repute, who, in  grave and fedate\
Manner turns towards that of her Husband hanging near it, gets  great\
Decorum by soving and firring Hind-works, whether by means of\
Waving Treesor croffing Archifecture of Stone, or Wood, or any thing\
olfe that the Mafter thinks will belt controff, or oppose the sedate Po-\
sure of his principal Figure: And becaute thefe are Things of Conte\
quence, and may not be plainly apprehended by every one,  hall ex-\
plain myfelf by Examples in Plare . VIl, touching the Elegance and\
Harmony of Back-grounds with the Figures.\

under Part of the Body; whereas, were it otherwife, the Face, as\
but  fmall Part of the Body, would look too fharp and ditagrecable,\
and the under Part of the Body would have no Force.\
In No.  Being the Portrail of  Man of  more warm and Twaro\

is very ornamental, and each fets off the other.\

in No.  Is an Example of the Contrall in Off-works with the Drg.\
perr of the Figure; frewing the Oppofition of moveable Objects with\
tixed ones; for herein are leen rounding and croffing Folds againtt\
 and parallel Off-works. And\
 in No. . Appears the Reverfe; where the Folds hang freight and\
mottly downwards, and the Off-works crots them.\
No.  Gives us an Example of the opposing Action and Polture of\
Bodies in two Fellow-portraits; for the Man, being on the Womans\
right Side, turns his Face fidewars towards her; his Body is fronting,\
receiving the Light from the right Side.\
In No.  We iee the contrary in the Womans Pofture; her Face is\
foreight, and her Body fways fideways towards the Man; the allo is\
lighted from the right side.\
The Figures numbered  and  reprefent alfo, yet in  different\
Manner, the Contrall in the Motion; for the Woman, flanding on the\
right side of the Man, has  fedace Motion; and fet and hanging\
Shoulders: But the Man contrarily is in an active Motion. And\
No.  Shews  proper Method to exhibit  great Extent, or seem\
ingly fuch, in  snall Piece; for the Fioure ftands in  firong Light;\
the By-ornaments,  Curtain, Vafe, Pillar and Walling are in Shade;\
and the Oftskip or Hind work is light again, but fomewhat broke by\
resion of its Diftance.\
To conclude this Chapter  shall fay fomething of the placing of\
Pertruits; and of their Point of Sight.\
As to the former, its certain that when we fee any painted Figure,\
of Object in  Place where the Life can be expected, as standing on the\
Ground, leaning over  Balcony or Balluftrade, or out at Window,\
C it deceives the Eye, and, by being feen unawares, caules fometimes\
 pleaing Miltake; as it frightens and furprizes others, when they\
meet with it unexpectedly at fuch Places as aforefaid, and where there\
is any Litelifood for it. if we are thus mifled by  Reprefentation of\
Nature, how great mull the Mafter be who did ir! The Knowing\
eteem him, Igaorants cry him up: If this be the Cafe, we ought to\
endeavour to follow Narure and :fclibood, and principally to oblere\
the Rules of Perfpective; for who can doubt, that  standing, fitting\
of moving Figure, artfully painted, and placed as aforefaid, wll ao\
\
have the same Effect as the Life itfelf)\

Of Porirailure.\
 .\
Fience it follows, that low Herisons, or Points of Sight, are the beft\
and moft natural in  Portrait, and will moft deceive the Senfes, if the\
Light and Diflance, with respect to the Place where the Pitture is to\
be fet, be well obferved; otherwife the Effect will be contrary to what\
we expected.\
This Condult is chiefly necelfary in Portraits hanging high; for being\
to much above the Eye, they muft needs have  low Horizon. Butas\
Portraits are moveable, how natural and like foever they be, and well\
handled, if they hang not in proper Places, they will not have  good\
Effelt: Hence, the Mifchief attending them, is, that, by continually\
changing their Places, they cannot always be painted to  certain\
Height and Diftance, and confequently baffle our Rule:  Difficulty\
which the greateff Mafters muft Hruggle with, and this Branch of the\
Art is lable to.\
Having now thewn that  low Horizon and Point of Sight are beft,\
and moft natural, as fupplying, in fome meafure, this inconveniency\
how much muft they miltake, who always chuse an high Herizen? They.\
are on  Level with the Sitter, and yet place the Horizon many Feet\
higher; nay, they think, thofe who do otherwife all againlt Nature\
and Art: Some will have two Points of Sight in one Piece, one for\
the Figure, another for the Ornaments; one level with the Eye, and\
the other for the Offskip; one Hand higher or lower at pleature, or\
about  or  Fingers Breadth above the Middle. Alcho\'92 thele are in=\
excutable Errors, yet  think it vain to attempt their Redrels; but\
hope the judicious Artill will weigh what  have faid, and endeavour\
to avoid them.\
\
  AP. . Of Pertraits in Little.\
  are many Things, as  have formerly thewed, which,\
if we will have them tranfport the Senfes by their natural Re-\
prefentation, we muft always exhibit in their natural Proporti-\
on and Force of Colouring: But in  Portrait it is otherwife; for this\
may as well be done in Little as in full Proportion, provided the Dis\
minution be well obferved; and befides, it has some Relation to biffe.\

 But ics neverthelets certain, that in Feffoerns, Garlands, Flower.\
poes in Niches, Groups of Flowers, Coc. ferving for Ornament of\
Chambers, lirle Flowers are of fmall ccount; nay, never feen wore\
or embroidered in any Stuff: Whence, some may be induced to think,\
that  Portrair in Little, as big as the Paim of an Hland, has as litle\
Property in  Square againtt the Wall, espectally when it receives its\
Light from witheut the Frome, and is bandled with as much Force as the\
Life imjelf; which, with respelt to Force,  allow; nevertheless,  small\
Portrait may, in order to make it look more nacural, be more eafily\
helped, than fnall Flowers placed againft  Door, Window or other\
Flat; which, in my Opinion, can in no wife be made good; but \
small Portrail may, as . shall prove in what follows: In order to\

only, as if flanding in the Street. On the Sill of the Window\
were lying  Bortom of blue Worfed ftuck with Needles, alle\
 Pair of Sciffors,  Piece of dark bine Cloth, and  Thimble,\
all in full Proportion; to be thort, this Picture was by an Artifl,\
with the Owner' Leave, fentenced to be dockt; in order to which, he\
drew  Square Chalk-line round the Window, which contained the Doc-\
cor, and cut away all the reft round about it, hitting here an Head,\
there an Arm, without (paring any Body but the Doltor; who was in\
Rantly put into  fimaller Frame: Thus the Piece was half cut away,\
and for no other Reafon, as the Artift pretended, than that the Docior\
alone was fufficient to fatisfy the Eye, the reft being fuperfinous. \
wretched Fate for to good  Picture! But fome Painters will keep the\
old Read, becaute is difficult to cerrect  reoted Evil: They de asthe\
old Womandid, who, being exhorted in her laft Sickness to embrace the\
true Faith, antwered, She would follow the Steps of ber Fore-fathers,\
were they all gone to the Devil.\
So it is with  Portrait in Little, which has nothing of Nature, but\
the Features, and looks like  Puppec; whereas there are well-known\
Methodsto make it appear as big as the Life; nay, to move and fpeak, as\
 may fay; but, being llighted, the Figure feems immoveable, dumb and\
Little, and therefore unnatural.\
On this Footing,  mean to thew, that all Things may be naturally\
reprefented in Lttle, except  Moon light, which baffies all our\
Skill\
Now, if it be asked, Whether too nice an Exprestion of Parts in \
fmall Portrair, would not be fuperfiuous and unnatural, with respect to\
Diltance, and whether lets fimthing would not be better?  fay, No;\
provided it be not to flrong and warm as the Life; for the Figure not\
being exhibited in open Freld, it cannot have to much Miflinets and\
Vapour about it; and therefore the neat Fencilling cannor, be obftruc-\
tive; elpecially if managed with Skill, as, the principal Parts well\

 appears to plain, elaborate and neat! But  antwer, that they\
are not, nor can; becaute the Glats exhibits the Life without the Inter-\
potition of Miftiness or Vapours, and with firong and warm Shades,\
which overcome its Smallnels\
 have often wondered at fuch fmall Paintings, becaute they feemed\
as if  was looking in  Nuremberg Looking-glats, or thro'  Prospective;\
fince they appeared not like the Life, but little moving Puppers.\
Now, another Difficulty is, that, fince fuch Paintings cannot, ac-\
cording our Policion, be made good, without the Addition of some\
By-ornament, as lmagery in whole or half Figures, Vine-branches \
bout the Frame, or tomething lying on it, in order to sing them of, it\
would be hard for thofe, who canonly paint  whole or halffength Fi-\
gure, and ain at nothing elfe than to become Mafters therein; where\
as, he who is better verted, may, by  due Obfervance of what has\
been faid, eafily overcome the before mentioned Difficulties.\

 will not be foreign to our main Delign, to put the Artiff in mind\
of the Application and right Ule of luch Materials as may enrich \
Portrait, and make it look the more noble: This is to great \
Point in Portraiture, that when well Known, we need never be at \
Standthro' the Mishape or Defects we often meet with in the Dispoliti-\
on of  Portrait, and which fometimes mult not be hid; fince we have\
always Mieans enough for obviating them with feeming Reafon, and\
withour forcing Nature; as  long and narrow Face may be helped by an\
Hood, or other Head-drets;  thick and too round  Pace, by the con\
trary:  Figuretoo lonefome may be embellished with  Pillar, Pedettal,\
Flower-por, Table and fuch Things as are proper to it; which ferre\
not only for Ornament and Grandeur, but allo to express the Sitters\
Luffre and Virrue: But Care mult be taken, that the Figure of the Sit\
ter, as the principal Object of the Piece, fill up the major Part of it,\
either by  preading Sway of the Polture, or by the Addition of some\
proper By-work; by which Means it will have  good Effect.\

  Suring of Colours in Pourtraits comes now before us, \
Matter of as great Confequence as the former, and deferves no\
lets Attention\
Mlany think, tho' without Ground, that deep Red beft becomes \
red faced Perfon; deep Vellow  fallow one; and all pale Colours, \
pale one; and, whats frange, black and dark Colours,  fwarthy\
Perfon; but this muft be ridiculous and without Reafon, if we confi\
der, what aftrange Ordonuance thefe People would make: Truly, if\
the Art were fo, there would be no Difficulty in finding Agreeablenets.\
and every one would be able to difpofe it as it ought to be; and if\
this were  Becomingness, Variety would be no Art: Nay, the Fathion\
itself, which alters four Times  Vear, with respect to Colour, would\
not be allowed every body to wear; as in Spring; Green; in Sum-\
mer, Vellow; in Aummn, Red; and in Winter, Fillemot. Vellow\
or fallow-faced Perfons durft not wear Red; or red-faced ones,\
Green: Bt enough of this. \'97 Let us now return to what fober\
Art diltates\
Beginning with the Head and its Hair,  fay; that deep or frong\
Colours, luch as deep Red, deep Vellow, deep Blue, Coc. beft fit \
Perfen who has brown Hair.\
Thole who have fair Hair beft become half or weak Colours, fich\
as Purple, light Blue, Violer, Green and Rofe-colour.\
 yellow-haired Perfon beft becomes Violet, Blue and whitifh\
Fellow, as Mafficot, and fuch like; thefe are the chief Colours\
which  know. But here we mult obferve, that the lighter the Hair,\
the more weak the Drapery; and the darker the Hair, the fronger\
the Drels.\
He is  prudent Mafter who well knows how to express in his Pic\
ares the different Natures and Complexions of People; and to diflin\
guith Perfons full of Spirit and Fire from the Meck and Dead hearted;\
the Sickly and Weak from the Healthy and Strong; as to whom we\
may ule Draperies of the following Colours; With the Red or fiery\
fuir beft Draperies of half or broken Colours, with lirtle Red in them;\
the Pale fuits no Vellow, or other pale Colour; the Fallow the same;\
but Whice is very agreeable: Brown Complexions become no dark or\

  but White and all light Colours. The Blacks love White -\
bove any Colonr, and think no Dress better becomes them than  light\
coloured one; and not without Reafon; for would not  black Man\
with black or dark Cloaths be frightful to look ar? And how ridicu\
lous is it for  pale Virgin, to dress in all Sorts of light and pale\
Colours, in order to look lets pale; and that one who is red, wear\
nothing but Red for the fame Reafon: Hereby, inflead of hiding  rault, the Mafter would commit  greater; and yet this is the\
common Notion: But if  may give my Opinion,  red and fiery-faced\
Perfon, dred in Red, feems to me like  red painted Statue; and \
pale-looking Perfon in  light or yellow Dress, as fick or dead. Where\
fore, if we would be artful, we muft manage otherwife; to wit, that\
thofe, whom we would reprefent bealthy or fickly, ought to appear\
such by contrary Colours; as lively Colours for  fick or unhealthy Perfon;\
and weak and faint ones for healthy Perlons: Vet ler me not be here\
mifunderitood;  fay not this as  politive Law, without Exception,\
but as an Hint to Tyros. The more experienced Know, what the\
Art teaches; for the is not deficient: But as the Drapery sometimes\
over-rules, so we can manage the Naked accordingly; for inflance, red\
Drapery requires  middling Carnation, between pale and red; fo al-\
to it ought to be with  pale Colour. When  fay that Decorum confifts\
in an Oppesstion, it mult be underftood, that Oppesstion has its Degrees,\
which we ought to know and ufe according to the different Occations,\
and the Grounds againtt which they happen to come: But in general\
Terms, the Naked mult always feem to be of  diftinel Nature from\
the Draperies.\
   . ViIl. Of the Imitation of great Mafters in painting\
Pertraits; and of copying their Pittures in general.\
\
  we leave the Subject of Porrraiture,  think this Hegd ne\
 celfary to be treated of, and therefore shall thew how far and jh\
what Manner we may engage in it; and fubjoin fomewhar of\
copying Pictures in the fame Bignels, as well as in different Sizes.\
 find that this imitation of Mafters is less oblerved in their Deligh\
and Ordonnance, than in the Colouring, Lights and Shades; This is\
certainly  principal Pont in  Picture, becaute there tan be he Dect.\
rum without it; ay; we find fome Works of lmall Mafters in this Par\
No.  VII.\
Of Portraiture.\
 tolerably fuccetsful; tho' they know not, how they got the\
Knowledge, it happening moftly by Chance: They are charmed\
with some fine and taking Colours in this or that great Mafter; thefe\
they ule at random in their own Productions, either forwards or in the\
Depth, Middle or Sides; and if they happen to be placed againtt \
proper Ground, or are fer off by any aiding By-colour, the Work his\
right, in farisfying both the Eye, and Rules of Art; but if thefe\
fine Colours happen not to fuit the Grounds, then all is wrong, and\
the Arriff at  fland.\
To explain this Point, we shall be more particular, and clear it by\
Examples; tho'  think  have already in this Book fpoken largely\
enough of it, in treating of Back-grounds and the Harmony of Co-\
lours in  Portrait.  certain Arcift having feen  very beautiful\
whice and green Lace on  young Lady' Gown, painted by  great\
Mafter, he mull by all means imitate it; butbeing asked, Whether\
he had taken due Notice of the Groundcolour of the Gown! he\
antwered, \'97 No. \'97 How then can this fine and becoming Lace\
have  good Effect in his Works, unless by chance? The Reafon of\
which is,  think, that either through Shame or Pride, or both, the\
Arciff takes fomething from  great Mafter; for Inftance, what he\
uted in the Lointain, the other, that it may not be Known, brings\
forward; and what he has reprefented in the open Air, the other\
 poor Method of Concealment, fince\
\
contrives in  dark Room.\
by  right Application the Thefe would be lawful! But tis fuch Mens\
Misfortune, to be, in this Particular, moft out of the way, when they\
think they do beft: For, wanting the great Malters Wit, Judgment\
and Apprehention, they have no true Notion of his Conduct, and\
therefore are eafily mifted, and, like KJop\'92 Raven, expoted to Cen\
fure.\
Since Tis an undoubted Truch, that we can perform nothing but\
what paffes through Thought, and of which, either by feeing of\
hearing, we get an Idea; therefore muft the Paintings, Drawings and\
fine Prints of old Mafters give an Handle to Thoughts and Praltice;\
for he who never faw  Lion can never paint him well, unless by\
the Help of  Draught, or Model: As was the Cafe of  certain Weft\
pbaliss, who reprefenting Duniel in the Lion' Den, and having never\
leen  Lion, he painted Hogs inflead of Lions, and wrote underneath,\
- Be this  Fable or Truth, it howe\
These hould be Lions.\

no Idea; nay, if we have feen the Objects, and made no Sketches of\
Models\

\
Of Portrailure.\
Chap.  of them, we shall never exhibit them naturally ; fince Memo-\
ry is but the Repofitory of Knowledge and Thoughts, from which\
they draw the Things which Judgment effeems ufeful and service-\
able.\
Iam of Opinion, that two great Advantages arife from copying\
great Malters Works: The one is, that therein we fee many Defelts\
of fimple Nature corrected by their Skill and judgment; and the other,\
that by this means we accuftom ourfelves to rectify thofe Defells.\
when we have Nature before us: Truly two Points of great im-\
Portance.\
But alasl is an Artiff, confidered in his natural inclination, other\
wife than  Child, which, advancing in Age, follows its impulfe? If\
he perform one praife-worthy Act, how many Errors will he contrari-\
ly commit? But when this Bent is condulted by Reafon and Art, the\
Perceptions of the Mind will then, as thro'  clear Channel, flow\
pure and undefiled: Which leads me in some meafure to confels, that\
Art and Praltice have great Advantages, and are more to be fer by\
than all we receive from Narure, which is often defective in defired\
Perfection, in  fingle Object: But the is perfect in her Performances\
and Objects in general; and, in that Senfe, Art is obliged to follow\
her; wherefore, with the Philolopher,  mult fay of Arcifts\
Natura incipit, Ars dirigit, Experientia decet.\
That is,\
Nature points out the Way, which Arts improve,\
And settlel Prattice makes  Pifture move.\
Heace we may eafily perceive what we should do to cure this great\
Defelt of the Mifule of other Mien' Works; but, that  may be the\
better underffood,  shall infiff on further Means for doing it: If then\
it happen, that the Arriff meet with any thing which is very taking,\
and he be defirous to make it his own, whether fine Colours, Drapery,\
Stone, Coc. Let him take Notes, in his Pocket book, of the Ground, By-\
colours and other incidents, as what there is about luch or fuch Colour.\
and againft what Ground, and whether it be rong or weak; and of\
What Colour the Objects be, and whether the warm or weak Colour\
be in the Diftance or forwards, difagreeing or not; as in the Chapter.\
Of the Harmony of Colours is thewed. We mult allo contider;; whe\

 and Windris; as is more largely taught in the Book of Lights\
and Sbades, and which  repeat here, becaute  think Face-painters\
frequently aft contrarily, in feeing  faint yet fine Drapery reprefent-\
ed witkin-deors, which, with the fame Tint, they exhibit in an open\
Air.\
The like heedles Miftake we fee in the Copies of many Dilciples\
and young Matters after old or modern Paintings; for, not obferving\
whether in lettening their Copies (which they generally do) they\
should not aHfo abare in Strength of Colour and Tints, their Colouring,\
as well in Light as Shade is as flrong as the Original. The same Er-\
for they commit in painting  great Copy after  fmall Original. But\
this ill Conduct is owing chiefir to Mafters when they fet their Pupils\
to copy in  different Size, in not admonithing them of it; but rather\
defiring that ther shall imtate every thing as exactly as poffible tho'\
in falt it be againtt the Rules of Arc. Tis therefore certain, that \
Picture with Figures, or  Landskin, fuppole it as big as the Life, to\
be copied  third fots in Size, the Tints in the Copy mult needs be \
third jainter than the Original; and the more it lesfens in Size, the\
finter the Tints, or elfe it cannor be good. If this Conduct be of fuch\
Moment in copying Pictures, of how much greater Confequence mult\
It be, when  Portrait-painter diminithes the Life, or paints  Portrait\
in full Proportion from  small one, with respect to the weakening or\
Hrengthening of Colours.\
Alcho\'92 irs commendable to follow great Mafters in general, yet irs to dwell upon tome of their Particulars, as an Ornament, Un,\
Vafe, Term, Coc. withour friving at fomething new. We think, that what\
ther have done is enough for our Practice; but this is Weakness;\
fince Are and Nature have fuch  Fund of Objects, and our Time for\
hearning and living is long enough, and by confulting within ourfelves\
we may (pir our Genins.\
Others commit the fame Fault by  contrary Impulfe; for to vio-\
lent is their inclination to some particular great Mafter in his Objects,\
Colouring, Cor. that they think in loff Time to employ their Thoughts\
on the Works of any other good rriff; and being thus wedded to\
him, they with, drudge and plod to be like him as well in Errors as\
Perfections: By this means, and by  puntual Imitation of Blunders\
and Miftakes, it fometimes happens, that the Copy and the Original\
are not to be diffinguithed, both being to wonderfully like each other;\

Chep.  may at firft ute himself to  good Manner of Deligning.\
which he ought to be Mafter of, before he takes to Painting, and to\
underfland this well before he proceeds to make Ordonnances; and\
then, if he have  thorough Knowledge of the latter, he will paint\
 good Picture. Vet Tis often feen, that his Work is but taken\
for that of  Pupil, nay, worle than  Copy; and what, is fill lets,\
its not like his own Manner or Handling, \'97 And why?\
Such Artifts, being advanced thus far, endeavouring to produce their\
own inventions, no longer minding Grounds and Rules, but Rriving\
only at Novelties, care little for painting or deligning well; whence\
their Works are oftentimes indifferencly defigned, poorly handled\
and coloured, but well ordered; arifing only from  Neglect of\
their Mafters Infiractions, and what they Know, and an tich for\
what they fill want to know; whereby they are often shipwrecked be-\
tween both: Pernicious Effect of the Bent of our Vouth! which can-\
not be remedied otherwife than by returning to original Principles and\
their putting in Ufe: Forasbyan Excels in loading Weight upon Weight\
on  weak and unfertled, tho' well-laid Foundation, the whole Building\

\
not to infiff on all its Advantages, or to give  Syfiem\

\
calls for Homer or Virgils Eloquence; and having been\
copioutly handled by feveral learned Pens, we shall treat no further\
of it than what concerns  Painter, leaving the reft to Architects.\
An ingenious Hiffory-painter, if he would be univerfal, muft needs\
underfland Archicecture and Statuary; becaufe he will otherwife be at\
 Nonplus in fome Things; he ought even to be as knowing as an\
Archirect, and how to order  good Building, tho' is an Archifects\

Proof that nothing in the World is permanent and ftablel\
But to come to our Purpofe, we mult premife that the Word (Arobi.\
telture) timply figaities Draughts or Designs, after which,  Building is\
carried up and conttructed; and comprehends the five following Orders,\
namely, The Tufcan, Deric, lonic, Roman and Corinthian; according\
to which, all Buildings are regulared, whether Pulaces, Temples, Town-\
houses, Triumphatarches, Bagnios, Theatres, Toungates, Galleries,\
Tombs, and other magnificent Buldings, round or (quare, or both;\
peak of their ourward Contiruction. The Word Order is of large Ex-\
rent; but in Architelture is, as Vitravius defines it,  joining of different,\
proportionate and fimmetric Parts, as Pedeftals, Columns and their Or-\
naments, in fuch Manner as to compofe  perfelt Order and Body.\
As for the Entablatures over Columns, to wit, Architraves, Frises\
and Cornices (which for their Richnels have got the Name of Orna-\
ments) they may, as little as the Orders themfelves, be either mixed \
mong one other, or changed from one Order to another.  careful Paint\
or will not only diltinguith one fort from another, from Cornice to Bafe;\

Sorts of Buildings, but ought to to be applied (relpecting their Parts and\
Ornaments, which alfo difter in general from each other) as to have an\
Harmony and Agreement with the whole Buildings, with respect to\
their Situation and Quality.\
Thele Orders mult be eariched in their feveral Kinds, to thew  fuit=\

throughout plain and fimple: The Doric Order excels in its Irighphs\
and Metopes : The lonic in its Volates, Modillions, &cc. The Roman\

Dithes, Hammers, Axes, Knives, Coc.\
Among the Works of the Ancients we fee in the Frizes of the Lonie,\
Remus and Corinthian Orders (efpecially in the two laft) some Foliage\
of Oak-leares; which has  fine Elfect, when rwined with Shrubs and\
Vine-branches, interfperted with Rofes and other Flowers. Sometimes\
are incroduced Vizards, with playing Children and running Ani\

Know more sorts of frizal Ornaments, mull confult the Works  of the\
Ancients, in which he will find them, tho' the before mentioned are\
the Principal, and most in Ule.\
Altho\'92' the Ancients reach, chatthe Frents of Buildings (which are\
the Parts moll in View) ought to be more adorned than the Flinks and\
Rears, ver fome modern Mafters have mifunderffood this, and appie\
hended, as if in thofe Parts the Ornaments could not be too many; nat,\
they have crowded the Mouldings of the Architrave, Frize and Cor\

 Manner, that it rathercaufes Confution than Ornament, as appearsby\

CHAP. II. Of the Rifes of the Ornaments, Columns and their\
Pedeftals.\
 VIN  fpoken in the former Chapter, of the Decoration of\
 the Orders, we shall now, in  brief Manner, treat of the Rifes\
and Divitions of the Columns, with their Ornaments and Pedeftals:\
The Ornament (or Entablature) of the Tuscan Column rifes  Module\
Parts of  Module (by Modale is meant, throughout the Orders, the\
Pillars Distmecer next above the Bafe.) The Column, with its Bafe and\
Capital rifes  Modules\'bd, and the Pedeftal  Module?: This being\
agreed, the Entablature and Pedeftal are each? of the Columns Rife;\
the Bafe under the Column, and Capital over it, are each in Rife; \
Module; the leffening (or Diminution) of the Shaft of the Column as\
the Neck under the Capital is  of  Module, and it begins below at \'bd\
of the Column' Rife.\
The Entablature of the Deric Column rifes  Modules ; the Co-\
luma, with its Bafe and Capital, is  Modalesj; and the Pedeftal  This being fixed, the Entablature is  and the Pedeftal  Lofithe Cohnrs Rife. The Bafe and Capital are each, as in the\
Tusros,   Module. The Diminution at the Neck of the Shafr, is:. of\

The Entablature of the Lonit Colums rifes  Module \'bd; the Co.\
lumn, with its Bafe and Capital, is  Modules;, and the Pedefal\
 Modules : This ferrled, the Entablature is; and the Pedeftalz\
Parts; of the Column\'92 Rife. (But if the Frize, be caryed, the Entabla-\
ture is  Parts  of the Column' Rife, and in the following Orders the\
fame.) The Capital with its Volures, is little more thani  Module,\
and the Bale is juft half  Module (and in the following Orders the\
Lame.) The Diminurion ar Neck is  of  Module, and begins below at\
 Partsf of the Column\'92 Rife divided into  Parts, as aforefaid.\
The Entablacure of the Romon Colams, riles  Module  Parts of\
 Module; the Column, with iis Bafe and Capital, is Modules;;\
the Pedefial rifes  Modules: Which laid down, the Entablature is:,\
and the Pedeftal  Parts; of the Column\'92 Rife; the Capital rifes  ; the Bale as before; the Diminution at Neck is : of  Mo.\

the Diminution at Neck isf of  Module, and begins below at: of\

The Breadch of the Talcas and Doric Pedeffals ought always to be\
equal with the Plinths or Bates of their Columns; and tho' the Plinths\
in the three other Orders project more at their Bortoms, by Reafon of\
their Sweeps, their Pedettals muft nevertheless be alike perpendicular\
with the upper Points of their Plinths.\
Let me here ix the Height of  Statue on  Pedeial placed next  fince many mistake in it. In right Proportion it ought not to\
rife higher thant of the Column; but then the Column should not be\
too high, or too low, but flandon  Bafe only, which is frequencly con\
finned thro' the Building. As for Pedeftals, they ferve only to raife \
Column, and angment its Ornament. Weought allo; for Elegance, to\
take care, that the Figure and its Pedeftal be proportionate to each\
other; becaute, if the latter be too great or too small, the Figure would\
become too small, or monfirous\

   . III. Of the Property of  Building, and Observations\
thereon.\
MU ST believe, according to the Evidence of Writers, and the\
Tradition of Travellers, that the Iralians have the beft Talte, as\
well for Archicecture as Painting; and tho' its certain, that Ger-\
many, France, England, Holland, and other Countries have produced\
fine Archicelts, yet at this Time they are not comparable to the Irati-\
ans, whofe Manner, which is the Antique, is now followed by the\
moll polite Nations. The old Tare was known by the Name of the\
Gothir, as  certain Writer affirms, faying; That the Gothic Manner\
of Building of the ancient Germons (which at that Time gave Law\
 to all other Nations) is quite abolithed by the Ialians Nay, he cries\
out, What magnificent and choice Wonders do we not fee\
in proud Ialy, lofty Rome especially, where it feems as if Nature\
and Art have mutually agreed to eftablith their Thrones, and exert\
 their Powers, in order to make this famous City the Miflress of the\
World, and the Beauty of the Univerle! St. Peter' Church, the\
Vatican, the Retanda, and many other Structures (ferving the whole\
World for Examples, and without which, Archicecture is but  con-\
fuled Mass) draw yearly thoulands of People and young Artifls thi\
:ther to improve themielves by them, for the Service of their own\
Countries; to that the finell and newelf Things which we fee in thofe\
Countries, lately builc, and still going forward, are deligned in the\
Nalian Gulfo. Wherefore it is to them that thofe fine Piles, the\
Stadthoule at Amferdam, the new Lutheran Church, and divers other\
Structures, as well without as within the Town, do owe their Origin\
and Beauty.\
We are then much indebted to thofe great Artifts, Fitrurins, Sertio,\
Philibert de POrme, Pulladie, Cataneo, Lee Baptifa Santeririe, Vigno-\
 Scamezsi, and many others, who have enlightened the World\
with their Works and Wricings. And  think, that no one can be \

 VIII\
We shall now freak of intire Buildings to far as they ferve for Or-\
nament in Painting. The Goodness of  Building fprings not meerly\
from the aforefaid Rifes, Breadths or Depths of the Orders, but from\
an appofite Conjunction (or bringing together) of different proportionace\
Parts into an exquifite Body, which, by reafon of its excellent Form,\
whether in Height or Breadch, appears to the Judgment of the Know.\
ing, both admirable and beautiful; especially, when firly adapted to\
the Quality of the Owner, and has general Conveniency with respect\
to Culom\
In its particular Parts  Building requires,   firm Foundation.\
  large and convenient Stair cafc.   pacious Entrance.  An\
elegant Divition of Doors, Windows and other Openings. . An\
handlome Fronciffiece, csc. Thefe skilfully work\'92, and judicioutly\
dilpofed muft needs produce  fine Effect.\
Thus much for the outward Face of  Building.\
If ant object, that Decorum confifts more in inward Contrivance;\
let me luppoie  Stranger to come into  Town, and, paffing thro' the\
Streets, he were asked, what he thought of the Buildings? What\
Anfwer would he make? Would he not fay they were either fine or\
mean? Or would he tay, \'97  muft firft fee the infides, and whether\
the Foundations be firm, the Apartments well-dispoted and well-light\
ed, and whether the Underground offices be good? - This would\
be ridiculous: Tis true, an Houfe mull have thefe Properties; but tis\
idle to think, that therefore we cannot judge of the Building by the\
Ourfide only; as if the Perfon, who is able to give  Delign for \
Fabrick, cannot allo compart its intide. Let it be asked then, Where\
in confifts  good Divition within? Whether tis  Scrence which Paint\
ers know nor ? Whether there mult be  fixed Number of Halls and\
Apartments of  determinate Form, Length, Rife, and Breadth, and\
what thote muff be? Whether there muft be one, two, or more Stacks\
of Stairs? Whether each Room muft have one Chimney or two:\
And whether the Floors muft be Wooden or Stone ? Or whether  Pa-\
lace is, for its Largenets, more beautiful than  common of Citizens\
Houle?\
But, waving other Mea' Opinions, we shall proceed in our Purpole,\
to far as concerns  Painter in thefe Countries, and no further: Our\
Judgment is, that the bed Proportion in  Building is one chird higher\
in Rife than Breadth, especially if it be covered in with  Compats\
roof and its Appurtenances; but if flat-roofed,  third wider than high,\
and to be commanded by  fingle Order riting from Bottoon to Top:\
 Archifecture.\
 .\
 would be improper to sdom them with Statues; Batsrelicts.\
Feftoons,  For fuch heavy and clole Strultures, without Weight,.\
and moreover open on. top, are proper for an Amphitheatre,\
but not for  Temple of Palace;  ipeak with respect to Cullom and\
Decorum, which mult always go together; fince nothing is beau-\
tiful without its natural Qualities The Cafe is, as  Woman in  Mans\
Habit, and the contrary; or  Water-vafe adorned with an Olive-branch.\
and Thunder; of an Oil-velfel, with Tritons and Dolphins.\
in painting  good Building there mult appear, befides the Archi-\
telture, Perlpetuve and Colouring, an orderly Disposition producing\
Elegance, otherwife ris of no Worth. Orderly Difpofition confifts in\
to joining the Parts, that they mutually fer off each other in  pleasing\
Variety, and thereby exhibic  fine Piece of Work, and an agreeable\
Figure: This Variety fprings from the Incqualiry of Openings, or\
Windows, whether Oblongs, Squares, Circles or Ovals; the Dispolici-\
ons of thefe Ovenings, near and over each other, are founded on Reafon,\
as shall be explained by an Example.\
We exhibr in Plate LIX.  Temple topp\'92 with  Cupols, or ras\
ther an Houfe round -roofed. On each side of the Door  Flight of\
Steps defcend balluftraded; underneath which, is  Vault; and over\
the Entrance,  Balcony: Now, beginning from below, we shall thew,\
what Figure each Opening ought to have in an orderly Difposicion.\
The Door under the Steps is (quare, rifing fomewhat more than ins\
Diameter: That of the Entrance is circular on Top, and riles; more\
than its Dismeter: That of the Balcony allo riles  more than its\
Breadsh, but is (quare or flat on Top; and then we meet the Roof\
rounding again. Now let us difpofe it otherwife, and make the Door\
below circular, the next square, the next round; and no Roof appearing.\
+\
Thus much for Doors; for we find no other than round and iquare ones.\
The fame Method may be taken with Windows. When there ase two.\
Ranges one above the other, the undermoll may be oblong and the up\
permoff compass, but lower; if there be another Range of Windowsa.\
bove thefe, next the Roof, they ought to be perfect Squares. This\
Rule we have taken from the Works of the Ancients, who always\
gave their Openings or Windows more Rife in the firft Story than the\
second, sill leffening in the third, yer all alike in Diameter. Win.\
dows should never be lower than about  Feet from the Floor within.\
If there be Windows in the Bafement-ffory, (where the Walling is\
thickeff, and is ufually finished with  Rafic Order) they mull be\
Square, and above either Scheme (little rounding) or flat; and thus\
the\
\
\
Of Architetture.\
 VIII\
the one thews the other, with respect to Roundacts and Squarencts. If\
now there were Compass-windows in the Bafement and upper Stories,\
the uppermoff should be circular, and the undermoff oval, with their\
longeft Diameter parallel with the Level of the Building, becaule, be-\
ing proffed by Weight, their Arch is dilared; when contrarily the\
athers do not bear any Weight But circular Windows are grown\
out of Ufe, as not admitting Light to well as the (quare ones.\
If in the Piers berween iI indows there were Niches and Figures in\
them, and over head, room for  Baisrelief, then the Table for it\
muft be (quarg; but circular, where tis over  Square Window.\
As for Doors over each other,  fay; that if there were over\
the Cornice  Compats-pediment, and on both Sides  Bullultrade\
with Figures; then the Balcony-door ought not to be circular, but\
Square, and ornamented with Pilaffers: Ver the Door of the En\
france may be circular. We ought even not to fer on the Balcony  with Figures, but ornament it with Balls or other low\
Things. The one of other Balluttrade mult be allo diverfified; for\
two Parts alike, in two fuch emment Places, have an ill Effect;\
wherefore one of them should be clofe walled (Parapet-wife) and\
the Face of it may then be enriched with Bals-reliefs of Figures, Fef\
\
TOORS, :.\
 think what  have faid  fufficient Guide for other Kinds of Build\
ings; for thefe Obfervations are on all Occafions unalterable to  Paint\
er, with respect to agreeable Difpolicion.\
There is Hill fomewhar behind, which, tho' contrary to the Dispo-\
firion aforelaid, muit be animadverted; tis touching  Flower -garden,\
which, if fine, mull needs be regular, as well with respect to its gene-\
fal Form, as its particular Divition, at leaft the two Sides ought to be\
alike, whether fer off with Pots, Vafes, Starues or other Ornaments.\
We are taught indeed, that Uniformity is fliff, and not Painterlike;\
wherefore we should avoid it as much as poffible: But, weighing the Pre-\
cept maturely, we shall find the Fault to lie in our Milapprehention of it:\
Onellionlets Things proceeding from Rule and Order muft be regular,\
but that Regulariry may nevertheless be fomewhar hidden on occafion:\
Wherefore, tho'  Garden be uniform on both Sides, we are under no\
Necefficy of shewing all that Uniformity; one Side is fufficient; the\
reft may be handfomely hid, or broke with  Tree, Piece of Stone\
work, Column, or  Corner of the Houfe But let us not from hence\
abfolucely conclude, regular Objects to be unneceffary in an Ordon\

 for they fometinfes: furnith all the Decorum of  Picture;\
pet if\
we fee but  Part of them, we may conceive the Refidue.\
More Examples of breaking Uniformity may be thefe: When \
Figure flands on each Side of  Gate or Alcove,  Man may be pix\
ced or fit down before one of them, in order to create Inequality; to\
alfo if by means of  Curtain, one of thefe Figures be shaded. If \
Balsrelief be fet on each side of the Gate, of Alcove, one of them\
may partly be covered by the Perfonages, to anfwer our Purpofe. If\
without doors on both sides of an Entrance, there be  carved Lion\
or Sphinx, we may break off one of their Heads. Solomon' Throne\
was adorned with  golden Lions; we need not fee them all; the fix\
on one Side thew-fufficiently, that there muff be as many on the other:\
two of three, entire are enough, of the reft we may fee only  Part;\
here and there. Thus we mull always manage in like Cafes.\

CHRP. IV. Of the matching of the various-celoured Marbles, as well\
without as within  Building; with the Management of Tembs, Vafa\
and Racchanalian Terms.\
BJ     have  fine Effeet, when Nature and Art are jeised\
 together by  skilful Hand; and tho' all Kyes are not alike qua-\
lifed to apprehend the Reafons of it, yet they are, by  wont\
derful Sagacity, lentible of it; confelting, that it is beautiful, and fo\
ought to be, tho' the one Perfon, as  fay, underfland it, and the other\
de not: And for this Reafon; Art has luch  Power, that tho' Narure\
be beautiful in her Productions, yet they would not perfectly pleafe pun\
Eyes, without the Help of Art..\
Nature produces an intinity of fine Stones of various Colours and\
Qualities; but Art alone judges of their Firness and orderly Location,\
as to Rank and Dignity; infomuch that, tho' igaorant in Art,. we. can\
clearly apprehend, that it qught so be fo, and no otherwife..\
We know, that the Whirars foff and tender, and lovely to the Eye;\
the Black contranly. is melanchaly and difagreeable.\
We place they\
the Blackamong the Red, and upon the Red, Whife. Thele three colour-\
ed Stones are Capitals, and cannot be otherwife difpoted as to their Na=\
tures and Qualities, without forcing Nature, and running counter. to\
Art.\

However, their Rank and Application in rchicellonk Wfe may be\
thefe.\
in the Tufcas Order, as undermoft, black Marble.\
Inthe Derit, Grees.\
\
in the lenic, Tellew.\
 in the Roman, Red. And,\
in the Cerinthian, White.\
If any ask, why the Red is not fet before the Fellow, fince the Red\
is in its Narure darker than the Vellow? Lanfwer, That tis, becaute the\
Red and Green are Oppofers in Strength; contrarily, Vellow is proper\
to Green, fince Vellow and Blse produce Green.\
If arany Time we are obliged to place, besween two Stones of ore\
Colour,  Stone of another, the following Mixtures are moftly in\
wic.\
Between two black Marbles fuit beft Jafper, Copper of Brats.\
Between two Serpentine, or green marble Stones, the same.\
Between two red Stones, Whire.\
Between red, black or ferpentine Scone, Pifan whice exed Marble.\
Between two grey Stones, Free-fone or yellowiff-white Marble.\
Between two docted long veiny Stone, one that is speckled; and\
the contrary.\
Bcweentwo Jafpers, yellow, or ffethy whice Marble.\
 Marble painter muft oblerve the Conveniency and Place for marbling:\
If the Place be large, or an Hall, then he may do it with Force;\
but in  fmaller Compass, he ought to moderate it, and keep it faint,\
that the Place may not feem thereby leffened, or the Eye offended If\
the Room be hiing with Piltures, he should confult Men of Experience,\
especially the Matter who painted them, what Colouring will fir bet.\
About light Pictures, dark Marble is beft, and about dark Pictures,\
Light Marble, as Pifun, Jafperor any tending to  light Vellow. But if\
it be  fingle Colour, fuch as Bafsreliefs, then Free ffone fuits beft.\
In bringing many Sorts of coloured Marbles together, we may, for\
Inftance, in  Froarispiere either fingle or double colonaded and pedeltal-\
ed, very agreeably dispote them thus: Vide Phire LX.. The Bale\
and Pedeftal mouldings may be Black, liticcyed; the Block, or Square\
of the Pedeftals, dark Red, much dotced, lets veined; the Plinths of\
the Columns and Pilafters may be White; the Columns, light Red,\
of Pisen Marble wich large white eyed Veins, on bech. Sides the eying\
to bealike; the Pilafters alfo light Red, moderately eyed; the Capr\
cals; Whice; the Architrave, Black, like the Bafe and Mouldings of\
the\
\
\
\
Of Archiletture.\
  Pedeftals; the Frize may be dark Red, like the Blocks or Squares\
of the Pedettals; and the Cornice, Black again, like the Architrave;\
if the Frize have raited Ornaments of Foliage, Children, Triglyphs,\
Ox-fculls, Coc. they ought to be White; if over the Cornice be  Pa-\
rapet, it may be intirely of another Colour, and the Pedeltals and\
their Members of Pisan or other cross-veined Marble, and the Pannels\
or Faces of grey Marble, or White, if adorned with Bats relicts; the\
Figures, or Vales on top allo Whice.\
This Diftribution may be doubled, and varied on Occafion: The\
Frizes and Columns may be White; the Bafes and Capitals, Gold;\
and to may alfo the Ornaments be, to wit, Triglyphs, little Blocks\
and Foliage; the reft may remain as before.\
In an Hall of red or other Marble (where the Mouldings of the\
Ornaments are different, larger or finaller) we may make  Door-fron-\
tispiece, or Alcove, of white or other Marble; but if the Members\
continue along the Hall, the Froncilpiece or Alcove ought to be of\
the same Colour with the Room: The Room may be of one Order.\
and the Frontifpiece, Alcove and Chimney of another: Thus the\
Corinthian or Roman. The Pave-\
Room may be fonic, and the reft,\
ment of the Floor mult correspond\
with the Building;  mean, if the\
Room have Pilafters, the Bands (or bordering Marbles tying the\
Pavement) muff run up to them, whether the Pilaffers sland wide or\
clofe; for they ought to be to laid, as to thew every where  Regula-\
rity, wharever Jets or Breaks the Door, Frontifpiece, Alcove, Coc.\
may occation; as  prudent Gardiner difpoles his Parterres, one round,\
another (quare, octangular, Coc. always contriving fuch an Uniformity\
as clofes with the Borders. In the middle of the Hall may be incrodu-\
ced such Figures or Compartments, as beil anfwer the general Purpofe,\
and they may be of what Colour you pleafe.\
in Chambers or Gatferies, where the Sides are unlike, we are oblig-\
ed to part them by fome Figure coming between; and yer the Bands,\
which bind the sides, mult come every where alike. If there he Co-\
lumns on both Sides of the Gallery, the Bands muft run, crofting it,\
from one to the other.\
Proceed we now to party-coloured Tombs, and other Stones. On\
white Sphinxes, Lionelles, Coc. fuits well  Tomb of Serpentine or\
Porphyry; and on  black Plinth, if no Figures or other Ornaments\
Tupport iI, Porphyry allo looks well. On Brackets of Copper or\
Brats, the Tomb may be of black Marble. With Graveffones or \
ther blwith Stone, agrees well violet-colour Stone, or Porphyry, Cop\
No.  Architecture.\

per or Brass. Note here, that the Black muft always be undermoff,\
especially when divers Sorts of Colours are placed on one another, as\
we have thewed in the Orders.\
Great  /es and Orns are always of the fame Stone as their Bafes,\
a well in Niches as on Pedeftals; if on Pedeftals, the Bafes ought to\
projell equal with the Blocks precitely.\
The Pringusfermsanciently ufed in the Bacchanalia, were moftly\

Carriage from Place to Place, whicher the Gang of Satyrs, Fauni and\
Bacchanils determined to go Having pirched on  Place for their Star,\
they fixed it in the Ground, by means of the Point aforefaid. Their\
Terms were fomerimes painted of  Brick-colour, fometimes allo\
Thire; about the Mourh and Breaff they were fmeared with blue\
Grapes.\
The Pois, or Guides called Hermes, were huge and immoreable,\
and of whice Stone, fer on rude Heaps of Stone, in order to be con\
fpicuous to Travellers ar  Diltance for which reafon they were allo\

\
  Beautr in painting Buildings confifts in an elegant Expret\
fion of the Difference of Stones which compofe them; and ths\
may be effeted not only by their Divition, but allo by their\
Colours, especially in Outffe-xert, which is not to much heeded as\
the Ixeard, and is subject to more inconveniencies of Ran, Hail and\
If ind; and if tlanding in damp Places, their Ettect in  few Vears :\
libly appears, if the Stones be not very hard, by the droppinz of\
Mouldings and Projectures in leveral Parts.\
Fountains must be suppoled to tuffer much, and become very moff\
by being dropped on; and to do Tumbs and Gravesiones: But prit\
cipally Pyramds, which are not fer up to much for the take of\
their polithed Bodies, as for their Forms and huge Bulk; wherefor\
is no great Matter, whether the Stones of thefe be of one for\
of Colour, of not; they are often feen of many Sorts of Stok,\
tome as they have been found, and others changed thro' Tike:\
Vet the Comen: fusters molt, by being eat up; whereby the Store\

  and muft needs drop. Again, some Stones, being more weak\
and brittle than others, and corroded by the Air, Dampnels and\
Drought, are broke in Picces by the Preffure of thofe over them,\
and thus leave Gaps and Breaks, wherein the Rain gatker:, out\
of which grow Weeds, Mots and other Greens, fomctimes whole\
Branches; all which, at the Vear' End, decay, and become green\
Sap, trickling thence down the Stones.\
We shall here flop  little to lay tomething touching   know\
not how some can to far relif Slovenlinets, as to (poil not only Stalues\
and fine Firares, but allo intire Buildings; if they were broken or\
mouldered Pieces, Ruins and other decayed Stones, it would be nn Da-\
mage if ever to much muddled and bedropped; but tis very impro-\
per to ferve intire and fine Figures thus, and in Places too where are\
neither Trees, or any thing elfe to occafion it: The fame they do in\
Buildings looking as freth as at tirll; were the Spots, feen on them, na-\
cural to the Stones, it would be more proper than all the Gutters\
nfually reprefented to trickle down them: Wherefore Care mull be\
taken, before we begin to paint Tkings supposed to be dropped on, that\
 Difference may appear between Nearnels and Diltance; for as Spots\
in Cloaths are more vifible near than afar off, to the Faintness of re-\
mote Objects mult be obferved. But let me ask, what Foulness of\
Wet and Dult can flick to fmooth Bodies, which Rain, Hail, of\
Snow do not wath off? But they may decay and be confumed by Time;\
especially thole facing the North, which futter all Extremities. We\
fee many Inftances of Decay in ancient Buildings, where are Figures fo\
eaten up by Time, that tis hardly difcernable, whether they repre\
fented Men or Women; like Figures of Snow partly diffolved by the\
Sun-beains.\
 peak not here to much againt the dropping upon and muddling\
such Objects, as of the Abuie when the Caufe of luch an Effect does\
not appear; for without  probable Reafon why  Thing should be\
thus, or thus, Art becomes Obllinacy. But to recurn to our subject.\
It is certainly Praife-worthy to take fome Pains in thewing the\
Stones of Buildings, and their veining and eyeing, when they are judi-\
cioully and agreeably difpoted, according to Rule:  fay it is commend.\
able to him who underflands Perspective.\
The Parts of Buildings witein (which are not to subject to the Teeth\
of Time) are not foapt to decay as thole without; the Cementallo latis\
longer, which makes them keep clean and intire, their Joints to seem\
almoll invitible, and the whole to be as one Stone: For this Reafon\
 Architedure.\
 VIII\
we muft aroid the Mistakes of some Painters, who vein and eye their\
Work, and afterwards divide it into Stones, whereby one Vein or Eye\
happens offentimes to run through two or three Stones at once; whence\
we muft conclude it to be what it is, meer Painting and not the Life:\
Whereas,  think it the moll certain Way, firft to divide the Work\
into Stones, and then to marble and eye them; obferving that each\
Stone have  particular Eye, to thew the Difference between the casusl\
Drepfing and the Maibling.\
Marble Buillings have  beautiful Effect when the Architecture is\
fine and well ornamented; and this as well in Painting as the Life:\
Orderly Dispofition is one of the belt Reafons thereof, without which\
it cannot have that vall Agreeablencts.\
 knowing Archrell takes especial Care of the fetting the Stones\
of his Building in fuch Manner as to blazon its Beauty, and improve\
it, and thereby creare Harmony; wherefore he dispofes the Eyeveny\
Stones in the properel Manner; jfor Inftance, in  fingle-colonaded Pory.\
co, the reing Ezes mu? oppose euch other, floping from out to in; or\
contrary: The same Method muft be obferved in the Pitaffers, and all\
Parts that are paired; to that the Work may appear regular at  Di.\
ftance, taking especial Care that they be eyed ante, to keep the Eye\
always in  Ballance between them. The Stones for the Architran,\
Frize and Cornice should be to cholen, that the Veining fall pe:pendi-\
cular, in order to keep the Members diffinct; which they would not\
be, were the tems to fall in with the Mouldings.\
II remains to be obferved in marbling Columns, that the Eye-veins\
ought to receive the ftrongelt Light on the reliered and swelling Purts,\
in order to aid the Flar of the Picture by Art; which Nature wants\
not, as being round of herfelf: Wherefore it would look ill, that the\
moft dark of the Eye-veins come on the weaker Parts, becaute it\
would render the Effect you propoted, abortive.\
Imagine  Piece of Walling divided into three Pannels, on each\
Side of which fland two Columns; the two firtt ought to oppofe each\
other; their Veining muft either be level, or run diagonally againt\
each other, ourwardly or inwardly: The two others mull do the fame\

Chap.   AP. Vi. Of Ruins.\
ITHER TO we have spoken of the Beauty and Regularity\
  of intire Buildings; wherefore tis proper next to treat of Frag-\
ments and Ruins, equally necelfary with the former.\
Te fometimes wonder\'92 how it happens, that among the Painters\
of Figures and Landskip, who make ufe of Buildings and other Brick-\
work, to few exhibit whole and highly-finished ones; all they thew is,\
Ruins, broken Walls and decayed Stones, but feldom intire and per-\
feet Structures, becaute, as  take it, theyll be at no Trouble to fearch\
Antiquiry for the Forms and molt beautiful Parts of Archirelture,\
whereby they might learn to produce fomething curious:  Supinity\
proceeding from their want of Knowledge, and Ambition to obtain\
II.\
Altho' many think, that  Piece of Ruins does not require to great\
 Regard as an intire Building, they are much miftaken; for the one\
as well as the other depends on Meafure and Proportion: Ver some\
will go and throw down  Part of  Building, and intermix with it\
some Fragments of Capitals, Pieces of Frizes, Corices and the like,\
of an Order foreign to the Building; which, tho' very wrong, they\
salve by fuppoling, that when  Building is in Ruine, no one will have\
the Curiofity to examine the Rubbith to fee, whether there be  wrong\
Capital, Frize or Cornice; and granting, fuch were to be found, the\
Fault would be none, fince thofe broken Parts might be brought thi\
ther cafually : But this is  lame Excule; to fpeak the Truth, Ican\
not apprehend how any one can be to wilfull, fince no more Know-\
ledge and Trouble are neceffary to the beft than the work Things, to\
the whole than to the half; in the one, we mult ule the Footrule\

great Building adorn  fine Landskip, and look grand, how much\
more, one in Perfection? He then who will take Pains may certainly,\
by Practice, overcome all Difficulties, if he have Ambition enough to\
fudy the beft Things. But let me not be underffood to (peak againft\

  Pique againlt that Sort of Objects; my only Drift, is, to thew\

Hills, Rooms, &cc.\
 this Sort of Work we muft in the firtt Place have an Eye to\
the Regularity and Divition of the Architecture, and if that be\
beauatul, nor in the leart hure it under Pretence of Decorum, or\
acting Painterlke; and if at any Time we are obliged to alter this\
Condut, it mult neverhelels be in favour of the Architecture.\
=. That the Painting, of what Kind loever it be, mutt cend to the\
Lufire and Magniticence of the Builling;  speak with respect to paint-\
ing the Wood-work, whether it be marbled or plain.\
 That the Ornaments to be painted agree with thofe of the Room,\
and be governed by the same Order in Architelture.\
 That in Pannels, Niches and II indows ought to be artfully paint-\
ed, whar you would have appear to be real or naturally there, whe\
ther Tapellry or Prospect: If Tapellry, it mult appear to be fuch;\
if  View, it mull look like  View; the former by being bordered,\
and the latter by its sky or Sun every where agreeing with the Light\
of the Room.\
 The Mafter muit beware of reprefenting in  Room  or more\
different Hours of the Day at the tame Time; nor in Hiffories, unless\
they be in the Alanner of Tapettry.\
 He mult never inclofe whice Marble Bassreliefs with Wood\
ork, as being repugnant to Cuftom and Likelihood.\
Latily, Since Excels often abates the Majelty of  Fabrick, the\
Artil should avoid many Lirtienefes in the Divilions and Ornaments:\
On tuch Occafions hifforical Figures should not exceed  or  Feet in\
Height, be the Painting ever to large: Tapeltry-figures exceeding the\
Lite are unjultitiable; they look montirous in  small Room, and let\

and when they are, they are to improperly and disjunctively applied,\
that we muft conclude them rather to lerve for Humour than Decorum;\
certain Signs that fuch Mafters were ignorant both of the Naturalnets,\
Needfulness and Application of Objects.\
Tis certain that the ancient Greeks and Romans were not originally\
to fumpruous in their Houfe-furniture as afferwards they came to be;\
and Tis as eafy to think, that there was  Difference between the No-\
bility and Commonalty, as well in their Buildings and Drels, as in other\
Respelts: The one ufed Place at his Table; the others, Earthen-ware\
or painted Wood; the one had Bals-reliefs, Statues, Hangings or Ta-\
peftries in his Houfe; the other was content with bare Walls; each\
according to his Fancy or Ability. Truly,  am furprized to think of\
my firft Ordonnances, and how disjointed my Conceptions were; often\
exhibiring  royal Hiffory in  Stable or Cottage, and as often the\
contrary: Quettionlets every Matler of an Houfe furnithes it with what\
is proper for each partment, whether Kirchen, Chamber, State-\
room or Gallery; one Apariment has  Bed or Couch and its Appur-\
tenances, Chells, Tables and Chairs; another has Hangings mage or\
lelscoftly, Floor carpets, Stands, Sconces, Looking-glafies, Coc. Ano-\
ther has Benches,  Chimney-piece, circular Couches fitting the Ta-\
ble, and other Things proper to the Room: And thus other Apart-\
MERIS.\
Some imagine, that Chairs were not anciently in ufe, but Mlen fat\
on Cuthions, as in the Eaftern Countries, or elfe refted on Couches.\
When  certain Perfon had reprefented Enews and Dide in  ftately\
Hall, and the placed on  low fmall Half-pace, covered with  Car.\
pet, with the young Afcanins in her Lap, and Eneys by her Side,\
and some Ladies fitting here and there on Cuthions on the Floor (which\
was covered with  green Carper)  was turprized to fee  large round\
Table\

 Architetture.\
Book ViII.\
Table fland in  Corner on  Side of the Painting, and this ferving up\
 for an Entertainment, and yet not  Chair near it;  asked the Ma.\
\
 \
\
\
Ler, why the Ladies had not Chairs or Benches, and whether this Cir.\
cumtance was thus to be found in Hiffory? He anfwered, that in\
thote Times, neither Chairs or Benches were known;  could hardly\
forbeer laughng, but asking him, whether the Company were to\
Rand to their Victuals, becaute of the Height of the Table, he began\
to fee his Error; ver in Excule laid, \'97 They will make ufe of the\
\
Ceach woice Lands jender againt the Hanging. \'97 This would have\
been  tolerable Comeoff, had the Couch been made for the Table;\
but by ill Luck the one was square, the other round;  faid no more,\
becaute  would not angment his Bluthes.\
Others have made the fame Millake, as was the Cafe of one who,\
as the Report goes, repretenting pbraham' Ofering, drew him with\
 Scimica: or bending Sword in his Hand, and  fireight Scabbard by\
his Side.\
Ionce made the fame Blunder, when my Inclination for Compoliti-\
on was greater than my Skill, in the Story of Hercules spinning by Om\
thale;  had feen, in  Defign of Barthelet, that Hercules was much\
bigger than anr of the Women; Wherefore  alfo drew him larger\
\
and dreffed in Womens Apparel, having Sleeves clofed at Hands (like\
Sardinagalus amongt his Women, in Aferians Hiftorical Chronicle)\
Diffaff in his Girdle,  Spindle in his Hand and Pearls about his\
Neck; and in order to thew that they were Ompbates Cloaths,  pla-\
ced her by him flark naked; now  appeal to any one, how well the\
Garment could fir Omphak, feeing it was neither too short or too flreight\
for Hercales, tho' half as tall again as the. Bur  afterwards rectihed\

Iis plain, that fuch Overlights proceed from ignorance or lame in\
Sruction, and princifally in what concerns Embellishment; ( fay, Em\
bellishment of anr Kind whatfoever. whether within or without doors;\
for few Know the Importance of this Part of rt, and the uncommon\
Effeds of it.\
Te mar, from the Works of old and judicious Malters, here and\
there borrow fome of their Thoughts, and ute them in  proper Ahen\
Fer in our own Works: The famous Poufin, in his finding of Aigjes,\
hews the Arke, with  Water-god; and with good Reafon (as we\
shall prove in the Chapter trearing of the Hutberity Painters have to\
regrefent spiritual and manimate Beings under human Forms) But its ir\
diculous, in my Opinion, that the same Figure with all its Adjund\
thould\
\
\
Of Architetture.\
  be placed on the Strand of  River, and near it Narciffus view-\
ing himfelf in the Water; on  Supposition, that, if it be but  Wa-\
\
 all is well; for thinks the Mafter, \'97 Ie fuits well\'97\
 fine Figure. \'97 Befides, if Pouffin durff do it, why may not we?\
But tis againlt Reafon; indeed, were the Sphinx and Children left\
out, it may be paftable enough.\
Who fets out  Room of Entertainment, and it does not thew whether\
the Dinner be over or not, by the Cloth laid, Bottles, Glaffes, Cifterns,\
and all Things in order, as before Dinner; and empty Bottles lying\
in Diforder, emply Dithes,  Dog gnawing  Bone, Chairs difplaced,\
Table-cloth half turned up, and such like, after Dinner! or\
Who can approve in Teffa' dipping of Achilles, Thetirs lying in an\
open Gallery, where allo is  Cradle \
As for moveable Embellifhments, its improper to thew Mark An.\
heny and Cleepatra, in their Grandeur and Luxury, without  Re-\
tinue, and as in  private Collation, feeing we know they had such \
Crowd of Mulick, Buffoons, Jugglers, and other loofe People about\
them: Or can we reprefent Chriff lying in the Manger, attended by\
Joseph and Mory, and the three Kings wairing on him, and that in \
Stable full of Beaft-provender, and on the Wall  Fan and Flail hang-\
ing, belides other Utenfils of Husbandry, and yet not  Countryman\
or Servant to appear; of  Chell, Box, Saw or Square to be feen?\
whether Toseph hired the Stable, or found it void of People, is ano-\
ther Confideration.) Moreover, one of the principal Figures is in  Suit\
of Armour, and barcheaded, and yet his Head piece is not to be\
Teen.\
One of my Fellow-ditciples once painted  Collation; and  asked\
him, Why be put not Knives on the Table? He antwered, That Knives\
were not Antique; very well, thought , Are then the Bread and Meat,\
and  three-legg\'92 Stool with  Back ftanding by, Anrique?\
Iis not improper, tho'  fmall Circumstance, that  Chamberpot\
be placed by  Bed-fide, when  Perfon is in it; even were there allo ac\
Day-break  Lampeither burning or extinguithed, and fuch like Things;\
whereby we may judge, what other Circumfances are required.\
From all which Confiderations ris plain, that  judicious Mafter\
mult take particular Thought about the By-works; leeing tis as bad\
to leave out fomething that is needful, as to add what is unnecellary.\

Book VIII\
   . Vill. Of the Pictures proper to various Apartments.\
HE Nature, Property and Use of Pictures in general, is, to\
keep the Seafes, by  pleating Variety of Objects, as Figures,\
Landskip, Cr. in  continual Employ and Contemplation.\
Their Auture has  near Affinity with that of the Things they re-\
prefent, when thote are done by  skilful Hand, and therefore they\
can, when natural Things are wanting, fully fatisty.\
Their Proverty lies in their Application to meet Places; and they\
cannot be difplaced without hurting, nay undoing Naturalnels.\
As for the (ye of Pictures, it is in the Occafion we have for them,\
and the Places they are to ferve for, in order to gratify the Senfes of\
the Owners; they mil be well expreft, and fall in with the Archi\
recture in the Agreement of the various Objects with the Ornaments of\
the Building.\
If this be unintellisible,  shall endeavour to explain myfelf.  fay\
then, that irs not tufficient for  Painter to delign Work for Apart-\
ments at random, and incroduce therein what Fancies he pleafes, or\
beft underflands; for, he ought to confider, whether it agree with the\
Place, and be proper there; if therefore he would go on with Certain\
tv, he mult, in the fir, Place, confult the Architefture, and then the\
three Points following.\
 The Qualiry, or Condiion of the Builder.\
 The Building itfelf.\
 The Apartments in it.\
Firlt, Let him confider whether the Owner be  Prince, Lord, Ma-\
giftrate, or Merchant.\
Secondly, Whether the Building be publick, as  Town houle,\
Church, Palace, Ec. or private, as for  Merchant or Citizen.\
Laflly, WThether it be an Hall, Chamber, Parlour, Kirchin, or the\
Like\
Thus far in general: But if we build  Palace for  King, the .\
partments mull be contrived for other Ufes, than thofe for  Werchant,\
or even  Town houfe; for in this latter we find many Rooms fitted\
for Purpofes, oppofite to  Palace; as may be feen in that fine Model,\
the Stadt houle at Amferdam, where Archicecture has wonderfully dit\
posed all the Rooms to their feveral Ufes; nor is the Judgment of the\
Painters\
\
\
\
Of Archilecture.\
Chap.  or Architelts lets confpicuous in the proper placing the Pic-\
tures in each Apartment; for each Piece (chielly Sculpture) is to order-\
ed, as to allude to the Room; whence we know, what Ufes the Rooms\
are put to, and by the Rooms, what the Paintings, Stone-figures and\
Balsreliets fignify.\
Wherefore tis very necellary to contider the Nature of the Apart-\
ment, in order to govern our Work thereby; as firtt\
in the Hall below fuits well  grey Bassrelief; or elfe Trophies\
painted on the Walls affer the Life.\
in an Antichamber, where People wait for Commands, grey Orna-\
ments are alto beft; fomerimes intermixed with Flowers, but very\
Sparingly.\
in an Audience, or Presence-reom should be Tapettries, or Pictures\
with Figures, as big as the Life, of magnificent Tranfactions which\
happened in Apariments or Palaces.\
in the Lady' Vissting-reom mull be other Sorts of Embellishments,\
tuch as Fruit, Flowers, Landskip, fine Thoughts, virtuous Reprefen-\
tations, and the moft cloathed and modeft Histories.\
in the Nursery agree Balsreliefs, and painted Emblems or Morals;\
whereby the Children may learn good Manners, and inure their ten-\
der Vears to virtuous Actions: To thele may be added, some Flowers,\
Fruit, Birds, and such like.\
In the Kitchin may be feen the Reprefentations of culinary Furni-\
ture, Hunting of Deer, the Picture of fome Maid or other Servant,\
or  Dog or Cat; but thefe mult be moftly grey or Wood-colour,\
on account of the Smoke, which otherwife would fully the Colours.\
in the Gallery may appear all Sores of Hunting equipage painted on\
the Walls from the Lite.\
in the Upper-rooms fuit Landskip, and all Kinds of beautiful Pro\
Spelts.\
in the Mafter' Bed-chamber are proper some beautiful Faces, and\
naked Children painted after the Life.\
in the Children' Bed-roomnothing mult be feen but Foliage or Branch-\
Work.\
The Study may be adorned with Paintings, in grey Marble, of learn-\
ed Men, Philofophers, Coc.\
in the Summer-house, being  Place for the Enjoyment of Company\
and Entertainments, fuit nothing better than merry Bacchanalian Pieces,\
portive Herdimen, Dancings, Brooks and Fountains.\
 Architecture.\

We proceed now to the Decorations over Chimneys,\
and on Doors,\
in each Apartment.\
Over the Dining-rosm-Chimacy place Comus, God of Meals, accom.\
paned by Taffe and Smell; and on the Door, Latitia, or Joy.\
 the Hillceimney may be Decorum, or Authority, accompani-\
ed by Palles, or Virtre, and Hones, or Honour; and on the Deor,\
Underftanding.\
Orerthe Lidrs Fifsing-room Chimney, Modelty, accompanied by Obe\
dience and Diligence; and on the Door, Fidelity.\
Orer the Chimney in  Saloon, or Meetingroom for Vouth, may be\
feen Incentus, or Youth, artended by Grace and Eloquence; and on the\
Deor, Gaudiar, or Jor.\
Over the Nursery-ceimney place Education, and by it  young Branch\
tied to  Stick; and on the Door, Obedience.\
Over the Kitchinchimney, Prudentia, or Prudence, accompanied by\
Ceres and Bacchas; and on the Door, Diligence.\
Over the Bed chamber-Chimaey, Quict; and the Door Security.\
Over the Study, or Closet-chimney, Wifdom, or Science; and on the\
Deor, Hurpo:rates.\
On the Doors of the Side-reoms going out of the Hall, Clemency\
and Vigilance; and between trem, Occonamy.\
On the Puntry-Leor, bundance.\
On the Cellar-loir, Sitenus.\
On the Garret or Left-doer, Winter.\
On the Gardin-doer, Flora.\
On the Orckard-dour, Pomond.\
in the Grun boyfe, between the Stoves, the Figures of Perfons who\
have been transformed into Trees and Plants, as Cypariffus, Myrrba,\
DugEr:, &cc. On the Deor within, Apelle; and on the Outfide, Di-\
yid.\
On the Stabli-Goor, all Sorts of Stable appurtenances, as  Bridle,\
Saddle, Houling, Stirrups, Dung-fork, Shovel, Curry-comb, Coc.\
On the Prizy-Loor Momus laughing.\
And now, that  may conceal nothing from the Artiffs,  shall fub\
jon the Pictures proper to be put into Chimpeys; which may be vari-\
ous; becaute we are not confined to the Fire, as being only uted du\
ring the Iinter-feafon; the Spring, Summer and Autumn afford is \
large Field for fine Inventions; and fince the Place, for three Quar-\
ters of the Vear, becomes any thing we find proper, we can either\
tht them up, or leave them open, or contrive, in Niches, all Sorts of\
Starves\
\
\
Of Archiletture.\
Chap. .\
 or Bults, Batsreliefs and other Ornaments, as Cifterns, Vala,\
Flower-pots, Baskees of Fruit, mufical Inftruments, Globes and fuch\
like: We can have them be open with Doors or without, with one\
Door or two half ones, and reprefent Viflos or Prospects, fuch as   publick Place with Fountains,  Street of Honfes,\
 Grove, Lane, Froncifpiece, Pantry, Wine cellar, an Alcove with \
Couch, or  Library, and such like; in fine, we may introduce any\
thing that is different from the Furniture of the Apartment. But\
Care mult be taken, that the Painting have  natural and high Hori-\
 with little or no Sky, to gain more Depth; Viffos of Apart\
ments one within another are alfo not improper; but if we reprefent\
Witheut-deer-Preffects as aforelaid, is more proper to paint Doors;\
feemingly to give the Room Air: And feeing it often happens, that\
tuch  Painting cannot have the moft advantageous Light, and is fome-\
times in Shade by the Projecture of the Chimney, we should contrive\
the Work accordingly, and to as not to appear like Paincing, but Na-\
ture itfelf.\
The Defigns proper to fuch Places (for the fake of thofe who are\
not fercile in Invention) may be fuch as follow.\
Spring.  Flora, fetting out with  gay and joyful Air, has  Bas-\
ket of Spring-flowers under her left Arm; with her right Hand be-\
hind the  little lifts up her Gown; her left Foor refts on  Step, and\
her right lifes up; her Breaft is fomewhat to the Light; behind, in \
low Ofiskip, is feen  Parterre, ornamented with Vales: Behind her we\
may place another Figure in Shade, afcending the Steps, in order to fling\
off the Offskip, and bring forward the Fore-figure. Flora muft be pro-\
portioned to the Size of the Fire-place; if not as big as the Life, let\
her be  young Damfel, and, if the Face be thaded by the Chimney,\
make good Advantage of the Reffexion: The fame Delign may be al-\
to executed with Children.\
Summer.  Pomona with  Basket of Fruit in her Lap; and in the\
Offskip, an Orchard, and fome Cupids butily gathering Fruits and\
Flowers.\
Autumn.  Bacchus reprefented in an Entrance or Gateway, hung\
round with Vine-branches and Grapes; and; if you pleale,  young\
Satyr by him, with  Cup: This Delign may be alfo reprefented with\
Children.\
 Anteros, as  Touch, crowned with Lsurels, flands on  Thref\
hold, leaning on  Torch or elfe  long Arrow, pointing inwardly to\
 Library, wherein are an Aftrolabe and Globe, and againtl the Wall\
 Architecture.\
Book ViIl.\
 Lyre hanging; his Garment, faftened on each Shoulder, is reddith\
Furple; his Look agreeable and majeftic; his Mouth open, as if com-\
plementing fomebody to come in; he flands on the left Side againt\
the Door, which comes half in Shade, againtt the Offskip, to that he\
is Rrongly fer off; his Face and Under-parts are fronting; his Breaft\
turning to the Light: This Delign either left or right is equally good,\
and to are the before-mentioned\
. Cupid is feen here fweerly fmiling, having  Flask on his Arm,\
and  Spaw-water-Bortle in his Hand, which he holds up, as if he\
- Rare Waters! By him is an elegant Stand or Tea-\
were laving,\
table, on which another Capid is placing  Silver Salver with Glaffes,\
and  Silver Sugar-box and Spoon; behind may be feen  Wine-cel-\
lar lighted by  Candle or Lamp; we should alfo difcover Part of \
Summer-houle, or Fountain, or  Gallery, Cc.\
 in this Delign we thew  Serenade by three Boys; the firft dreff\
as  Punchanello, with  Bag-pipe, Hautboy or Flure; the second as\
an Harlequin, with  Violin; and the third as  Scaramouch with \
Guitar, and all three in their proper Poftures: Harlequin in fet Po\
Rure flands to the right againtt  Polt, holding the Violin to his Ear:\
Punchanello, fitting againtl the other Poff on the Threshold, holds his\
Fluce from his Mourh, and looks forward, laughing and thewing his\
Teeth, his Head finking backwards fomewhat into his Neck: Scara-\
mouch is in the middle, with his Guitar under his Arm, and his Head\
quite funk into his Shoulders; he is attentive, holding his Fore-finger\
to his Nofe, and his Legs clofe. Behind thefe Buffoons we might thew\
 Ballultrade over  Water in Shade, and on it an Ape fitting; in the\
Water may be Condolas, with Masks in them; or elfe  Street,\
and fuch like.\
Becaule the Breadth of the aforefaid Opening cannot be very great,\
you may, by thurcing the Door more or less, or by placing fomewhat\
between it, get advantageous Shades, if the Marter require it: There\
ought at molt but  Figure and half to be in the Light, and  third,\
in Shade. The Colours will effect the fame. Such Paintings should\
not be muddled, but boldly handled, and the Lights flrong\
Thus much for Withour door- Views; proceed we now to Designs for\
Crimners which are closed.\
  Vase either of white Marble, Gold or Silver; or the Belly\
Gold, and the Neck and Foor of Lapis Lazuk, in  Niche of red\
Marble, or Porphyry; and the Jaumbs to be of  lighter Stone, hung\
with Feltoons of all Sorts of fine Leaves, intermixed with Flowers;\

\
Of Architecture.\
Chap.  Feffoons should be very large, like two Arms, and preading, in\
order to break the light Ground, that the Middle-ornament, whe-\
ther whice Marble, Silver or Gold, may have the greater Force.\
 The Buft of Borchus in whice Marble, crowned either with Vine-\
leaves and Branches and Grapes, or elfe Mulberries with their Greens;\
on each Side, on  Ground of Free-ftone, Feffoons of white and blng\
Grapes, and between thofe may be placed some proper Inftruments,\
 Cymbals, Timbrels, Tabors, Haurboys and Pansfintes; the Buft\
is on  Pedeltal of Pifan-marble in  Niche, as before; the Niche muft\
rife as much as poftible, that the Bult may have its full Height; but\
if the Chimaey and Niche do not admit of  Figure in full Proporti-\
on, you may make  Boy of it; if you leave out the Pedeftal, you can\
place the fame in the Niche, but  third lets in Height. Under the\
Niche may be  faint Balsrelief of grey or other Marble; or elfe \
Feftoon of Pine-leaves, intermixed with fome beautiful Flowers.\
 The Buft of Apollo; and on each Side fome mutical Infiruments,\
either painted as carved, or natural. Under the Niche may be  Pannel, and on it  carved Torch, with  Quiver acrols, thro'\
 Garland of Laurel. Among the natural Infiruments, tome Laurel\
or Olive-branches; and among the carved ones, some Rolls of Paper,\
with geometric and other fuch Figures; for thefe can be better order-\
ed in Bass-relief, than among thole naturally painted.\
  deep Niche; in which may be feen,  Table, with an elevant\
\
\
Stand or Foor of fine Wood, partly gilt: On the Table, Ching  as Dithes, Saucers, Tea-pot and  Silver chafed Tea-caniffer;\
or elfe Cofice equipage, as  Silver Coffee-pot,  Silver Salver with\
Pipes,  Knife, fome Tobacco in  Paper,  fine Chafing-dith with\
Fire; and on the Ground, in the Shade, fome Bottles of Wine.\
 The Table in this Delign may be put to various Ules; it may; be\
ferved fwith Melons, or Baskers of Fruit, as Peaches, Neltarips, -\
pricocks, Filberds, Coc.\
 On fuch  Table may be alfo Mufick-books and Inftruments, as\
 Lute, Violin, Haurboy, Coc. And on the Ground,  Ciffern of Wa-\
ter, with Bottles of Wine flanding upright therein.\
 in this lafl, we may place  round Bals relief reprefenting  fir-\
ting Child, of Fleth-coloured Marble, on  blue Ground, blowing\
Buables: Round it,  white Marble Moulding; and underneath, .\
Feftoon.\

Orders in Hrcbitefture.\
IN CE no Manner of delcribing fine Apartments is more pro-\
Lo per than this, which exhibits Things as it we really faw them,  therein give an rchitectonic View of each Order, and in as\
confpicuous  Manner as myself conceive it. The Particulars muft\
then be well regarded, becaute they are to linked together, that, by\
overlooking  imall Circumftance, the whole Cham may be broke,\
without ever getting  true Ides of the Thing.\
We shall confine the Subjelt to five Apartments, and describe in\
each the Pictures, which thew the Narure, Height, Cullom and other\
Properties relating to the Orders of this Building: And fince the Tusan\
Order, either in Parts of altogether, is rough and mafty, we shall ex-\
hibit here,\
The Pitture of POLYPHEMUs and GALATEA.\
Polphemas, on the Sea-Thore, inflamed with the Love of the beau\
tiful Galotes, who came to divert herfelf on the pleafant Surges of\
the Billows, ftrove to pleafe her with his Singing and Mufick, and\
thereby to gain her Favours; but the was deaf to his Suit: His rough-\
hewn enormous Size, and frightful Aspect were her Averfion; where\
fore the thuns him, and derides his Addreffes.\
 calm Sea was feen On the second Ground, to the left, appear\
ed  vall high Rock, hanging over the Sea, almoff to the Point of\
Sight; all rough, and over-run with Mots and Herbage, going off to\
the left very cragged; up to it huge Stones were piled on each other,\
as Steps (but three times higher) from the Edge of the Warer; on the\
lowermoft of them, fat the monttrous Cyclops, as  wild and favage\
Man; his Skin very fwarthy and hairy; his Head and Beard full of\
briftly black Hair, (preading over his Shoulders and Breaft; he had\
but one Eye-brow, and that as wide as his Forehead, hanging over\
the Eye (which, according to Homer, was as large as  Shield) placed\
in the middle of his wrinkied Forehead; his Blubberlip turned up to\
wards his broad and fiar Nofe, like that of  Negroe; thewing his\
Teeth, fet like thofe of  Saw, out of his gluttonous Jaws, with  Look: By him, lay his Staff, which (like those of Herdlmen)\
 Architetture.\
  crookt at one End, and (according to Ovid) bigger than the Malt\
of  Ship:  Knaplack or Pouch hung at his Side; his Raiment was\
Goatsskins fewed together; which he had chook from off his Shoul-\
ders, poffibly to difcover to Galates his conceited fine Shape: This Gar-\
ment was Cream-colour, spotted with Black. He fat very rudely,\
leaning  little back againft the Rock; his left Leg was firetched out\
towards the Water, and his right, with the Foor forethortened, lified\
up, lay over  Piece of the Rock; his Flure, with an hundred Pipes,\
he held, in his left Hand, up at his Mouth, as if he had been juft\
playing. His Head inclined (with his Eye to Heaven) towards Cupid,\
who ffood near and flattered him; his Mouth was open, as if he were\
finging, and his right Hand, upright on his Knee, feemed to beat\
time. It was curious to fee the Method Cupid took in the midft of\
his Play, to stick an Arrow into Polyphemur' Breaft without his being\
fentible of it.\
Cupid was about half as big as the Cyclops Arm or Leg; to that,\
tho' he had climbed up the fecond Step, he could fcarce reach the\
Cyclops Shoulder, in order to flroke, with his right Hand, the Hair\
from the Giant' Eye; when, pointing with  fretch\'92 Finger of the\
fame Hand towards the Sea, he laughing tuck with the other an Ar-\
row in Pelyphemus' Breaft, under his lified Arm; Cupid was of  begu-\
tiful roly Complexion, his Hair yellowith Whice;  Quiver, tied with\
 red Sath, hung by his Side, and his Bow lying near him.\
The fair Galatea, in the mean time fitting on  large Sea-shell in the\
middle of the neareft Diltance, was drawn by two Dolphins, encom-\
palled with Tritons and Nereids, founding their thelly Trumpers, and\
playing on Timbrels and other infiruments; the fat fronting in the\
Shell; and the Dolphins, which the guided gently, turn\'92 to the right; the\
was followed by other Iritons, bearing beautiful naked Virgins, and \
Crowd of Sea-monfters, who, gradually uniting with the furcheff Di=\
stance, difappeared. This whole Crowd was grouped in the Form of \
Crefcent; Galaten appear\'92 to turpats all in Beauty.\
 at firt thought this might poffibly be tenus herfelf; becaute three\
Beauties attended her, whom  took to be the three Graces; but the\
looked fomewhat younger, and not to wanton as Penus is ufually repre\
fented; her Breall allo rofe lets, and her Head attire was quite diffe-\
rent from Venus; for her white Hair, twifted in Treffes, and elegantly\
howing, was here and there fruck with white Bell-ffowers; and the\
Locks on each Side cied together on the Head in  Tuft, and, hanging\
down both before and behind, made plainly appear, how gently the\
No.  Archiiecture.\
Book VIII\
 over the Billows What most charmed me, was, that, in this\
great Crowd, one might fee the particular Sways, Turnings and Affec-\
tions of every Figure; one mored flowly, another fwiftly, as their\
Beards, Hair and Vails plainly hewed; fome bending backward, as\
blowing, ochers forward almoft to the Water; fome were full of\
Foam; others fwimming as evenly as if they moved on Looking-glats,\
to that their Glitter was fearce vifible in the Water: This second tenns\
(as  call her) had  greenith blue Scarfe, which, coming over her Lap,\
fined abour her right Leg; advancing her naked left Leg, the fet her\
Foor on the Scroll of the Shell; her Head,  litle fiung back, inclined\
to her right Shoulder; her Brealt projelting; and the right Arm,\
freiching crots her Body, supported her Rein hand on her naked Knee;\
her Countenance was modell and fmiling; her Eyes fomewhat downih,\
made me think that the Sun was too powerful for her, but,  more\
hearly perceived, the was talking to  Seanymphor Nercid, who, near\
her Chariot, lay behind on  Triten, flaring towards the Shore at Po\
GtBens, whither Galatea, with her left Hand  little forethortened,\
was pointing; the top of the Rock was almoff thaded by  Cloud;\
which Shade run crots the Piece, and fer off Gulares and her Recinue.\
The whole Croup was agreeably lighted, and tho' the Light was\
Rrong, yet the Shades near the Water were foff and melting, by the\

Second Picture.\
Pelyphemus, from the top of the Rock, where he fat playing, view.\
ing his beloved Galates bellowing her Smiles on Acis, was to enraged\
thereat, that, full of Fury, he fore  Piece from the Rock, with in-\
rention to cruth them both ; which Galurea clcaped by diving into\
the Sea, but Acis, not nimble enough in running, was fruck with\
it.\
This Piece is  Fellow or Sequel of the preceding: The Rock is\
here placed on  contrary side to the former; behind it, an Ifland allo,\
in the Form of  Crescent, towards the right extends acrots; beyond it\
the Sea is feen along the Horizon; the Rock on the right Side goes\
down in rough Steps, and follows  fandy Way forward on its left, to\
the middle of the Piece, where it ends in the Frame: The unhappy\
Reis falls here in the Sand under the huge Piece of Rock, with his\
Arms extended, and his Face downwards, yet fomewhat turned towards\
the Sea; he is not quite dead, becaute the great Weight, rolling in the\
Air, only took him in the Leg as he was running; the caraged Cyclops,\
not content with this, foams at Mouth, and gripes an heavier Piece of\
the Rock in order to deftroy the faithless Gaurren; Riegara, with her\
(moaking pitchy Torch, eggs him on, and, enffaming him with hellifh\
Fury, points towards the Sea at the Objects of his Revenge; at which,\
he looks back; and now what  Force he thews in rending the Rock;\
all his Members are diftoried, his sinews firetch, and his Mukiles\
twell; drawing in his Mouth on one Site with the upper Teeth, and\
his Eyeishalf thut; does he not look as if he were anaromized or flead;\
nay, the leaft of his Mukcles works, and preffes thro' his thick Skin;\
his Hair flands an end, and his Beaft-skin Garment, being got loofe from\
his Girdle, drags on the Ground, and he treads on it with his left Foor;\
the Goats Feet hanging to it appear to fly about, according to his\
Motion; he bends double, one of his Knees almoft touching his Breatt,\
and with his right Foor againtt the Rock, he, with both Hands and all\
his Force, tears off  piece of it: Tipphone, half behind him, with\

comes Gulstea in her Chariot drawn by two Dolphins, not gliding\
as before, but toffing fomerimes on the top of the Waves, and\
fomerimes beneath them, with the hinder Part of her Chariot almoff\

with Amazement, and her Reins flack; her difordered Locks fly in\

got loofe, drops behind her into the Sea; her lovely Members are -\
verpowered by her inward Troubles; the Mutcles of her Neck, before\

Pencil of  judicious Marter ? Be it what it will, tis real Nature to\
me, and  am fausyed. But, to proceed,\
In the Offship, on the left Side, tome Ships appear in  Storm, and\
two in the middle of the Piece riding at Anchor, and  Boat landing\
Some People; this made me think that Twas Oliffes, who had  De-\
fign on the Eye of the cruel and gluttonous Devourer of Men; it is\
even fo,  can perceive them to be Greeks by their armed Gallies and\
whole Equipage; the Sea is White with Froth, and the Waves beat\
towards the Point of Sight; the Air is in Commotion and full of\
driving Clouds, which caule here and there large Ground-fhades; the\
main Light falls on Pohpbemus, and the under Part of the Rock, and\
takes in almoff the whole Shore forwards; but the Stone which falls\
on Ais  with his Under-parts, in Shade, cauted by  bit of  Side\
rock, which frongly fets it off againtt the Light; Cugid, in the mean\
time above the Honion, comes flying forward, turning, full of Sor\
row and Cries, to the right, down where fois lies; his left Hand is\
up to one Eye, and his right (wherein is his Bow) over his Head, to\
shade it from the Sun; his Quiver is reverted, and the Arrows drop\
into the Sea; Hois lies on the Fore-ground, with his Shoulders bare,\
and he is feen  little right fide-wile; his Hlands, half covered with\

  are wide open, as if he were fwimming; his Hair is dark, and his\
Garment dark Creen; Golateg, between him and Pelyphemus with the\
Rock, runs cross the Piece; the is feen rghe fide -wife, and her Face is\
fronting; the Offskip, confifling of Hills, Bolcage, beautiful Lawns\
and Rivers, is clearly lighted; there appear alfo lome Cattle grating,\
as in the former Piece; under the Impendance of the Rock, and clole\
to the Sea, lies  red cloth Garment in Shade; undoubtedly left there\
by Acis; which was, in my Opinion, artfully contrived, in order to\
point out the Place where this unhappy Couple had been fitting; the\
Shore is covered with Cockles and many other Sea-productions; \
large greenith -coloured Tortoife is feen, making from under Acis to-\
wards the Sea; Polyphemur' Flute lies by him, but the Bag Hill hangs\
by his side; the top of the Rock is dark against light Clouds driving\
thither; the Light comes from the Side of the Piece.\
After  had exactly weighed all the Circumfances of the two Pieces,\
 was confidering what the Mafter' principal Drift might be, and\
found them to be an Example of Love, or Flattery of the Senfes wan-\
tonly affecting the Body without Violence, in the Perfon of Polypbe-\
mus, in the firtl Piece; and in Calatea an ealy indifference, without -\
ay Poffion; for  perceived her Motion was lmooth, and her Beauty\
in its Perfection; the was not actended by any Capids, becaute fuch as\
have Fins inflead of Wings ufually wait on the Wereids:  was to re-\
joiced at this Obfervation, that  cant express it.\
inquiring likewife what might be learned from the second Pilture,\
 concluded that the Author intended to express the unhappy Iffue of\
Love in the Perfon of Galatea;  Paftion both warm and ludden; for\
the leaff diforderly Affection puts the chief Members of the Body in\
Commotion, and difturbs the Peace of the Reft; that of Potyphemus\
is violent; Capid is subject to Compaftion only, as  think; where\
fore he is reprefented crying, poffibly to shew  Childithness;, for\
Children commonly laugh or cry about Things which Isem. ttrange to\
them.\

all the Cyclops, was, according to Homer, Son of Neptum and the\
Nymph Tbefa; the Word Cyclops lignities, having one Eyc in the\

amine more narrowly into the Egrptian Hicroglyphies, fay, that the\

Salmess and Sweetnels; reaching us, that both Good and Evil spring\
from their Narure and Conflitucion, to wit, Good from the human\
Narure, and nothing but Evil from the Fithiness; for the human Form,\
Lays Prarnstys, is compared to fweer Water, which is proper for the\
Aliment of Trees, Herbs and Animals; but the fithy Part is compared\
to Sea-water, which is noxious to the Animals of the Earth and Air,\

Having largely handled the Offspring and Signification of the Charac-\
ters in both the aforefaid Pictures, we shall pats to  general Expli-\
cation of the latter. Harmony in Mulick arifes from an agreeable\
Mixture of difcording and flat bounds with concording and Charp ones;\
but in Love Tis otherwife, where Diffimularity cannot be brought to\
agree, or two Hearts to join, which do not fympathize by an Har-\
mony of Humours: The hideous Make of the Ciclops is trightful to\
the beauteous Galatea, who thuns him for her dearer  by Poly-\
phemus, in this laft Story, we learn, that thole Perfons fue in vain, who\
flatter themfelves that their troubleiome Addreffes gain the Affections\
of thote who hare them; contrarily, Acis, bleft with the Smiles of\
his Miftress, shews us the Danger of expoling ourfelves to the Refent-\
ment of  powerful Rival, from whom at any time we muft expect\
nothing but Death: It may allo,  fay, ferve for an Example of the\
Power of Beaury, which to bewitched fors, that he could not for-\
bear loving, tho' at the Expence of his Life; thus we are bewildered\
by our own inclinations, and brought to the Place of inevitable Mis\
fortunes, where we are plunged in Tears to the weakning of our vi-\

his Head, and his Elbow is drawn in, holding the Rope with both\
Hands, clofe to his Body. Another, on the right Side behind him,\
is lifring up  Curtain, and looking after him. Between thefe two\
fifes  large Column, and another on the other Side of the latter,\
whereonthe aforefaid Curtain hangs; thefe Columns and their Pedeltals\
run towards the Point of Sight. Behind the laft Philiffine fland\
  more. On the left Side, behind the old Woman, appears\
Part of the Couch, supported by  Lion' Paw; the top of the\
Couch has an Ornament of Foliage, from whence projects  Wo\

hairy Breatt: His Drapery is dark Purple; which, faltened with  Gir-\

Secend Table, or Pifture.\
After Sumson' Hair was cut off, and he ried Hand and Foot, he .\
wakes, and finding himfelf thus wreechedly trapped by Delitak, arifes\
full of Wrath, friking and puthing all away from him as well as he\
is able; but is at latt overpowered and feized.\
Here, in his Fury, he flands in the middle of the Piece, turned\
with his left to the Lghr, and firaddling; his left Elbow rifes, with the\
Hand and Arm down behind his Head; his right Hand comes forward,\
with the Elbow puiled back by  Rope, by one of the Phitiffines; his\
right Leg advances, and the left falls quire back, yielding to the\
Height of his heavy Body, which bends backwards. Two Perions lie\

  of whom, the foremofl, with  Staff or Half-pike, feems\
to Rrike, with all his Might, at the reeling Samfon. Their Fury is\
very great on this Occafion.  little to the left, behind Samson, and\
clole to the Couch, Debitah is feen embracing the Statue of Venns, and\
looking back with Affonishment; the is fomewhat high on the Steps;\
which run crots the Piece. Juft beyond her, the old Woman, is either\
flung down or falling, and with one Leg  little up, thews her Naked\
nets, by reafon of her Garment fomewhat turned up; the has one\
Hand on the Floor, and the other coming forwards. In the Corner\
forwards hangs  Part of  large Curtain, which covers half the Ta-\
mentioned in the\
ble, whereon lies the Money. The two Vouths,\
former, come running in  Fright, endeavouring to hide themielves\
between the Table and Wall; the one is already half behind it, and\
the other is looking back, with his Head between his Hands. Sam-\
fon' Drapery lies half on the Sceps, and the Reidue is under his Feet;\
together with fome Weapons, as Halfpikes and Head-pieces of the\
Slam. The Commander of the Phitiffines has  Vellment reaching bes\
low the Knces, and  loofe Drapery about his Arm; about his Head\
is  light grey Fillet, faftened behind with  gold Ribbon. The main\
Light takes Samfon and the Parts about him. Delilab is in  reflect-\
ing Light, and deep in the Piece.\
Thefe two Pictures were not inferior to the two former in Passions:\
The Ordonnance, Light and Colouring furprized me, and induced me\
to think,  faw the very Action and Life itfelf:  was pertuaded, that\
if  knew not that it was Samson and Delifab,  muft have gueft it by\
their Makes, Faces and Motions: And, what was moft wonderful, the\
Falt and Drift could not only be naturally feen, but alfo its Cause,\
and what the Iffue would be, whetber good or bad. In the firtt Piece, .\
could eafily perceive that Samson was to be betrayed; and if  did not\
Know it, the Circumftances of his Hair cut off, Mleney told, and Ropes\
at band, would make me furmife it. Vet this could not be done\
without Bloodthed, as in the fecond Piece, where he is feized and ro-\
ped like an Ox for the Sacrifice; who, if the firft Blow fail, roules,\
puthes down, and tramples under Foot all that he meets with; xill, at\
ength cired, he is maftered, and thus led back to the Alfar again.\
Jull to it appeared to me. Truly, we fee few fuch Pieces to efficaci-\
outly exprefted; every thing, as, the Apartment, By-werks and Inci-\
dents were to proper, to needful to explain the Matter, that the \
miffion of any of them would have made the Ordonnance imperfect.\

Book VIII\
 of this heathenifh Woman! Does not the naughty old Womas,\
with the Key in her Hand, plainly thew, that thes in her own Houte,\
not in that of Samfon, or the Commander of the Philifines? Or of\
what Ofe would the Money on the Table be, if we faw not, by the\
Bearer, that it was not Samsons? For he is afleep, and the Money\
now brought in: But if, on fuch an Occafion, the Running of the Bear.\
ers and the Noife of the Money be thought improper, as difcovering\
the Plot;  fay there is no impropriety in it; fince its poffible to run\
bare foored over  marble Floor, without any Noife, and to fet down\
Bags of Money without rattling. All here is huth; no body (peaks,\
for every one knows his Bufinets.\
In the fecond Piece, Delilab makes to the Statue for Protection:\
Why does the fly, and why in such Fear, after Samson is bereft of his\
Strength? yet the cannot be eaty; the is tolfed between Hope and Fear,\
and her Anxiety makes her carch hold of any thing the meets with;\
and, as long as Sumfor is prefent, the retains her Trouble. The Com-\
mander' paffionate Motion is,  think, very proper; for tho' he be\
ditcharging the Duty of  Servant, it' eafy to imagine, that, feeing\
the dead Bodies he about him, he would not have expoted himfelf to\
the Danger of approaching Samson, had he not been fecurely tied:\
Now, ruthing from his lurking Place, he falls boldly on Somson; poffi-\
bly, not to much to thew his own Valour, as to (pirit the others; for\
he looks not at Samfon, but at the Soldiers. The old Woman' lying\
tumbled down is not improper, as being feeble -legg\'92' and full of Fear:\
And altho' the have no Share in the Action, yet  not repugnant to\
the Story, if only for Delilahs fake; and for the fame Reafon the\
is fiung into Shade. Her Garment turned up, can be no great\
Scandal to an ill Woman.\
Let us now confider both the Pictures; but chieffy the Signification\
of Samson'\'92 Hair, and the Love of Delilab.\
We read briefly in Scripture, many Things touching the Hair of\
Samson; of which he was very careful; becaute, whilft it grew, it be-\
came longer and thicker; whereby he gained greater Strength for\
breaking the Ropes, with which he was at any time bound: But, be\
ing cut off, his Strength forfook him, and his whole Body was fub-\
jetted to Weakness.\
By the Perfon of Samson the Nazarean, we underfland,  Man cho\
ten by Heaven, and devored to its Service; for the Men of that Or-\
der took, as  have faid, especial Care of their Hair; which gave\
them Virte, adorning the Head, . . the Underffanding; which, the\
more it increafes, the more courageous we become againft the Af\

right Reafon becomes ufeless, and we ceafe to do good. Thus we are\
fhorn by the Wiles of Women; that is, by means of Voluptuousness, ws\
are deaf to the Impulfes of the Spirit; and then of courle he open to\
our Enemies, both to fcorn and cruth us; for worldly Affairs are fo\
affelting, that they have no fooner got the Maftery, but we find our-\
felves croffed, either by Covetoulness, Love, Hatred, Jealouty, or \
ther Difquiet: But returning to ourfeives, or gwaking, we become fene\
fible of our Folly, and thro' Contrition, gradually recover our Hair,\
and thereby our Strength; and then, dying to Sin, we at once over\
come both ourseives and our Enemies.\
The Hair cut off allo implies, the Weakness of the Faculties of the\
Soul or Spirit; or even Death itself.\
Earipides reltifies, that Alceffus could not die before Mercury came\
from Heaven to eat off his Hair. Mines likewife could not overcome\
King Nisus, unlels his fatal Hair were cat off by his Daughter. And\
Dide, fays Virgif, could not die before June, who piried her long -\
sony and lingering Death, fent Iris to releafe the Soul from corporeal\
Fies, by cutting off her white Hair, and offering it to Pisto.\
Thefe two laft hifforical Pictures differed from the two preceding\
in this, that they were not mixed with poetic Figures; as Cupid, or\
Love; Megarg, or Rage, and fuch like, to help the Exprettion of\
the Passions, or Meanings; fince is certain, that real Trath could not\
be difcerned from Fittion by  Nixture of both. And altho' the Sta-\
tue of Venus, in this Matter of Faft, feem to be of that Nature, yet\
is nothing to the main Point, but ferves only to thew, that the Place\
was beatheniss, and where probably fuch Figures were common among\
that People.\

The valiant Hercules, after having performed many, wonderful Ex-\

ther, thro' fnarting Rage buuned himself; occafioned by the poiioned\
Shirt of Reffas, which Deinira had feat him, our of Jealouty, thar\
he loved loke, Daughter of Euritus, King of Occalia. Tupiter much\
concerned at this, carried him to Heaven in  triumphant Chariot, and\
placed him among the Stars, in the Number of the Gods.\
This Proffect wes will, woody, and mountainous. In the middle\
of the Piece,  little to the right, near the Point of Sight, was feena\
large Pile of rough Wood lying crols-wife, not as chopped, but rent\
 having Roots and Branches. The upper Wood was small;\
and the under very large, lying parallel with the Piece. Here the\
unhappr Heroe, the scourge of Monlters, was lying extended over his\
Lion\'92 Skin, with his Head to the right, and Feet to the feft Side\
turned fomewhar backward, and his Breaft leaning over. His Face \
liitle riting, and bending forwards, was feen in profile from, the\
right Side, diecovering Relignation, unartended with Pain.. His left\
Arm was quite raifed, with the Hand behind, under his Head; the\
other Armlay our  little forward on the Wood; with the Hand\
half thur, and the intide cowards his Body. His right Knee was whol.\
by drawn up, with the Foor inclining towards it; the other Leg was\
repretented hanging off, as if he would life himself fomswhathigher.\
Philoffetes, before the Wood,  lirle to the right, kneeling on his left\
Knee, fupported his bent Body on his Elbow and the right Knee. He\
looked downwards, holding, before his Face,  Part of his Garment,\
as if he were weeping, and, with  Torch in his left Hand, fetting\
Fire to the Wood in the Middle of the Piece, behind the Pile, on\
the second Ground, was feen  triumphal Charior, finely adorned with\
Carring and Gilding, and Children with Garlands of Palm; the fore\

and the Horfes turning to the right, almoff fronting, got fomewhat\

behind the Ground, on which Foor, leaping; back,, be supporied\

burning Pile, with his right Hand behind him, wherewith he drew\
in the Rem, as if he were going to stop; looking back, he was at\

pointing upwards with his right Hand, and Scepter, cross his Body,\
and in his lefe holding the Thunder againtt his Thigh. Behind the\
Chariot, above Hercutes, to the right side, the Ground rofe up hilly.\
Behind the Horfes were feen high Pine -trees and Cypreffes, and some\
broken Stems; and behind Bfercury were others, fomewhat lower and\
further. On the left side, up to the Horison, appeared the Sea; and,\
not far in it,  Rock almoff in the Form of an aftrighted Man; which\
 judged to be the unhappy Servant Lychas, who was flung into the\
Sea by   Mafter' Fury. On the before-mentioned rocky Hill, food\
 (moaking lar; and next it,  burning Fire-pan and the Club of\
Hercutes. In the Pannel of the llar, was caryed an Eagle with -\
pen Wings, and the Thunder in its Bill; ficting on  Feltoon of Oak-\
leaves. In the Front of the Piece, on the left Side, lay  very large\
Body of an old Tree, fore up by the Roots; and the Hole in the\
Ground, thereby made, was fill apparent; the Roots, abounded with\
Fibres, and the other End came forwards to the middle of the Piece,\
where it went into the Frame. Here and there lay some May-branch-\
es, and Stones thrown off their Bafes. On the Ground, by Psilacte-\
tes, lay Hercules' ivory Bow and Quiver, adorned with Gold, and of \
Size bigger than ordinary; the Strap being cariched with gold Buckles.\
On this Quiver was  small nlaid or chaled Figure repreienting Atro-\
pos, the latt of the fatal, sifters, with her Scifiors.\
This Piece was flrongly lighted from the right side;  little front\

in the Shade of the Trees. The Fore parts of the Horfes, and the\
Opper-pares of Afercury, half way his Thigh, were in the Light;\

larse white Feather hung from it carelefly on the Ground.\
The naked Bodr, on the Pile of Wood, appeared very beautiful;\
the Breaft, fomewhat heaving, received  Rrong Light; the Mufcling\
of the Stomach and Ribs was well expreft, but on the rms and\
Legs fancly; the Toes of the right Foor, which had yet fome Mo\
tion, thrunk inwardly; his Eyes were dying, and the Balls drawn co-\
wards the Corners; the Mouth, fomewhat open, feemed either to\
fend forth Sighs, or fetch Breath, or utter, for the laft Time, some\
moring Words; which raifed the utmoft Sorrow in Philotfetes, and\
melied him into Tears, as  thought. Mercury was almoff naked;\
having only  fmall green Silk Scarf about him, wherein fluck his\
Caducess. The Horfes were winged; and the Head of one appeared,\
but that of the other was hid behind Atercury.\
This Piece was particularly remarkable for the Death of the Heroe;\
and did not ill agree with what we have before in this Work obferved,\
touching the Condition of  Man in  very hot Summer. Owellionless,\
the Poifon not only worked his Body ourwardly, but inflamed and confy-\
med his very Enrrails: For this Reafon,  alfo thought he muft die.\
His Breath was mifty, and his Mouth gaped after Coolnets; his Exe-\
lids, fliff and heavy thro' inward Heat, he could hardly keep open;\
his Sight fmothered by the Steam, and its Motion recarded by the\
Slackness of the oprical Nerves, drew towards the utmoll Corners\
The Sweat broke out and he thined with Wetness thieffy about the\
Breaft, over which waved  thin Damp, like the Fumes of boiling\
Water; which made his Out line nite with the Ground: In this Part it\
was, that the unhappy Heroe had the moft Feeling; and where the\
Blood, leaving the Members and feeking for Shelter, was retiring to\
the Heart; his Breaft was fwelled, and, as he ferched Breath, heaved\
and fet; his Belly was fallen in, and the Ribs were prominent; his\
Upper-parts to the Navel, were of  warm and fiery Colour, yet freh\
and beautiful, as was allo his Face; his Lips were not as yet dead nor\
pale, but his Hands and Feet almoff burned black; his Eye-brows\
appeared drawn fomewhat upwards, as one who, tho' fleepy, srives\
to keep awake; the Arms and Legs were bare, pale and thrunk, as\
partaking of Death; but the Fingers, Knuckles, Knees, and Toes\
were Violet, heightened with Vellow; about the Ribs and Belly were\
seen some red and violet Spots of the Poifon; and his Linnen thoved\
underneath at the Navel, hung in Rags, the major Part whereof was\
under his Body and Thigh, and partly ftained with Blood. Thus the\

 Heroe,  Thunder to the Wicked, lay in Agony.  very much moved, cafl his Eyes downwards fidewife on the pi-\
tiful Body, and spake to Mercury, who looked up at the celeftial Ru-\
ler, with Concern, as if he were faying, \'97 Look Fotber! He is\
expiring. No People were feen thereabouts, except thofe before men\
cioned; nor any Satyrs or Woodgods. Iis certain, that if any have\
been there, Hercules frighted them away in his Rage. The Sorrow of\
Philotteres was, in my Opinion, inexpreffible, and the Arriff therefore,\
with Reafon, had covered his Face. But why Paans Son should be\
with Hercules, without Servants,  could not apprehend; but fancy'\'92,\
it was, becaute the Painter thought it unneceffary, this Bofom friend\
alone fufficiently explaining the Matter;  fecond Reafon might be,\
becaute the Poet mentions nothing of it; and lattly, becaute the Mat-\
ter clears itfelf fo well, that any Addicion would alter it, and, inslead\
of an unexpetted  make it rather appear as  premeditated Funeral\
Solemnity. Whence, we may well infer, that the Pile was not prepa\
red for him, but that he himfelf made it on  fudden; as the Poet\
relates.\
This atful Piece was remarkable for thefe three Things naturally\
and plainly expreft; to wit, the Fact irfelf; what preceded, and what\
followed. The Beginning of the Tragedy was, when, having receiv-\
ed the poitoned Shirt of Neffus, by Lychas, he offered it at the Altar\
to Tupster his Father. The Sequel of his Rage appeared by that un\
happy Wretchs being cafl into the Sea, and metamorphifed into \
Rock; after which, he burned himfelf; and his fucceeding Triumph\
was shewn by the Charict which Tupiter fends him for his Deificati-\
on. Renafcitur ex Junere Phanix.\
The Conclutions to be made from the Perfons of Nefus, Deianira\
and Lychas may be thefc.\
We learn from the Centour how dangerous the Gifts of Enemies\
are; the Caufe of the great Heroe' Death. In Deiaring we difcover\
her imprudent and indifcrect Paftion, and the Effelts of her Jealouty;\
which made her the Inttrument of her Husbands Death; and in Ly-\
chas, we obferve the miferable Reward of his Services, and that the\
Misfortunes of Servants are fomerimes by the Great to conftrued as to\
render Obedience and Difobedience equally culpable.\
Over the Door, oppofite to the former Piece, was feen another in\

Amphitrye, being with Alemeng in her Bed chamber, had, before\
he went to Bed, laid the two Children, Ipbiclas and Hercules, in his\
Shield, under  Pavillion; into which, June, full of Spite and Rage,\
call two Serpents, in order to devour the two innocents, especially\
Hereales; who (queered them to Deach, and flung them at Amphitryes\
Feet.\
Forwards, on the left Side, one Step high, were feen the two Chif\
drenlying in the Shield, encompatted with  Balluftrade running from\
the forepart of the Piece towards the Point of Sight, and which took\
up two thirds of the Piece. Ampbirrys, at the Children' Cry, leap-\
ing out of Bed with an undrawn Sword in his Hand, came to lee\
what was the matter; and, having one Foot on the Step, he met with\
the young Hercales, looking at him with  Smile, and grafping, with\
borh Hands, one of the Serpents, which he fqueezed to Death; the\
other lying already at his Feet. Amazed at this, Anphitrye farced\
back: The other Child, bawling out, lay, half rumbled out of the\
Shield, with  Pillow and Part of the Cloaths on the Floor. Behnd\
Hercufes, and beyond the Shield hung the Tbeban Princes purple Man\

were tied together. Over them,  litle backward, the baulked  was feen mounting upwards, encompafted with  dark Cloud, with\
her Scepter by her side in her left Hand, and, with the other lified\
up. feeming to threaten with her Fift, and looked down frowning at\
the Children. Somewhat further, bevond the Balluftrade, in the mid\
dle of the Piece, role  or  Step:, feiched in by an Hland rail, reach-\

middle of the Piece, was  large and deep Compassniche or Alcove,\
having  Curtain drawn up and faftened, on each Side, with two\
Kings; herein ftood the Bed. The Apartment was  Feer high, and\
hims with Tapefiries; and over them, as far as  could perceive, the\
Wall was divided into Pannels, wherein were some faint Batsreliess, re-\
prefenting warlike Acts. On the left Side of the Alcove, in the Corner,\
was  round Pedeftal or half Column, whereon ffood  burning Lamp\

Hindworks were feen, by the Torch, in  dim Light, except the\
Corner wherein the Lamp food; which, with the Door, adorned with\
fine Foliage, thewed fomewhat Rronger. From June proceeded fome\
light Rays, darting on the Children and thereabours. This Light was\
not like that of  Candle, but of the Day or Thunder: It mottly fell\
on the Under-parts of the Child in the Shield; his Upper-parts and\
Head, with fomewhat of the Pillow, tumbled out, were in the Shade;\
he turned in the Shield his Opper-parts one Way, and his Under-ones,\
another; which were forethortened. Amphitrye' Upper-parts, almoft\
to the Middle, were in the Shade of the Clouds, receiving frong Re-\
fexions from the Children and the Floor.  food pondering, how\
Alemend came by the lighted Torch; but, on  narrow Inspection,\
found  large gold Candleflick ftanding near her, by the other Pedeftal;\
and  wondered why Alcens' Son had not taken it, yet, on further\
Confideration, concluded, that, thro' Hurry and Fear, he overlooked\
it, as ufual on fuch Occations; which Afemens perceiving, the proba-\
bly jumped, out of Bed and fezed it. Such was this Picture. Thefe\
thiee Lights were finely and diffinctly obferved: The Lamp,\
which\
was diftant, gave  whire or pale Light, but lomewhat foggy\
The\
Flame of the Torch was, almoft to the Wick, covered by the Clouds\
under Juno; which, as far as  could apprehend, was an artful Sleight\
of the Mafter, in order to render the foremolt Light the brighter and\
Rronger; and to avoid the Necefficy of making the whole Piece dark;\
which otherwife he muft have done for the fake of Naruralness.\
Tune had  Diadem, and  light blue Garment, her Head attire\
was wild, and her Locks flying about like Serpents.\
The Poets mention, that Hercules was reprefented by the Ancients;\
as an Example of all Virtues, as well of the Body as the Soul; iqueez:\
ing Serpents to Death with his Hands, even in his Cradle; by which\
they give us to underfland, that  Man, firted for Heroifm, ought,\
from his Infancy, to fhun Pleafures, and mortify carnal Affections.\
Now, thinking to go out of the Aparment, to fee what was fur-\

Eye to Hercules, and obferved, that he was without his Club and\

by the Troop of Pigmies. The other shewed his awaking, and hiding\

hre we proceed in our Relation, let us thew what the Heathens uns\
derfood by the Deification of Hercules.\
Hercules, the Glory of valiant Men, shews us, by his Deification;.\
that thofe who attempt that Honour in their Life-times, as Autbony.\
with his Chopatra did, or strive to obtain it by intreating and cajoling.\
the People, as moft of the Persun Kings and Romulus did, milake the\
the right Method; whereas Herculess whole Life was taken up in:\
freeing the World from Monfters and Tyrants; and no Divine Honours\
were paid him till after his Death; for Eternity, which he obtained\
only by Death, teaches, that true Virtue will not be flactered in this\
Life; as Aexander proved to thofe who were before hand for calling\
him  God, by shewing them the Blood which iffued from his Wounds,.\
in the fame Manner as from other Morcals. How powerful and virtuous.\

her Under-garment, as well as  could perceive by the Sleeve, was\
dark Violer, and her Head elegantly wound with Fillets of many\
Colours, the Ends whereof hung down her Back. The Virgin, who\
took down the Ieapons, had  pale apple-bloffom-coloured Garment.\
The Melfenger was feen fidewile,  little hindwardly, in  small\
sold fringed Mantle, dark Grey or blackith, hanging halfway down\
his Back; his Under-coat was light Grey, and reached below the\
Knees; his Buskins were of Beatts Skin; he had  Dagger by his\
Side, or ttuck in his Cirdle, with  small Staff in his Hand; his Hel\
met, having  Dragon\'92 Head, and two Wings on top like thofe of \
Bat, lay by him; his brown Skin thone with Sweat, as did his Hair,\
which was not long, yer ried behind.\
The Apartment received its Light from the right Side, through \
large Compals headed Window, which fell firongly on the Qucen,\
and about her,  little forward : She cauted  Groundshade on the\
Corner of the Table; by which the Marron'\'92 Under-parts were well\
fet off. The Meffenger was moftly in Shade, as being more forward\

ran  Spout of Water, upon  Cloth or two, and  Spunge lying in\

Over againtt this Piece, on the oppofite Wall, was the Sequel of the\
preceding, in  Picture.\
Here Semiramis was feen fetting out from her Court, with an ex-\
traordinary Majetty and Courage. She defcended the Steps very airily.\
 martial Fire feemed to inflame her Heart; which gave  Glow to\
her Cheeks; her kyes (parkled like two Stars. If the had not an\
Helmer,  should, by her Dress and Accoutrements, have taken her\
for  Diana going  hunting. Every thing was in Readiness for her\
March, even to her Robe; which the refuled to put on, contented on-\
ly with  Bow and rrows and her Authority. The waiting Women\
ran up and down Stairs, one bringing this, another that; one of the\
chief put the royal Helmet on her Head;  Foorfiool was fet for her,\
below on the Stairs, whilft the other was girding the Sword about\
her. The curvetting Horfe, inured to War, ffood ready at the Stair-\
foot. The Trumpers founded, and the People, full of Defire, crowd\

were drawn up in the Inner-court. The Meffenger ran down the fum\
ther Steps; and the Matron above, in the Gateway, was gaping and\
ftaring at the Preparations. The Sky was clear, and feemed to tavour\
the Princels' Enterprize.\
Having, thro' Hurry, but tranfieatly viewed thefe Things,  could\
not poffibly well remember every Circumftance, to as to give  true\
Delcription of that excellent Piece; wherefore, attentively placing\
myfelf before it, my Obfervations were as follows.\
On the left Side was feen  magnificent Portico, with four lonic Co-\
lumns fupporting their Ornaments; and on each Side,  Ballultrade\
and Plinch, running down gor  Steps, to  large Pedeftal, whereon\

 Lioneffes, caped and covered, whole Bodies were full of Syrise\
Charalters The Gate was circular headed; and over it  Key-fone\
which fupported the Cornice, and wherein was  bronzed Lion' Head\
Over each Column, in the Frize, were the fame Sorts of Heads; and\
between them,  faint carved Quiver and lighted Torch across. On\
each Side, in the lings of the Portico, was  Niche, the Bottoms\
whereof were even with the Sill of the Door, and running towards\
the Point of Sight. At the Excremities, of thote Wings, were two\
other Columns, flanding againtt  Wall, which ran, on  low Ground,\
to the middle of the Piece. This Wall was divided by flat Falcias,\
in the Narure of Pilafters; and, between them, were circular Open-\
ings, through which was feen the Inner-court, and above the Wall,\
 Side, running, deep in the Piece, towards the Point of Sight. Ar\
the End of the faid Wall was fuch another, parallel with the fore\
moft, which bounded the inner-court; and, further behind, some Palm\
and other Trees rofe above it. On the Fore-ground, on the right\
side, the Ground was rugged up to the Landing-place of the Steps,\
defcending into the Fore-court; in the middle of which ftood  large\
Fountain, of white Marble, refting on  Balis of  or  Arches,\
which were fupported by fquire, fmooth and high Pillars, of the Do.\
 or Ruttick Order, divided by ruflicated or Rock-like Blocks; over\
this Work arofe, inflead of an Entablature,  large Plinth, three\
Feet high, of whice Marble, like the Figures. On the rop, in the\
middle, riting  or  Steps, ffood  large terreftrial Globe, lupported\
by  Sphinses; on which Globe fat  Woman, with her Fore-parts\
towards the Court, holding high, in her right Hand,  Sun, and\
downwards, in her left,  Moon. On her Helmet was an Eagle with\
(pread Wings, and on her Breaftornament  Lion' Head Her Dress\
was like that of an Herome. On the loweff Steps, next the Plinth,\
fat the four Parts of the World, fettered againtt some Trophies. Be.\
low, between the Pillars, were Copperbronzed Bafons, which re-\
ceived some Spouts of Water from within, out of  Rock. This\
huge Pile ftood in the middle of the Piece, againft the Point of Sight,\
half behind the Wall. The Fore-court was rough; and at the fur\
ther End had Steps afcending as aforefaid.\
Thus was the Plan of this Picture, and the Difpolition of all the\
fixed Work;  shall now, to the beft of my Skill, defcribe the\

was  little fronting; and the held the Robe high in her lett Hand,\
that it might not drag, and, with the richt, kept the reft clofe to\
her Body; her dark Head actire was flrongly fet off againtt the white\
Furr, of Eining of the Robe; and her Locks, thro' her fwift Mo-\

She was girt jult under the Breall, and had white Sandals: The Gown\

Her Garment was Rofe-colour. The Matron, near the Cate-way,\

with the Foorffool, and  little beyond her. Quite on the right side,\
Tomewhar further, flood two Trumpetesturned towards the inner Court,\
girt with Beafts Skins, and founding: Their Trumpets, almoft like\
thote of the Romans, were winding like Serpents, with Dragon' Heads\
at the Ends of them. On the further side of the Qucen, the Meffen.\
ger appeared running down the Steps, quire over his Poife; pointing,\
with his right Hland  little forethorcened, forwards at the inner Court,\
with his Face towards the Qucen: By the lirtle flying Mantle behind\
him, might be perceived the Swifiness of his Motion; his Action, like\
that of  fiving Mfercary, being free and extenfive: He fiung out his\
left Leg, and his right Foot was quite behind, and off the Ground.\
The People, on the second Ground, below Stairs to the Pedeftal of the\
firl Ballustrade, were feen between his Legs: Thefe People, as well\
Men, as Women and Children, ffood, fome wringing their Hands,\
others lifting them up high, some embracing, others clapping their\

almoff Mouth to Mfouth; with his right Hand pointing up to Heaven,\
and with his left, giving her  friendly Look, he pulled her by the\
Sleere, as if he would have her take hearr. Some Children were lying\
on, and crawling up the Steps. In the Fore-court some Troops of\
Horie were leen purting themfelves into Order, and others mounting\
their Horfes On the further Side of the Place, other People were\
coming running down the Steps. The Offskip behind them, on the\

there, from the Opening,  little Light on their Under parts and Legs.\
The Gare was low, becaute the Ground run off floping from the Steps;\
the Ground, with the Hind-part of the Horfe being thaded by it. The\
Horfeand young Manreceived (mall but very frong Lights and Shades.\
The Trumpetesand Gate were rongly reflected from the left Side.\
The People on the fecond Ground, againft the Balluftrade, were moftly\
lighted from on high, by the Blue of the Sky, and could have no Re-\
flexion, becaute they food parallel, along the Stairs. Behind the\
Wall, with round Openings againtt the Angle of the Wings of the\
Portico, arofe the Top or Leating of  large Palm-tree; which broke\
the Length of the faid Wall; at the same time cauling the Excremities\
of the Wings to unite agreeably with the Innercourt. The Portico,\
fronting the Light, was, with the Balluftrades, of Pisan and Egyp-\
lian Marble, with white Ornaments. The Lioneffes on the Pedefials\
were of Serpentine. The upper Steps were of whice Marble with\
Eyes. The large and pacious Landing, at the Foot of the Steps, was\
of Free-ffone; and the Ground, on the right side, fomewhar Ruffet,\
mixt with Earth.\
The Matron had, as in the former Piece,  dark Fillemot Upper-\
garment, over  Violetone; and her Head was elegantly wound. The\
young Virgins were alfo as before. She, who girt the Princess with\
the Sword, had an apple bloffom -coloured Garment; her Coat being\
tucked up behind; her Hlead attire was light againtt the dark greenith\
blue Garment of her, who, flanding one Step higher in the Shade, was\

Figures were fmall Life, and finely wrought.\
Berween thofe Bais-reliefs itood  fquare Pedeftal in  Niche, and\

on the cop whereof lay  little Dragon, whole Neck curled down the\
Fore-part of ir. The Pedeital was Porphiry, and the Figure mafff\

the Pillars and Pilalters of Eciptian Marble.\
Orer the Niche was an oblong arure-blue Table or Fafcia, and\

when in its ancient State. Forward was feen  large Plain, encom.\

is probable, the Arriff introduced, in order to make the Place the\
more remarkable; and tho' it may be doubted, whether they have\
been of to long standing, ver we may eafily admit it. On the right\
Side was :epretented the proud Capirot, of Marble, and collly Archi\
recture after the Rovm Order, alcended by  lpacious Flight of Steps.\
On the top was this Intcription in Gold Letters, SENATUSPOPV.\
LUSOUE ROMANUS, . . The Senate and People of Rome.\
Here, ther were mounting the Steps with the Armson Pikes. Horati.\
as followed, shearhing his Sword. Behind him, his unhappy Sifter\
dropped down backwards. The People, from all Corners, flocked to\
gether, muttering and cufing his Cruely; but he, regardles of it,\
boldly went forward. Before the Steps, about  or  Paceslength, the\
Ground was paved with large grey Stones; the Refidue being rugged or\
uneven. The foremoll Weapon bearer, entering the Gare, held his\
Trophy fomewhat flooping within it: He was leen from behind, hav-\
ing almoll the fame Altion as the Gladiator, his left rm excended,\
and his right Leg on the Threshold. The fecond, two or three Steps\
down, held his Weapon up againtt his Body, looking back at the\
third, who followed clole, and was speaking to him. This poifed on\
his left Leg, having his right very much bent, and the Toes of it on \
Step higher; his Upper-pares fwayed  little to the left, with his Head\
forwards; holding the Pike, in his left Hand, againtt his right Breaft,\
and the Bottom of it with his right Hand. The chird carried the Tro-\

Back fwaying  little forwards, with his Elbow flanding out, fetting\
his right Foor on the Steps; the left being quite behind, and off the\

Thofe three Men were called Velites, or light armed, and dreft in Lin-\

forward in hafte. With his Face fronting he looked down on the\
Scabbard; having on his Head an Helmet crowned with Laurel and\
Oak-leaves; with  Feather behind, which, by the Turn of his Head\
and the Swifinets of his Walk, flew to and fro.  Mantle, faftened\
on his right Shoulder, and tucked under his Chin, hung  little over\
his left Shoulder; one Flappet of it flew behind, and the other for-\
wards, flinging over his left Leg. The Straps under his Coat of Ar-\
mour and on the Arms were short and broad, and rounding at Bot-\
toms. His Buskins came half-way up the Legs.  little from him\
forwards was feen the expiring Virgin, falling back, with her Feet ex-\
tended towards him, and Arms (pread wide, the right lifted up, and\
the left finking; her Breaft turned to the Light; her right Hip fvel-\
led, her Thigh was at full Length, and the Leg  little forethortened;\
the left Leg hid under the right: Her Face, allo forethortened, lean-\

was naked; her Breaft-garment, girt under the Breaft, was fying up-\
wards; her Upper-garment finking, fhing over her right Leg, and \
Flappet of it hung over her left Arm; her light Treffes, by her Tum-\
ble, flew upwards. Beneath her,  little more to the left Side, was\
an aged Woman supporting the noble Virgin, and, hricking out, be-\
holding the Murcherer; the, with her Breaft downwards, and left\
Hand on the Ground, and right Hand lified up, was staying, with\
her Body, the Back of the droppine Roman Virgin: Her Head\
was wound with Cloths and Fillers. Jult behind her appeared the\
half of  Pedeltal, whereon lay one of the aforefaid Lioneffes; and,\
fomewhat further behind the Fellow of it, running towards the\
Point of Sight Two Soldiers followed Horatius; who, in Diffatif-\
faction, feemed to turn back. Not far behind the Conqueror were\
some Spectators highly difcontented; some were pointing at him,\
some menacing, others disdainfully turning their Backs upon him,\
 It looked as if we heard them grumble. On the Fore-\

came haftily running to fee what was the Marter; he had on  short\
Coat, with an Herdimens Cap on his Head, and  Flute and Scrip\

the Cupitol, Part of  Wall, with its Architrave and  large compass-\
headed Gareway, ran towards the Point of Sight. This Wall extend.\
ed from thence cross through the Piece, by the Point of Sight, to\
the left Side, and was divided by ruflicated Doric Pilafters, into\
Squares, wherein were fmall Niches. Out of this Gate, juft below\
the Wall, some Cartle, as Oxen, Cows, Goats and Sheep were coming,\
with  Shepherd, who, at the Noife, was looking back. This Shep-\
herd and Cartle coming in at the Gate, made me believe, he came\
from the Marker, becaufe it was behind the Capitel. Over the Wall\
appeared feveral fine palace-like Buildings; as allo  Column, where\
on was placed  She-wolf, with the two Children Romulus and Remus.\
Above the Angle of this Wall, on the right Side, in the Offskip,\
was feen, as well as  could guess, the Rock Turgerd, riting up very\
high; but neither the Pantheon, Mente Cavalle, Vatican or Coloffeum,\
as not being as yet known: No Ruins nor broken Buildings appeared\
here, but all beautiful and whole, except fome little Houfes; fince\
the Town had not been an hundred Vears tanding, nor before ruined.\
On the left Side, forward in the Corner, on  ruing Ground, food  by the Trough of  Fountain, aftonithed and crying out, who\
feemed as if the were going away; lifting up one Hand on high, and\
holding out the other to  young Girl, who came running in Confuli-\

Fountain Hood againtt  large Pyramid, which run towards the\
Point of Sight. several ordinary-drelt People, Men, Women and\
Children, came running in Groups,  or  together, from behind the\
Pyramid; others were recurning from thence. The young Girl, who\
came running in Confulion, had  thort Coar, and was barefoored, and\
her Hair very meanly ced behind. Thefe People and Objects with the\
Pyramid, filled up almoft  fourth Part of the Piece.  Row of low\

Trees.\
This Piece was lighted from the right Side, yet  liile fronting.\
The Crpirof gave  large Ground shade over the Steps beyond the two\
Arms-bearers, and continued beyond Horatins, over two or three Men,\
who ftood behind him, againtt whom he was flrongly fet off. The\
Side -walls, with the Gare, reached half the Height of the Building; the\

and Children, was kept fomewhat darkith, by reafon of  Cloud; ex-\
cept the top of the Pyramid, which received  clear Light. The Sky\
was full of Clouds, especially in the middle, and on the left Side of\
the Point of Sight, behind the Houfes.\
The Romans, in thofe Days, except People of the firlt Rank, wore\
little of no Variety in the Colours of their Cloaths; they were moft-\
ly white, or elfe light grey Woollen. For this Reafon, as  conjec-\
ture, the Deligner of thefe Pictures had made the principal Persons to\
excel; for  perceived, that the People were moftly in Grey or White;\
Some,  little Ruffct, others inclining to Green. Few among them,\
except aged People, had long Gowns or Garments. Horatius' Coat\
of Armour thewed Colden; the Straps under it, and on the Arms,\
were elegancly embroidered on  fillemot Ground; his Mantle was\
yellowith Whire, with Violet Reffexion. The Scabbard of his Sword\
was dark Blue, finely wrought; the Hill reprefented an Eagles\
Head: His Buskins, tied with white Strings, but quite fouled,\
as  judged, by Sand and Duft, were Purple. His Sifters Upper-gar-\
ment was light Blue; her Breaft-garment light Vellow, with violet\
Reffexion, almofl like that of her Brother. The aged Woman be-\
neath her was twarthy-skinn\'92; her Garment greenith Blue, and\
plain. The Lioneffes were dark Porphiry, and the Pyramid, of  rocky\
Stone.\
Having fufficiently viewed this Picture, and exactly learnt all the\
Circumftances of it,  took infinite Delight in feeing how naturally the\
Occurrence was exprefted, and that nothing was fuperfluoully introdu-\
ced, tho' the Story does not make meation of all the Perfons who\
were brought into this Reprefentation.  thought, it is truly of great\
Moment, that the principal Parts of  Story be well expreffed; and\
herein,  good Mafter has Work enough to give each Perfon his due\
Paffion, to the end the Matter may lpeak for ittelf: But it becomes\
kill more excellent by the Addition of all other necelfury Circum-\
Rances (tho' not to be found in the Hifforian) after fuch  Manner\
that both appear natural.\

the Relidue unred with the Ground. Behind his Back, the She-wolf\

 on the other side, were half lod in the Ground. terfory, fying\
between RMid and Tylam, held, in her right Hand,  Crown of\

  Triumph, on account of the mournful Accident,\
to much af\
felted me, that  remained in Sufpence; not knowing,\
for fear of \
miferable Iffue, whether  might turn to the following\
Piece: Never-\
thelels, confidering the Bravery of Horatins' Explot,\
whereon de-\
pended the Power of Rome,  took heart, in hopes of\
his Preferva-\
tion, which  found agreeable to the Writer' Relation.\
Horatins then was secured for the Murther of his Sifter, and, ac\
cording to Law, fentenced to be pur to Death: Ver, in Confideration\
of his heroic Action, pardoned, on Condition that his Father paid, as\
 Fine,  certain Sum of Money into the publick Treafury. The\
Pilture, as  remember, was thus:\
Secend Piffure.\
At the Cupitol, Tufice, or the Reman Law, fat in  raifed Chair,\
with the Scales in her lefr, and  Poleax in her right Hand. In one\
Scale lay  Sword, and in the other,  Crown of Laurel with  Palm-\
branch; this lacter far over-ballancing the other Scale, as  Token\
that the Law is mitigaced by Mercy. The Criminal food very de-\
jected before her, with his Hands iron\'92 behind him. On her left\
Side, the Father, on his Knees, was offering  Veffel of Money at\
her Feer: On her right flood Afercy, with-holding the Hand wherein\
was the Pole-ax, and with the other pointing at  Picture, held by\
some Children, reprefenting the decayed Roman Dominion reffored by\
the Valour of Horatius. Further were feen the Arms of the three\
Rain Brethren, planred there by himself round the Starue of ROMA,\
whereon Tuflice had lixed her Eyes. Another Child, crowned with\
Laurel, was loofing the Fetters of the Aecuted with one Hand, and\
putting on his Helmet, or feeting up the Cap of Liberty, with the\
other. On each side of the Throne was  Bassrelict, and over\
them two Niches: in that on the right side was reprefented Numa\
Pompilins, and in that on the left Lycurgus, two of the moff anci-\
ent Legiflators. The Bals-relef under Nums exhibited the Example\
of Charenhss, who, to enforce his Law, Rabbed himself, in full Se-\
nate, for having acted contrary to it: And under Lycurgas, that of\
Setencs, when, for his Sons Sake, who, by Law, had forfeired his\
Eyes, he caufed one of his own to be put out. So firict were the an=\
crent Romans in Support of their Laws. Over the Throne hung two\
Tables, containing the Reman Laws, written in Greef Letters of Gold.\

Book VIII\
 unexpected Erent much rejoiced me; wherefore, full of De.\
fire,  went to  third Picture, in order to observe on what Bafis fo\
great  Work was built, and found it as follows.\
Jullas Hefilias, cholen by the Reman People for their third King;\
on account of his great Ability and Merit, invaded the Alban Teri\
fory, tho'  four People, and bearing much Sway in Iraty. Thefe,\
weakened by many Battles, at laft agreed with the Romans to end\
the Dispuce by  Combat between three Brothers on each side; thofe\
of the Remans were named Heratir, and of the Albans, Curatir.\
The Fight was glorious, yet doubtful, but at laft fortunate for\
the Ronins; for, one of the Horatis, after having loft his two Bro-\
thers, miftrulting his Strength againt three fuch brave Enemies, add\
ed Policy to his Courage, and, by an artful Sleight, flew the three\
Caraiii one after another; and thus got the Viltory.\
Third Pitture.\
Here appeared the Place of Combat, fenced in. On the right Side\
was feen the General of the Roman Forces, and on the other, at  he of the Albans, both firting fomewhat high, with their\
Badges of Dillindion. In the middle of the Piece, Horatins was re-\
pretented turning Tail to the latt of the Curatis; but returning, he\
run his Puriuer thro' the Breaft; whereupon, he fell backwards. The\
second,  little from thence, was on his Knees, with his Face to the\
Ground, and all bloody, bearing up  little on his Elbow: He lay,\
about the middle of the Fence, againtt  Poft, whereon ftood the Fi-\
gure of Fate, or Fortune in Copper. Jult beyond this Poft, lay the\
third Rreiched our on his Back: And at the End of the Paling were\
feen the two dead Horatis. Over the valiant Heroe, Viftory shewed\
herfelf, with the left Hand crowning him with Laurel, and, with the\
right, holding our  Cap and Staff to the Chief of the Romans; who\
thereupon joyfully came down from his Seat, with the Acclamations\
and Clappines of the People. Oppofite, ffood the Chief of the con\
trary Party affonithed, and turning his Back, in order to go awaj.\
The People withdrew in Tumule at the Sound of the Roman Trum-\
pets; leaving their Field-badges in the Place. On the right Side, be\
hind the Romans, appeared Part of the Town wall, and on the \
ther, behind the Albans up to the Wall, the Field full of Tents on\
 low Ground. Over the Reman Arbiter, or Umpire, was feen Ro-\
matss and Remus cut in  large Stone. The Field-badge of the  Architecture.\
Chap.  was  Dragon or Harpy. In the Offskip appeared the Tiber, and\
the Alps always covered with Snow.\
Thus was the Plan of this artful Piece, which  thought no lets wor\
derful than the others, in Force and Dispofition as well as Naturalnels.\
Every Thing was exactly obferved; the Paffions and Motions to well\
expreffed, the Place to plainly apparent, the Quality of the By-works\
to proper, and the Lights, Shades, Colours, Coc. to advantageoutly di=\
sribured, that  could fcarce believe it  Picture.  could not but ad-\
mire the three remarkable Divissons of this Story: As firft, the Begin-\
ning, bappening without the Town; fecondly, The Sequel, seen within the\
Town; and lanly, The End of the Scory, or, what was tranfulted in\
the Capitot; without any Thing of Moment intervening, from whence\
 Painter could make  Picture:  speak, with respect to the different\
Matter, which opportunely offers to the Thoughts and Execution of  Mafter.\
As the Sente of the Story is very particular, to the three Pictures\
were as excellent from firft to laft. In the firff, we perceive the lucky\
Chance of Arms; or, the Valour of the Heroe, whereby he gained\
the Repure of  Deliverer of his Country: in the Second, we confider\
him as  Murtherer; or, the Accident as  bloody Triumpb, and him\
elaced with his succets: And, in the Third, we fee him as  Aalefactor,\
condemned to be put to Death; or, as one who had tranfgreffed the\
Laws. Truly, thole three Events may ferve for intiructive Examples\
to all Men. Do we not fee in them the common Courfe of the World.\
and that too great Success and Prosperity make many Men proud and\
infolent? And what do not their blind Pallions lead them ro! Certain-\
ly, Unthankfulness to Heaven is the Prelude to many Difatters and\
Errors, leading them into the greatelt Dangers However, all Things\
are governed by Providence.\
The Middle of the Cieling had  large Oval Piece, wherein Provis.\
dence was, in the greateff Depth, repretenced fitting on  Globe, dreit\
in Gold Stuff, with her Head crowned, and about it twelve glictering\
Stars; having in her right Hand  Scepire, with an Eye on Top; on\
her Breaft,  sun; and on her Knee holding  Lookingglats with her\
left Hand; her Look was full of Majefty and Authorny: She pointed\
downwards at Roma, who fat  little to the left side, on  Cloud, ar-\
tended by. Religion, Valear, and Concerd. Long Life, Health, and\
Prosperity, came gently waving down towards her. Long Life, was .\
beautiful Virgin in her Prime, with  Flame of Fire on her Head,\
and  Serpent, with the Tail in its Mouth, in her fland. Health, was\
IEJcus\

TEsculapins, holding  Stiff, about which twined  Serpent. Prospe.\
riry appeared as  naked Vouth, crowned with Laurel, with  Cor.\
na Cogra, full of Fruit, under his Arm. Retigion, or Piety, was dreff\
like  Vefal, holding, in her right Hand,  Cup emitting  Flame,\
and looking up at Previdence. Valour was reprefented like an Herey.\
fes, with his Club and Lion\'92 Skin. Concerd looked fomewhat more\
compoted than Piety; having in her Arms,  Bundle of Rods, which\
 Cuordned with  red Ribbon. ROMIA, dreft in Whice, or light\
Blne, under  purple Robe embroidered with old, held in her right\
Hand,  Pike, and in the left,  Laurel-branch; on her Head the\
had an Helmet, and Buskins on her Legs.\
Now, we ought to weigh the Meanings of thefe Things. Provi.\
dine is to be contidered as the chief Ruler of worldly Affairs; de.\
baling and railing Empires as the pleafes. The three Cifes of long\
Life, Health and Profferity are Bleftings flowing from her. The cor-\
poreal Virtues are the Effects of Might, whence they proceed: The\
firtt is Religion; the second, Valour; and the third, Concord; thefe\
eftablithed ROMd in her Power, and increated it. In relation to Art,\
let us obterve, with what ingenuity and Oncommonness the Maffer has\
executed thote Pictures:  fav, Oncommonness; fince  never faw them\
handied by any other after such  Manner. Firft, Previdence is in the\
greatell Depth; and, according to Guets, thrice as big as the Lifs.\
The three bifts, which the iends down, being fomewhat lower, are\
not batf to brg; and the undermolt, to wit, ROMA, and the Charac\
ters accompanying her, are still smaller, yet fomewhat larger than the\
Lite.\
Providence has no Bounds, always maintaining her uncontrolled\
Power, without Dimmution; and tho' the three Gifes, which fow\
from her, are but small Purts, yer, with respect to the undermoll\
Figures, they are much bigger; and keep among them their own Forms,\
as reigning over them. The three others, on the undermoft Clouds, being\
but corporeal Virues, are therefore much smaller than the preceding,\
and appear with less Majelty: Neverthelefs ROMA excels, and seas\
Berself bigger; intimating thereby her Growth and Improvement\
Her firting on Clouds implies, in my Opinion, her rifing above all \
ther Powers of the World\
This would be  montirous Delign, if Art, with respect to Per.\
pettire, were nor duely obferved: But, by this means, the Piece look\
ed to perfell, that  judged it could not otherwife be good; for the\

Of Architetture.\
Chap. I Croup, as quite low, was very flrong; the middlemolt,\
according to its Diftance, fomewhat fainter; and the uppermofl, very\
faint, and almofl imperceptible.\
This Emblem bears  myfterious Interpretation, and may, in gene-\
ral, be applied to all the Governments in the World, provided the Fi-\
gure of ROMA be atter\'92, and another fubffiruted, as Things require.\
inftead of Esculapius we may reprefent Health, by the Figure of  and in the Place of Hercules, the fame; taking for Valour an\
Heroine, holding an Oaken Branch in her right Hand, with  Lyon\
on her Shield.\
In treating formerly of this Sort of Tables, we have called them\
Emblematicas, carrying  myftic Senfe, whether they be mundane or\
(piritual: However, as  Diftinction between both, and to thew that\
this is mundane and hifforical, we muff obferve, that it is not in-\
termixed with any emblematic Figures, which have  fpiritual Sente,\
except thole of Esculapins and Hercules, which therefore in this\
Work  reject as untit, and only proper for poetic and fabulous Sub-\
jells: As if, inflead of ROMA, were introduced Trejs or Egine,\
which are Dominions no where now fublifling but in the poetic Wri-\
tings; we find that this Emblem, like its Subject, is not only\
mundane and heathenith, as the Story of Horatins proves, but that\
therein is alfo expreft the Force or myfterious Senfe by thofe heathen-\
ith Figures.\
Now, if it be asked, why this Cieling-piece does not allude to the\
Perfon of Heratins, as that in the tenth Chapter to Hercules: My\
Opinion is, that the Conclulion of the Story, to far as it respects him,\
is contained in the second Picture: For here we cannot expect any De-\
ification, nor do the Gods interfere in the Marter: They regard only\
thole who are reckoned in their Number, fuch as TEneds, Hercules,\
Memnon, and others of godly Racc.\

  AP. KIII. The Fable of Califio, adapted to the Corinthian\
Order, in the Upper-fory.\
  delighted to relate here, in four Pieces, the wonderfully em-\

fion whereof renders this Work moft perfect.\

The arit Piece was as follows.\
Coll cired with hunring, went to repote in the Shade of the\
Trees; Tupiter enamour\'92 with her, came to delude her in the Shape\
of Dirrs, and gracined his Paftion, notwithflanding all her Efforts to\
+\
the contiary.\
There, on the right Side of the Piece, on an Eminence, the inno.\
cent Creature was luting under the Trees, not at reft, but full of Con.\
cern, Shame, and Dread, melred into Tears, with her Hand on the\
Edge of  Fountan; her Treties, half looted, hung carelctly over her\
naked Shoulders; her chalt Borom was above half bare, and her Legs\
ancover\'92 to Encemlineis, fufficiently thewed her forrowful Facc.  the Aucher of it, was feen  little off, next the Middle of the\
Piece, above the Horizon, not as  difguited or pretended Dinnd, but\
the Chief of the Gods, thinng with Majefty, with his Diadem on his\
Head, and in his purple Robe; not as  Thunderer, with Lighinings\
and Tempeits, bur only actended by his Eagle. The cruel and dege\
nerace Lover feemed to deride her Sorrow, having his left fland up at\
his Breall, as if he meant, that he had got his Will; wherefore, pe-\
netraring the Clouds, he advanced thro' the Air, fortaking the mife-\
rable Homan. The unmerciful incendiary, Cupid, was excinguthing\
his Torch in the Fountain, looking at Tupiter, who, with his pont-\
ing Scepter, commanded him to do fo. Disns was teen in the Off\
skip, in  Valler, with her Retnue of Numphs. The Landship was\
delightful and woodr: Here and the easreard tome River gods. Be-\
hind Caj-, among the Trees, flood  lerm of Priagus in Shade. \
attentively viewed the aforelaid three Figures, and reflected to mylelf,\
how well they acted their Parts; clearly openng the diatter, even to\
the very Term, which, tho' it might be placed there accidentally,\
yet contribured towards the Exprestion.\
Secend Pictitie.\
The unhappy Cal , bemoaning her Misforcune, and full of Shame\
and Fear, and difcarded by her Mistrets, was fecking Shelcer in Joh\
tudes: Ver the jealous June elpyed and found her there.\

to Flight. Being now metamorphifed into to frightful  Montter, by\
the immoveable Jealouty of June; the, in her Flight, looked up to\

Areas, Son of the deluded and now metamorphifed Califfe, was\
fifteen Years of Age, when, according to his Cultom, going  hunting,\
he met with  frightful She bear, which came towards him, not to\
hurt him, as he thought, but, if poffible, to make herfelf known to\
him; yet he, ignorant that the was his Mother, ffourly prepard to\
thoot her. Tupiter, from Heaven, feeing this, in Pity, hindred\
the Matricide.\
Third Pifture.\
Here, on the right Side of the Piece, Areas appeard gent-\

with his Staff in his lefe Hand, that the scould take to Flight, which\
the feemed to do; the ffood upright, with her Under-parts towards\

Thus the Work concluded with the Deification of the unhappy Ca.\

Animadversion.\
This Fable clearly thews, how beautiful Bodies are polluted by\
Uncleannels; for in  thort Time after Califfe was delivered of her\
Son Areas, Jane transformed her, as  Punishment of her Unchallity,\
into  She-bear,  Beaft to deformed as to be reckoned among Mon-\
fers. The aforelaid Rvil has fuch direful Effects, that the Fruit or\
Children of nalawful Love mortally hare their guilty Parents; for\
Beauty fained with Onchaffity, is of no Account in the Eyes of the\
Virtuous, and what before created Wonder, is now  Mark of Infamy.\

 I were of beautiful, plain, white Marble. The Figure of Apolle\
was paked, crowned with Laurel, and holding  Scepter in its\
Hand.\
The Floor was inlaid with Variety of coftly Stones, in the Form\
of  terreffrial CGlobe, in the Center whereof ftood the aforelaid Figure.\
The Arch-work was Azure Bluc, bur  could not certainly perceive it\
to be Mofaick; it was adorned with the Seven Plancts, and other Con-\
Rellations, all in Gold. Near the Windows, between the two Pila-\
fters, were Niches filled with Figures, each reprefenting one of the\
Monibs of the Vear; they had the Form of young Men, and were\
cut in whire fieth-colour\'92 Marble.\
The whole Building confified alfo of Marble, but not to fine as that\
of the Figures; for here and there,. under the Niches, in the\
Mouldings, and about the Windows, it was veiny. In  Bafement,\
running round the Temple, was carv\'92  continued Bass-relief; the\
Figures of it were about four Feet high, and of fine white Stone. The\
other lafide -divition was the same as we have already described it\
to be withour the undermoft Part being compoled of the lonie Order,\
the middlemoft, of the Roman, and the apper, of the Corinibian.\
Over the firff Cornices appeared Terms, inftead of Pilafters; thefe\
reprefented the Hours, and with their Hleads tupported the Cupola;\
they were in the Shape of young Virgins, to the Number of twenty\
four: It would be redious to defiribe them, and their Badges of Di-\
Hinction fingly; and the rather, fince Cafar Rips has to hindlomely\
done it.\
Next,  took notice of the orderly Difpolition and Proportion,\
which was judicioully obferved throughout the Building; for Apetios\
Figure was, as  gueffed, eight Feet high; and thofe about hm teven\
Fectand an half; the young Men, reprefenting the Montbs, were leven\
Fect; and the Terms for the fears, fix or fix and  half. This Pro-\
Portion not only feemed to large, but the imagined Height really ap-\
pear\'92 to me to be tuck, without Abatement for Diffance, as teen from\
urderneath. Refleting on this Neatnets,  thought it ftrange for Pec-\
ple of Senfe, nay, great Malters, to agree, that  large Window should\
come over  lnall one, or  Giant be fer above  young Child, and how\
such Things should look becoming. The undermofl Bats-relick confiff\

 MONG all the Parts of Painting none is to difficult\
as that of ornamenting Cielings, tho' many think it eafy\
even more eafy than an upright Piece on  Wall or over\
  Chimney: This is owing to ignorance, and an indiffe.\
rence in People what their Cielings are dawb\'92 with, to\
as they be but quickly finithed, dazzle the Eye and cort\
little. Formerly they were contented with Foliage flightly painted\
for faving Expence, and that in Places of Confequence only; whereas\
ow, according to the prefent State of the Painters and Times, they\
can have other Things for the fame Price, and the Painter making no\
great Matter of it, they lay hold of the Opportunicy, cauting the\
whole Cieling to be filled with Hiltories and Emblems, whether they\
be fuitable or not.\
We fee, that all Things from fmall Beginnings improve, and at\
laft come to Perfection, thro' the indullry of judicious Arrifts: Even\
to tis in Painting: For  remember to have feen many Cielings with\

or riing ones, flat and even, and caute them outwardly to appear\
what they really are not; as the famous . Niceron, and others, hare\
plainly demonttrared. Wherefore, we need not wander, that to few\
Painters excel in this Branch of the Art, fince they are little con\

CHAP. II. Of the usual Difficulties in Cieling-painting.\
IR ST, we are at  great fland, becaute we cannot ule the Life,\
either in the Nudities or flying Draperies, tho' they be the prin-\
cipal Objects.\
Secondly, Becaule we cannot, without great Trouble, find the true\
and certain Places of the Figures we introduce; for which Reafon,\
they mult moftly be done by quess.\
Thirdly, Becaute we cannot duely view the Work as long as tis on\
the Eafel. Whence,\
Lattly, le follows, that the Malter is always in pain for the Effect\
of the Painting in being fixed in its Place.\
Thefe Difficulties are not  little vexatious, even to one who un-\
derflands his Buliness; for tis otherwife with thofe who make more\
ule of their Hands than Heads, that is, who work without Founds-\
tion, tho' thefe ought to be more careful than others Paint as many\
Cielings as you pleafe, as long as you do not believe, that there\
are Grounds and Rules for it, and remain in this ignorance, you will\
never furmount the aforefaid Difficulries. The most skilful Mafter is\
often at  lots in this Part of Painting. Let us then, in the first Place,\
learn Perspective, and what it fhews us; fince thereby only we may\
arrive at this laudable Study, which otherwife is impoffible.\
\
CH AP. III. Of foreshertening Objects in Cielings.\
 is obvious, that the Offskip, in  common Picture, is the Part\

that the Horizon is an utmoff Dillance limiting our Sight.\

If the Painting of\
 in Cielings, our Offskip and Boundary of Sight is the\
Firmament or Harry Skr; whereby Objects, the higher :bey are, lof\
fis toe hre, even to lnealibiliry, not only in their Proportions and\
NeaReis, bu: alo in their Colours.\
Hers we ought to obferve, that all Objects, of what Shape or Form\

 To. Ialase, pice  lquire Stone, to as to be viewed directly .\

fill re-penfcularl: from the Pont of Sight; moreover, that, however\
the ird &jaire is turned, the Top and Body always make  Right.\
angle, and conequencly, the hindermolt Extremity is parallel with\
the frenol. It is the lame with Figures of other Objects.\
Pizs, for Intance,  Man, on one or other Side of the Piece,\
Hant\
am. ag urright, and the Point of Sight in the Middle; let him be in\
Pryile, and have boch his Skoulders of equal Height, and you will\
 perceive that the Shoulders, from one to the other, keep their\
f Brealte, and ther Figue us full Thickness from Top to Toe.\
Thus we fee evidende that there is no other Forghortening than in\
\
te Leagie; or, to tay bever, in the Height; and the more the Fi-\
stres, or other Osets, rise and appreach the Point of Sight, the sporter\
\
 ire miagin they become; because, in their Breadth, they retain\
\
har MerE: CarL Pregortion, as before has been faid. This is  prin-\
\
cipal Rule, and ought alwars to be oblerved\
 for Bx. e . Batts gives full Precepis touching them, in the\
latter Part of his Book of Perppertive yer  have Room to fay, that\
when we would place Columns over Columns, for Galleries, we ought\
to draw  rifing Line thro' their Centers, from the Bafis or Ground, to\
the Point of Sight, even thro' each Balliffer, and thus find the due\
Proportion of their Heights, as well as Breadths, by the Help of \
Gradation-line.\
This, with respert to Proportion, mult likewife be obferved, in de-\
\
Agrrg Figures, and other Objects, as  shall hereafter thew, by Ex-\
amples.\
This Sort of Painting is not only the moff artful, but allo the moft\
difficult, as  have before faid; becaute, alcho' we underfland the Rules\
and Practice of it, it appears, nevertheless, difagreeable and deformed;\
which no one can be  Judge of but the Mafter himfelf, unless it be\
put up in its proper Place, and feen at the due Dillance.\

Chap.    . IV. Of the sizes of CGieling-figures.\
\
HE Figures, which we paint in Cielings, ought not to exceed the\
common Size of  Man, to wit, fix Feet and an half, when they\
are to low, as to be even with the Cieling; but, being higher and\
fitting on Clouds, or flying, they mult leffen and go of, as Perspective\
teaches. Vet, we may reprefent the Desties as big as we please, pro-\
vided they be not painted with more Strength than other Figures: It\
even fometimes happens, that when they almoff vanith our of Sight,\
they have yet human Bignels.\
Sunsbine is the moft proper and agreeable in Spiritual Reprefen-\
tations.\
As for the Glory of each Deity in particular, they keep it when they\
appear to Aen, but when they are reprefented in Heaven, tis  Miix-\
ture of many fmaller, producing one great Seining: To do this artful-\
ly, is not  Matter of the lealt Contequence; and he is  great Ma-\
Her, who, intlead of dark, thick, and beary Clouds, like Woot-fucks,\
places his Figures on thin, transparent, and almoft infensible Papours.\
It will not be improper, in this Chapter, to mention fomething\
touching flying Figures in the Air.\
Tho' the Air be fellom without  Wind, and this may always be\
tomewhat perceived, it is neverthelels not advifable to make it ap-\
fear in Cielings; becaute, if the Wind were flirring, the Figures\
fying before it would teem to be motionless and contrarily, thofe\
which are fitting or flanding, thew as mch Vielencs as the fying ones:\
For this, Reafgn, no Wind mult come into the Piece, but what the\
tippiting of Each Figure caules, that we may plainly fee by what\
Motion the Draperies are Clung, as allo the Places the Figures are go\
ing to, or returning from, one gently waving, and the other nimble\
and iwift.\
The different Stafs are very proper to this on fuch Occations, and\
they very much conduce to exprets the Marter; as the Refferion of ruf-\
King Silk for waving Figures, and which are gently defcending; thin\
and seazy Silk, for forft and deen-ftying Figares, and the moft plant\
or thick Silk or Stuf, for fitting, lying, or flanding ones. The Secret\

 Importance of  fine and firring Cieling-piece lies chieffy\
herein.\
As for the making of the coloured Stufts of flying Figures, becaute\
ther cannor be pur on the Layman, and therefore not painted after\
the Life, we cannot lay down any Rules about them: Nothing but \
good Conception and natural Judgment, joined to continual Pratice\
\
and Oble. vazon, can bring the Artiff to perform it. We mult ufe\
ther Means, and be perfect in them; obferving what Stuff is moff\
proper to the Occation, as we have before intimated.\
We ought alio to take care, that the thin Stuffs be rearm and trans.\
Firen Agair. the Liget; whereby they caufe an agreeable Effect againt\
the faint Sky; likewife, that the flying Figures never seem to be upright,\

is if a Mitct tys to be kunding; but always fitting, kneeling,\
Iving or flying, unleis, in the Cale of People fuppoted to be on Cie\
lings or Galleries, who then are either flanding, fooping or kneeling,\
as the Subject requires.\
Ler me lar, that we ought fometimes to make fome Additions to\
the Diupontion of the general and particular Objects; but with as\
much Caution as pottible, that the lnabiliry of the Artiff, and the\
Deficiencr of the lfork may not appear.\
\
   . . Rieihed for vicwing  Cieling-piece on the Easel, as if\

  have already obferved the Difficulties arifing in Cielings, with\
 refped to the Cie of the Life, and in laying down Rules fib\
terrient to it. Now, had  my Sight,  should certainly find\
out fome; but fince this is impracticable wichour figural Demontlrat\
on, and  cannor pottibly verbally do it,  shall nevertheless thew some\
Methods, which, tho' they may feem triffing, have always been of\
Service to me, and of lttle Trouble in their Ule.\
After skerching my Ordonnance on Paper,  fixed it againtt  loy\
Cieling; then taking  Looking-glats, and fitting under it,  with cal\
exactly contidered every Thing, oblerving what was wanting in it; and\
this  marked and corrected the Faules as much as poffibly  could\

This Examin  repeared, till by feveral Corrections  found, that  had\

\
CH AT. VI. Of Defgsing after the Life, for the Use of Cieling-\
Paintings.\
  muft not ffatter ourfelves, that Cieling-painting can be per-\
 formed without good Knowledge in Proportion, fince, as has\
been faid, we cannot conveniently make ufe of the Life; for, how\
great foever your Skill may be, you will fird Difficulty enough, tho'\
the Life were before you, to bring it on the Cloth. Neverthelets, to\
thew that it may be done, and that  have often uted the Life,  shall,\
for the Service of thofe who are not spiring of Pains, by down my\
Manner of doing it.\
AfferI had fet the Model, whether of Man or Weman, on an high\
Place, according to my Skerch,  far down on the Floor, with my\
Bick againft the Steffeld, with  Lookingglats between my Legs,\
which  mored and turned about to long, till the Model appeared in\
it in fuch  Manner as  wanted according to my Point of Sight; and\
then defigning it on Drawing-paper as correct as poftible,  painted af-\
for this Defign without any Trouble.\
As for the Diefes,  managed them in the fame Manner, calling\
the Garment on the Layman according to my Sketch;  mean, eiit-\
out Kring, which is  Thing impollible, and depends only on lmagi-\
nation.  placed then the Layman, thus dress\'92, on an high Treffel,\
and fat down againtt it in the Manner aforefaid, and made  Defign of\
the Dress; if it was  flying or lying Figure,  made thift with Pack-\
thread, Wires, or fuch like Means, as well as  could; (paring for no\
Trouble,\

Difficulties occurring in this Study: However,  did not this, before\
my Cloth was in readinets for it, that  might not miftake; fince, nor.\
Withitanding all our Care in some Things, elpecially spright standing Of-\

As to the Preparation of the Cloths for our Defign, as likewife the\
Dead colcuring, in order to finith, and thereby to refreth our Memeries,\
 shall row treat of them.\
Firft,  fix the Point of Sight, either within or without the Piece,\
as my Place of flanding direts: Then  ftrike, with  chalk\'92 Thread,\
from the faid Point, as many Lines over my Piece as  find neceffary\
to ferve all my upright flanding Objects, viz. Ballufters, Columns, Pil.\
latters, Figures, Sr. which  fuppofe to be perpendicular:  alfo frike\
some Disgonals, of Slope-lines, from that Side of the Piece whence the\
Light comes, either left or right, parallel and equidiflant from each\
other: Thele put me in mind how high or low the Light falls on my\
Objects; if they run parallel with the Bafe, the Objects are lighted in\
firely from the Side; if oblique or floping, as before is faid, they light-\
en  litle fronting; and if they fall from on high, from the Point of\
Sight, the Light comes diredly fronting, as is vifible in the Examples,\
Numb.   , in Plate LXII.\
 think myself obliged here to propofe to the Artiff  fmall Prac\
tice of my own Inveation, and, in my Opinion, of little Trouble, but\
great Advantage to Cieling- painters; fince we find, that, altho' there\
are certain Rules, yer they cannot be put in ule without the greatelf\
Trouble, Application, and Loss of Time, unless aided by some Prac\
tice or other, or by fome artful Intrument; like Affronemy, which,\
how demonftrative foever, has its Globe and Aftrolabe; Archiretture,\
iis Plan and Level; Geometry, the Oval, Triangle, Square and Com\
paffes; Mathemsties, Algebra, Cc. But, to return to my Inven\
tion\
 firft mould some WVax-puppers, as we have fhewn in the  Chap\
ter of Ordennence, as big and as many as  think proper: Next take\
as many pointed Wires, some long, others thort, whereon to flick the\
Puppers, and keep them from bending, whether they be made fland\
ing, lying, flying or ficting: This being done, Itake an oblong wood\
Ch\

Chap.  Trough, lined with Tin, of what Bigness  think proper, and   Fingers deep, for the placing as many Puppets as  pleafe. In\
to the Corners put fome Pins or Screws to fatten  Cover of Wood\
or Tin fitting the Trough, and made full of little Holes, wherein to\
Rick the aforefaid wired Puppers; and fo as they may tun eality:\
Then,  fill the Trough with Clay, or Kneaded Bran; and thus my\
Machine is in readinels. Now, when  make ufe of it,  flick my\
Puppets, bent and turned, according to my Delign, on the Wires, and\
thro' the Holes, into the Clay, where  would have them, one high,\
another low, one flooping forwards, another leaning back, Coc. as\
the Subject requires; which will then sland immoveable.\
My Scheme being in this Forwardness,  lean the whole Machine\
back on  Tables be the Light left or right, and then flightly defign\
the Figures in the Manner  have thewed with the Lines.  can give\
the Machine fuch  Light as  defire, either from  side, froncing, or\
from on high,  Common, Sun-hine, or Candle-light.\
Now, for perfecting this Sketch, and conveniently painting afcer\
it,  fet my Layman, with fuch  Dress as each Figure requires, in\
the Manner before laid down: And then, my Cloth being ready, \
proceed to painting.\

bout  Years, with great Advantage, and wich fuch exact Refleltion,\

than  or at moft  Puppets.\
Now, the curious Artill mult alfo know what Obfervations  made\
in the Ufe of the Machine.\
Firfl, as Plate  XIII. fhews,  put one Puppet coming direfity down,\

 second Puppet  fet apright, fanding in Profile on one Side of\
the Point of Sight, and found it foresportened in all its Parts.\
 Third  ler fying upwards from behind forwards, and perceived,\
that the Members foreportened fomewbat more than these of the first,\
and somewhat less than those of the second.\
 Fourth  placed fitting with its Upper-parts upright, the Thigbs\
parallel, and the Legs like the Upper-parts; and obferved, that when it\
was quite in Profile, the Upper-parts and Legs foreshortened, and the\
Thigh kept its full Lengtk, as it alfo did when in  Frent-posstion..\

Of the Paintinge,\

 had no further Occafion for that Method.\
We shall now tay fomething,\
   . Vil. Of the Colouring of fying Figures.\
ER EIN we mull obferve, that in Cieling-painting tis the\
tame as in Landskips. Firfl, we rub in the greateft Light of\
\
the Sky, then all Parts about it; next, the higheff and moff\
faint Objects, and then the lower and more near ones; and, in cale \
Balluftrade be reprefented, it muft be the laft: The Reafon of this\
 have thewn in treating of the Deadcolouring of Hifferies and Land\
SKifs.\
Moreover, as in  fine Landskip the Sky principally governs all\
Things, and without it no proper Diftance can be given to the Pic\
ture, to is the fame in  Cieling-piece with Figures fying thro' the\
Air; for is impostible to make Objects rife, unlets they have some\
Communication with the Air. Nor is it enough for Objects, going\
off higher or further from us, to be painted fainter and faimter, as in\
 Drawing or Print, but the Colour mult alfo be thewn; and as the\
Air is coloured, to muft the Objects partake of it;  mean, in their\
Stides; for if the fir be blue, yellow, or red, the Sbades ought like\
wile to have  Mixture of Blae, Tellow or Red\
As to the Light of the Objects, we mult obferve, that of what\
Colour foever it be, it breaks and grows darker as it goes off: Even,\
were the Air, as  may fay, Snow-white, it breaks by Diftance or\
Air interpoting; the Red becomes Violet; the Vellow, greenith; and\
the Violet, Bluc. As the Objects go off from us, and approach the\
Air, they are darkened, White becomes darker, pale aellow the\
fame; and to on, in other Colours.\
Something fill remains to be remarked, with respect to Objects in\
the Air, viz that fince the Air communicates Light from all Parts,\
the broad Shades cannot poffibly be to dark as in  Landskip, or other\
Piece; but contrarily, the dark Touches will be to much the fronger:\
All that is in Shade ought to be lighter, and feen more plain, yet\
fomewhat less than in the Light.  muft be likewife known, that\
round Objects have no Surface, especially on the shaded Side, that is to\
fay, the Our line againft the Sky ought to unite and vanith, not quite\

   . Vill. General Observations in painting the Cielings of\
Halls, Galleries, &cc.\
+   firff and principal Obfervation on thefe Occafions is, that\
the Quality and Regulariry of the Architefture be firmly prefer-\
ved in all its Parts.\
The second Obfervation concerns the Grandear of the Architecture,\
as being the main Matter. Painting, in this Cafe, is only to be con-\
fidered as an Aid, to accomplith it with lets Charges; wherefore, fuch\
Care mult be taken, that the Painter' Deligns do not marr thofe of\
the Architelt, but that both unite in fuch  Wianner as to induce the\
Eye to take every thing for Truth irfelf.\
By the firff Obfervation, that the rchitelture ought to preferve its\
Regularity, we give to underfland, that the Structure of the Room\
muft chieffy be regarded by the Painter, in his Cieling pieces, to as\
not to be hurt by making Openings where they ought not to be; for its\
not allowable to make them every where, as big or litle as we pleafe:\
The Cieling must remain Cieling. ll that is withour the Painting, as\
the Summers, ought to have their proper Thickneffes, and be latting,\
and not feem as tumbling, which yet, thro' Heedleffnels, fometimes\
is the Cafe: For Inftance, let us fuppose the Cieling to be divided in-\
to three Pannels lined with Cloth; one next to the Windows, the fe\
cond in the middle, over the Chimney, and the third to be next the\
Wall; that in the middle is between two Summers, one Foot in, and\
the two Side ones hie almoff ffuth with the Under parts of thofe Sum\
mers: Now, if the two Side-cloths be, like the middle one, adorned\
with Sky, and the Thicknels of the Summer (which is one Foor) not\
painted on the Cloth, the Cieling, on thofe Sides, is to much weak-\
ened, or at lealt seems to be so, and is beavier in the middle, contrary to\
Architelture: Whereas, to make it look natural, and according to Or-\
der, the Ponderolity muft, in this Cale, be on the sides, and the\
middle Part lighteff; that it may not feem to be falling on our Heads.\
  the Painting of\
Book IX.\
 we ought to observe; that there muftt be but one Open.\
ing, and that in the middle; fince there is but one Point of Sight,\
and but one Place of flanding to view the Work to Advantage.\
As for painting the Thicknets of the Summer,  only faid it to\
rectify  Miltake often committed, when  Cieling is made alt over\
oxin, and intlead of  Covering, nothing is left but  Grate, which\
cannot be juftitied; Some think,. if may pats for  Lantern, but\
they are much mittaken; for  Lintern rifes, and  Cieling lies\
far: Moreover the whole Cieling cannot ferve for  Lantern, becaute\
of the Windows in front. The principal or middle Piece mult predo-\
minare, and of contequence be open, and the others closed,  mean, not\
to have any Sky of living Creatures, but Bass-reliefs, Foliage, Com-\
parrments of Flowers, all of fuch  Colour as fuits with the Apart-\
ment. This  judge to be the firtl and principal Care and Study of \
good Cieling-painter, before he fets about the Work; for in the Divi\
 of  Cieling it is as with  Diamond, the largelt and moft valua-\
ble is fet in the middle, and round it, the less and less.\
As to the second Obfervation, that the Art of Painting is aiding to\
\
\
-mecture, and enrickes it at less Expence, the Point is plain;\
wherefore  thail proceed to thew the Reaton why the one may fpoil\
the other.\
In painting Divisions, it aften happens that the Summers have not\
Proper Rets to he on; especially when the Cieling is covered all over\
(and the Summers hid) with  fingle Cloth, and left to the Judgment\
of an ignorant Painter, who then, without Confideration, divides it\
into ,    or more Pannels, and thefe parted by painted Sum\
mers which do not bear on any thing: Now, to prevent this, you\
mull let each Summer reft on  Discharger, Pilafter of Cartouche, as\
Architelture reaches For laftance, were you to divide the two Pan\
nels next the Windows and Wall, each into two Parts, in order to\
have four Pannels, this would be improper and againtt Archifecture;\
becaute of the Flamels over the Window, unlels it were compals\
headed, and then it would not do withour  Cartouche.\
If it be asked, whether the Dirisson be  Painters Buliness!  fay,\
Ic is, to far as he underflands Architecture; otherwife more proper\
for an Archifect; at leaft may be eafily done with his Affillance.\
As to the Work, where the Painting may diforder, or be contrary\
to Archirecture, it lies in the Deligns, when they do not fuit the\
Building, nor perfecily bear on Foundations, or have their proper\
Weight By the Foundation of the Puinting  mean, the pariment;\
and\
\
\
Cielings, or Plafonds.\
Chap.  by the Weight of the Defign, that what the Painter intends to ex-\
hibit in his Cieling-piece be not too heavy, and teem to press down the\
Under-parts. The better to clear my Meaning,  will luppole  Room\
to be  Feet (quare: Now, if  second Depth, or upper Room,\
were to be reprefented, the Piers, Columns, Doors, and Windows\
thereof muft needs accord with thofe of the under Room, and bear\
upon them: And, in the next Place, the Courfe of the Orders ought\
exactly to be obferved, as Architelture teaches, that is to fay, the\
beavieft muft be undermeft; firft, the Tuscan, next, the Doric, then, the\
Jonic, next, the Roman, and laftly, the Corinthian, and to upwards\
lighter and lighter; which  think is feldom obferved; and the Rea-\
fon is, becaute the Figures are fometimes reprefented bigger ihan the\
Life; which neceffitates the Artiff to proportion his By-works accord\
ingly: An unpardonable Error, and not at any Rate to be juttitied?\
But  shall fay more of this on another Occation, and now purfue our\
Purpofe in Cielings.  principal Point is, that the Work rife, and\
that its Force unite with the Life; that is, that the Objects in the low-\
ell Parts be not painted fronger than the fixed Work, as Compart-\
forethort-\
ments, Bafsreliets, and other Ornaments, which, not being\
ened, receive their Light thro' the Windows. Now it may be asked,\
Whether, in cale we were to reprefent an Apartment above, with the\
same Light as below, the Force of Light and Shade muft not be the\
Same? And,  fay, it ought not; becaule of the great Difference between\
them; as we may caily fuppole, in two Columns fet over each other,\
receiving their Light from one Front, the one from the undermoft, and\
the other from the uppermoll Windows: Here, the upper Bale muff\
have no more Force than the under Capital; for, were it otherwile, it\
would seem to be nearer; it would alfo not rife, and confequently over-\
Power the Life. Tis here, as in  fine Landskip; where the Fore-\
ground has the greateff Force, and the lecond and third are lels and\
tainter in Proportion as they go off. It is the fame with fying Fi-\
gures; for the Light weakens by their Riling, and the Shades become,\
as well as in  Room, by the lurrounding Air, weaker and fainter:\
But the Touches and Shades keep their Force.\
We have obferved what is necellary to the Stability and Regularity\
of the rchirecture, with reipect to Painting, to that boch may teem\
to be one Body; as we thall exemplity by the following Fable out of\
Ovid, proposed here as  painter like simile.\

in the Poffeffion of to beautiful an Object, falls in love with him;\
but, finding  Repulfe, the invokes the Aid of the Gods, and thereby\
obtains her earneff Suit. The young Man, not daring to refift the\
Will of Heaven, gives up the Caufe, and is, by Mercury, (whom we\
mud obterve here to be Opfres) joined to her, and thus of two Bo-\
des is made one. Further Applications are needlets, fince the Simile\
fufficienly explains itfelf.\
Now, to continue our Subject, the following Obfervables are, at\
the Beginning of the Work, chiefly neceffary.\
 The Condition of the Place.\
 The Quility, Ofice, and Inclination of the Owner, and what\
Subjects are proper trereto, whether Hiffories, Fables, Cec.\
 The Dispeftion of the Subjects.\
 How the Subject is to be divided.\
Firtt, By the Condition of the Place,  mean, the Light of the\
Room, and in what manner it takes the Cieling; allo, into how many\
Pannels the Archirect has divided the Cieling, and which is the Prin\
cipal, that we may adapt our Thoughts thereto, in the Dispofition\
of the Reprefentations, as well as in the Execution of them.\
Seconlly, By the Quality, &cc. of the Owner we mult underfland,\
\
wherner he be  Dirine or Lawyer, Pholofopher or Artifan; and\
whether ke incline to (piricual or moral, general or particular Repre\
fentations; that is, fuch as relate to him or his Family in particular,\
or generally to any who may live in the Houfe after his Deceafe; ac\
cording to which information we ought to chufe Subjects fuitable.\
Thirdly, How the Subjetts ought to be disposed; namely, what mult\
be placed above in the Air, wherein, as is faid, lies the Soul of \
Resz-painting, and what below as touching the Body of it: This we\
divide into Spiritual and Meral; Spiritual, all that is governed by\
Heaven, and Moral, every thing that is directed by our Judgment.\
Fourchly, How the Subject is to be divided: Here, the principal\
Piece in the middle, muff thew either the Caufe or Rife of the Story,\
or the Efect of it; the next to it mult exhibit the Matter itfelf, and\
that further off, an Appendix to or inference from it. But, to make\
this Point plainer,  thall give an Example.\
in the middle Pannel,  place Solemon before the Ark of the Covenant,\
praying to Ged for Wifdem, and on each Side,  reprefent, furrounded\
with  Glory, the Gifts which God beftows on him; as Wifdom and Rick\
es flowing doxn. And in the leffer Pannels,  exhibit, in Bals-reliet,\
the\
\
\
\
Cielings, or Plafonds.\
  this Foot, we may handle any Thing or\
the corporeal Virtues.\
Subject whatfoever; and by having due Regard to the aforefaid four\
Particulars, and well executing them, fuch  Reprefentation will cer.\
cainly pleafe every one, even Envy itfelf.\
Hence, we may fufficiently perceive, how orderly we mult manage:\
Wherefore tis no Wonder, that to few excel in Cieling-painting, tho'\
it have Rules as well as other Studies; but if thefe be not duely ob-\
served, we cannot gain the Point. He who fets up for  good Mafter,\
muft thew that he underftands his Art.\
If  am asked, whether  think Correggio, Cortond, Vovet, and -\
thers, who performed Wonders in this Branch, have always to puncty-\
ally followed the Rules, and fo nicely regarded all the Obfervacions\
here laid down according to my Apprehention!  antwer, that it\
would have been better if they had done it; or elfe what  fay, mult,\
  have thewed in  foregoing Chap. be owing to the Machine with\
Puppets, which  made ule of for  or  Vears, and afterwards laid\
alide; for, we ought firft to have  thorough Knowledge of  Thing,\
and then demonttrate it. But  am further of Opinion, that had the\
great Mafters perfectly known the prefcribed Rules, we should not\
find fuch great Miltakes in their Works as some now think there are.\
Nevertheless its moft certain that none are qualified for this Judgment,\
but thole who have made it their Practice; for he who underftands\
the Rules, and retains them in Memory, can always judge whether\
they be obferved, or not, tho' not able to do it himfelf: Vet they\
who work only by Guels, and know nothing of Grounds and Rules.\
are more pardonable than thofe who are acquainted with them, and do\
not ufe them; tho' both blame-worthy, the one for his Carelessness\
and Neglect of Learning, and the other for his Knowledge and Neg\
lelt of uling it.\
 am very fenfible, that fome will make little Account of many\
Things by me delivered as neceffary; but  am in no Pain for that, if\
 can but give Satisfaction to  curious Reader.\
 mull own, that, in my juvenile Vears,  dawbed some Cie-\
lings, but never flatter\'92 myself that  underffood the Art to as \
ought; becaute  was then ignorant that there were any certain Grounds\
and Rules.. Neverthelets,  afterwards attained them, by fomctimes\
hearing others difcourfe about them, and by the Rules of Perspective,\
and by my own indefacigable Applicacion to to noble  Study; info-\
much, that at laff  could sketch  large and grand Compolition with\

felf on my Back, and fcrarch\'92 my Thoughts on the Paper. Thisl\
found to be  good Method, for preventing Miltakes;  mean, in the\
Sketch. Now, for the Painting it,  allo did it againft the Cieling;\
yet not after fuch  flight Scratch: For, having made my Sketch,  our of the Prints of Povet and others, fuch Actions and Poltures\
as were proper; altering them either in the Faces, Hands, or Folds\
of Draperies, more or lets, by Guess, as well as . could. Thus \
made thift; yer all was done againt the Cieling: Whereby you may\
judge, what Trouble  had, as well in finding Things, as afterwards\
in executing them; which really was double Work. But, when better\
informed,  fat commodioutly at my Eafel. He who proceeds with\
Certainty has  great Advantage above others.\
   . IX. Mched for drawing foresportened Buildings, Figures,\
Trees, &cc. after the Life.\
 CE  commonly happens, on Nature' denying her faroura-\
Lo ble Affittance, that we have Recourfe to our Wits, for Means to\
tupply the Defect; it was even my Cafe in Cieling-painting. Af\
ter having given myself much Trouble to no Purpofe, and taken ufe-\
lets Pains, in order to delign every thing after the Life,  at laft found\
out the following Mechod, which has made me full Amends. Tis\
very profitable in all Pieces with low Horizons, as you will perceive\
in the Uic.\
 suppote then, for Intance, that  am to make  Delign of the\
Stadt-houle at Amgerdam (tis no matter if it were thrice its prefent\
Heighe) and this without looking up.  chule  Station or Diftance of\
eight Feet, more or lets, from the Building, as Occafion requires.\
Then,  take  Convex Looking-glats, of about  Foot Diameter ( bought at the Auremberg Toy-thops) and place it againft the Intide\
of my Drawing-board, or Porto-folio:  contrive it in fuch Manner,\
that it may either sland upright, or leaning back, according as  would\
fee Things either from beneach, or higher. Thus  approach with\
the\
\
\
\
\
\
Cielings, or Plafonds.\
 To.\
the open Porto folio, and my Back towards the Object, till the Build\
ing, Tree, Coc. appear as  would have it, and then delign it from\
the Looking-glats, on white or blue Paper.\
This Method is very convenient for drawing all Sorts of large\
Works in narrow Places or Streets; even,  View of twenty or thirty\
Houfes. Tis alfo ufeful to Landskip- painters in their Country Views:\
They may take whole Tracts of Land, with Towns and Villages,\
Waters, Woods, Hills, and Sea, from Ealt to Wefl, without moving\
either Head or Eyes. Tis likewife proper for thofe who are ignorant\
of Perspective.\
We mult here allo thew  Method for reprefenting all Sorts of fore-\
portned fat-faced Ordennances, whether Pictures, Hangings, or Bals-\
reliess, againtt Walls, Cielings, or any where elfe, either flanding,\
hanging, or lying, and that with Certainty, according to Perspettive.\
Thefe are Things which Painters often meet with, in exhibiting\
Rooms, Galleries, Gardens, and other Places; and the Method for\
doing it, tho' not attended with Difficulty, yet, fometimes purzles thofe\
who neglect it.\
 have therefore cholen the Example in Plate LXIV. which is the\
Foundation of all Forethortnings, as well of Apartments as Cielings;\
and the Performance is as follows. Having made the Scheme of \
Room in Perspettive,  divide the Height and Widch of the Side-\
Wall (where  would have Hlangings or Reprefentations of Pictures\
into  certain Number of diminithing Feet, fetching the Crofs-lines\
from the Point of Sight, and the Perpendiculars from the Plan or\
Sale.\
Now, in this Example, we perceive four principal Ferehorinings:\
For  is the Cieling,   Side-wall,  the Floor,   loofe Picture\
hanging forwards; all four proceeding, after one and the fame Man-\
ner, from the Point of Sight, as the middle Part  Thews, which is\
divided into Squares. To fay more, would be ufelets and tedious to\
thofe who are in the leaff converfant with this Art.\

\
\
\
 of the Colours, wrether they differ little or much from\
Cr otker, or yrether they ought to be almoft all White or Light;\
\
\
\
 the Coours may be beautiful, be they ever to light. Eves,\
ere  Cielizg pirce to comiit only of Whire and Black, Light and\
\
 . wold have no leis Deceran, nor be lets valuable.  think\
\
\
,  Cale, to be much like  Print, which, tho' conlifling only\
in Wkice and Black, has yet its Harmony and Decoram, when Light\
 Thade are well ditpoied againt each other; and Hill more with\
 Laction of proper Colours, and those thinly and trantparently\
\
 whcreby it gets the Propercy of  Picture.\
As the prrripil Goodnets of  Cieling-piece lies in an artful Dipo\
\
hon of the Figares asove each other, to tis of no lets Contequence,\
\
nat the Colours be well adaptedtherero.\
 will now gve an latlance, in two Pieces, differing from each other\
+\
in Light and chade. The one has three, and the other two Depits\
The former has its undermot Depth ttrongly fer orf in Colour agaiil\
the second, which is  lirtle dark; and the third is light againit the\
Jark Bine of the Sly. In the latter, (which  think the bett on ac\
count of De-sram) the uppermoll Croup is dark againll  light ble\
Sky; and the undermoll, by the Force of Light, fit off againt\
the uppermofl. Even, were we thus to dispose three or more Crounb\
or Groups over each other, it would look very decorous; and each\
Deity\
\
\
Cielings, or Pialonds.\
  would neverthelets keep its proper Colours, yet lets in Foree,\
in Proportion to the Diffance: Fer when the uppermoft Croup is fe:\
off againt the light Sky, it caules  wonderful Gooff; and the Reaton\
proceeds from the Skys feeming to be infinitely higher; which con-\
trarywife cannot be effected.\
If it be objected, that fuppoling one of the principal Figures in the\
uppermoft Group, ought, according to its Dignity and the Reafons\
laid down in the fuiring of Colours, to have  white Dress, and\
therefore the aforefaid Polition will be overthrown  deny it; for it\
may be helped, by difpoting some dark Clouds behind, which will\
preferve that Garment in its Force, and make it have  pleating Har-\
mony with the reft of the Work. In the Difpolition of Objects, over,\
near, and behind each other, we have more largely handled this Point,\
and shewed its Truth and Decorum: For, Dark againtt Light cannot\
advance with to much Force as the Light may againtt the Dark; be-\
caute the Light has greater Strength in itfelf. However, to put an\
End to  Point of to great  Latifude, which by Dilcourfe cannot be\
fully demonffrated,  shall conclude it with the great Tunius, who, in\
his third Book of the Art of Painting, fays,\
Thus we see, that Artifs, in their Werks, create Shades or Depths,\
to the end that the Parts to come eut may appreach with more Force, and\
seem to meet the Exe of the Beholder, even without the Picture. Let\
two parallel Lines, (ays Longinus, & be drown upon  Cloth, with light\
and dark Colours; the Brightness of the Light will Joonet strike the\
Eye; and seem to be nearet. And,  little further, quoring Johannes\
Grammaticus, he fays,  If we paint  Board with White and Black,\
the White will always seem to be nearer, and the Black further off.\
Therefore, continues the fame Author, in his Obfervation on this Point,\
the Painters also make use of blackish or dirkish brown Colburs, when they\
are to represent the deep Hollow of  Well, Ciftern, Ditch, bottomless Pir,\
or the like. But when, on the contrary, they will make any thing come\
out, as, the Breafts of  Woman, an Hand held ont, or the Fect of \
leaping or running Herse, they ley, on both the Sides,  jufficient Shade of\
black and brown Colours, in order that these Parts may; by the neighbour-\
ing Darkness, be flung of from the Picture with  lively Ferce.\

CH AP. XI. Of the Deities in facred and prosane History, and\
Paties; and, firt, of the Difference between  facred and profane Re-\
fitzntaritn.\
  IN  done with trearing of Cieling-pieces,  thought it\
improper to end this Book, and make  new one of the following\
\
Chapters; becaute the Mlatter has fuch  Connexion, that we\
can fcarce think of the one, without falling prefently on the other.\
Irs certain, that in common Pictures the Deiries, Gholls, Demi-\
gods, Angels, Virtues, and other Powers may likewife be introduced,\
nay, are even infeparable Adjuncts: But into Cieling-pieces, where\
the Upper-part is the Shy, they muft of Necefficy come; becaute the\
major Part of fuch Reprefentations relate either to their Perfons, Qua-\
lities of Virtues.\
Now, duely to execute this Reprefentation of the Deiries, the Ar-\
tifl ought chiefly to be acquainted with the facred and profane\
Sterres, as well as with the poetical Fictions, that he may learn from\
them the partucular Occurrences and Properties peculiar to each Per-\
ion and Rank of the Deiries or Upper-powers, and reprefent them\
accordingly; for altho' Imaginution mult, in this Point, lend great Af\
Lillance, yer its not fafe for every Man to rely intirely thereon, left\
he should be deceived; like the Man, whofe Neighbour dreaming,\
that in  certain Place was hidden great Treafure, and awaking and\
going thither, found it, by digging, and carried it home; he, on this\
good Luck, laid himfelf down on an Heapof Poppies, in hopes of the\
lame Happinets; but after  long Sleep he awaked without any ad-\
vantageous Intimation from his Dream; contrarily, found his Pocket\
pick\'92, and thus at once was bereft of his Hopes and the Money he\
before had in Poffettion. This Simile is too plain to need nearer Ap\
plication\
 judicious Mafter muft certainly be well exercifed in the Know-\
ledge of the true Conditions of the Things he is to handle, that he\
mar not be thought an lgnoranc; for the Truth cannot be hidden\
with respect to the Inventor. Wherefore you ought to take heed of\
mixing this Truth with falfe Things, especially in facred Stories, of\
(piritual Reprefentations; fince there is to great  Genrrariety between\
them, that they cannot be joined, unlets to thew the Difagreement:\
 or Plafonds.\
Chap. II.\
 fay, they cannot poffibly be joined in order to exprets  fingle Mean-\
ing, but will rather ferve to confound, weaken and miltake it, except\
they be feparately difpoted, the spiritual above, in Heaven, and the\
werldly below, on the Earth.  speak with respelt to Emblems: For\
there is  great Dilparity between Pallas and the Wifdem of God,\
fince the latter cannot be attributed to any Perfon, and much less re-\
prefented on Earth. The fame may be said of Janus and Provi-\
dence. The begventy and civil Tuffice are alfo very unlike. We\
mult therefore note, that the whole lconology or Science of the\
heathenith Figures, tho' formerly accounted heavenly, has now\
no relation to the Soul, but to the moral Vircues and Merits of\
Men.\
Let us then inquire, with Reverence, what are Chriflian Emblims,\
and what, prefane or Heathenish; uting in spiritual Representations no-\
thing but what is pure and heavenly, and in the worldly, all thats\
proper to them, in order to gain the Elleem both of religious and\
Worldly Pertons.\
 Paffage in Scripture mentions the driving Lucifer and his Compa-\
nions out of Heaven: Whence we may plainly conclude, that thote\
Monfters afterwards fell to the Share of the Heathens, as no longer\

more fuch unruly Spirits were expelled Heaven; wherefore we are not\
allowed to reprefent more fuch Inftances. But in the Cafe of Men\
seen to battle the true Faich, Things may be accompanied and repre-\
fented with heathenith Emblems; becaute, as is faid, the Heathear\
gave themfelves up to the Devil; the better by that means to ex-\
prets their Error, and thew the Truth, thus alfo driving them out of\
Heaven.\
It is, upon Occafion, likewife not improper or difagrecing with the\
Pharifees or Hypocrifes; but has  greater Weight in tillicious Stories\
or Parables. Nor can we, without Offence, introduce other Emblems\
than Chriffian like, when they only tend to incite to Salvation. In\
which Cale we may reprefent Angels or Spirits, to keep thofe Hypo-\
Crites out of Heaven\
in true profane Hifferies, as the Reman, Grecian and others, this\
Management would be improper, but we may lawfullvule bereghphic\
and other Characters; of which there is an infinity; for inftance, by\

  AP. XII. Disquistion toucbing the Representation of the\
Trinity.\
RANY will think this Subject beyond the Reach of what we\
II have hitherto handled, and inconfiftent with Art: But  am\
of  contrary Opinion; for  tender-hearted Arcil has, of .\
count of the many Differences among Chrillians, Reaton to be in\
Concern for this Point, fince fo many Occurrences offer in Scripture,\
where the Almighty is either acting in some Form about Mankind,\
or is pailing by as  Glory to make his Prefence known.\
The greatelt Part of Chrizendom (Helland, England, and  Part of\
Germanr excepted) allow, with one Accord, the Reprefeataion of the\
Perfons in the Trinity; as firlt, Gad the Futher, in the Shape of an old\
Man with  long grey Beard and Hair: Secondly, Frus Cirjz, as he\
appeared in his Humanity. And Thirdly, Ged the Hol. Giz., in the\
Shape of  Dove, in which Shape he dehended on fiyes Cirt, at\
the Time of his Baptilnm.\
Now if, according to the Letter of Ser:prure,  were to repretent\
Ahum and Ere,  and it neceltary to exhib: the Creaior of the World\
and Maker of Adam, in  vitible Shape, unce it is wrieter, that he\
made Tham of the Duit of the Ground, and breach if into him the\
Breath of Life. Nowhe, who is to mate tricting, or Biedcbs in fiz..\
ring, muit, humanly peaking, have botn Hinds and Mouck.\
As Scripture aliocommonly thers is an apprenenive Realr: of the\
\
\
 why should  be more clpable for repretentin; an under\
the fame, than under that of  Trrangle furrounded with  Criort, and\
containing some ffebrew Letters: Vet our Divines are of OpOn, Chac\
this latt is allowable, but not the torme. Is not then the oas  fizure\
as well as the other:  do the Tewip Characters, of the InaztMatc\

Befides thefe Reafons, does not  Picture tend as well to Intiection,\

 think, that the learned World and Arcifts reprefent the firtt Per-\
fon of the Trinity rather in the Shape of  Man, than of any other\
Creature, on good Reafons; for we learn from Scripture, that God\
creared and made Man in his own lmage; and from the ancient Fathers,\
Char Wan is an Exitome of all that God created; who is therefore called\
 aorle World: Some even call Man the Mafter-piece of God. We\
oight therefore, if we will take some Likeness from the Creatures, to\
exprets the Almighty by the mot perfect Idea to be found, in order\
to exhibit his Perfection, and thus to make the Copy, in the beff\
Manner, like the Original: And the more, as Scripture, in feveral\
Places, makes mention of the Head, Eyes, Ears, Mlouth, Lips, Arms,\
Feet, Hands, and other Members of God: Which Things mult not be\
underffood in  carnal and literal Senfe (according to the Opinions of\
some ignorant People, who imagine God, in his Nacure, to be like \
Man; that he firs in Heaven on  Throne, according to  Pallage in\
-The Herven is my Throne, and the Earth is my Footfiool.\
Laise,\
\
And as in another Place the fame Prophet fays\'97 faw the Lord\
fitting es in bige Tbrone, and lifted up\'97) but in  figural and fpiri-\
tual Senie.  think then, that  Painter has no nearer Exprestions, in\
tuch Reprefenrations where God himself is alting, than to exhibit his\
Figure in an human Shape, as beft agreeing with thofe Likenelfes,\
WVe paint him aged, in order to thew his Majefty and Wifdom, which\
are more to be found in Old Age than Vouth; and with  Scepter and\
Globe, and  Circle of Stars about his Head, to shew his Omnipo-\
cence boch in Heaven and on Earth. But Roman-catholicks daily make\
Additions.\
If the Scripture reprefent his Godly Perfon under  myfterious Senfe,\
why may not the Arcift be allowed to do the fame! Do we not read\
in the Recelation what is mentioned of God in an human Shape! Is it\
not plain enough? Or muft it be objected, that this Discription is\
poctyphal? But granting it, the Relation, nevertheless, is not at-\
counted ffearbenifh. ny Doubt, which might arife from it, does not\
affect the Point, with respect to Shapes. In another Place we find, that\
the High -Prieff hid himself, that he might not behold the Lord:\
Bur the Lord put  Finger on his Eyes, till he was paft by. How\
can  reprefent that Paltage, without  Body? Or is it no Falll\

Chap.  Now, to make this known to  Perfon who cannot read, and is\
deaf, Is it not more caly to do it by  Reprefentation, than by Sigas?\
Are we to make only  Mouth fending forch  Flame? Is this to\
proper for fuch  Man' Apprehention, as  whole Figure? Moreover,\
 not  Mouth  Likencis and  Figure, as well as  whole lmage?\
What then are they pretending, who allow one Part of the Crime,\
and not the Whole? If ir be  Crime, let it be intirely forbidden;\
and if good, or at leaff fufferable, intirely allowed, and performed.\
Neverthelels, we mult not bow before these Ibings, much less worship them,\
but the true God only, who is thereby meant. Can we oblerve  Sacri-\
fice otherwife? Is not that  myfterious Reprefentacion, or, in better\
Terms,  figural Demonftration, when it is faid \'97 The Sucrifice\
was burning upon the Altar, and the Children of God were bowing before\
it, praying, befeeching, and giving Tbanks in all Submisfion?\
Scripture, in feveral Places, (peaks of the appearing of God te\
Men, either really by the Miniftry of Angels, or in  Vifion by\
Dreams, of by Extafies. There is to fine  Description of God, undet\
the Shape of an old Man, in the leventh Chapter of Daniel, that no\
Artill can better reprefent it. The same Scripture alfo mentions feve-\
ral Appearances of Angels in human Shapes: For which Reafon, the\
Church, in the lecond Council of Nice, made no Difficulty in alloxing\
Artifts to do it; and chiefy Painters, to reprefent God the Futher as \
kind, loving old Man, and the Angels in an human Shape.\
It feems allo, that  Painter has the Privilege to paint and repre-\
fent inanimate Things as living, according to the Idews which Scripture\
affords him: And the Spectator mult not be offended, when, in fome\
Pittures, he finds facred Subjects attended with poetical Fictions, for\
their better Explanation; on  Supposition the latter be impious. Are\
not the Pfalms of David, Solomon' Song, the Bock of Job, and the\
Revelation of St. John the Divine, all delivered under Poetic Figures?\
Not to speak of the Parables befides mentioned in Scripture.\
Painters therefore are not blame worthy, for bringing in some\
thing that is hearhenifh, in order to clear the Alatter; and elpecially if\
the Falt happened in an heathenith Country. Thus the great Ro-\
phacl, in his Pasfage of the Children of Ifracl over Lordan, has repre-\
fented the River under an human Shape, violently turning the Water\
back towards its Source.\
As Scripture often lays down fuch and the like Things under fome\
fgural Descriptions, it gives Painters full Liberty to do the fame;\
fince, in order to accommodate ittelf to the weak Apprehentions of\
No.  the Painting of\
Book IX.\
 it ufarlly delivers many of the greateff Myfteries under Figures\
and Parables; as it speaks of the Rivers, in Pfalm xevin. &\
Pouffin alfo made no Scruple, in his Picture of the finding of Mofes,\
to exhibit the River Nile, by an human Figure. But there were Ca-\
lumniaiors in his Time as well as there are now. He was charged\
with Ackeim, for mixing Truth with Lyes, and having no more Re\
gard for either, than to treat them alike. Vet, if we look nearer\
 this Matter, we shall be convinced, that the learned Painter was\
Ro: in the leat cinctured with Acheifm. Did it not happen in hea-\
trenih Eeger? Was not Pharach' Daughter prefent? Did the believe\
\
tne Trum, which was only manifelted to Graelf Certainly the did not.\
Since therefore the Falt lay in an heathenith Country, and was done in\
the Prefence of but two Hebrex Women, the others being Ethnicks,\
this great Artiff has not trespafied either againft the Chriflian Farth, or\
againtt the Art.\
And alcho, at the firft View,  well grounded Objection may be,\
that with Things which relate to Religion, no falle Gods or Deiies,\
worthipp\'92 by the Heathens, ought to be mixed; and that it is fuffi-\
cient for  Painter to reprefent  River in its natural Courfe, and not\
in an himan Form: Fer the Objection is eafily anfwered; for Scrip-\
ture repreients the Waters, and the Noise of Rivers, under an human\
Form; as in Pfalmxevin. where it is faid, that they clapp\'92 their Hands\
and were jorsal. Moreover, the Egyptians never worthipp\'92 the Ri-\
vers, but the Crocodiles living in them; and Is, under the Shape of\
 Cow, as Or:, and other Writers tellifj.\
Since then Scripture makes ufe of allegorical Speeches,  Painter\
may allo exhibit his Subject under fymbelical and perceptible Likenefes,\
in order to be the more incelligible to the Spectator, without Fear\
that his Work will miflead faithful Chrillians, or ftrengthen heathenith\
Superflition; for  Painter, who has no other Language to express\
himself by, but Figures, ought to make ufe of them, if he would be\
underftood.\
Rubens, who of all the Painters handled thofe Tumbolical Figures\
in the molt agreeable and learned Manner (as we may particularly ob\
ferve in the Curdinal Infunt\'92 Entry into Antwerp, and in the Painting\
of the Luxemburgh Gallery) is taxed by fome with mixing, in thote\
Compositions, Truth with Fictions: But how eafily is this Judgment\
to be refured, by shewing the Ufe that judicious Artiff made thereof\
For Fiction is here not at all mingled with Truth, but only tends to\

 pray oblerve, in his Birthof the French King, Lewis XIIl. how that\
excellent Artiff has exhibited Caffer with an arrful Sway, on diflant\
Clouds fitting on his winged Horle, and oppofice to him Apolle, who, in\
his radiant Charior, is driving upwards, in order to thew, that this Prince\
was happily berninthe Morning. Hereby it is evident, that this ingenious\
Mafter had no Thoughts of reprefenting Deities as Deines, but only to\
denote, by Caffer (as accounted an happy Confiellation) the Kings\
fortunate Birth; and by Apolle, the Time of the Day, which was in\
the Morning, appearing by his Chariors mounting up from the\
Horizon.\
But further to clear my Thoughts touching the Reprefentation of\
God the Father,  shall, before  end this Chapter, fubjom the follow-\
ing Oblervation.\
mentions, that he saw the\
The Propher Exchiel, in his firtt Chapter,\
Almighty from the Appearance of his Loins even upeards, and from\
the Appearance of his Loins even downwards, as it were the Appearance\
of Fire, and it had Brightness round about. Wherefore, by this, and\
other inflances of Scripture, we fuppofe, that this sacred Figure ought\
never to be represented without  Glittering or Glery from Head to Foot;\
even in fuch Manner, that, bigger or lets, according to the Place, Oc.\
cation and Decorum, and (preading around gradually thinner and\
fainter, like  clear and tranfparent Vapour, it at latt infentibly unites\
with the By-works, and difappears.\
Now, to reduce this to  Painting, we ought firft to defign the Fi-\
sure of the Almighty, whether ficting or flanding, in Heaven or on\
Earth, in the mofl perfecl Form and Countenance, yet much bisoer\
 any heavenly or earthly Creature. This you muft colour, with \
fingle Tint or Ground,  little darker than the Glory, and afterwards\
heighten with Light. Then, with  large Bruth, foften the Figure,\
to that neither its Out line, nor any Edginels or Charpnets of the Parts\
of the Face Hands or Fect (which ought to be touched very gentle\
and faint) be perceived; jutt as if it were viewed thro'  silk Craute,\
Reamed Glass, of thin Mift; in thort, like Things feen in  Camera\
Obseurg: Obferving, that the Figure do not receive any Light either\
from on high, or from  Side, or from behind, but in Frent only,\
and about the moft relieved Parts; altho' the whole Piece have an\
other Light: It mult moreover have no other Scades than in the\
deepell Cavities, and those very faint.\
  I the Painting of\
 have before curforily thewed, why we reprefent the Almighty\
as  venerable old Man: And shall now further infift on the Pont,\
tho' without reference to all the Paltages in Scripture, which might\
ferve our Purpofe. In Duniel, Chap. Vii.  Tis written,   of tis Head was like pure Wool, and his Gurment white as Snow.\
- The Reason wbereof, Lays Gregorius Nezianzenas, is to shew\
thereby, as by an infullible Token, his clean and andefited Being. Where-\
fore the wife Exicherns is allo of Opinion, that for the same Reason\
the Ceir and Maltitude of Angels are represented in White. Others\
compare it to the human Shape, and would thereby allude to infinite\
Durarn, fince nothing is to eternal as the Godhead. Which  re-\
mark here, becaute some fcrupulous Perfons are of Opinion, that we\
ought not to reprefent God the Father in fuch  Shaps, aforned with\
White Garments and grey Hair.\
And, on this Account, all Nations have, by an univerfal Confent,\
thought proper to perform divine Service in whice Garments and Or\
naments. The Whice has alto been at all Times appropriated to the\
holy Service. Wherefore the Poet Perfins lays, \'97 He is wersipped\
in Waite.\
But what is Perfas' Saying to us, fince the Raiment of Fefts\
Chril, when he manifelted his Glory to his Dilciples, appeared as\
- The White looks\

ment; however, its not improper, to make it look more natural, that\
you keep it  litle yellowith, as lighted by  Sun, or like the Glory\
which furrounds the Figure.\
But in all this,  Painter must be very discrect, and not abuse the li-\
cence allowed him by Scripture and the Consent of the Fathers, or by\
his Art gervert the facred Truths or flight them.\
\
   . KIII. Of the Glories proper to Angels and beathenmisp\
Deities.\
 VIN  thew\'92 in what Manner, and on what Terms, ac\
cording to my Judgment, to reprefent the Almighty, let ws\
\
now inquire how the Angels, in their Power, ought to be exhibited\
 or Plafonds.\
Chap. Ij.\
 Nuxianzenns lays, that the true Property of the Angels, when\
they appear in  badity Shape, is, to have  bright Glery and glittering\
Garments. We find the ngels thus defcribed in Matt. xxviil.  in\
Mark xvi. . in  .  and many other Places of Scripture.\
This glittering Light of the Angels ought therefore by all means\
to be obterved in moll of their Appearances: As for Inflance in thofe\
co Araham, and in the delivering Lot out of Sodom, where they\
fmore the lutful People with Blindness: For irs certain, they had\
fomething more than human, fince Abrabam lalures them as Lords.\
Tis not likely, that this Honour proceeded from their coflly Dress,\
lewels and other precious Things about them, but from some heaven\
ly or uncommon Addition.\
 further Proof of this Glory of the Angels, is, the fore preffing\
of the Sedemites upon Lor, and their not covecing either him of his.\
Daughters, or any other Strangers probably living among them,\
but only thefe two young Men to be brought out, in order to Know\
them: And perhaps becaute of their more than human Form, and\
charming Brightnets. If now this Glory had thone too firong, they\
would have perceived fome Deiry,\
and forbore their Wickednets;\
for it cannot be imagined, that any Man should daringly and know-\
ingly frive againtt the Almighty.\
But, before we proceed further,  muft here deliver my Opinion,\
touching the Perfon of Fefus Chriff; which is, that in his Humanity\
and before his Resurrection, he ought to be reprefented without the\
Seaft Shining or Glory; fince he was made in the Likeness of Men,\
and would be like his Brechren in all Things, except Sin, as Scripture\
relifies: But after his Resurrection, he should be shewn with  Glory:\
(as we read he appeared to his Dilciples on Mount Taber, and in other\
Places) as having thea put off his Humanity in its principal Purpofe.\
Now, to proceed.\
We have further inffances of the Appearance of Angels, as in those\
who came to Manuah, Gideon and Tobit,. and him who imote the Peo-\
ple of Terufalem for David' Sin, C Of the firft, Scripture expretty\
lays, that be, forecelling Manoah the Birth of Samfon, ascended in\
the Flame of the Altar; poltibly in an Augmentation of CGlery unicing\
with the Flame of the Offering; by which doubling Brightness the\
Parentsof Samson were Rrengthened in their Faith and Hope of the\
Birth to come.\
If this Glory now be painted too frong and like Lightning, it blinds\
our mortal Eyes, and thus the Patriarch Abrabam could have viewed\
 the Painting of\
Book IX.\
 no more than the Prophet and Leader of Irael, Mloses, when God\
appeared to him, and patied before his Face: And this Glory would\
deffroy  Beholder.\
The blind Heathens had Glimmerings of this Truth; for when\
Semcc prefumptuoully defired, that Tuprter might once embrace her\
in the tame Majefty as he did June in Heaven, and infifted on it, not-\
Withflanding his Diffuation to the contrary, the was, on the Requeft\
granted, intirely confumed by the attending Glory of the God, info-\
mgh that with Difficulry he faved the Child he had by her.\
Whence it' plain, that the Glory, even in exhibiting the Heathenish\
Deities, ought to be oblerved; fince in their Appearance to Men ei-\
ther by Night or Day, to bless or punith them, they recained their\
full Force, Glory and Majelty; and this being weighed, they mull al.\
to be reprefented glittering, beautiful in Aspect and Shape, and in Rai-\
ment of an elegant Colour, as much as portible, and the Nature and Ule\
of the Picture will permit; as we have before hinted in the bandling\
of Colours in Cieling-pieces.\
But when the Derties appear among Men, as Men, then they ought\
to be like them, and not eafily diftinguithable, otherwife than by their\
Mien: , for inftance, in the Story of Tupiter with Califfe, Apello\
with Daptne, Tupiter with Lycaen, Mercury with Argas, and the\
like: In fuch Cales, and that they might the better play their Parts,\
they transformed themfelves incirely inco Men, and were perfectly like\
them, laying afide all God-like Glory and Shape, as if, according to\
the Opinion of the Heathens, they meant, that there can be no Union\
of the divine with human Nature.\
As to the Aotions of the heathenith Deiries, many reprefent them\
appearing in altive Poftures, as walking, running, and other Motions;\
but its as contrary to my own Opinion, as that of the great Bihop of\
Hippe, Heliedoras. This learned Man, and great Searcher into heathen\
ith Annquiries, will not allow them to go or walk when seen in their Ma-\
ie but only to ware; or teem in some meature to walk, yet gliding\
like  Ship moved gently along by the Wind, without perceptible\
Motion: They ought always to be fet out with rhin Glouds, of which,\
Iuch as are neareff them receive  greater and Rronger Light.\

As to the Angels before mentioned, who, in all Ages, have been\
reprefented with Wings, Scripture allows us the Libercy to to exhibit\
them: For the Almighty himself thewed Moses the Partern of the  the Covenant, and the Cherabins, in this Nianner, upon it. Can any\
Example be more perfect than his ? More inflances in Scripture may\
he found in the Prophecies of Duniel, Ch. ix.  Jaiah vi. Rev. iv.\
Kachiel . Eec.\
Having thus far treated of the Reprefentation of Angels, we hall\
now thew the Opinion of the Heathens, not ill agreeing with the fame\
Meaning.\
Platurch tells us, that the ancient Remons had alfo their turelar\
Guardians, by them ttiled Genis, or Birth gods: But they were not\
reprefented as ngels, or litting on Clouds, or with Wings, or Glo.\
ries, but as well-shap\'92 joung Men between  and  Years of Age, and\
without Beards, having long light Hair, composed Countenances, and cay\
Metions, and  Dog\'92 Skin over their Upper-parts.\
The Reaton of this Cloaching was, as Chryssppus fays, that they, as\
good Spirits, attend us from our Narivities, being Guardians of our\
Altions, in reproving Vice, and revenging Trantgreffions, as often  prefer Brurality before Humanity, which the Genis abhorr\'92, pur\
iuing and barking at us, in order to awake the Confcience. Of which\
Opinion is Cenforimas, and feveral others whom he quores; adding,\
that thefe Spirits watch to narrowly, that they never leave us, incit\
ing as to Virtue, in Proportion as we fortake Vice, and covet Felicity.\
Bot why need we thefe Examples! Our Saviour affirms, that the An.\
pels bois Charge ever as, to condutt and preferve us, as we have before\
said: Wherefore, the Heathens, by this Emblem, have alfo rightly\
Rited ther Gemi, Guardians.\

  likewife teffifies, that the Ancients confidered their Genir\
as Gods of Precreation, either that, as we have faid, they took care\
of us, or were born with us; for which Reafon, they believed, there\
were as many Genis as Men, and that each had his own: Or elfe, that\
there were twice as many, and that each Man had  good one and\
an evil one, the former perfeading to Virtue, and the latter to Vice;\
agreeable to what Chriflians fay of their Guardian Angels and the\
Devil, this laft not failing to afflict Mankind, tho' not born with us,\
as the Heathens believ\'92 of their Genir. Hence it is, that some re-\
prefent the Genii in the Shape of  Serpent, others, as Children or\
young Men; or elfe, as grey-headed old Men, conformable to the\
Philolopher Gebes, in his heroglyphical Table.\
Gorouffer, and the ancient Philofophers have made  Diltinction be-\
tween the nimals confecrated to the good and evil Genii; according\
to them, Dogs, Forwls, and the Tortorfe are proper to the Good, and\
Water-animals peculiar to the Evil.\
The Ancients often exhibired the Geis crowned with Gurlands of\
Hercbound, the Leaves whereof much refemble thofe of the Vine, or\
elle with Chaplets of divers Sorts of Flowers; as Tibullus, in  certain\
Place, lays,\'97 The Genins is adorned with  beautiful Chaplet of Flow-\
ers, when his Name and Feftival are celebrated to his Henour.\
Each Perfon worshipp\'92 his Genins, without knowing it, in celebrating\
his Birth-day: And thofe of Princes were especially kept by every\
body, with great Splendor; wherefore, he who falfly fwore by the\
Gents of his Prince (which was accounted  very great Oath) was an\
immediate Delinquent.\
Since, as is faid, the Ancients had two Kinds of Genii,  good one,\
and an evil one, according to the Socratic Kuclid, as Cenforinas relates,\
we shall now confider, how the erit were reprefented.\
 do not find the Ancients hal any Statues, or Refemblances of\
them, but we read, as Writers rellify, that they appeared to\
many.\
Pistarch, Appianus, Flerus, and others report, that as Bruths, one\
Night (according to his Cultom) had betaken himfelf, with  Light,\
to his Apartment, for Meditation, he faw, before him, the Likeness\

had allo  very evil Genins, of  black Colour, and frightful Look,\

  AP. XV. Of sacred Emblems.\
HE Delign of  well compofed facred Emblem is principally to\
edify, and to incite to Virtue; reprefenting it to us, as \
Looking-glats, not to much for the Regulation of our Bodies, as our\
Souls, and by fuch Means to bring us to Happiness.\
Thefe Emblems are either general or particular. General, when they\
fuit any Perion whatfoever; and particular when they relate to one\
only. When their Subject is Piety or Virtue, Learning, Liberty,\
Peace of Mind, and fuch like, they are general, and applicable to\
erery Perfon who poffeffes, or endeavours to poffets thote Qualities:\
But when  particular Perfon is their Subject, as, the Virgin Mary, an\
Apoitle, of other virtuous Man, who excelled in fome particular Gift,\
in fuch Cafe they are particular or fingular. We ought therefore, in\
the former Sort, to obferve, that the main Matter is (piritual, and in\
the later, corporal: The one exhibirs Learning itfelf, and the other,\
 learned Man, or Philofopher one thews Peace, and the other,  Mian; one reprefents Piety, and the other,  pious Man, EC.\
The one is the Matter inself, and the other, he who poffeffes it. How.\
ever,  judicious Mafter will make  Diffiattion between (piritual\
and corporal Vircues, between natural Inclinations, and heavenly Gitis.\
The Corporal, as Strength, Prudence, Equity, and the like, proceed\
from us, or, in beter Terms, are peculiar to us, walk, fand, and al\
with us; and the spiritual and beaventy, and which contequently\
 no Relation with the Body, are as without us; wherefore, they\
muft be reprefented either fitting or lying on Clouds, and the nearer\
they approach Beatitude, the more glittering, nimble, faint and wav\
ing they are to be exhibired.\
 am of Opinion, that we ought to adapt particular Sorts of Stufs\
to the aforelaid Virtues and Qualicies, according to their Ranks and\
Dignitics;\

We mull further remark on the laft of thefe, that the Charalters,\
call\'92 the Qyalities of God,  mean figural Charalters, fuch as the\
Scepter and Eye, implying Dominion; the circled Serpent; Eternity;\
the Sun, Glory; and fuch like, ought always to appear in the uppermet\
Glory, as pertaining to the Deity, and are reprefented by lovely waving\
Children. Vet, let it be obferved, that thofe Things only respect the\
Bleftings of Heaven; for when the Almighty is provok\'92, and is to in-\
flict Punishments, we muft introduce other Qualiies, fuch as his Wrash,\
Tuffice, &. alfo reprefented by Angels, with Thunder, fiery Swords,\
Scales, Coc. but thefe ought to be flronger, and like young Men; as\
we find it in Scripture, in the Story of Lot, where they ftruck the So-\
domites with Blindnets; and in that of Senmucherib, where an Angel of\
the Lord, in one Night, fmore to many Thoulands; and more fuch\
Cales.\
 shall illuftrate what  have before faid, by further Examples, in\
Tuch Manner as  apprehend the Point; and for that Purpofe have\
cholen an uncommon Subject, to ferve for  particular\
Emblem and stately Monument of ber Majefty, Mary Stuart, late Queen\
of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Princess of Orange.\
Here,  Tomb is flanding; on the left Side of the Piece, of \
Bafement whereon is carved the River-god of the Thames. In the\
Middle of the Piece, on the fecond Cround,  Princess is firting\
in Grandeur on  Throne, reprefenting England, with its proper\
Badges. She leans her Head on her left Hand, and, with her\
Right, opens the royal Robe of the Deceafed, which is lined with Er-\
min, and, with the Scepter and Crown, lies in her Lap, whereon the\
calls  forrowful Look: She is covered with  black Gaule-weed,\
which darkens the Glitter of the Seat and Coat of rms. Policy, on\
her left Side, quite dejected, is beholding the Tomb, accompanied by\
Sorrow. On the other Side appears the Proteffant Church, languithing,\
supported by Hope, who points at the Tomb, whereon flands  large\
beautiful antique Vafe, out of which is growing  Rofe-twig, having\
but one Bud, whereon Providence, fitting on Clouds, difpentes fome\
Moiffure, out of  fmall cryfial Phial, and, with her Scepter, points\
upwards at the celeftial Light, to which Wifdem, Piety, and Sted.\

with Rofes, having  bright Star over her Head; her Hands are cross\
her Breatt, and the is looking upwards with  joyful Countenance. On\
high appears Gors Lore or Tenderness, waiting for her with open\
Arms, having in its Lap  Pelican feeding its Voung with its own\
Blood. The other Characters of Lirine Happiness before-mention\'92 are\
allo feen, and elpecially, hearents or perfect Fey, or Hurmony, repre-\
fented be Spirits finging and flaring on Infruments. On the Vase is \
Niedal, wherein is carred  Phienmx arifing out of its Athes. Under it,\

, IDIE IN ORDER TOLIVE. The Tomb is hung with\
Felears of Crgress, intermixed with Rofes. On the right side of the\
\
Tomsis LAc, having, in the left Hand,  Rofe clofe to the Vale,\
and in the right,  pair of Sciliors, as if the had cut off the Rote\

holdng an Hindkerchief before her Eyes, and with the lefe Hand at\
\
\

her Breail\

 Scrond Example.\
Here, we may repreient dfrely on  raifed Throne, fitting in full\
Spleader; Clemency and Lutberiry fanding behind her, and holding\
over her Head  Crown topp\'92 with  glittering Star. On her Side\
may fir Religion, and on  Step below, Pelicy taking Shelter under\
her Garmert. Qrict, Plenty, and Success by Land and Set may be\
placed as coming in, and on the other side, Peace accompanied by At\
and Stirerc. Above, in an oven Heaven, fits Providence pouring down\
dirine Bleiting. Over the Throne, on  Cloud, should be Wiydem,\
Religicazets, and Stedfaftness.\
This Mljory may be here the Subject of this Emblem, and, if it\
have no particular Charalters, fuit any Kingdom, Power, or Com\
manwealth in Corytenfom. Bur if it have any Arms, Device, or Mot\
to, as SUFFICIT UNUS or  Flowerde Luce for France; PlUs\

 Third Example.\
The Subject of this shall be Innecence murther\'92.\
Here Innecence is proftrace, murther\'92 by raging Impiety. She lies\
near an extinguish\'92 Altar, fretch\'92 out on the Ground, cloath\'92 in \
clean white Carment, betokening an upright undefiled Heart. The\
cruel Executioner forcibly tears her innocent Child from her Breaft, and\
at the fame Time the brutith Murtherer is fepping from the Emi-\
nence whereon he fat, in order to go off; he is Raind with innocent\
Blood, and, theathing his bloody Sword, tramples under Foot  Pe-\
lican with its Toung. Rage accending him, and firing them with her\
Torch, is looking back, in great Contternation, at Heaven, which darts\
many Thunders at her. There, Divine Jutice is defcending, with\
Scales in one Hand, and Thunders in the other. Picty, bowing before\
her at the Allar, is praying, and thewing her the innocent Corps:\
Thereupon the doubles her Speed to execute Revenge. Now fee the\
Wrath of God exprets\'92, not with bright Sun beams from on high,\
but with fiery and bloody ohes.\
Here, Tuffice, or divine Wrath, has  flaming red Garment or Vail.\
Impiety is cloath\'92 in  rully copper-colour\'92 Drapery. The Excinti-\
oner, who mifules the Child, has  cruel Aspect, and is reddith. Over\
Innecence,  little Angel is afcending to Heaven, with  bright Star to\
which,  long Ray feems to proceed out of Fer Mouth; he has \
Palmbranch in his Hland, to tisuify her Hippiness.\
The following is  Chort Skewh of the Achions.\
The Head of the Corps lies in the Middle of the Piece, on the\
Fore ground, and the Feet towards the right Side, fomewhar nearer to\
the Altar, with one Leg  little up, as if there were fill some Life\
left. Behind the Alcar, Piery kncels one Knes, which is in Shade,\
the receiving her Light from Tyrice, who, on the lecond Ground, is\
with her Upper-pares directly over the Point of Sight, and her Feec\
tomewhat forethorined towards the right side, from whence the  the Painting of\
Book I On the leff Side, on the fame Ground,  little more for-\
ward, Imprety and Rage take to Flight. Rage is half chaded by dark\
Clouds, over which Heaven opens. The Fore-ground has  right\
Light; but Turice receives her Light from behind. On the left Side\
of the Piece is  dark Offskip.\
Now, as the former Emblem respected the Reward of Virtue, to\
this repretents the Punishment of Evit: in that appeared the Love of\
Gol; in this, his Wrath.\
Thus are my Thoughts on thefe Subjects, not prefuming to have\
handled them with the urmoft Accuracy;  am far from giving them\
out as perfect Emblems, fince thats the Work of great Judgment, vall\
Knowledge, and mature Confideration: Neverthelels, rough as the\
Plan is, Tis iufficient for explaining my Sentiments. And as we always\
stick either more or less to Art, and hardly keep to much within the\
Bounds of Curiofiry, as not to take some Libercies in the Dispofition\
of Things, to  have reprefented him, who is taking away the Child,\
as an Executioner, naked, his Hair tied with  Cloth, and with \
Dazger lying by him; and Impiousness, as  Prince, with  blood\
red Diadem about his Head, and  Staff in his Hand; tho' thefe Fi\
sures ought rather to be Women; moreover, the Executioner might\
have been left out.\
   . XVI. Of the Penates, Lares, and Cupids.\
NCIEN  Hiffories relate, that moft Nations which lived under\
( Laws and Policy, especially the Hebrews, Greeks, and Remans,\
Figures of Gold, Silver, Copper, or\
but moftly thefe latt, had certain\
Wood, which they fiiled Dir Penates, in Engliss, Houshold-gods.\
Thele they kept as holy, and took fuch particular Care of, that in\
cafe they happen\'92 to be loff, either thro' Carelessness, Violence, of\
other Accidents, they thought it foreboded some imminent Dilaffer,\
or bad Luck to befal them; and accordingly believed, when any\
fuch were at hand, that thofe Gods were erther removing, or va\
nithed\
The Hifforian Timaus writes, that they were reprefented like two\
beautiful young Mex, in  warlike Dress, each with  Tovelin in his\
Hand, and by or near them an eartaen Firepan, over which lay twe long\
Iron\

Chap.  cress wife, turned at the Ends like the Hazel-wands which the\
Augures held in their Hands at the Time of officiating.\
Cicero, treating of the Penates, fays, they were certain Gods brought\
forth in the Houfes of particular Men, and wershipp\'92 in the most con-\
cealed and private Places of them. And in this Sente Demephoon and\
Terence (pake, when they laid, they would go home and bide their House-\
hold-gods, before they betook to their Business and Callings.\
in Scripture alfo we have the Teraphims, or Houhold gods, which\
Rachel fole from her Father Laban, when he went to thear his Sheep;\
as the Rabbi Eliezer, in the  Chapter of his Difcourfes, largely\
treats, (peaking of Laban, and the preparing of the Teraphims.\
We have before faid, that the Penafes were in great Efteem among\
the Romans; which Dionysus Halicarnaffus affirms, faying, they were\
Wworthipp\'92 at Rome, under the Shape of two fitting joung Men, in very\
ancient and warlike Dreffes, and having favelins in their Hands; with\
this Subscription, DII PENATES, as we find it sill in ancient Me-\
dals. Nigidins was of Opinion, that they were Apolle and Neptune;\
and the rather, as by Apolle is meant Heat and Drought, and by Nep-\
June, Gold and Moifiness; judging the Worship to owe us Origin to thefe\
Effelts: Wherefore, Virgil, in the Righth Book of his Eneids, Riles\
them the great Gods, meaning the Penates. Others think, that Tupi-\
ter and Tune are lignified by them; becaute their chief Bulinets was to\
give Men Help and Affiftance, and therefore they both derive from the\
Latin Word Tavare, fignifying to belp or affjf. Others again imagine\
them to be Cafter and Pollux; becaute they, with the Penate: or\
Houlhold gods, were allo, according to the ancient Poets and Hillori-\
ans, in very great Efteem, and the Roman Worthip affigned them the\
firtt Places in their Temples.\
It will here be proper to deduce fomething, touching thefe Gods, from\
Antiquity, the becter to illultratce the Point.\
We read, that when the Daughter of Pallantes was married to Dar-\
danus, the brought, in Dower, the Gifts which Pallas had made her\
 Prefent of, being an oblong Shield dropt from Heaven (which the\
Rild Palladium) and the Figures of the Penates or great Gods. After-\
wards, on  Rebellion breaking our in Pelopennesus, where Dardanys\
and his Wife lived, he, with many of the Arcadians, fied from\
thence, taking Shipping for Samothracig, where, in Confideration of\
those Gifts, brought as  Portion, he buill  Temple, infliruting pri-\
vate Solemnities for their Religious Worthip, keeping them fecret\
from the common People, in  Vault under the Ground; and foon\
after,\
\

Book IX.\
 on his Departure for Assa, took them with him, and placed\
them in Durdama, to called from his Name. His Son Wus, being im-\
ploy\'92 in bulding liam, or Troy, tranfplanted thofe Gods thither.\
\'a3is afterwards, having faved them out of the Flames of that\
City, carried them to Pay, placing them in the City of Lavinmum.\
Afcinits, his Son, removed them to the City of  where he dedi-\
cated  large and magniicent Temple to their Honour. But, they\
iar, the Gods of themfelves, without human Affiftance, returned the\
Lext Night, to Lurimum, tho' the Gates were faft, and the Town.\
wall and Roof of the Temple found incire, and without any Breaches.\
\
zin Miracle very much turprizing Afcanins, he fent to Larinmum\
 Men, called Caratores, of whom Eggins was Chief, to guard the\
Gods. At lait, being carried to Rome, they remained without any\
Alteration, and the Roman People committing to them the Care and\
Protection of their City, and growing Empire, placed them, in lmita-\
tion of Derdanis (that they might not be fioln either by Fraud or\
Violence) in  Vaule or Temple under Ground, wherein, after Confe.\
cration, they ofter\'92 Sacritices to them; not allowing any Perfon to pit\
in this Temple, becaute the Gods, like  were worthipp\'92 with\
Fire.\
They were reprefented as young Men, and fitting, with Tavelins in\
their Hands, to lignify their being adored as Alaintainers and Protec-\
fors; for the Sitting, hicroghphically, expreffes Stedfastness in what\
ve desen to dr: The Tarelins imply, that they preserve from Harm\
and Difzzer; and the Touthfulness denotes the Increase of their\
Pbwer.\
The Lires were much like the Penates, at leaft in the Guard and\
Cyre of Citys. They allo are faid to have hid, or kept themfelves\
secret in the Houtes, as well as the Penates Which Tibullus aftirms,\
laving, that thy have not only the Cure of particular Houses, but als\
of the ihele Town.\
The Ancients ufed to place Dogs to warch their Idols called Lares;\
as being  Creature kind and fawning on the Family, and fierce and\
frightful to Strangers. They had the same Opinion of their Lares,\
or Hoshold-gods, committing to them the intire Care and Safeguard\
of their Families. For this Reafon, fays Plutarch, the Romans repre\
sented them as brisk young Men, dreft in Dogs-skins. Ovid attrms,\
they were fometimes exhibited in sbort Garments, gather\'92 up on the left\
Shoulder, and coming down under the right, in order to be more free and\
bese in their Metion; because, fays he, their Bussness was like that of\
 or Plafonds.\
  Geii (imeationed before) to inquire narrowly into Mens Aftions, for\
the Punishment of the Wicked. The Philolopher Famblicbus relates, that\
They were often worshipped on the Reads, and had from Time to Time\
Offerings of Wine and Frankincense.\
We shall now treat of the Shape of Children, diftinguithing them\
into beavenly and earthly.\
Pouffin exhibired them too fquab and full for flying, and thofe of\
Raphael are generally, chiefly in the Borders of the Hiltories of Pp-\
che, too hard and mufculous; wherefore, to find  good Form, we\
mult keep  Mledium between both. But Cupids ought not to be re-\
prefented to beary as earthly Children, yet as joung as you pleafe.\
The earthly, contrarily, mutt have Underffanding, in order to han\
dle fomething, and their Bodies to be enlarged according to what they\
are to do, or carry. But in reprefenting  Cupid, who is to deliver \
Mefage,  think tis proper to give him Age and Bulk enough to do\
the Buliness punctually, and the better to express Truth and Nature.\
As to their Wings, they muft not be made in Proportion to the Weight\
of their Bodies, like Birds; for their Bodies wave of themfelves, and\
the Bignels of the Wings often creates Deformity, unlets they are to\
reprefent  Fome, when they ought to be larger.\
As to the Loves or Cupids themfelves, they, according to my -\
preheation, differ as much in Size as Action. The one is, by the Po-\
ets, called Cupid, and the other Anteros. The former creates Love\
and Defire for Voluptuousness, and the latter leads to Firtues, Arts and\
Sciences. They have both  like beautiful and agreeable Aspect ac-\
cording to their Ages. Cupid is reprefented about  or  Vears old,\
and quite naked, armed with  Bow and Arrows, and fomerimes hold\
ing  burning Torch. Anteros, contrarily, has  purple Garment,\
with bare Arms and Legs only,  Crown of Lawrel about his Head,\
 burning Torch in his Hand, Sandals on his Feet, and he is about\
  Years of Age. Capid is wild and frolicklome, Anteres fo\
date and contemplative.\
There is another lets Kind of Cupids, fomewhat younger and more\
timple than the former. Thefe increase Lave, incite the Pleasure of Vo-\
lupiueufness, or mere strongly delude the Senfes. To them, in order to\
thew their Simplicity, are alcribed childith and idle Actions, fuch as\
Dancing, Shiping about, Running, Rolling, Flying, Kinging Apples at\
each other, Coc. They mult not have Quivers, Bows, Arrows, or\
Torches, but Baskets of Fruit and Flowers, or Chaplets,  Looking.\
glals, or any thing tending to the Pleafures of Vinus.\
Alex\
No.  IX.\
 the Painting\
 Propertius, Phileffratus, Claudianus, Silius Italious,\
Artix:, and others, relate, that the different Loves or Cupids do not\
only respect the Charms and Service of Venus, but alfo imply the\
Defires and Tendencies of the Heart; fince all Men do not affect the\
Same Object, but each chufes for himself.\
We regrefent Capid or Love in the Form of  little Child, becaute\
is fortih to betake to Venery; for the Actions and Speeches of thofe\
in Love are as imperfet as thofe of little Children; as Virgil hews\
 begins to (peak, and stops in the middle of her Talk.\

it in their Manner of Living and Service. And as Reafon principally dit\
Kinguithes Man from Bearts, fo we any where fee, that the Vle of it\

Antiquity, how and in what Manner divers Nations, not enlightened\
by the Golpel, have dedicated their Worship, under Fictions and Fa-\
bles, to the invisible Being; and begin with the Exyptians.\
The Cultom of thefe People was, when any Perfon prayed to the\
Gods, that he mult, as the moft decent Action, do it panding, and with\
lifted up Hands. Which Pofture was alfo firictly obferved by the\
Romans in their religious Worthip, as Martial and Horace teftify.\
Virgil likewife thews, that flanding with Hands lifred up lignities Wor-\
ship; when he introduces Anchifes (at the miraculous Sight of  Head, encompafted with  thining Light, and yet his Hair unhurt\
by the Flame) joyfully turning his Eyes to Heaven, and lifting his\
\
Hands in Prayer to Tupiter: And, in Confirmation of the Acceptable.\
nets thereof,  loud Thunder was foon after heard, and  Star appear-\

Tail, defcending towards the Houle, glid along, and at laft hid in the\
Wood of Mount Ida, leaving behind  long light Stripe which emit-\
ted  fulphureous Vapour and Smoke: Whereupon Anchises, panding\
 invokes the Gods, and facred Stars. Philo fays, that the erect\
fanding Pofture denores an humble Heart wholly devoring itfelf to\
Heaven. Authors unanimoutly agree, that the Ancients offered their\
Sacrifices, Vows and Prayers to Tupiter in  flanding Pesture; but to\
the Goddess Ops, in  fitting one; fignifying thereby, that the was the\
Mother of the Earth. Pythagoras enjoins thofe who pray, to do it\
fitting: Xet Plutarch fays, that Numa Pompilins was the Author of\
that Vows and Prayers ought to be\
that Cultom; thereby teaching,\
certain and conflant.\
Randing, St. Paul feems to exhort\
As to the Pofture of praying\
likewife in the Old Teffament, that\

the Pricks did, in their Prayers, pretch out their Hands to Heaven. In\
the Book of Judges, Chap. vii. we read, that in Gideons Army, the\
Men who bowed down on their Knees to drink, were, by Gods\
Command, fent away; but thofe who drank panding, putting their\
Hands to their Mouths, were cholen, and defeared the Midianites:\
in Exed. Chap. xvii. is written, that as long as Moses beld up. bis\
Hands, Amalck was ditcomfted: Which, as Adamantius fays, figni-\
fee, that he offered up to God his Actions and Enterprizes, not like\
creeping Animals who cleave to the Earth, but as directing his Heart\
and Tboughts to Heaven. On which Grounds and Examples, the Coun-\
cit of Nice ordained Prayer to be made standing.\

Hestes, but allo in their being open, infide upwards, as if we gave\
them to kiss. They who adore and fupplicate, fays Hieronymus, are\
uted to tiss the Hands: Wherefore the Hebrexs judged this Manner\
of Kiffing to be very reverential, and firictly obferved it. Cj.\
cere and Catalius allo confirm the Signification of lifting up or pretch-\
ing out boto the Hands to Heaven. Terrullian, (peaking of praying\
for the Prefervation and Profperiry of the Emperor, fays thus: Tbe\
Chrizians barch:ated ift up their Hands, with their Eyes to Heaven in\
token of Innecence; fignissing thereby, that they had no Occasion to be\
afpamed, but heartih prayed for their Emperor. The Tuscans likewife,\
in their Prayers, vicd fuch  Pofture or pretching out the Hands; and\
in adoring their Gods, elpecially Tupiter, lifted up their Hands to\
Herten. Of which Ingif alto makes mention in his yth Eneid, where\
he defcribes Yartas among the Statues and Allars of the Gods, iff.\
ing  tis Hands to Heaven, humbly and earneltly imploring Tupiter.\
He read further, that in the Olympic Games, anciently celebrated at\
Syrnl,  ridiculous and ignorant Actor was reproved by the Sophill\
Polemon, for his awkward Motions with Hands reverfed; becaute when\
he was to lay \'97 Op Tupiter  \'97 he rurned his Hands downwards,\
and in faying \'97Ob Earth) \'97 he looked up to Heaven. But\
thefe perverle Geftures, proceeding from ancient Cultoms, are still feen\
among the Remish Clergy, who, as oicen as they pronounce the Word\
Gidor Lird, give the Bletting to the Congregation; and in praying for\
the Proiperity of the People, tretch our their Hands on high. in the\
Medal of Gordiarus Pins, we fee  small Figure with the Arms thus\
extended, and the Hands open, with  Motto alluding to the Matter,\
PIETAS AUGUST. Bur, to recurn to the ancient Egeptians.\
They uled to reprefent the Deity in an hieroglyphick Manner by \
Circke: And, agreeable thereto, the Philofopher Pythageras enjoined  round in the doration of the Gods. Afernous fays allo,\
that he gathered from the Greef Writings, that they had an ancient\
Cuffom of running round the Allars when they offered Sacritice, be\
ginning from the left to the right side, according to the Zodiac, and\
then running from right to left. Plstarch thinks, this was done in  of the heavenly Motions in their continual Rotation, which\
Mortals ought to follow. Tho' others pretend, that thereby was\
A the concinual Changes and laftability of human Actions.\
for the continual Mocion and turning of the Body in Prayer, we find if\
to have been the Cuffom of divers Nations; and in this Sante the Poct\

  in his rii Book, accolts his Miflrels,   have often\
furn\'92 roand before yeur Door, and offered up to you my Soul and my Pray-\
ers. Like which, there is  Paffage in Suctoniss, when he speaks of\
the Anceffors of Vitellins, \'97 He had, fays he,  particular Ad-\
dress for Flattery, and was the firft who commanded divine Worship\
to be paid to Carus Cafar: And no Perfon durft, after his Recurn from\
Syris, appear in his Prefence without being covered, and turning fe-\
veral times round, with the Face downwards. Numa Pompilius or-\
dained, that Men should turn feveral times round, in Prayer to Hea-\
ven, and afterwards fit down; thereby incimating, that, in wordly\
Affairs, Mortals muff expect nothing but inconflancy and continual\
Change, which they ought to bear with Parience and Refolution.\
Add to this what Pliny fays; that the Manner of turning round in\
Prayer was from the left to the right Hand, in Imication of the\
Earth; which, according to him and others, turns on its Axis affer\
that Manner. Hiffories inform us, that as Camillus, in Prayer, turn\
ed round, according to the Roman Cultom, he fuddenly fell. By which\
Accident the People (much addicted to Superflition) would needs pre-\
lage his Rum, which happened foon after. We read allo, that Mar-\
collus, being at War with the Tranfalpine Ganls, and come to  Town\
called Capide, in order to charge them, his Horfe, attrighted by the\
Shouts of the Enemy, went backwards; wherefore, to encourage his\
Men, he turned him round as if he were adoring the Sun, according\
to the Reman Cuftom before Bstcle, and thus covered the Accident\
without the People' perceiving it.\
We shall now, for the Readers greater Satisfaction, treat of Piety,\
and what relates to it.\
The Ancients chiefly effcemed the Allar as an Hicroglyphic of Pis\
ety, offering, according to their Opinion, their Prayers to the Gods\
by means of Fire; which being suppoted  Medium between heaven-\
ly and human Things, they pretended it to be  Mediator or Mefien-\
ger. Accordingly Virgil, in his  Eneid, \'97  touch the Altar,\
and call the Fire upon it and the Gods to witness, &cc. They urge fur-\
ther, that Fire unites with material Parts, and always rifes upwards\
from below; as knowing all our carchly Actions, and imparting them.\
to the heavenly Spirits. Hence we fee, that the Manners of offering\
Sacrifices are not without fome Foundation in Reafon, becaute the\
Laws of Nature were always purely oblerved. And fince the World\
has been enlightened with the Truck, Fire is cultomarily ufed in divine\
Service, and no Sacrifice was thought acceptable without it. Indeed,\
if\
\
\
Of the Painting of\
Book XI.\
 earthly tirestures can in anywife reconcile us to Heaven, nothing has\
\
 with the Spirit than Fire, as it lights and clears\
greater&\
every thing. Wherefore they think, they may reprefent the Genii\
and Angels, even the Deity itfelf, by it.\
As to the Atars and Piety, we fee, in the Medal of the Empe-\
for, . Lius,  Figure with open Hands, which, as before obferved,\
igaines Werfing; and by ir, an Aktar, with thefe Letters, PIETAS.\
in one of Halrianas Augura; is the same Figure, between  Stork and\
an Allar adorned with Groundlvy; with this inscription, PlETAS\
At In one of Dirs Augaia Fauffina appears  Woman, lifting\
up her Garment with the left Hand, and laying the Offering on the\
burning Alar with the other; having the Word PIETAS. In the\
Medal of Lucily we fee  Figure flanding behind an Allar, with \
Cup in iis Hand, as ready to offer; wish the WordPlET AS. in that of\
KntCRints is the Figure of Piety, opening the right Hand as  Token\
of Adoration, and with the left ready to put the Sacrifice on the ).\
fir; with the fame inlcription. In the gold Medal of . Elins Ca-\
fur the right Hanl of the Figure is in the fame Action, and the left\
holds  Gitt; allo inscribed PlETAS.\
We offer Prayers and Supplications either in making Vows or fe\
ceiving Favours in confequence of them. Hence proceed the various\
Inscriptions on Medals; which nevercheless do all allude to Piety,\
whether in praying for Help or returning Thanks. Accordingly we\
find in the Medal of Juls Pia Aug.  Woman tucking up her Gar-\
ment on the left Side, and offering with the right; with this in\
Scription VOTA PUBLICA. But in one of Hadrianus are two Fr\
sures, one like the Emperor, and the other holds in the lefe Hand \
Palm-fprig, and, with the right, offers him  Cup, having this\
Motto, ADVENTUI AUGUSTl. in one of Demitian is  bun\
ing Alar, intribd, PRINCEPS JUVENTUTIS.\
The Alcars were ancienly, as they are now - -days, Places of\
Safety and Protection. Wherefore Priamus, in Virgil, having loft all\
Hope of Prefervation, took Sanctuary at the ltar; of which his\
Wife had said, \'97 This Altar shall proteft us all. Cicero, (peaking\
of the ACfor Refcins, (avs, \'97 We run into his House as to an Altar.\
And Ovid, in his Triffib. \'97 The Altar only is left me in my Mif-\
fortune.\
The Arkenians had  particular Alear dedicated to Mercy and Com-\
passion; as we gather from the Poet Papinins, and Lattantins Gramma\
ts, and from Apfinis in his Rbeteric. Pistarcb, treating of Su\
perflition,\

  calls the ltar abominable. Kenopbon, in his fecond Book\
of the State of Greece, takes Vefta for an Emblem of Refage\
\
to the Altar: When Theramenes, fays he, had heard the Things, be\
took to Velta for Resuge. Pollux calls Fefa the Alfar of Offering;\
especially that at the  Pritancum, where the everlalling Fire was\
Kept. Disnytus Halicarnaffus fays, that Romulus buile  Temple in\
Honour of Peta, and as  Memorial of his having divided the Ro-\
man People into z Wards. Suctonins writes almoft the fame in the\
Life of Tiberins.\
in fine, the Allars were fet up for Sacrifices and Prayer, to obtain\
divine Favour and Bleffing; tho' few have determind, which of the\
various Sacrifices was beft and moft approv\'92 by the Ancients; who of\
ford to the Almighty only in Spirit and Underftanding, without ut-\
tering  Word. Wherefore the Egyptians honour\'92 the Crocodile, as\
having no Tongue, applying it to the divine Silence. They praifed\
the Spirits and Souls of the Everbleffed; and offer\'92 to heavenly\
Things material ones, fuch as had some Affinity with them, viz. Fire\
to the Sun, Coc. But to the evil Spirits, or Devils, they brought Of-\
ferings that they might not hurt or obtlruet them, or that their Un-\
cleannels might not pollute the Sacrifice, or the Savour of the Meat.\
The  Egrptians always thought it abominable to expiate with the\
Blood of Animals, and therefore offer\'92 only Prayers and Frankin-\
cente. The Kings of the Protemaic Line enjoyn\'92 them Sacrifices to\
Serapis and Saturn, to whom they built Temples without their\
Towns, wherein to offer Beafts, as whual; tho', in after Times, ac-\
cording to the inhuman Cultom of Bufris, on his ulurping the\
Countries and Places bordering on the Nife, they offer\'92 Men.\
But of Offerings we shall treat further in the following Chapter.\

to enquire into the ancient Manners and Cultoms relating thereto,\
both in general, and with respelt to particular Countries.\
Scripture informs us, that the Athemans were very religious; where\
fore ther, as well as the Remans, left they should forget  Deiry,\
would rather let up an Altar to the unknown God, and make Offer.\
ings thereon, than be any ways negligent in the Duty of Worship.\
From which Alfar, St. Parl took Occafion to preach to powerful \
Sermon, touching Crri? and his Colpel, as thereby to bring over\
 Souls to Ch.rLAREr.\
We mult conclude, that to many Allars required many Prielts; who\
 as deterent in Dres as the Gods and Manner of Offering; thote\
of Tufiter not at all like Priapuss, nor Diana' thofe of Bacchus,\
as we thall thew in the Sequel.\
The great Laver of the foxs evidences, that their Priefts obferved\
\
\
 perfet Clea.. in their Worthip. Even the Almighty himfelf\
ordered dois to par off his Shoes, when he appear\'92 to him in the\
burning Buth, and that any Beaff or Man who touched the Mount\
or its Borders, to long as he was prefent, should be thot or\
Roned.\
It is not probable, that the Heathens were to nice in this Point;\
neverthelets, the prefent Cuftom induces us to believe, that their An\
celtors no lets obferved this Decency in their Worhip; fince, to this\
Day, even Chriflians are not allowed to enter the Mofques of the Ma-\
fometons; tho' of all intidels they are the leaft Obfervers of religious\
Ceremonies.\
 think it amiss to deride the Eggptians in particular, for paying\
divine Honour to fome Bealts; becaufe molt Nations, especially the\
Greeks, (who excell\'92 in Wifdom and Knowledge) as likewife the hrill\
Romans were infected with the lame Superftition.\
Alarrobins writes, that King Junus was the firft who introduced and\
chabliked in Iraty the Offerings to the Gods; and that he himself was\
afterwards worhipp\'92 as fuch, even to much, that the ancient Romans\
never facrificed before they had invoked him as the inventor and Pro-\
rector of the Ofterings; for they believed, he always fat at the Gates\
of Heaven, and that the Prayers of Mortals could not reach the Gods\
if he denied them Entrance, nay, he muft even lend them an Hland\
to go forward, becaule Prayers, which Hemer calls Women, are lame\
and Cripples.\
The moll ancient Nations who brought Offerings (of which the\
Eggzrrans were doubilets the principal) did not make ufe of Bealts,\

  Herbs, Flowers, Trees, and Plants, as likewife Perfumes;\

therefore who anciently lived on Beafts Fleth did it, as reported, for\
want of Fruits) and this on an Opinion of Pythagoras, who forbad\
the Eating of Meat or Blood, as judging that the Soul had its Reb-\
dence theren: Alcho\'92 Eufebins relates, the ancient Divines maintained,\
that no Beafts, even no Meal, Honey, Fruits or Flowers, ought to\
be offered; for, favs he, God knows them who fear him, and savoura-\
bly accepts the poored Leaf they lay on the Altar regerding their Hlearts\
and Inclinations, and not what they offer with their Hlands.\
tescertain, that, in old Times,  deceltable Cultom prevailed amongal-\
moft all Nations, of burchering Men for Victims; as, we learn from cre-\
dible Authors, was practifed to Diana Taurics. And not only the an\
cient Scythians, but allo the Egeptians and Romans were infelted with\
this Crueky; the former offering fuch Villims in Honour to June, and\
the latter to Tupiter called Latiahs, whom they eftcemed the Pro-\
teltor of the Latins. Sicinnius Dentatus, (or the footh\'92, as being to\
born) very famous for martial Exploits, was the firll among the Ro-\
mans who facrificed Men to Mars. Athanassus relates, that divers -\
ther Nations, after their Return from Conquelt, had  Cultom of di-\
viding their Prifoners inco Hundreds, and that one our of each, as the\
unlucky Lot fell, was facrificed to Mars. Varre alfo reffifies, that the\
wandering Trojans, on their Arrival ar laft in Faly, offered, accord-\
ing to the Oracle, one Mian in ten to Plato and Saturn. Enaas, as.\
Virgil informs us, chose eight young Gallants out of the Prisoners be\
took of the Enemy, to facrifice them to the Gods of Hell for the sake of\
Pallas deceased. Diederus Siculus mentions, that the People of Car-\
thage facrificed to an Idol of Metal, reprefenting Saturn, holding our\
iis Arms bent, young Men as  Burnt-offering, by confuming them\
alive in the Flames of  red hof Oven placed under this Figure. Which\
Offerings were long retained among thole People, vill ac lafl, having\
them in Abhorrence, they put  live Deer to the same Ufe: Ver,\
some Time after the Death of flexunder the Great, on being vifited\
with the Plague, and the Town clofely belieged, and reduced to Fa.\
mine by Agathocles, King of Sirity, they, according to the common\
Cultom of Nations, had recourfe to their imagined Turclargods;\
Prayers, and old Superflitions, believing, that Suturn, provoked by\
the Change of Offering, (which their Anceltors, with great Devotion,\
appropriated to him) had, as  Punishment, caufed this Difaffer and\
irreparable Damage to befal them: Which Opinion fo infinenced on\
the Minds of the Citizens, that they barbarouly, in one Day, offer\

  others fay goo, Vouths of noble Birth, to that Idol as an\
Attonement. The tame Writer adds, that the Phanicians exceeded\
all other Nations in that unnatural Practice; infomuch, that in  fran\'ac\
Ec Extravagance, and to appeafe the imagined Wrath of the Idol\
Sararn, they lacrificed their own Children; and afterwards, abating\
that Cruelr, they made ufe of thofe of other Men, whom they fe-\
creelr bought or Hole for this abominable Purpofe. But Pictarch fays,\
that Gelez, King of Sicily, having vanquithed the Carrbaginians in the\
Bartle of Hiners, forced them to promife, never more to offer either\
their own or other Mens Children in fuch  Manner. Quintus Curti.\
is retizes, that this cruel Culfom prevailed among the People of\
Tre, rill the Deftruction of that City. And, according to St.  the ancient Guals, Inhabitants of France, as now called, and\
leveral other Narions were defiled with this Abomination. Hiliega-\
 one of the greatell and moft extravagant Tyrants who ever far\
on the Roman Throne, cauted all Ialy to be fearched for beautiful\
and noble Vouths whole Parents were still alive, barbaroutly, and to\
the greater Sorrow of their Families, to offer them as Victims. The\
Tcus are allo, not without Reafon, much cenfured by Appion, Tulian\
the Apoftare and others, for having facrificed Men to Idols; abhor.\
ring the Cruely of Fepbthah Chief of the Cileadites, in delivering up\
his Daughter for  Burnt offering. This deceftable Superftition was\
no: only prevalent among the Heathens, but alfo among the Kings of\
TudRL, the Rulers of Gods cholen People, in making their Children\
pats thro' the Fire, offering them up to Moloch; as we read of Apar,\
and Manuffer,  Kings xvi. and xxi. and as Tefepbus, de Antig. lib.  after the Manner of the Canganites. Cambyfes, King of Perfia, and\
Aexander the Great, after him, by publick and univerial Laws, pro=\
hibired their Subjects thefe abominable Offerings: Vet, not being long\
obferved, the Emperor Hadrianus, under fevere Penalties intirely fup-\
preft them. Hercates firft abolithed the killing of Men for  Sacrifice\
to Saturn, offering him to many burning Lights in their flead, and\
thereby reformed the inhuman Cuftom. This he did on his Return\
from Spain; and affigned for Reafon, that the Greek Word gas, (which\
the Oracle of Dodone had made ule of for the Inflitution of that So\
lemnity) lignified Light, as well as Man, and that therefore they were\
to offer to Plato  baked Figures of Clay, and burning Torches or Can-\
dles inflead of Men: For which Caufe, they, on the Feffivals of Sy-\
tarn, called Saturnalis, made Prefents to one another of little Figures\
and\
\
 Macreb... .  or Plafonds.\
  burning Wax-candles. But Lycurgus, the Lacedemonian Legillator,\
ordained, that Pigs should be ufed for Vicims inflead of Men.\
The lmage of Diang, mentioned before, which Iphigenia and Ore-\
Hes had brought, bound up in  Bundle of Willow-branches, from Chersonesus\
 Taurica, now called Crim, was worshipp\'92 by the Lacedemeni-\
\
ans with great Reverence. They anciently offered to it Men, who\
were cholen by calling the Lot: This cruel Cuftom Lycurgus alrered\
thus; they led Vouths to the Alcar of the Idol, and whipped them to\
long till, according to their inflitution and the Will of the Oracle, it\
was (prinkled with human Blood: And this was done to encourage\
young People not to fear the Cuts and Wounds they might receive\
from the Enemy in Battle.\
Plutarch alfo relaces, that anciently, when the Plague had made  Havock at Lacedesion, the People were informed by the Oracle,\
that the infection would ceafe if they offered yearly fome noble Vir-\
gins. The Lacedemonions obeyed. At laft it happened, that the Lot\
tell on Helena; who being led for Sacrifice, an Eagle defcended and\
fnatch\'92 the Weapon our of the Prieft' Hand, carrying if over  Field,\
where he dropped it on  Heifer. Ariftides, in his  Book of the\
Nalian State, mentions the fame Accident formerly happening at Rome\
to Valeria Luperca.\
The Head, fays Hefycbius, Bilhop of Terusulem, as having of all\
that is created, Reafon, is called Understanding, and has planted its Seat\
in the Heart. God alto formerly commanded, that the Head and Li-\
ver, and all that belonged to it, should be  Burnt offering to him:\
For from the Heart and the Liver come forth the Springs and Moti-\
ons of our carnal Appetites. And in this Senfe St. Punf bleffes his\
Congregation, laying, \'97 The Peace of God, which pafes all Un-\
derflanding, keep your Hearts and Minds, &cc. The Prophet Iaiah\
lays likewife, the whole Head is fick, and the whole Heart jaint: From\
the Sole of the Foot even unto the Head, there is no Soundness in it.\
Heredotus writes, that the Scythians worthipp\'92 divers Gods, but\
did not erelt either Temples, Allars or lmages, other than to Mlars,\
altho' their Manner of Sacrifice was one and the fame to all their Gods;\
and which  think not improper to mention here. The Victim be\
ing brought to the appointed Place, with its Fore-legs ried, the Prieff\
followed, ftriking it on the Head; which cauting it to fink, they there-\
upon invoked the God to whom it was to be offered. Then he threw\
 Rope about its Neck and Rrangled it, and pulling the Skin and Fleth\
from the Bones, he put the fame, if they had no Wood, on the Bones\
with\
  the Painting of\
Book IV\
 other burning Mixtures, in order to boil it; and if they wanted\
the Skin again, and\
the necellary Kettles, they pur the Fleth into\
ths broiled it on the Fire. This being done, the Prieft offered the\
Victim to the God they incended But among all their Villims the\
Horle was the chief, which therefore they dedicated to Mars; whose\
Temple, when damaged and decayed by Rains, Dampness and  bad\
Clmare, they recrieved in the following Manner. They gathered\
many Branches, Twigz, and Chips of Trees, piling them into  large\
Square Heap, made perpendicular on three Sides, and floping on the\
fourth, to as conveniently to step on: In the middle of this Heap,\
they laid  large Knife, not unlike the prefent Persan or Turkis Sei\
mitars, which they imagined to be the true imase of Alars, whom\
ther motily worshipp\'92 and honoured with their Offerings.\
That the Hone was anciently firll facriticed to Alars, the Hiffories\
of the Grects and Romins plainly evince. The Annals of the latter\
tenity, that they uled to offer yearly to him, in the Campus Rlartins,\
on the rath of December, an Horfe which had won the Prize in the\
Rece; thereby befeeching the God to favour their warlike Enterpri\
 with Succels. Punusuniss reports, that Tyndurus, Father of Heb.\
 who was ravithed by Paris and carried to Troy, having determind\
the urmot Revenge, aftembled all the Grecian Princes in Conjunttion\
with her Confort Menclins, vowing, by the Sacrifice of an Horfe, to re\
venge by Sword the Affront put upon him and his Family. Someallo\
precend, that the aforelaid Feltival, kept on the  of December, has\
been celebrared on the rath of October, and that the Name of Octo-\
Ser was given to the Horfe appointed for thofe Purpofes. On which\
Occation,  great Conrelt one time arole at Rome about the facrificed\
Horfes Head; tome infitting to have it on the Capitol, and others, on\
 Tower of the City, called Alumitis. The Solemnities of this Rice\
were performed in the following Manner: On the r of October,\
 led  ne Horte, deckt with Garlands of Greens, intermised\
witk Flowers and Loaves of Bread, thro' the Streets and Quarters of\
\
ine Town, and being arrived at the Campas Martins, they there\
killed and offered him to Afars, for obtaining Profperity and Fruirful\
neis. This was done to befeech the God ro prevent ruinous War; in\
which, the Cavalry caules the greateft Damage and Destruction to the\
Product of the Field: For it would be abfurd to think, that the Ro\
mens, who pretended to be defcended from the Trejans, should offer\
the Horfe to lars, after the Greek Manner, and in Conformity to\
the Inceation of Tynduras, in order to be revenged of their Anceffors:\

Chap.  it was only for the Reafon aforelaid. The Lacedemenions.\
as Feffus affirms, had allo  Cullom of offering an Horfe yearly on\
Mount Taygeras; burning him to Athes for the Wind to featter into\
all their Towns, Villages and Diftrilts. And Paufanias mentions,\
that the Macedemans facrificed on the fame Mount, an Horfe to the\
Sun, in imitation of the Persians. Kenophon afferts the fame in his\
Memoirs, when he relates, that they made Curio  Prefent of an Horle\
for that Purpofe; knowing it was the Cultom of the Persians to ho\
nour the Sun with fuch  Victim. He fays further, that the Sarma-\
tans bred Horfes for Sacrifice and Suftenance. The Salentines likewile\
offer\'92 Horfes, and afterwards burnt them, in honour to Tupiter. The\
People of Rbodes offer\'92' to the Sun  Chariot with four beautiful Hor-\
fes, which they drove into the Sea, to be fvallow\'92 up by the Waves;\
believing the Sun ran round the World equipp\'92 in that Manner. We\
read in the heroic Poems of Pbiloffratus, that, in order to overcome\
their Enemies, they were obliged to offer to the Sun  white Foal\
who had never Known the Bridle or Spur: This was done by the Ad\
vice of Patamedes, to buoy up and animate the Greeks, who, at the\
Siege of Trey, were firuck with Frights and Fears at the Sight of  Eclipfe which then happen\'92.\
Origines intimates, that the offering  Bullock before the Taberna-\
cle, according to the ancient Tewiss Rice, fignified, that ree must Jub-\
due all Pride and Haughtiness; and by  Calf, the having overcome the\
Weakness of the Flesh.\
The Exotians had  Cultom of facrificing to Neprane  Bullock,.\
called with them Mucytes, or bellowing; becaufe his Noife has some\
Affinity with that of the Billows when violently agirated by the\
Winds. The Bullocks, which the Prielts felected for that Deiry, ought\
to have dark and black Hair, thereby to fignify the dark Depths of\
the Water. Wherefore many think, that the Eagle is called, by the\
Latins, Aquilu, from the Word Aqua, as having  dark and blackith\
Colour. For the same Reafon, the Sea-gods are ufually reprefented\
with brown Complexions, blucith Hair and Garments, and with full\
Chells and broad Shoulders, like Bullocks. As to the TuurnLndi, or\
Bull-folemnities in ule among the ancient Romans, they were not infli-\
tated by them in Honour to eprane, but for the infernal Gods, whom.\
they believed were thereby moved to Compaffion, when, under Tar-\
quinius Superbus, the City was aftlicted with  Plague, which carried off\
Abundance of Women with Child, and the Peopie imputed the Misr\
forcune to the eating the Fleth of black Bullocks..\

Of the Painting of\
Book IX.\
 Sacrifices which the Roman Cenfors uled to offer every fitth\
Year for their Purification, and called Solitaurilia, contifted of  Boar,\
 Ram, and  Bull.\
The offering  Bullock, as we gather from Hiftory, was generally,\
especially among the Romans,  Token of Viltory gained over the\
Enemy. Accordingly, Turenal fays, They led to the Capitol  large\
black Bullock markel with Chalk. But here it mutt be obferved, that\
the Lerdemomans in Come Sort imitated the Romans in leveral of their\
Sacrifices of that Nature; for when the latter got  Victory by Slaugh.\
ter and taking the Enemy Pritoners, they offer\'92  Bullock; bur\
when without Bloodthed,  Sheep. The Lacedemonions, contrarily,\
facrinced  Bullock, on obtaining  Victory without Cruelty or Blood\
thed; and  Cock, when it was got in the open Field, in  pirch\'92 Bar-\
le, preferring Enterprizes performed with Reafon and Conduct, to\
thote effected by main Force.\
We read likewile, that anciently, especially among the Romans, the\
Bullock was to much regarded, that it was as capital to Kill one, as\
to murther  Citizen. Wherefore Erichthans, reigning at Athens, or\
derd, that ar the yearly Feffival, wherein  Bullock was facrificed, the\
Peey, or Prieft (whofe Ducy requir\'92 him to furnith the Cartle, and\
to cut their Throats when knock\'92 down) should, after the Solemnity\
was over, and in Mlaintamance of the Law, fortake the Town and\
Territory, firft leaving the Ax at the Foot of the Altar.\
The Treffulians were enjoined by the Oracle of Apalle at Dodone, to\
offer Sacrifice yearly on the Tomb of Acbilles; and to furnith the Ne.\

and the other white; the Wood from Mount Pelion; the Fire out\
of Theffal; and Flower and Water from the River Sperchins. With\
thefe were to be ufed Garlands and Feftoons of Greens, intermixd\
with Amaranths, that, in cafe the Ships, bringing the Neceffaries\
from other Countries, should be kept back by contrary Winds, at leaft\
Iuch Greens and Flowers as never wither, might not be wanting to\

Apollodorus and Attrnaus relate, that Hercules was to great an Eater,\
a often to devour  whole Bullock at  Meal: For which Reafon, the\
Ancients dedicated to him the Water-foul, called by the Greeks pages,\
in English Sea-mew; becaule this Bird, according to Suidas, is very\
voracions; nay, on account of this Excels in eating, they brought\
him Offerings, whereby Men were not allowed to ufe any other Expret\
tions than Curting and Swearing. Laftantius and Apellodorys relate the\
Story\

Chap.  thus; Hercules on  Time travelling with some Companions\
thro Rbodes, and being very hungry, met with  Country-man at\
Plough with  Couple of Oxen, which he defired to purchale for fill-\
ing his Belly; but the Man rejecting the Proffer, Hercules took the\
Cattle by Force, and with his Companions eat them up. The other,\
inrag\'92 and frantic hereat, curs\'92 and fwore at Hercules as he was eat-\
ing; who laughed and banter\'92 him, faying, he never eat  better\
Morfel, or with more Gufto, in all his Life. Wherefore the Inhabi-\
tants of that Ifland erected an Altar to him, after his Deification,\
whereon was carved  Yoke of Oxen; offering thereon, at certain\
Times,  Couple of Oxen: At which Solemnity the Prielts and Peo-\
ple buftled about, and made  great Noife, by curting, fwearing, and\
other Impieties, which they thought would pleafe the God, in Re-\
membrance of the Adventure with the Plough-man.\
Imalt fubjoin another Sacrifice to the Honour and Memory of the\
deitied Hercules, not lets foolith than ridiculous. Suidus relares, that\
the Exotions on  certain Time leading an Ox for Sacrifice, he broke.\
loofe and ran away. Whereupon the Mob; unwilling to pretermit\
the Time for Celebration, Ruck an Apple on four Sticks, with two\
imaller on top, reprefenting four Legs and two Horns; offering this,.\
with great Solemnity, to Hercules. Others afcribe this Apple-facrifice..\
intlead of an Ox, to the Athenians: And Tulius Pollax tellifies, that it\
was long in ule among the Thebans. Vet Pausanids, in his Memoirs,.\
reports, that as the Apple-tree is fometimes accepted by the Gods,.\
in token of  propitious Sacriice, to the Beotians, at the Oxs running.\
away, offer\'92 to Hercules an Apple tree, having but four Branches,\
intlead of the fourlegged Beaft; whence it became afterwards cultom=\
ary to confecrate that Tree to this God. And Apellodorus affirms, ac-\
cording to Zenedotus, that thole Offerings of the Beotians were inflead\
of Rams and Sheep.\
The imploring Help and Favour by means of  Bullock, reminds\
me of  Cultom of the ancient Scytbrans, now called Tartars, who\
Killing and stripping  Bullock, the Perfon who had received any Injury\
from another, took the Skin, (pread it on the Ground, and fac upon it with\
his Hands behind him; and thofe who, in palting by, promited to give.\
their Alfiffance, trod un the Skin with the right Foot, thereby figaiiving.\

Bur the Egigrians hated this Creature, not only for his Dulness\
and Stupidity, but allo for his Skin mix' with brown and white;\
which they accounted abominable, and untit to be offer\'92 to the Gods.\
Accordingly, they abuted him as much as posfible, finging Stones and\
Clods of Dirt and Mud, and pricking him with Charp pointed Sticks;\
and when, in the Purfuit, they found him on  convenient Eminence,\
they made him roll down it. Hence arifes the comparative Proverb\
applied to contemptible Perfons, The  of Egypt.\
Thefe People were not the only ones who paid Honour to the Hog:\
Other Nations have ranked it with their Gods. For this Creature was\
formerly facred in Cantis, where they believ\'92, that Tupiter, at his\
Birth, luck\'92  Sow, which, by her grunting, intirely drownd the\
the Cries of the Child; tho' some will rather afcribe this Kindness to\
the Goat of Amaltheu.\
The ancient Nalian Kings had  Cultom, to offer an Hog in\
their nuptial Solemnties: And the Great, in their nuptial Fealts,\
brought, according to the Tufcan Manner, an Hog to the Allar, con\
fecrating it to the Turelar-gods, and Prefiders over new married Per\
sons: Which was the general Cuftom of the Greeks as well as\
of the Latins.\

Chap.  They of Arges celebrated ihe Fellival called Hyfferies, by offering\
in Hogtin Hohour to Vehws Of which Copinacbus largely treats;\
tho' we find the Sicyonians dedicated to her all Kinds of Bealls, as\
Ariffophanes reltities, laying, they kill\'92 an Hog to offer to Veaus.\
They likewife offered an Hog to the Goddels Majs, (by whem is\
meant the Earth, thus called; according to Gurnelias Labee; as figaity-\
ing Greatness) becaute this Creature makes preat Havock among the\
Corn and Grain, and is very prone to tear up the Ground; as Haerace\
Tays.\'97The Hog loves the Mad; for thefe Bealts were facrificed to\
the Gods, either on account of their Likenels and Agreement, or Dif\
fimilarity and Avertion. Wherefore the Poets mention, that the\
Hog was firft offer\'92 to Gores, for the great Mitchief it did to the\
Corn. Veranins fays, they allo offer\'92  Sow to Geres, after  Funeral,\
for purifying the Family.\
On making  Peace, Alliance, or Truce, they offerd an Heg: As\
Virgil attums, \'97He made the Peace during the killing of  Sow.\
Though Quintilian and Serviss, in their Remarks, fay, that Virgil\
meas an Hog; becaute in that Solemnity was always ufed an Hog or\
Rigll Suctemus, in the Life of Claudius Cafar reports, that he made\
an Alliance with the Princes, during the Offering of  Sow; tho' Titus\
Livins (peaks likewife of an Hog.\
The Mosaic Law enjoined the King or Princes to offer for their\
Sins ian He-goat; and thofe who had no publick Employments, \
She goat or Lamb. Haren was commanded to offer, for himself and\
Family,  Calf, as harmlels or righteous; and an He-goat for  Sin-\
offering. And we learn from Hesychins, Bihop of Terufalem, that the\
High prieft, after having offer\'92 an He-goat for  Burne offering, was\
allowed to go into the Haly of Holies, cloathed in  whire Linen coar,\
with  Girdle of the fame; and Breeches and Micre of fire twined\
Linen; as fignifying, that being reconciled to God, purified in Body\
and Soul, challe, fober, and righteous, fill\'92 with godly Underttanding,\
and the Gifts of the Holy Spirit, he might enter into that Place.\
The offering He goars and Sheep under the Law implies,  morti-\
lying; ind rooring fout all impurites and carnal Lulls, as Adamantins\
Explains. it, and to which Cyrif agrees; for Scripture, hieroglyphi\
cally, commonly rakes the He-goar for Men plung\'92' in Rinking, im-\
pure, and ill Manner of extravagant Defires; as alfo plainly appears\
by our Saioures Words, when, at the latt Judgment, he will let the\
Sheep orfElelt, with all Bleffings on his right Hand, and on the Left,\
thofe, who, by Rinking Sin, are unworthy of his Pity, for eternal\

 And after fuch  Manner the Goat was brought to -\
cone for Sins, when the Law commanded, that he should be prefented\
alive before the Alear, and the Priell, laying his Hands on the Head,\
should confess over him all the Iniquities of the People, and put them\
on the Head of this latcivious Creature, and then, by  fit Perfon,\
fend him away into the Wilderness. They add, for Confirmation,\
that the thick and rough Hair of this Beaff is laid upon him as \
Kinking Burthen of his Lafcivioulness\
The Fables of the Greek Poets tell us, that Hercules was the firtt\
who tamed the lafcivious He goat; meaning, that he overcame the\
Wanion Defires of the Flcth. He likewife firft offer\'92 this Beall to\
Tano; for, having vanquith\'92 Hlipperson, and thereby irritated the God.\
dets, he found no other Viltim at hand to appeafe her with; as Pan-\
Junias relates in his third Book. But the Lacedemonians facrificed to\
Di:x called the Coryrashan, in the Fields, Goats Fleth only, no other\
Realf being allowed in that Solemnity. Wherefore Kenophon, in his\
Memoirs, reports, that, when the Persions invelled Athens with \
mighty Force, incending to ruin it incirely, the Afbenians made  Vow\
to Dians, to offer to her as many Goats as they should defeat Ene-\
mies, in cafe they beat them.\
The Poets likewife mention, that the Goat was facrificed to Bac-\
chas; becaute he, being the God of Wine, could not be more accep\
rably honour\'92, than with the Death of  Creature to noxious to Vine-\
yards dedicated to him. Wherefore the Feltivals called Afrelis were\
allo celebrated in his Honour; when they laid on the Ground, at\
equal Diltances, Sacks or Bags of Goats Skins fill\'92 with Wind, which\
being fneared with Oyl or Greats, they merrily, to win the Prize,\
leap\'92 from one upon the other, tumbling, by Reafon of the Clib\
nets, over each other, to the no small Delight and Applaute of the\
People.\
The Romon Ladies, on being delivered with Twins, formerly of\
ferd to Tase (to whom Empires and Riches were facred) certain\
Sheep; which, according to Bebins Mecer, were tied between two Pair\
of Lambs on each Side. But the Sicyoniass Cultom was, to offer fat\
Sheep, by them called Exmesides, to the Gods of Benevolence and\
good Hope, for the good Luck and Profperity of their Families.\
They likewife facrificed to Hercales, as God of Riches and Plenty,  tied on four Sticks, inflead of  Bullock, who ran away, as\
they were leading him to the Allar; wherefore he is called Metins.\

We gather from the Greet and Roman Hiffories and Antiquities.\
that they facrificed Dogs, the former to Proferping, and the latter to\
Genetia. At the Feltivals called Lupercalis, facred to the Lycaan idol\
Pan, the Romans offer\'92 the fame; knowing that the conftant Nacure\
of Dogs is to purfue Wolves. Others think that this was done in Honour\
and Remembrance of Romulys, who, they faid, was, in his infancy.\
laid in  Wood, and brought up by  Wolf Some report, that\
Evender firft introduced and ektablished thofe Solemniries. The Peo-\
ple of Arges offer\'92 Dogs to the Goddess Cyoig; to whom they -\
scribed the Power of giving Women in Labour an happy Delivery.\
The Lacedemenions contecrated thofe Creatures to Mars for their Eager-\
nets and Alacrity in falling on Deer: For the young Men in their\
warlike Exercifes uled to begin them with facrilicing  litile Dog to\
Mars, as the Rrongell and moft valiant of the Gods, judging that\
Creature to be the moll acceptable of the came and fociable Ammals.\
The Augures,  Sort of Prielts among the Romans, allo often facriticed\
 Kind of red Dogs before the Towngate, called from thence Caruta-\
ria, or, Dogsgate, that the Heat of the Dog-days in Tuly and\
Augist might not bun or fpoil the Trees and Fruits of the\
Earth.\
The Inhabitants of Metbose annually offerd  Cock for the Prospe-\
rity of the Vineyards, and for averting the violent South eall Winds;\
for when this Wind rifes in the bloffoming Time of the Vines, its\
Malignity kills the young Shoots, and frullraces the Hope of  fucure\
Vintage: Wherefore the fugures of that Tract of Land found it\
Proper to order, that two young Men, cholen for that Purpofe, should,\
at  certain Place; take  white Cock, and each holding  Leg, above\
the Spur, by parting, pull him to pieces; and then, with the Piece\
of the Cock in their Hands, running round the Vineyards, one to the\
Right, the other to the Left, till, having as they thought made an\
Aconement, they met again at the Place where the Cock was forn to\
pieces, and there buried him. By blind Luck, it fomerimes fell out,\
that as long as they obferved the Solemnity, the iffue of Things an\
wered their Defire.\

The People of Cyrene ascribed great Honour in Husbandry to Ss.\
firn; faying he was the Inventor of Plancing, Grafting, Pruning, and\

The Egygtions offer\'92 annually, on the iggh Day of the firt\
Monch, Honey and Figs, in Honour of Afercury; celebrating this\
Feat with great Noife, and crying, Obl how sweet and agreeable is\
Trutt.\
The ancient Gaals worlhip\'92 Hercules as the God of Prudence, and,\
as Lariamus fays, Eloquence, even more than Afercury; becaute Elo\
grence is accounted more confummate in aged Wien (as Hercules is ge\
nerally reprefented) than in the Voung: Wherefore they offerd to\
him, as the Eggotians did to Afercury, Honey and Figs: Moreover,\
all who mmnister\'92 held  Figiree Branch in their Hands, and they,\
as well as the Prielts, had their Heads adorned with Poplar Leaves.\
Firgif likewife mentions, that Evander, offering to this God, had \
Chapiet of the fame Leaves about his Head, calling them Hferenks\
Lertes. And Macrobins fays, that the ancient Solemnities to Saturn\
and Hercules were performed bare headed; but in thofe to other Gods,\
the Priefts Heads were cover\'92.\
The ancient Romans offer\'92 to the Goddefs Carna, to whom they\
atcrib\'92 the Support of the animal Spirits in hamman Bodies, Bacon, and\
the Greens of Beans, whereby Men are made flrong and hearcy for\
Labour. And it is certain that thofe People called the firft Day of Tine\
Fabaria, or Bean' day, becaute that Oblation was inflituted by Junius\
Brarys, of whom this Month has alfo borrowed its Name.\
Felas Pompeins fays, that the Romans annually offer\'92 to Vulcan in\

prefented the Souls by Fithes: And, as Philo fays, becaute they con\

The Egyptians, affer\'92 to Ifs Loaves and Apples. And the ancient\
Sicilians, corns; and Flour to Ceres.. The heathenish Prielss offered\

count of their Purty. As Serapis is reputed by the REgyplians the\
God of Riches, or the Productions of the Earth, being the Inventor\
of Sowing and Tillage, he is therefore by them repretented with \
Bisket of Fruits of, the Earch on his Head. Fiven, hism Offerings,\
whether of Mear, Bread, Fruits, or Flowers, were camied in Baskets\
We fee, that the Ing is commonly facred to Offris, not only on ac\
count of his being Malter and Inventor of Wine, but allo of all Moif\
ture; wherefore he is called Occan, and Ips, Ibetis: For it was the\
Cullom to carry  Iug in the Proceltion of the Offerings, thereby to\
thew their Veneration for this God, keeping  large one in particular\
Elteem; to carry it cover\'92, with great Solemnity, to the Temple;\
where being arrived, they knceled down, and, with lified up Hands,\
thanked the God for his loving Kindness to Men; as believing that all\
Things were brought forth by Moiffure.\
in  certain Place in Greece they worhipp\'92 Myngrus God of the\
Flies: When the People effer\'92' to him, all the Flies recized from thole\
Parts. The Cyrencufes in Lybia allo honourd the God of Flies, called\
Acber, making Offerings to him for Hopping the Plague, which fome-\
times was occationed by the Multitude of thofe Infelts.\
Ancrently, they offered red Wine intlead of Blood. For Mlefes, in\
his Song in Lextersnomy, fayss. And theu didff drink the part Blood of\
the Graps. And David, in his Pfalms, \'97 Tbey have drank the Blood\
of the Grape. Indeed, the Egyprian Prielts, fome of whom were Kings,\
intirely abftained from Wine, but always uled it in their Offerings,;\
not as an Acceptablenels to Heaven, but to fignify the Blood and\
Punishment of thofe who rebell\'92 againff the Gods, and thereby: to\
obtain Favour and Reconciliation: For the Egyptians firmly believed,\
\
that Wine Sprang from the Blood of the difcomfted Giants, which,\
on their rifing againft the Gods, and threatening to fform Heaven, was\
pilt on the Earth, and therefore made Men commit all Manner of\

When the Egyptias Prielts, for the Sins of the People, put up\

It is likewile  general Cuftom of the principal and moft polite Na-\

Heredotss, to thew that the Heathens agree with the prefent Opi-\
nion touching the Signification of Cleanness, reftifies, that the Egypti-\
ans did not allow the wearing in their Temples any Cloaths made of\
Wool, but they had whice lnen Garments. Terrullian, (peaking of\
our Saviour, therefore lays, as be is dreft in the Garb of white Linen,\
it is the same with that of Ouris. And Plutarch, crearing of Ips and\
Ofris, takes this to be the Reafon why the Priells make ule only of\
whice linen Garments, to lignify, that all clean and undefiled Things\
beft agree with the Nature of the Gods, whole pure and facred Ma-\
jekly, according to Plate, ought not to be worhipped by Things im\
purc and filchy. And as Linen is the cleanelf Drels, and can be very\
eafily walhed and made beautiful, fo it was thought the moft becom:.\
ing the facerdotal Dignity and Purity. And indeed, the Magi, or\
Prielts of the ancient Persiuns faid, that God took Delight in white\
Garments: Which Affertion feems to be berrowed from Selomon, who,\
in his Exhortations to good and blamelets Manners, and  pure Con=\
Kience, lays, \'97Let your Garments be always white; as if he meant,\
- Take heed, in all your Actions, not to be defiled with Evil and\
Incleannels.\
The Prieftly Vellment called Poderis, from the Greet Word Podes,\
in Engliss, Feer, was of fine white Linen, fetting clole to the Body,\
and hanging down to the Feet: Ancient Divines fay, that thereby ther\
tignitied the most bely and myfterious Dectrine: This was the undermort\
Covering as we find in Exed. xxxix. And they made Coats of fine\
weav\'92 Linen, and their Garment called Hypodytes of Hyacinth Co-\
lour; intimating Heovenliness, and that Men ought to raife their\
Minds, Thoughts, and Faculties thither, forfaking what is earthly.\
The Priefts allo wore, under their Coats, Breeches of fine twined\
Linesd, covering their Priviries and Thighs; as an Admonition to dress.\
and appear in Challity. They were likewife enjoined by the offerto-\
rial Law to be girt with  Curdle embroidered with blx, purple,\
and fcarlet, hicroglyphically implying. Fortitude, Strength,. and\
Virtue.\

 Shoes of the Eoiptian Prielts were not made of other Matter\
than the Bark of Trees; to caurious were they in avoiding the leaff\
Appearance of Unchallity and Uncleanness. Accordingly, and\
with respect to Purity, it was  great Crime among. the Roman\
Prieffeffes, called Flumisicx, to wear Shoes of Skins of Bealts which\
died narural Deachs, fuperflitioutly behieving it to be abominable; but\
ther approved of luch as were made of offer\'92 Bealts Skins. Our Sa\
viour himself commanded his Dilciples not to wear Shoes; that, be\
ing with all speed to publith everlatting Life, they might intirely for-\
Lake what is corruptible. Moses allo, leaving the Egyprian Bondage,\
wore Shoes of Bealts Skins, intimaring his Affinity with Mortality;\
but afterwards, as he grew in Strength and Virtue, and was to ferve\
the Almightr, he was commanded to pull them off.\
The Egyption Priefts adorned their Heads with Hawk' Feathers;\
thinking to owe this Honour to that Bird, becaufe, as they fay, he\
formerly brought the Prielts of Thebes, in Eorpt,  Book written in\
red Lerters; containing the Manners of worshipping the Gods, and\
many of the principal Rires to be obferved in their Offerings; where.\
fore, the Lotn Poets, according to Martial, call thofe Prietts copped\

as the Micre, Bonnet, Ephod, and other Ornaments, fince they, and\
every Thing elfe relating to the Prieithood, are amply defcrib\'92 by\
Gserce in his Fewish Anuquities Wherefore, after having touched on\
the Hair of the Priefts, we shall only rrear of the ancient Roman\
 was formerly the greateft Scandal and Indignity foial Manto\
have his Hair cur off. And poffibly Alofes therefore commanded the\
Priefts not to have their Beards or Hair taken off with  Razor, but\
clipped with Sciffors, to diffinguith them from thote of the Egypti-\
ans. who, after the Deach of Apis, deitied and worthipped by them,\
had not only their Heads, but their whole Bodres shavedgi that in their\
Sacrifices they might be purc. Morcover, according to Bede, in his\
Church-hiffory, by thaving the Head is meant  renouncing fuperfiuous\
Riches (which Priefts, by their Inditution, are punctually to obferve)\
and that Hair is to he accounted but as  Superfiity of the Body.\

muft be content with fmall Provifion for fupporting their mortal Bo-\

of  Crown, denotes the Crown of Eternity, with which, after their\
Conflicts, they were to be rewarded\
But as for the Law commanding to cut the Hair round, and to\
have the Beard, many think it proceeded from the abominable Abute\
of the Heathens, who offer\'92 their own Hlair, and that of their Chil-\
dren, to the Devil.\
On the other hand, divers Councils decreed, that the Priefts, in Imi-\
tation of the Nazarites, should keep their Hlair and Beards, and let\
them grow; with Intention, that, by feeing and handling the fame,\
they might always remember their Ducies. Wherefore they did not\
have, but clip their Hair with Sciffors, that it might not over- grow.\

the Duries of the Priekhood, infficuted three Prielts called Fiamines;\
the firft, in honour to Tupiter Capitelinus; the second, to Mars; and\
the third, to Romulus Quirinus. Their Dress was much like that of\
the prefent Romiss Clergy in their Service. On their Heads they had\
 white Hat, with an Olive-(prig upon it, at the Excremity whereof\
appeard  Tuft of Wool, taken from  facrificed Sheep: This Hat\
Was called Albegalerus.\
Aferwards Numa ordained twelve other Priefts, called Sohi, in\
Honorr to Mars the Genquerer Pretefter, Avenger, and Peace-maker.\
Thefe were dreft in long loofe Garments or Coats, having  Breaft-\
Piece of Copper enrich\'92 with Gold, Silver, and divers precious\
Stones. The Solemnities growing numerous, and at length amourting\
to above  Nung increafed the Number of Priefts accordingly.\
He created the Feciales, and Pater Patratus, who proclaimed War;\
alto the Epulones, or Overfeers of all facred Banquets, and Augures,\
of Soothfayers, whole Authority was to great, that the Senate could\
not affemble without their Confent. They had all particular Garbs,\
except when they officiated, at which Time their Drets was alike,\
Deing  Garment of white Linnen, very wide, and reaching to their\
Heels, girt with  Girdle and Buckle about their Bodies. This Gar-\
ment they called Gabinus.\

and Hugolfgols.\'97 And in his sd Eneid we read, \'97 Father\
Aachiles timself gives the dejetted Touth Achemenides the right Hand,\
as  Tokin of his Sincerity to him. \'97 And in another Place, Amata\
favs to Latinas\'97 Where is your Sincerity? Where the former Care\

Frew Turnus? Virgil alfo calls Fidelity white and grey; meaning, ac\
cordng to Servis, that Sinceriry is moft found in old People, who\
are grey and whice Horace, complaining of the Wickedness of his\
own Times, fays, that Sincerity dreffed in White is little worlhipp\'92:\
Adding, that, in the Offerings to it, the High-prieff keeps not only\
the right Hand covered with the white Garment, but allo his Head\
and almoft his whole Body; to thew, that the Heart and Will ought\
to be pure and immaculate, and always to accompany Sincerity.\
Therefore Arigto alfo lays, Sincerity was formerly reprefented in\
 white Drets\
Perrents reports, that Aums himself, for  Badge of Prielhood,\
wore  small Linnen cap, like the Priefts and Soothlayers in their Ser\
vices; as did likewife the Wives and Maidfervants of the Reman\
Prielts, called Flamines.\
The Hat allo, among the ancient Romons, denoted the facerdotal\
Dignity; for the Fhinines took their Names from Pilens or Hat, as if\
they would fay, Pileanines Tho' others are of Opinion, their Name\
is derived from Fhimmenm, which, among them, was an Headorna-\
ment; for the Bilhop-like Caps, long Coats and Garments were, asl\
have faid, peculiar to the Priefls. The Authority and Credit of the\
illuftrious Fabins Pictor induce us to believe this, when he fays, that\
the Priefts, or Flamines, were not allowed to appear publickly with\
out the Har or Cap; but that in their Houles they were at their own\
Liberty.  Cultom to this Day sirictly obferved in many Places by\
the Romish Prelates.\
Infuls was  fine white Linnen Garment, with which the Priell and\
Villim were covered.\
Whee\

 or Plafonds.\
  the Vefal Virgins offered, they wele dreft in  long and wide\
Vellment of very fine whice Linnen, called Suffibulum. Their Heads\
were likewife wound with  whice Garment, and over it was  Vail of\
whice Linmen hanging down square, and coming over their Cheeks,\
and faltened under the Chin with  Clafp or Buckle; wherefore they\
were called Veftals, from the Word Veffis. The Romiss Women wear\
to this Day long Vails, pretending to imitate the virtuous ancient Ma-\
trons, who covered their Heads, Necks, and Breafts with them, and\
kept themfelves to chaffe and referved, as never to feparate from their\
Husbands, nor give the leaff Opportunity for Evil.\
Befides the before-mentioned Dreffes, the Priells had divers imple\
meats, and facred Velfels for Offerings, viz.\
Prefericulum,  Veffel of Brafs, wide on top, and without an Handle.\
Patina, or Patera,  Dith or Plater, wherein the Priells faved the\
Blood of the Victims.\
Aobana, another fmall Veffel, in the Form of  Cup, in which they\
faved the Droppings of the Wine at the Offerings.\
Aceira, was  lmall Box in which the Perfume was kept.\
Enclsbris, was the Table whereon lay the facred Things; whence\
th: Urentils, and other Materials for the Offerings, were called.\
Fchbria. On this Table they laid the Beall to be offered, cut\

pelling the Entrails, to wit, Hearr, Lungs, and Liver, in order to\
prognofticate future Events to the common and filly People. Pan.\

Secespita, to called,  fccande, from cutting, was  precty long Knife,\
having  round lvory Handle, tipp\'92 with Cold and Silver, and Hud\
ded with Copper. With this they cut the Villim\'92 Throat.\
Struppi, was  Bundle of Herbs, called Tirbens, mixed with Law-\

prefaged Happinets and Prosperity in their Offerings; they even ufed:\
them in their Purifications, tilling alfo and making Pillows thereof for\
their imagined Deities.\
Afpergillam, or Holy-water. Sprinkle, was made of Sprigs and\

Patterns and Models.\
CHAP. II. Of the Execution of Statuary.\
YT  TUAR  is an Imitation of Nature, performing it' Work\
by  firong Motion of the Body, and Dexteriry of the Hands. Ic\
\
contills in the Symmetry or exact Divifion of the Objects, according to\
their particular Qualities, especially in the human Figare (wherein it\
moll excels) and next, in Quadrupeds; all Relieved and conformable to\
the Life.\
ies other Performance concerns the Bassrelief, or half round\
Work, according to its different Qualities; as we shall hereafter ex-\
plain.\
The Materials for Statuary are of five Sorts, and each of  particu-\
her Narure and Quality.\
The firk is Clay.\
The second, Wax.\
Thethird, Wood.\
The fourth, Ivory.\
The fitth, Stone.\
The two firfl are worked with wooden Tools, and the reft with\
harp lrons, and each Material requires  particular Handling. From\
the firft, fomething is taken of; to the second, fomething is added; in\
the third, is cutting; in the fourth, scraping; and in the latt, driving\
or thrulting, according to the Nature of the Matter, either foff or\
hard, folid, dry, or briitle.\
In an human Figure or other Creature, Statuary firtt sketches its\
Thoughts on Paper, making choice of the moft beautiful Side; and then\
takes Clay, and fets thofe Conceptions upright, and as like the Delign as\
poltible. The Figure being now roughed out with the proper Tools, or\
rather with the Fingers, the Life is fet to the fame Pofture, in order\
 Statuary.\
 .\
to finith after it, and being brought to this Forwardacts, the Artifl pro-\
ceeds gradnally round, tillall sides are finithed and nothing is wanting.\
The Work, flanding in this Condition for some Time to dry, is after-\
wards baked in an Oven, and then may ferve as  Model for carving in\
Marbleor other Matter,\
The Efience of this Art lies in  beautiful Ferm, and  neat or diffintt\
Representation of the Things we would make, whether haman Figures,\
Bezts or other Objects; of which, the principal are Figures and Bass-\
relicts.\
The firff confiders Man, Woman and Child, of all Ages; as like.\
Wile Portraits or Bulls.\
 tecond respects the Horfe, Camel, Elephant, Lyon and other\
Bealls. And\
The laff regards the Peacock, Eagle, Raven, Oul and other fuch\
Creatures occurring in this Art; all requiring an exact Knowledge.\
seeing therefore that to many Thingsare necelfary to be underflood,\
 think it of the laff Contequence, that the Arciff, before he begin\
Sculpture, be well acquainted with the Groands of Drawing; and for\
Two Realons; Firft, in hopes of Honour and dvantage; and Second.\
, For Fear of Prejudice and Reproach. Thefe two Confiderations\
alwars artend the Marter, and one of them unavoidably depends on\
Ks Knowledge and Performance. For as the Work is of great Con\
tequence and Charge, as well in the Materialsas Tools, and flow Pro\
cets; to, if it fucceed well, it brings Reputation and Gain, otherwife,\
greater Loss and Blame.\
 true Artiff ought not to be without the following Works, viz.\
The Starnes of Perrier, the Lcenelogy of Cxlar Ripa, Oudaan' Roman\
Alght, and other Books of Aniquities; allo the principal Hiffories,\
but chiely, Les Characteres des Passions, by Montieur de la Chambre,\
and other Anshors on the fame Subject; together with thofe of Droses,\
and of Begts and other Anmmals. And for Practice, he ought to be\
furnished with Plsiper-figures, Bass-reliefs, Medals, Bufts, Hands and\
Feet, Lions and Lieneffes, Sphinxss, Terms, and many other Things,\
which are to be bought; as likewife, Models of Wax and Clay, and\
an Paper.\

 . AP. III.. Of Bassrehess.\
HAT  may proceed in an orderly Manner,  thall begin with\
Bass reliefr of which there are three Sorts, viz. almost Relief,\
half Relief, and faint, or fat: And the Difference of thefe ought to\
be well confider\'92, as they have three particular Inteations in their\
Proportions or Divifions.\
The frtt Sort; or almoff Relief, is commonly uted in deep Nicbes,\
with Figures in full Proportion; having three Grounds behind one an\
other; the foremolt Figures are almost Relief, the second balf Relief,\
and the third somewhat less.\
The fecond Sort, or balf Relief; is uted in shallew: squarl Niches,\
Frentifpieces, circulan-beaded Upper-doers, and Niches. This has two\
Grounds or Depths; the frlt is balf Relief, and the second Jomowbat\
Jainter.\
The third Sort is proper for Frizes, Pedestals, Balluffrades, and Me-\
dals. This has but ons Deptb, or  fingle Figure on one Ground.\
In their Ordonnance, four Things are to be obterved.\
 That the principal Figare of the Work have its full Relief, and\
thole of the leaft Contequence most faim, and Ricking to the\
Ground.\
 That the greateff Motion and Action of the Figures be always in\
prople, yet without any forethortening of the Members.\
 That ther Setting on of the projelting Parts appear natural, not\
\
forced.\
\
 That the Work be equally divided and diftributed every where\
alike, not too fall in one Part, and too empty in another; which is \
Point of great Importance.\
Altho\'92 thefe Bass-reliets feem chiefly to concern Statuaries, yet they\
as much affeet Painting, on account of the particular Relation the two\
Arts have to each other, in that one cannot be perfect without the\
other. The Statuary borrows from the Painter the Ordonnance or Dif\
polition for the Ground of his Work, which he afterwards puts in\
Praltice: The Painter, on the other hand, learns of the Statuary the\
Method of modelling, as neceffarily ferving for  Foundation in the\
Pexformance of Balsrelief. Wherefore,  think  Painter cannot pot\
No.  Stasuary.\
 \
fibly paint  good one, unless he underfland fomething of modelling;\
nor  good Statuary give Sacisfaltion, without having some Skill in\
Painting.\
 judicious Mafter ought to be exalt in ordering thefe Batsreliess,\
that exch receiving its preper Light, all may appear diffintt, and with-\
out the leaft Alteration. Sun-ine or parg Sbades make Things look\
otherwife than they really are, by the mishapen Ground hades which\
on thofe Occafions are feen in Nature; when the Work, being much\
raifed, has many deep Hollows.\
 large and aniverfal Light is moll advantageous for the firf Sorr,\
or almost Relief.\
 Light fontewbat mere fram the Side is most proper for the fecond,\
or balf Ketief; becaute it has but few Kilings, and the Work is there.\
fore more free from Ground (hades. And\
 direct Side-light is bett for the third or fainter Sort, as giving it\
great Deceram and Eleganct, tho' it be almoff without Shade.\
This Deltrine, touching the Light, may poffibly feem ftrange to some,\
viz that it ought to be governed by the Bass-reliefs or Piltures which\
are to fland or hang in it, according as they are more or lets relieved:\
But we muft conceive, that  proper Light ought to be chofen for each\
Sort of Bassrelief, from this Confideration; that the Light is not\
equally good exery where: Here, fairs  Batsrelief in  deep Niche;\
there, one less rifing, and here again, one that is quite flat; the one\
being thus lighted from  side, and the other fronting. Nevertheless,\
it must not be thought, that according to the Make of the Room, the\
Difpolition of the Windows, and the Places fix\'92 for  Niche on each\
Side of the Chimney, is in our Choice to have in one of thofe\
 Batsrelief of three Grounds, and in the other,, one of two Grounds,\
or one; becaute that which is neareft to the Windows receives  more\
froming Light than the other: Wherefore, they ought to be alike\
hollow and raifed By  proper Ligbt, we mean, that the Work\
mult be to order\'92, that each Part, according to its Light, get  good\
Decorum: For Inflance, in the formor Niche, where the Figures are\
much raifed, they cannot give fuch large Ground-fhades; fince the\
Light falls on them  little froncing, but may happen in the other,\
where the Light comes more from the Side; unless you placed the Fi\
gures which in one Niche are on the right Side, in the offer of the\
tek, thereby to, prevet the fuperfirous Shades, and eleganly recon\
cile the Difference of the Lights.\

:The Baterelicts in shallow Niches, with two Grounds,\
vice an Obtervation, and the fame Condubt is necelfary in Frizes, Pe-\
deflals; and Medals.\
Many err in placing Batsreliefs in Frizes of Chimseys, on Pedeltals\
and over Room-doors, even upon the Breaft-work of the Chimney it\
self, fetting there more than half relieved, nay, whole relieved Fi-\
gures; as  once law an almost Relief on  single Groand in  Chimncy-\
trize. In my Opinion, tis very improper to make Figures of nine\
Inches Leagth to very diftant from each other, and to litle draperied;\
Cfometimes  Figure has fcarce three or four Folds) the Work look-\
ins then (to (peak in painter like Terms) more like  fmooth Dead\
colouring, or rather old and wore out, than new made; and should\
by right be execured as faint and fine again.  have obferved, that\
Painters, in reprefenting Bals-reliels in luch Places, avoid all large\
Shades as much as poffible, especially in Frizes, Pedeltals, and other\
Flats; it being, in my Opinion, very proper that thofe Parts of the\
Archtecture keep their Flarness; and as all the Ornaments, viz. Capi-\
tals, Foliage, Modillions, Triglyphs, and the like, are in fuch Cafe\
commonly perform\'92 neat and curious, to our Figures ought likewife\
to be perfectly finithed.\
Some keep too much to the great Manner But the fmaller the\
Things are, especially withindeers and near the neater they muft be:\
Forwithout-deers the Cafe is different, becaute there they receive Light\
from all sides, and are less fet off, be they ever to much railed.\
Wherefore, Statuary joined to Architecture, in fuch Manner as it\
ought to be, is the Bufinets of  judicious Artifl, and for which so\
one is qualified without great Praltice.\
As this Study concerns  Painter as well as  Statuary,  shall shew\
the former in how many different Manners  Balsrelief may be paint-\
ed: And feeing the moft expedicious is always the beft,  shall lay\
down that which, by Experience,  have found to be beft.\
Firft,  paint my Cloth neat and even, with fuch  Colour as my\
Balsrelief requires, whether white, grey, red, yellow,  between\
Light and Shade, or in second Tint. Drawing my Ordonnance on\
this Ground,  correctly and Rrongly trace it over with black Lead\
and after rub it with  dry Cloth that it may Rick fall, and reliff the\
Varnith without muddling. Then  varnith it all over, and proceed\
to painting; firtt the Shade, and then the second Tint againtt it, leav-\
ing the Ground for the Light, and uniting the Shade wich the second\

 airily, without fofiaing them with  Fitch,  fcumble the\
second Tint, either with  Finger or fliff Peacil, into the Grount\
Then Itake another Tinr, as dark as my Model direlts; and with it\
give  Ground behind my Figures, leaving the Work on the light\
side without the leaft Rehef. Being to finith,  rub the whole Work,\
of as mich as  can do at once, with  lighter Iint than the firft Ground,\
and to very thin and even, that every Thing may appear through it;\
obferving here, that the Whice muft be very fiff, and thinned only\
with Turpentine. On this wer Ground  clapmy main Lights, which\
then, as well as the Shades, will gradually unite with it, without\
touching each other.\
The second and chird Sorts may be eafily finithed up at ence (the Re-\
ronching excepted) as having neither Ground-fhades nor Hollows; the\
Method is this My Cloth being prepared as aforefaid,  firft height.\
en, fcumbling the main Light into the wet Ground, which, by therun.\
ning of the  Oil, is become fomewhat tacky:  do the same\
with the Shade, leaving the Ground in this Condition for the second\
Tint.  the Work is to be very neat,  rub it over with  good Var.\
nith, mixed with some fat whire Oil, that ir may not dry to foon, and\
that  may with cafe, and as long as  pleafe, paint upon it, heighten\
ing on the most Relieved Parts, and giving dark Touches in the Hot\
lows, fcumbling allo here and there tome smale with  foft Firch, and\
tome Vellow in the Reflexions of the Shades. If the Back-ground\
ought to be  little darker, now is the Time for doing it, becaule then\
it will no more go in.\
The laff fortneeds no other Groundchan the firft; and it ought to\
be neat and even; becaute the Light on one side, and the Shade on the\
other, make the Work Relieve and Rife fufficienly: Vec. ler us ob\
ferre, that as often as we paint or re-touch, it muft be rubbed over with\
Varnith, or at leall where neceffary, to prevent its going in : For fuch\
is the Nature of Varnith, that it will bear but one Painting; otherwill\
the Work finks prefencly.\
We shall now thew what is to be obferved in Painting Figures in deeg\
Nicbes;  Work not to be performed, either with respelt to the Figures\
or Groundshades, without due Knowledge in Peripective, whatever\
Applaate Ignorants may get from thate who do not underfland\

His Blunder was great, who, painting  fine Figure, in  Niche, with\

Condult? Another fimple young Fellow, feeing his Malter paint \
orey Figure in  Niche, and being cold, that the Ground-hade was \
Watter of much Importahce, and ought allo to be correll, and being\
at the fame Time thewn the Model it was painted by, went immedi-\
ately and got  Niche made: But for Want of  Figure he borrowed\
his Mafters, and fet ir in the Niche, tracing therein the Ground hade\
with black Lead; agreeable to which, he gave all his Figures, in what\
Altion foever, the same Ground-shade.\
Now, it' certain, that Things painted on firm Places ought, that\
they may look natural, to have their proper Groundshades according to\
the Relief; well obferving, . Whence they receive their Light, front-\
ing or fidewife.  How farthey are from the Light, in order to de-\
termine their Shades; as one, fomewhat thort, Charp and frong, as be\

As Things painted on fmooth Objects, flanding in large and wide\
Places, can have no Relief or Projecture on the Sides, when feen front-\
ing; forifing and projecting Ornaments, fuch as raifed Figures, Lions\
heads, Feffoons and the like, are very improper and unnatural on them,\
unlets being fixed and immoveable, they were feen but from one Side; for\
then you may pant as flrong and Relieved Things upon them as you\
pleale, avoiding the Side going off, fince the (mooth Roundacls of the\
Figure does not admit it. The moveable Objects which are uled, and\
feen from all Sides, uft have  froncing Light, and be painted very\
Rat or faint, and with no rifing Swells; and the Ground, of what\
Colour foever tis, be laid in fuch Manner, that what is painted on it,\
whether Figure or other Object, be fet off by  dark Tint in irs Our-\

Country ought to be fomewhat acquainted with Painting, as being\
obliged to make  Virtue of Neceffity.  knew one, who, for this\

of Marble. Iescertain, they cannot always carry fuch heavy Baggage\
along with them;  speak with respect to thole, who hang their Houles,\
Galleries, Halls or Apartments with Cloths, and caute them to be\
pairied with Statues and Bals-reliefs, which at any Time, in Cale of\
Remoral, Fire or other Accidents, they may roll up, and hang in other\
Rooms, which otherwife they could not do; at leaft tis better than to\

 HI NK an Artiff ought never to be at  Loss for Matter in\

wife from Scripture.\
 have formerly, in the Book of Ordennance, propoted the Story of\
Tadab and Thamar; which, according to Bats relief Management, is,\
with little Alseration, (as well as many others) very proper for it,\

Chap.  that Story require, not fo mach Depth: And how fine would fuch\
 Bals-relief become the Hall either of  Jow or Chriffian? And if\
herein, the servant and the Country-boufe were on  particular Ground,\
how plainly would the Matter appear, if naturally expreft? For tho'\
many imagine, that  Bafs-relief is in the fame Cafe with  Medal,\
which tends only to commemorate this or that Occurrence, of remark-\
able Story, . muft intirely deny it, fince, in my Opinion, the chief\
Intention of the former is, in an inftructive Manner, to ferve for adorn-\
ing  Building; and the plainer, more artful and incelligible, the better\
it is, especially when the Choice of Subject is our own, and we can go\
to the Expence of it. Vet painted Bass-reliefs, ought, as well as, \
good Picture, to have their Property; as the Ancients (who brought\
this Art to such Perfeltion) have fufficiently fhewn in their fine Re-\
mains, which are our beft Models.\
 agree with others, that, without an exall Obfervation and Inquis\
 into Antiquity, and the Comments thereon, which some ingenious\
Men have left us, we should be almoff Strangers to the hieroglyphic\
Seuie of the antique Bals-relicts; for many of them are to foreign and\
dark that we can fcarce apprehend what the Ancients would fignity by\
them.\
We shall therefore make fome Remarks on the long and imall, yet\
Ane Bass-relief of Meleager, killd by his Mother, wben sbe burnt the\
fatal Wood. Ies certain, that this Story is faintly reprefented; but,\
in my Opinion, the Mafter has omitted the Buftle and violent Stir of\
Meleager'\'92 Body, in order to preferve the Elegance of the Action. \
find it allo not flrange, that few can underfland this Story without\
tome Writing under it. We there fee the Parce, of three fatal Sifters,\
but nothing of the Mother; and tho' we luppose Diass to be prefent\
yet that Circumffance does not fully clear the\
and mourning,\
Meaning. Meleager should rather have had his hunting Equipage\
ard Dogs by him, in order to point our his Perfon and Inclina-\
Rons. nd tho' the burning of the Wood feem, in some meafure, to\
express the Matter, yet  think it too nearly cut and fmooth, and\
should be more like  Firebrand. But my greatelt Wonder is, at the\
Abfence of the Mother Althes, the who was  principal Perfon, .\
great Princess, and alted this Tragedy orr of Revenge, and feeing tis\
one of the greateft Effects of  revengeful Temper, to triumph in the\
Prefence of thofe who are overcome. Moreover we fee no aclive Paffi-\
ons rule in any Part of the Compofition. Nor can  fay, who the\
Woman litting by him is, whether his Mother; Diana; Halania; or\
Wha\

 elfe:  cannot believe the is his Mother, becalift he feems to be as\
oll as the. Moreover, we do not perceive in him any Motion of \
Perton in Paih. Nor can  apprehend the Defign of the Face on the\
round Board below on the Ground, it not being  Medal for Orna-\
ment, tho' doubtless placed there by the Artift for some Reafon: Some\
think, it reprefents Rage or Trouble, or elfe Fite;, becaufe the Hair\
teems to be flaming. But the Matter might have beef berter expret\
by  prefting of the Eyes, fruggling of Arms and Legs, Contraction\
of the Nofe, Mouth, Fingers, and Toes and the Trouble and Pain of\
the dying Perfon; whereas, here we fee nothing like it; but contrari.\
ly, he feems to dic very quictly, as his Arms, lying clofe to his Be.\
dy at full Length fufficiently thew. Befides, tis againft the Rule of\
Emblems to admit of any Aid, where the Fall can be performed by\
the Perfon himself, much less the Addition of two or three Figures to\
exprets the Meaning, unless they be Statues; fuch as Tyranny with\
Nere, Ambition with Alexander, Valour with Scipie, and to forth.\
Irs true, that Painters ufed formerly, before they were acquainted\
with expreiting the Pattions in the Face and Geftures, to write them\
on Scrolls proceeding from the Figures Mouths, that they might\
thereby be underfiood; but as Artifts are now more enlightened, it\
would certainly be very improper to fet  Cock or Spar by  Mansit-\
ting or standing, in order to thew his Iuduftry, or  Scall by another,\
to fignify that he is dead, &.\
By thefe Obfervations is apparent, that our Meleager should rather\
have been known by  fine Action and Motion; fince the chief End\
of  Reprefentation is to express naturally, and with Energy, the Ni-\
ture of the Matter; and this may as well be done in Biss-relief as\
Painting if the Story require it. Nevertheless we muft obferve, that\
there are some Paftions which do not work externalty, and ought to be\
exprefted by Addrions, in order to make them intelligible; fuch may\
be Charny, Mercy, Fiety, Liberality, and the like: But Anger,\
Madness, or Rage, Pain, Smarl, &. (which diffurb the Body as well\
as the Mind, by irritating the Members) do not require emblematic\
Figures of additional Explanations.\

  ny anicen na in ee in \
   . . Of the Draperies of Staises and Bassreliess.\
MONG the Greek Statues we find none, but what seem to be dreft\
AA in one Sort of Stuff; and thefe are the Models for  good Sta-\
tuary or Painter to govern himself by. Bur  Portrait, which is like\
\
wife an ornamental image, mull never be like  Statue, or Stone Fi-\
sure, tho' white, and painted with  fingle Colour; even were Ovid.\
with his Train of Metamorghofes prefent. No fine Dilpolition of Folds\
is here of any Advantage: If the Scuffs be not like thofe of the\
Greeks, they are not proper for Stone, and feem lets congruous with\
Antiquity.\
Let is therefore not flatter ourfelves, that we can make any Im-\
provements, by feeking new Stuffs for our Figures; nor rely too much\
on the Dexterity of our Hlands, that, how brittle foever the Stones are;\
we can work them, and perform any Thing, even Folds as thim\
 Paper, small lying Draperies, loofe Hair-locks hanging on  Csc. But rather imitate the Greeks, in the Tbinness, Pliable-\
ness, and Leofeness of their Draperies, that the beautiful Sway of the\
moving Parts be not obttrutted, but plainly perceived under them; un\
less in the Cafe of Old People, who, hecaule of their Stiffnets, may be\
drelt in cearse Cloth; and yet not as feeming to be  meer Dress\
without  Body, but futing close to it, to as to difcover the princi-\
put Parts, with the Ends hanging loofely down, not flicking\
Out.\
Flying Draperies have no Place among Starues, or Bass-reliefs: nd\
tho' the latter reprefent Hiftories, yet fuch Draperies are not proper\
in them, unlels on the second or third Grounds; where, then, they\
may be fixed againtt the Ground, and be no Hindrance.\
in  Medal hrile Relieved, or on Urns or Vases, where flying and\
running Figures can be reprefented in all Sorts of Hiflories, we may\
freely make as many of thofe Draperies as we pleafe; becaute, as we\
said in the third Chapter, the principal Motion ought always to be in\
Profife, either on  fingle or second Ground.\
 willingly allow the Greets to be the Inventors of loofe Draperice,\
as being the moft ealy; but that therefore we may not, now Statuary\
is arrived at fuch Perfection, make ule of all Sorls of Stults (which is\
 Thing pollible) feems to me very Rrange: For it is certain, that all\
No.  Statuary.\
 .\
Things, thro' long Praltice, improve, and we daily difcover and fee\
what was formerly unknown. Befides, there are few Laws which afe\
not capable of Amendment or Enlargement; and tho', as the Proverb\
lays, \'97Old People are seldom better\'92 by Tounger, yet it happens in\
some Things, especially in this Art.  speak here of Laws only by\
Way of Comparifon. Pray obferve, how little the famous Bernini ar\
Rome has ried himself up to the Greek Antiquities. By the Force of\
his Judgment he has turpaffed them; he has gone fuch Lengths, that\
it was indifferent what he met with, whether flying, running, lying,\
flanding, naked, or dreff Figures: He did every Thing, not like the\
Greets in  Scone -like Manner, but with Draperies fying, rufting,\
\
snd ja.nging, as if they were ahive People; and those not twifed like\
\
\
\
\
G . .. Fexitiful and broad Folds, sametimes loofe, at orvers, for,\
Toict, or rein, tenderly and agreeably work\'92 as Art requires. Bu,\
\
uzar am  aying: We need not go abroud for Examples: Whatfire\
\
Drapenes has not the famous Statuary Keyser made? Iis certain, be\
ad nor meerly follow the Anlique; thinking it below his Charalter co\
\
weat the common Rond: He fought the plas Offrg, in order to go\
Levord.\
Adl to thefe the great Mafter Francifco Quenoy, whom  do not\
hame as ditcommending others, by pafting them by in Silence, but as\
an excellent Partern for thewing us  Way void of Error and Reproof:\
For, by faving, that Bernins perform\'92 what the Greeks never did, \
mean, that he drelt his Figures in thick and thin Stufts, in order to\
gire them, as it feems, more Motion; the Draperies fivinging, fiying,\
and ruifling, according to the Liberry allowed to any Mafter, who car\
perform it.\
It may poffibly feem to fome, that  am trampling Antique Clay\
under Foor; but  declare,  have no fuch Incention: Tho'  know\
that if some Perfons had the Option, either to be  Praxiteles, or Phi\
dias, or  Durch Keyser, or Roman Bernini, they would chule to \
the latt; and for this Reafon, that rt has, in thefe later Ages, me\
with Improvements unknown to Anciquity. But after all,  muft fy\
in Reference to the Judgment  have made, that tho' it be in our Chen\
to represent any Stuff we can perform, yet as long as we find none ml\
Feautifal, profer, or fine than these which the Greeks have left us \
Examples,  think we ought to follow them. As to what is figing\
fwinging, blowing, or rufffing (which is very improper in Statues,\
ye have faid)  shall leave that Point to Bermn, and not follow eith\
Ke Statuary:\
  or Queffis: But ware  to do that flonour to any Perfon, it\
\
hould be to Francifce Quendy.\
But let me not, by any Micans, perfuade Artifts to imitate the parti-\
cular Manhner of this or that Mafter; for every one has the Liberty of\
chuling for himself, and  preferve mine. What  have advanced is\
only  Wher for the judicious, by making further Enquiries.\
Tis  great Fault in Artifts to fix they Thoughts on  pnole Part\
of  Figure, fuch as an elegant Neck, handfom Shoulder, Back finely\
mutcled, or beautiful Thigh; which they work out with the greateff\
Application and Pleafure, in order to give it  Sofiness; and it that\
fucceed well, they are perfectly charm\'92 with it; infomuch, that we\
may often perceive, in what Part their greateft Delight lay: Hence,\
it frequently happens, that the Parts of the same Figure are very un-\
like in Goodness; and the Hlands and Feet, nay, fometimes the Face,\
bungled, for the fake of  well-finith\'92 Back. It muft be granted, that\
the principal Parts are of the moft importance; yet we are not igno-\
rant, how much the Leffer can either fet off or deform  beautiful Fi-\
What is  fine Naked with poor Hands and clumfy Feec?\
Purc.\
WWhy was Van Dyt fo famous for his Portraits, but for having as\
much Regard to an Hand as  Facel To an expert Workman it is indif-\
ferent, whether he cut  Block of Marble, or make  Model in\
Clay; fave that the former requires more Time.\
But after all, this Choice of Handling and Neatness is of no Mo-\
ment, if the Figure be not weft for or deligned, becaute the greateff\
Perfection lies in  Conjunction of both. Wherefore, it is certain, that\
if Phidias and Praireles had been Mafters of Berninis Handling and\
Elegance, and this laft, the Knowledge of the Greefs, all three would\
have deferved the greater Prailc.\
Ias readily own as  take it for granted, that. Art owes its Defelts\
to Arcifis themfelves; as well in Painting and Staruary, as Archirec=\
tere; proceeding not only from Mafters keeping their Pupils ignorant\
of their Principles, Experiments, and Secrets, but allo from obtirult-\
ing their Advances in the Art: For tho' it were Weakness to think\
the Ancients did not underfland it, yet the Decay mult, as  imagings\
be principally imputed to the Reafon  have given: From whengg\
arofe another Milchief, to wit, an indifference in Pupils: for fur-\
ther improvements, especially in Statuary. Accordingly, none will\
at this Time, feek the old Pach of his Predeceliors; Tis now over=\
grown, and become fo uncertain, as hardly-to be found; every Man\
mas blind fold over the fleath,, without krowing whither\
\
\

Book \
 obferve, that the Greeks have commonly made more naked Fj.\
gures than the Remans: Which  can afcribe to no other Caufe, than\
 Choice of Objects agreeable to their Inclinations, and  Defire to\
difplay their Skill in the Composition and Symmetry of the Parts of\
an Human Body. In their Statues, they rather chole to reprefent Dei-\
fies than Men, and in their Balsrelicfs, rather Bacchanals and Sacrj.\
fices, than Hiffories. The Romans, on the other Hland, defirous, by\
their Statues and Batsreliefs, to tranfinit the Memories of their Em.\
perors to Pofteriry, found themfelves obliged, that they might not go\
againft Hiffory, to dress their Figures in the Mode of the Times.\
We shall now confider the neceffary Obtervations in printing Statues\
and Batsreliefs It is certain, that they muft be very neat and white,\
becaufe fuch Works, in Stone, being both hazardous, troublefome, and\
cofflr, were never undertaken before the Artifts had cholen fine Blocks\
of Marble for that Purpofe. Wherefore, we ought to take Notice of\
the Stones, and their Kinds.\
Light Marble is various; one Sort intirely ssbite; another, shipp; \
thid, fet-olour &cc. being thus either in Nature, or chang\'92 thro'\
Time. They are all good when free from Spots of Eyes, and appear\
well agrinft proper Grounds.\
For this Reafon we fee, that the Ancients reprefented the beff and\
moff remarkable Hiffories either in Copper or white Marble; as many\
Remains on Palaces, Temples, Henorary Arches, Columns, Pyra-\
mids, Tombs, Coc. can witness. Single Whire has alo this Advan\
tage above the colour\'92 Paintings, that it does not foon change, and\
when it fades, as Marble itfelf is not free from it, it is all of  Co.\
lour. The Ufe of it is certainly attended with much less Trouble,\
and not lets natural than in Colours: Moreover, we may fooner find\
ten Mafters for this Sort of Painting, than three for Colours; becaute\
it is but  fingle Part of the rt, and remains always the fame,\
and without Alterarion; whereas the Cafe of Colours is quite dif\
Terent.\
The grey Paintings reprefent only  Wall, or Piece of Stone -work,\
but the colour\'92 ones thew the Life irfelf, feen as thro'  Window:\
Wherefore the grey can neither recreate nor ferve for particular Pictures\
of Delight; nor can be of further Ufe than in the Places where they\
are fet for Ornament, of which they make but  small Part; and\
were any Thing elfe to be placed there, it would be bur of the Na-\
 even in\
fare of the Stone, and not pleafe like  colour\'92 Picture..\
the fame Cafe with  Field in Summer and Winter. The North\
Wind\

Chap.  deadens and greys it, and the Summer revives and makes\
it look green again, feeding the very Soul with its Variety of\
Flowers.\
The white Marble has  particular Colour and Tendernets; as may\
be perceived in the Nixture of Colours: Wherefore, it is of great\
Moment to fait it well to its ground.\
Between grey Stone if ought only to be temper\'92 with whice and black,\
and fofined with light or yellow Oker; but between reddith or Por-\
phiry Stone, with  little Vermillion or Indian Red, fomewhar upon\
the Fleth-colour, and this in Shade as well as in the fecond Tint. If\
you learn this Colour from the Life, your Work will have the imoff\
Agreeableneis.\
\
   . VI. Of the Attirudes of Statnes.\
ESIDES the Draperies of Statues, fomething is to be obferved\
touching their Sways and Poftures; which is  Point of the\
greateff Contequence: Wherefore we shall, in the firll Place, thew\
what Statues are; next, whether they will admit of any other Vari-\
ety than what the Greets have affigned; in the third Place, whether.\
thofe, which fince their Times have been in Ufe, are reckon\'92 as good;\
and latile, whether it be not more advifable to follow the Anrique\
and good ones, than to feek after new and lets good.\
Amidll the infinity of Motions incident to Nature in general, it is\
obferred, that every Man has one particular to himfelf, and peculiar\
to his Temper, one bultling, another flow, and  third between both:\
And this Diltinction cannot but be obvious, even to  Man of fmall\
Underflanding, fince from thence, and  Propenlity for Company like\
ourfelves, proceed either our Love or Avertion for this or that Per-\
fon and their Actions. And if this be granted, we may be affured,\
that the ancient Mafters (efpecially the Greeks, who were to famous\
for Wifdom) nicely obferved all thofe Motions, as well the internal\
as external,, and expreffed them: in their feveral Works. Wherefore\
it may then perhaps be inferr\'92; that nothing in this Particular remains\
for the improvements of Afterages: But let me ask, Why we should\
not as well make ple of our bilicies and Judgments in order to go\
forward?  think we may, in other Things especially; but pafting by\
What\
\
\
Of Staluary.\
Book .\
 is already done, we shall proceed to inquire, what  Statue means\
and fignifies.\
 Statke reprefents an Idol in human Shape: An Idol  fay with\
Iespect to irs Origin and Ufe, and (as far as Statuary is concerned) form\
il after the beit Proportion, either in Gold, Silver, or other Mecal,\
and dexteroutly work\'92 by the Hand and Judgment of the Arcill. The\
Efes of thefe are, to be let in Temples, Courts, Palaces and other pub-\
lick Places, but especially to adorn Archirecture. We find them  in Scipture as Fables: For Inftance, in Afordecar, when royally\
arrived he was led, on Horfehack, by Haman thro' the City. Allo\
in Cor:,, when expated, by Pilare, to publick View.\
We likewile And Matter for Starues in profane, even recent Stories:\
\
As for lnmance, in the late King Witham and Qucen Hlary, of bleffed\
Memory, moulded from the Lite, and fee up in the Temple of Henour,\
and tuch like. None of thefe Pieces thew either active, paffionate, or\
violent Motiors, but plain or grave, and majettic, fuitable to the Dig-\
nies of the Perfonases they reprefent, and which we ought to conti-\
der as Genrlemen or Ladies, who, flanding at Doors or Windows to\
fee, and be feen by the People, are ferious and without Motion.\
Whence the Proverb feems to arife, \'97 He slands like  Stone-figine,\
 or, like  dumb and lifelets Perfon.\
Cr Ele:.\
We shall therefore confider two Sores of Starues, the anactive and the\
nring. The unafive are fuch as fland fingly in Riches and on Frommif\
ores, and the moring or bulling are thofe which are feen in Groups\
of =or  on FedzEnls, triwnftal Arcpes, and Fountains.\
Now, its certain, that thefe two Sorts of Statues mult needs hare\
Particular Purpoles, and therefore particular Places: For the former\
are teen from  single Stand, for which they are properly made, and\
the latter are to be viewed round about from all Sides. But of this we\
shall tay more in the next Chapter.\
As to this larter Sort of Starues, they receive not their Appellati-\
ons from the Perions they reprefent, but from the Aftions they per-\
formed, or to: Ahsartunes they unferwent And herein lies the\
main Point, tince, without them; the Persons fingly of themfelves\
would not be known; as in the Steries of Seneca, Petus, Laocoon, Py\
rimas and others. And thefe Occurrences or Accidents mult be but once,\
art en one Occation attribured to them. Suppole any of thefe Perfons\
were to be reprefented by  fingle Statue, as Lyocoon with  Serpent,\
Bruwas with  Sword,  What Difference would there be between\

Of Statuary.\
Chap.  who once committed fuch an Alt, or bore fuch  Calamity, and\
one who in his Life-time, had gone thro'  thouland Accidents, as Her-\
cules, Tbefeus, Achilles, Hecter and many others, who are reprefent\
ed by one Statue! Wherefore we may eafily conceive, that the Anci-\
ents have in every Respect to firmly fixed and orderly dipoted their\
Poltures, that there is no room left either for Alteration or Addition.\
Befides, we fee, that no Addicions of the modern Maffers are like the\
Antique, either in Qualicy or Goodness, as is evident in the Works of\
Quellin, Keyzer, Bernini, and many others, who made no Dillinction\
between Statues and Starues.\
if  seem here to contradict myself, becaufe, having in the preceding\
Chapter fet thole three great Mafters almoll above Antiquity,  now\
place them below it, let it be obferved, that  am speaking of Statues,\
not of Bass reliefs; for herein they have neither excell\'92 nor been equal\
to Antiquity in the Beauty, Air, and Variety of Draperies.\
The Ancrents, in their Statues, had in View three principal Conditi-\
ons and Natures of Men; the gay, the beavy, and the moderate: The\
 are altive, full of Fire, and flender like the Apotto; the second are\
melancholy, flow and liftlets, like the Antinous; and the third Sort is\
compoted of  Temper between both, as the Mfercurius radians, which\
receives its Light from below. All thefe were ercht by Perrier. We\
alfo commonly obterve, that the active and airy are feldom long with-\
out Motion, now flanding on one Leg, then, on the other: Accord-\
ingly, the Ancients reprefented fuch  Perfon flanding on one Leg.\
relling little or nothing on the other Foot: But, being to exhibit an in-\
dolent, voluptuous, melancholy one, like Antinous, we may plainly\
dilcover, how heavily he flands on one Leg, and yet reils on the other\
Foot, his Belly sticking out, Head hanging down, and Hips exceffively\
riting. The Contrarieties of thefe two Figures are worthy of Remark;\
one leems to fly, and the other to be finking into the Earth. As to\
the Exprestion of the third Figure, (which is  Mean between the two\
Sorts aforelaid) he, as  well-temperd perfon, is made flanding firm\
on his Legs, looking thoughtfully down, without any Turn, not too\
Hery or eaty, nor too much funk; one Hip fwelling  little more thin\
that of Apollo, and fomewhat lets than that of Antinous, and tho' reft-\
ing on one Leg, yet appearing more firm than the one, and more airy\
than the other.\
Now, as the Ancients Knew how to divide thofe three different Bo-\
dies to very nicely, according to their Nacures and Action, to we need\
not question but they handled all treir other Figures in the lame Maa-\
HIcr.\
\
\

Of Statuary.\
  fpeak, in reference to their Qualities, as  Kill-flanding Baccbus,\
Mers, Hereales, Satarn, &. Even the Women, Goddeffes, and Nymphs\
not excepted; all which proceed, either in  greater or lets Degree,\
from the three Standards before mentioned: This Truth is evident not\
only from thefe Examples, but likewife from what we daily meet\
with, whether in Models or Prints. Ler us then not imagine, that we\
are able to inveat new Actions for our Statues, or others than thote\
which are already found, much less, that they should be better and\
more proper; but rather employ our Thoughts more advantageoutly\
on other things, and in the mean Time implicitly follow the Ancients\
in  Study to noble, and in which they took to much Pains.\
The main Point lies in the beautiful Sway of  Statue, well\
expred according to the Quality, Condition, Nature and Intention of\
it. But hereby  mean not, that we are obliged punctually to imitate\
the Actions and Poftures of the Ancients, without the leaff Deviation;\
contrarily, every Man has the Liberty of exercifing his Ingenuity:  their Works only as Patterns which  have always followed,\
and would have others do the fame, without Fear of being therefore\
call\'92 Copyilts, or their Works, Copies. Such  Moderation  think\
even very commendable, fince the Fable of Learas teaches us, that\
High fyers have often great Falls; or, by avoiding Scylls, they get\
into Chargbdis.\
There Hill remains  neceffary Remark, touching the Explanatory\
Addituments of Statues; and, to be brief,  shall thew their Natures in\
three particular Starues, and chufe out of many, the Stories and Fi\
gures of Lxcretis, Dido, and Thisbe, among the Women. Thole of\
the Men may, on the fame Foor, be eafily apprehended.\

 Ravither' Head thereon, is flanding or lying at her Feet, and of\
her right Side lies  Dog to point out her faithful Love. On the Pe\

ship, to Statuary embellifhes, and makes Archirecture look grand. AA\
good Landskip-painter knows what Objelts are moft proper for an Ordon-\
nance, and what Forms they mult have, whether crooked, ftrait, sland\
ing, fitting, to the left or right, in order to produce Decorum, as we\
have hewed in the Chapter touching irregular Objects: And  skilful.\
Architelt ought to be as well acquainted with the Mechod of fetting\
off his Work with Figures, Balsreliefs and other Ornaments, according\
to Rule, that it may thereby become not only magnificent and elegant.\
but we may plainly perceive, it muft be so and not otherwife. He should\
allo know, why tome Figures ought to face, and others look from each\
other; why thefe mult fwell or rife outwardly, thole be upright or sit-\
ting, &.\
Upon this Account, the Statuary ought rightly to underfland the\
Architelt' Intention, Tere he proceed to work; as alto what Figures he\
is to make naked or cloathed, be they of Men, Women or Children,\
on what Side they ought to rife or fwell, and how bent; and from\
What Side feen, and whether they mult fland high or low, and to forth:\
being apprized of thefe Particulars, he is then to execuce his Thoughts\
 finding, according to thofe Sways, fine Actions, graceful Motions\
No.  Statuary.\
 .\
and eiegant Draperies, from whence may arife  general Decorum.\
Thus much, as to theie two ative Siffers.\
in relation to the third, to wit, Painting, which embraces them\
Foth, as needing their Aid,  mull fay, that as it makes the Elegan-\
cies of Archredure and Staruary, whether in Hiffory or Landskip,\
its chief Study, to  judicious Painterought, for adorning his Archi\
\
redure with Figures, Batsreliefs, Gc. to be thoroughly acquainted\
with them, that he may naturally exprets them with Shade and Colour;\
even; to much as thereby to corred the inevitable Mif thapes fill to be\
observed in Nature.\
Tis unaccountable, that, among to many good Architelts, Starua.\
ries, and Painters, fo few have underfood the richt placing of Statues:\
They tometimes hir it, but not upon certain Principles. Wherefore\
we shall enleavour to clear the Pomt in few Words and three Skeich.\
es; hoping tiat no Offence will be taken at my adapting the Matter\
allo to Painring, fince is has fo near  Concern therein.\
As there is nothing in Nature without imperfection, fo, in the Ufe\
of Things, we ought to proceed with Judgment, in order to chule the\
beff for the Satustaction of our own Eyes, as well as thofe of the\
Knowirg and Lovers.\
in the placing of Starues in Architecture, the same Regard muft be\
had wherever they fand or fr.  speak not of Painting, alone, but\
what generally concerns both the Arrs; Statuary in the firft place,\
and afterwards Painting. See Plates  XV. and LXVI.\
Behold the Skerch in Plate LXV. with Accention, and my orderly\
Difpoficion of the Starues in different Places; fufficiently to evidence\
the Regularity of my Scheme to any one who has  mind to try the\
COntyary.\
Here, you are only to obferve the Our lines of Couples or Pairs of\
Figures, and their Posfures againf each orher ; for  fingle Figure ads\
for irfelf, but  pair or couple of Figures thews the Refult of both.\
 have formerly afferred, what conflitutes  beautiful Action,\
sawely,  geod Tarn of the Members and Motion of the Head, Armm,\
Hands and Feet.\
The  Example chiefly concerns Statuaries, who, hy obferving thaif\
Pofition, will thew that they underfland it, and are able to order and\
make large Things as well as fmall.\
The  Example respects Painters, tha' it be the same as the ford\
mer, in reference to the Our line; but with respeet to Sbade, wheat\
\
\
\
Of Statuary.\
Chap.  are confined to  fingle and fixed Light, we ought to chule  proper\
and advantageous one, that the Out-ne, as our principal Purpofe,\
may thereby maintain its Force, and produce the Effeet and Decorum we\
defire; as you fee here with its oppofite.\
We have formerly faid, that the Out-line without the Shale is of no\
Effeft; and that  beautiful Action and Out-line may lofe their Ferce, and\
the Gracefulness be spoilt by an improper Light; which Mis- pape is very\
vifible in sharp and broad Lights, and mere difagreeable than in stirring\
Figures.\
The gd Example concerns thofe who paint Figures, Balsreliefs,\
and other Ornaments, either in whice, red, yellow or ofher colour\'92\
Marble, or Stone. Here, obferve not only the Outline, as in the\
firft Example, or the fame paded, as in the second, but likewife the\
Colour of the Stone, as well in the Shade as Light:  tay, especially in\
the Sbade, becaute therein appears the greateff Variety, either by means\
of the Air, or fome other Reffexions.\
Another of our Politions has been, that all Objects retain their naty-\
ral Beauty in the Shade, unless they receive Reffexions from other Things;\
bkewife that White is the most susceptible of it, and, by its Cleanness, easly\
receives whatever Colour it meets with. Confider allo, the great Diffc-\
rence between the Clofenels and Solidity of Marble, and the Thinnels\
and Tranfparency of Linnen. In the third Example you will find that\
white Marble, not without Reafon, produces yellow or ruffet Shades;\
wherefore you ought carefully to confult Nature, in order to imitate her\
with Knowledge.\
But to return to the firft Example, let us abferve how two opposing\
Figures appear in their Out line. Firft, upon the Frontispiece, where\
thele two Figures swell outwardly, the Faces either regarding or turning\
from each other, and the Arms the same; and the middlemoll prast,\
without swell, and frenting; and thote on the outtides allo with licle,\
of ne Turn, as being feen only forward: Secondly, the two Figures on\
each Side of the Steps likewile swell outwardly, yet mere turning than the\
others, becaute being allo feen lidewife, they ought to be beautifut from\
three Sides: Thirdly, the foremoft Figure may have as much Turn and\
Attion as you please, and be good quite round: Fourchly, tne Figures\
in the Niches are frenting, without the leaft Turn or Stir, and the great-\
off Swell is forwards. lus allo very proper for the Rien to sand below,\
and the Women above; becaute the Woman tapers upwards, and there-\
fore is more dilappearing and usiting with the fir; which, in Archi=\
fecture\
 Statuary.\
 .\
relture has  fine Effelt. For this Reafon they formerly offentimes fet\
mall Pyramids on the Tops of Houfes, inflead of Figures.\
The uppermsl Figures, againtt the Sky, look beft naked, becaute of\
their Airimess; thole in Niches mult be maffy and dref; and those be-\
low on the Ballytrade, half dred. Thus much as to the firft Skerch.\
The  Example thews the Method to be uted when it happens;\
that the Stall canfes  visble Deformity on the swelling Part of  Ei.\
gure; as to help it by the Disposition of an Arm, Bit of Drapery or\
Hand:  mean, in  Painting, where the Light remains atways the\
(ant, and to which Statuaries are not tied, especially in the open Air,\
becaute the Light continually afters, but in  Painting not; for as\
Things are painted they fland This Remark is worth noting; as well\
in Kirring as Htill Figures.\
In the sd Skeich,  exhibit  flanding Figure in  Niche, and be.\
tween them  Batsviol, fuppoled to be of yellowith or rufset Wood;\
which Colour, becaute the Figure is of white Marble, gives prong Re.\
fexions. On the Side, we fee another Figure, between the Greens;\
and  third lying on the Ground furrounded with the ir: In all three\
 have one and the fame incention, viz. to thew the Couse of the Mix\
fare of the Skiles; otherwife, the Figures will fometimes teem to be\
made of two Serts of Stuff, as the light Parts White, and the Shades\
of some other Colour.  due Obfervation of this enables us to antwer\
for what we do.\
Altho\'92 now by thefe Politions about the flirring ctions,  feem to\
contradict former ones, namely, that in painting of carving Statues, we\
ought to give them but lirtle Turn, yet in Fact  do not: ( spake there\
only touching  fingle Figare; whereas here are many in Company, and\
thofe fet upon Pedeftals, Fountains, and the like Places, where they\
are feen from all Sides; which creates  Difference as well in their Na.\
fures as Circumllances.\
If  am raxed with Prefumption for taking upon me to place fr\
gures, and fee naked ones and Women above, and Men, with thofe which\
are dreft, below,  anfwer, that my Conduct is founded on Architec\
ture, which intimates, that the five Orders are peculiar to five diffe\
rent Conditions of Men; as Polyphemus, or the Giants, for the firft Or\
der; Mars, as robult or mufculous, for the second; Apolle, for his\
Stendernels, for the third; Diana, or Vents, as womanith, for the\
fourth; and Iris, or Cpid, for the fifth. This Confideracion will,  as well embolden as juffify me.\

Chap &.\
 conclude this Chapter,  shall touch on Heads, Hands, and Feer,\
  have found,\
oth here and in other Parts, Painters as well as\
 \
\
\
Statuaries very imperfelt in them, as if of lets Confideration than\
Bodies.\
Some Statuaries do not fufficently vary their Faces, making little\
Difference between Vouth and ge, giving alfo much into the modern\
Way of Afettation, and exaggerating the Parts, without any Regard to\
tbe Antiques. By Affettation and exaggerating,  mean,  Kind of\
Fondnels in Artifts for  particular Manner; as, to make the Eye-lids\
of their Figures too large, which caufes an heavy look; and to cut the\
Dimples on each side of the Mouth, and the Hollows of the Nofe,\
and Neck, too deep, feemingly thewing the Fatness of Women:\
Whereas, they ought rather to be fomewhat more expreffive in the\
Mutcles; fince, according to the Turn of the Head, thofe rife more\
of less, especially in thin and aged People:  fpeak only of giving \
Variety to the Look and Breafts: For Faces mult not be always alike\
graye and lofty; there muff be, wanton ones as well as modeft, large-\
teatur\'92 as well as tender, fuitable to the Bodies;, the Cafe is here\
the fame with the Neck and Brealls, fome are growing, others full\
gTown.\
Much is to be obferved about the Make of the Hands, and Set of\
the Feet, especially when naked and without Sandals; but the Marter\
lies moft in ordering the Toes: The three foremeft ought to be the\
longest, and close, turning out more or less with the Tread of the Feet;\
whereas some turn them in, the great one lying ftrait with the Foor,\
and the reft againft it, which looks very uncomely. See the Examples\
in Plate LXVil. and the Difference between them; of which, the two\
Oppermoll thew the Upicemliness, and the three others the Ele\
fance  peak of And tho' many have Calts of beautiful Womens\
Hands for conflant fe, yet thefe (as has been faid of Faces.\
Brealls, CSr.) cannot, on all Occafions, ferve for the Difference of the\
Sexes; for Women have thicker and more tapering Fingers, and fimaller\
Nails than Men, who, according to their Bulk and Age, have morg\
riting Knuckles than Women\

AV ING, in the second Chapter fouched upon Modelling, which\
 is  Practice of great Concern to  curious Arcifl,  shall here\
deliver my further Thoughes about it.\
The making Models, whether in Clay, Wax, or other foff Matter,\
is both ulefol, delightful, and neceffary for  Statuary as well as\
Painter, indeed, for all who endeavour at any Perfeltion in the Arn;\
for by this Prattice (in Reference to the Relief of Things we are to\
reprefent, whereby it teems always to have Life itfelf) we obtain \
Firmnets, and at the fame Time  bold Handling. It disburthens our\
Thoughts, and makes fuch latting impreffions on the Mind, that we\
need be ar no Loss about the Lite. We mult be fentible of the great\
Advantage arifing from it, becaute we can model in the aforefaid Bo-\
dies, Baisreliets, Foliage, and other Ornaments from the Anciquities,\
on all Sorts of Objects, as Alears, Vafes, Dithes, Candlefficks, Cifferms,\
E and then paint them with such Colour as we pleafe; allo gild or\
bronze them, according to the Ufe we would put them. to. By the\
Jame Means we may have Store of elegant Swordhilts and Helmets,\
Greek as well as Roman, to ferve any Occation. In thort,  good Mo-\
deller can help himfelf out of any Difficulties. Therefore let me ad\
vife you to fall boldly to work, and make Batsreliets, Sphinzes,\
Tombs, Vafes, or any Thing elfe neceffary in the Art. Vou may\
Likewile get fmall wooden Pithes and Pors of divers Kinds turned, and\
prettily adorn them with Wax-imagery of Satyr' Faces, playing Chil\
dren, dancing Nymphs, (. Thefe Things may be uteful in any\
Manner of Painting, whether the Piece be Sun-fhine, or Moon or Car\
dle lights. If you would go further, you can divert yourself with\
modeiling Medals in Wax, and oblige  Friend with  Cafl of\
them.\
Many of the molt famous Mafters have praltifed Modelling; as fut\
fciendy appears in ther Works. The Truth is, we can make any\
Thing we want, even what no body elfe has, and is no where to be\
purchafed, to paint after, as from the Life itfelf.\

Board painted with the fame Colour and  as my Deign, and,\
with  Point, trace it thereon, and fill thefe Out lines with Wax or\

 wet Pencil; in order to make it fmooth and even: Which being done,\

tue arifes only from  Contrafl in its Out lines, from Top to\
Bottom; affecting not only the Figure, but allo the Pedefful; with\
this Difference, notwichflanding, between naked and cloath\'92 Figures;\
that an ornamented Pedeftal gives the former greater Elegance than .\
plain offc. Vet this latter Sort likewife produces  fine Effect, by\
obferving, that the Swells or Scrolls of Mens Pedeals ought to be at\

wis, & whether the Pedeffals ought then to be reprefented fo unliker\
My Opinion is, that they mull not, as being contrary to Rule and Or-\
der. If both Figures be Aen, the Pedeftals ought to swelt at Bottom;\
if both Women, en Top; and if  Man and  Woman, both ought to be\
plain: If there be  Weman between two Men, the Side-pedeftals muft\
be plain, and the middle one particular to iffelf; and the contrary.\
Plain Pedetals, tho' bearing dreff Figures, Vafes, or Bulls, fuit not\
betweentwo Colunns or Pilafers; at lealt, they ought to hellow in, not\
twelf our.\
The Height of  Fase, placed between two Figures, muft not ex-\
ceed three Foarths of that of the Figures, incluive of the Pedeftal;\
that is, up to the Breafts, and no higher.\
 Bul, with its Pedeffal, should not rife above Mans Height,\
the Pedellal not swelling our, but the contrary; as in the Ex-\
amples.\
Where two Prfes and  Buf are placed in  Gardeh between two Fj.\
gures, the ourward Pedeftals ought to be of the fame Height with the\
middlemofl, and plain, the two others muft hollow in or fwell out,\
according to the Courfe of the Vafes, and be  third, or half, lower,\
yet retain the fame Breadth with the others.\
 Vafe, twice as high as broad, and running up firait, ought to\
have  square fwelling Pedefial. The Contrary will produce the same\
\
\
Decorum.\
If  Byl fland between two Vafes, they muft be level with the\
Shoulders of the Figure. The contrary is allo gord, provided the\
Pedeftal be fomew har bigger, and fuited to the Courfe of the Vafe.\

 ble Art of Painting, together with the Lufre and Advantage\
 Stilllise.\
 Ii\
accrusing to thefe who thoroughty confider and put it in Execution;\
we shall now, for the fake of weak Capacities, proceed to Stittlife,\
or, immoveable and inanimate Tbings; fuch as Flowers, Fruits, Gold, Sil\
zer, Stone, Musical Indruments, dead Fish, Exc. and thew which are the\
beft and of moff Advantage. Thefe may, in their Turns, in different\
Mianners, ferve for Materials for  natural Compoficion, wherewith to\
pleafe all Sorts of Men, the Great as well as the Lirle, the Learned\
as lgnorant. Wherefore, out of many, we shall fix on the following\
Objects, as the moft beautiful, elegant, and agreeable.\
 Floters.\
 Fruit.\
 Goll, Sikver, and other rich Tkings.\
 Mufral In:ruments.\
Thefe four Sorts, arrfully order\'92 and perform\'92, may ferve for the\
Ornament of Halls and Cabinets as well as the beft Paincings, pro-\
vided ther have  proper Light, and bang together. But we mult\
Know, in the tirft Place, what conflirutes  good Still-life-piece, fince,\
tho' ir be naturally handled, nothing but  good Choice can charm the\
Sentes, and bring Fame to the Matter. Tis Weakness to think that\
faded Flowers thould pleafe, much lets in  Pilture: Or who would\
hang  Piece of ordinary, unripe, or rotten Fruit in his beft Room,\
and among  Cabinet collection, feeing the Life itfelf is to difagreea-\
ble? Such Rubbith  did formerly admire; but as they only thew the\
Deformiries of Nature,  have no Appetite to view them any more.\
Bur, to return to the Subject.\
My Opinion is, that the Beauty and Goodness of  Still life con\
fitts only in the moft choice Objects:  fay, the most choice;  Flowers, the molt rare and beautiful, and the fame in Fruits\
and other Things. Thefe will gain  Mafter Credic, especially with\
the Addition of tome particular Significutions proper to them. It is not\
probable that wealchy People should be delighted with old-fathiond\
Plate and Furniture, when they can have every Thing more beautiful\
and elegant; and as improbable, that judicious Lovers of Mulick\
should be pleafed with the modern Lyre, Dulcimer, or Bag-pipe. As\
for Cabbages, Carrots, and Turnips, as likewife Codfith, Salmon, Her\
rings, Smells, and fuch-like (which are poor and mean Ornaments, and\
not worthy of any Apartment) he who is pleated with them may feek\
them in the Markets  as little approve of Horfe-furniture and hunt\
ing Equipage; tho' thefe latter, with wild Boars, Stags, Hares, Phea-\
Lants,\
\
\

Chap. .\
 Partridges; and other Fowls, depending on Princes and Noble.\
mens Fancies, are more tolerable.\
Having thus in general couched on Still life, let the Judicious deter-\
mine which Sort is belt and moft advantageous either to the Painter of\
Purchafer.\
As for me,  think Eloquence very charming to the Ear; but Good\
ness alone makes Beauty amiable. What is  fine Flower, Apple, Gold\
Cup, or well-cund Violin, without good Smell, delicate Tafle, proper\
Ufe, and agreeable Sound? Goodness,  fay, ought to be perfectly ap-\
parent: The Smell, Taffe, Hearing, or Sound cannot be painted; but\
may be, in fome Meafure, expreft by occult Significations, either in\
Balsrelief by Fables, Hicroglyphicks, or emblematick Figures, or by\
many other Things, if the Will be not wanting.\
As to the Nature and Property of the Places for Stilllife, they are\
two fold, clole and open; the one reprefenting it as if banging against \
Wall or Wainicot, and the other, as lying on  Bench or Table, or on\
the Ground.\
We allo fuppofe, that no Objects ufed in Still-life ought to be repre-\
fented less than the Life.\
Tis likewife improper, and againtt the Nature of Still-life, to intro-\
duce, in any of the before-mention\'92 Choices, colour\'92 Back-works, or\
Viffos, either clofe or open, that is, Landskip, rchitecture, or any\
Kind of living Creatures; which would fpoil the very Name of  Still-\
life: Moreover, it is difficult, if not impoltible, for fuch  Painter to\
hit every Thing; and granting he can,  yet queftion, whether he\
would be pleafed with the Title of  Still-life Painter..  fay then,\
that the Depth of the Picture is only to be reprefented by an hanging\
Curtain, or  Bassrelief of Wood or Stone, of fuch  Colour and Iint,\
as belt fuits the general Decorum; the one darkifh, and the other fome.\
what lighter. With Flowers,  dark-grey Back-ground fuits better\
than  white, yellow, or red one. With Frsit, white and grey Mar\
ble, but not yellow or red. Vet, as  fine Balsrelicf requires more\
Skill than  Flower or Fruit, and fuch like, you may, inflead thereof,\
introduce  Niche, with  God or Goddess' Buft therein, proper to the\
Subjett, as  Flora, Pomend, Barthus, Apolle, Diand, or others, ac-\
cording to the incent of your Delign, and as you would have it bear\
either  particular or general Meaning,, which each of thole Figures.\
will fupply in Abundance. Flowers are various; and, like Fruits, may\
be divided into three Sorts, to wit, the Spring; Summer and Aucumn;.\
and, having different Qualities, are fit for many fine and uncommon:\

Touching the other Sert of Still-life, either flanding or lying in deep\
Niches, or on Benches or Tables, we have before obferved, that it\
ought not to be represented less than the Life, and therefore mult come\
quite forward in the Piece, as appearing then in its full Force and Qua-\
Ley; even much better with  Light coming from without than within,\
 Frent, than Side-light.\
There are three Sorts of Grounds which elegantly fet off Fruits.\
Grapes, especially the blue, and Cherries, blue Plums, and all Fruits\
inclinable to be dark, require one of Freeftone. But Apples, Peaches,\
and Apricocks appear better on  dark grey Ground. there is  third.\
Sort, as Pumpkins, Melons, Oranges, Strawberries, and others, which\
bell become  white Ground, whether they be lying on  Bench or Ta-\

This Piece exhibits  compass headed Niche, (quare within, and its\
Depth equal to its Diameter. Therein  place  beautiful Vale; either.\
of Cryftal, Copper, or Gold, with Flowers; of which,  fet the short-\
eft halkt in the Middle, and the others (preading on the Sides. Above,\
in the Middle, on  King,  hang two or three Bunches of the largeft\
Sort of Grapes. To the King  fatten  small Ribbon, on which:\
loofely hang Ears of Corn, intermixed with fome Corn-flowers,\
taken up and ried in the upper Corners of the Piece, and hanging\
down the Sides. Below, round the Vafe, lies fine. and palatable:\
Fruit, of the largeft and beft Sort, as Melons, Lemons, freth Figs,.\
Pomegranates, Walnurs, as well as Apples, Peaches, Chinaoranges,.\
 This is the Subltance of the Piece.\
The Dispolition is thus. The Feftoons, in Bunches of an Hands,\
Length, are parted with Greens, and tied, which Greens cover the\
Stalks of Corn, and being intermixed,, as is faid, with fome blue Flow-\
ers, produce an agreeable Mixture, without Mepery.. The Jaums fer=.\

of the Niche, without drawing the Eye from the principal. My in.\
tention is, to dispose the Flowers into  large Mass of beautiful and light\
ones; the ftrongelt and fulleft to be in the Middle, confilting of white,\
fellow, and light red. The higheft next the Grapes to be  Tum\
 and on the Sides, others of lets Force and Colour, intermix\'92' here\
and there, with  beautiful blue one. And becaute the Vafe, on ac-\
count of the Room which the Fruits lying about it take up, cannot\
sland quite forward, the Flowers preading on the sides mult be in\
Shads. The Fruirs  dilpole contrary again; as the biggeft on the leff\
Side, and the imallell and moft tender, tuch as Peaches, Apricocks, and\
Plums, on the right: They should be ltalian Fruits, especially the le\
mons at lea? two Fids big, as being the Chief of the Group, and govern\

Aleanings, add  Lyre, Violin, or other mufical inftrument, which may\
be fer or hung againtt the light side of the aforefaid Hollow; and thus\
the Piece is compleat.\
And now, curious Still life Painters! view this Example with Atten\
tion, and confider whether  propoie to ye any Difficulty above your\
Abiliries. Ve Flower-painters, is it more troublefom and artful to imi-\
tate  Grape, Apple of Peach, than  Rofe, Lilly, or Turnfol? And\
ye who practife Frut only, what Difficulty has  Flower more than\
Fruits,  Pomegranate or Mielon inwardly or outwardly? Any of thefe\
may be fer flanding or lying before ye, as long as ye pleafe; and fo\
may an Harp, Violin, Lyre, or Flute: Thefe can ffore ye, and are all\
in your Power, and your Eyes can determine the Proportiens, Meafures\
and Forms of all that flands fill, hangs, or lies, and the foft Pencil,\
skilfuly handled, bring them naturally and properly on the Clock.\
Why then do ye fo often obflinacely build on  fingle Sore!  beauti\
ful Flower will certainly pleafe the Eye, but more, in Conjunction with\
some freth and palatable Fruit, and higher yet, with the Addition of\
fome fine Mufical Inftruments. Vour Cloth may take in fomething of\
each, and yet ye moft Times do it with  fingle Sort. If it be  Flow.\

Greens, fied up, as in the former; and againt the Jaumbs of the Niche\
some mufical Inftruments, as  Flute, Trumpet, Baffoons, Corncis,\
Haulboys, Coc. On the right side of the Basker, lies  porcelain Dith\
of Strawberries; and behind it, fomewhat deeper in the Niche,  wide\
Glass of Mulberries, Cos. The hanging Feffoons, on each side of the\
Burch of Flowers, confiff moftly of Ears of Corn and Greens. The\
main Light takes the Basket of Fruir, confifting moftly of lightifh\
white, yellow, and fomewhat red ones, and the chaded Side, of dark,\

\
The\

Book Xi\
 Helwet denotes an inclination for War, and  martial Spirit.\
The Shield, allo  Token of Defence, was to much regarded by the\
Ancients, that they made  Prefent of it to Conquerors, in Confiders-\
tion of their Valour and Conduct. Virgil, in his qth Book, mentions\
TExeas' ordering  Shield to be brought to him, wherewith to reward\
the Fidelity and Valour of Nrsus. The Argives had  Cultom of\
marching young Men (who had by notable Exploits merited the Ho.\
nour) with the Sbield of Eshippas carried before them, triumphantly\
thro' their Town and Territories. We alto read, that the Palladium,\
which the Ancients believed fell from Heaven, was  Shield, myfteri.\
oly reprefenting the Protection of the Roman People and Empire,\
And, according to Nama Pompiliar' Exvlanation, the Shield implied\
Succets and Prosperity; whereby he endeavoured to buoy and comfort\
the Reman People, on their being forely vificed, in his eighth Vear;\
with  Peftilence which chrearmed the Deftruction of all  The\
Sbields were moreover dedicated to thofe, who had faved the Town\
and Common wealch from any great and imminent Danger; and to\
perperuate fuch  Benefaction, and as  Spur to Virsue, they cauted\
the Story to be engraved or carved on their Shields. The Shield and\
Pife alfo fignity War, chiefly in recrieving the Damages fultained by\
the Enemy, and in patting them to Flight and deftroying them. Vet\
Weapons are of little Advantage, if not ufed with Wifdom and Under\
Wherefore, we generally fee Palfus reprefented with \
standing:\
Shield and Pike; the latter lignifying Force and Quicknets of Appre-\
Neation\
The Pitz or Spear allo denores the (preading of  glorious Name.\
For which Reafon, according to Pistarch, Lysippus adorned the Scatue\
of Atexander with it, tho' others reprefented him with Thunder in his\
Hand, intending thereby to immortalize the Atchievements of that\
Heroe. The Pife or Arrow allo, being thrown or thot at  Mark,\
hicroglyphically fignifies, the (preading of  glorious Name. Vet.\
according to the Ancients, the Pifz or Spear not only implied Royal\
Grandeur and Authority, but was likewife the ufual Reward for thole\
who had shewed their Bravery in conouering the Enemy: As Pling\
fays, that Sicinains Destaias, for his admirable Valour, was prefented\
with twelve Pifes. Fifus Pempeins thinks, that Generals received the\
Pike or Tavelin, in token of their being incrufted with the principal\
Management of the War and Empire; and that therefore it was cut\
comary to fell the Prifoners publickly, fub Hofa, or. under the Pikt\
of Spear.\
 Stilblife.\
  Sward, in Reference to War, fignifies Fury, Crucly, Fright,\
Persecution and Threatening with Death.\
The bent Borw is likewile  Sign of War; and the Arrows fignify\
the People, or the Enlargement of Power; alfo Velocity and quicks\
Motions.\
The Crownof Laurel was the Token of Conquerors, and thole who\
performed any glorious Alt,, as the ancient Remains fufficiently inform\
us. And we learn from Hiffory, that the Roman Generals and Com-\
manders uted, in their Triumphs, to prefent  Crown of Laurel to\
Tupiter Capitelinus.\
The ancient Remans allo uled to bellow  Palm on thofe who tri-\
umphed, as  general Token of Victory. And the Patmtree, thot\
preffed by an heavy Weight, will yet grow againtt it; wherefore, in\
hot Battles, tis effeemed  Token of Victory, which can only be got\
by  firm Refolution to refift and despife Dangers and Adverlicies.\
The Olive is likewife  Mark of Victory; the Ancients adorning\
their Trophies and warlike Monuments with its Branches, or decking\
the Head of the Conqueror with  Crown of its Leaves.\
The gold Cbain was the Reman Reward for Valour and Virtue; it\
not only recompenfing Merit, but ferving for  Badge of Honour,\
Glory and ERleem. The Roman Hiffory informs us, that the Son of\
Tarquiniss Prifcas, tho' but  Vears of Age, charged the Enemies in\
the open Field, and conquer\'92 them; wherefore, to immortalize his\
Valour, he was the firft who was honour\'92 with  gold Cbain: Tho,,\
according to others, Herphias, the firft Son born of the ravith\'92 Sa=\
bines at Rome, firft received that Honour. We alfo read, that Sicin\
nias Dentatus was  Times rewarded with  gold Chain, and  Times\
with other Gold or gill Prefents.\
The Heart befet with precious Stones, hanging down to the Breaft.\
on  gold Chain, fignifies, that wholfome Advice and Deliberation (pring:\
from the innermoff of the ffeart; wherefore, thofe who triumph:\
ed were introduced with this gold Chain about their Necks, in the ur-\
molt Part whereof, or the Heart banging down to the Breeft, they ima-\
gined were contained Herbs and Balm, which secured the Triumphers.\
from Malice and Envy. Afconins particularly remarks, that the Chil:\
dren of the Nobles or free Citizens wore thole Chains; but the Lis\
terti or Freed-men, for Diffinction' Sake, had them only of Silver.\
and Copper: To which, Tavenal, in his Satyrs, alludes, laying, Tbs.\

 gold Crown and Bracokets, which adorned both the Shoulders\
and Arms, were likewife the Rewards of great Attions. Thole Gife\
were preferved for Pofterity, as  Spur for young People indefatigably\
to gread in the Steps of their Fore -fathers. Firas Liviss, in his roch\
Book, fays, that, after the Viltory obtained over the Samnites near\
Aquilonis, Papiriss, on that Occafion, prefented Sp. Nautins, his Ne\
phew, Seariss Pabiriss,  Captains and  Troop of Pikemen, with\
Bracelets and gold Crowns; giving the other Captains, Foot-foldiers and\
Horfemen, Brocelets and Ornaments of Silver which they called Cor.\
mrals, of little Horns And Decins the Tribune received  gold Crown\
from Aulss Cornelias Coffus, for defending  certain ffrong Place, be\
longing to the Remans, againff the Samires, and forcing them to raife\
the Siegc.\
The Romans allo efteemed the Kings as Badges of Honour and No.\
bility- For, according to Titas Livius, in his chird Book, treating of\
the second Panic War, on Mlago' being difparch\'92 by Hannibal to no\
tify to the Carthaginians the bloody Defeat of the Romans in the\
Battle of Canns, he poured out before them an Heap of gold Kings,\
taken as Booty from the Stain; adding, to excol the Viltory, that,\
among the Romins, none but the Great and Noble were allowed to\
wear them. And, towards the Clofe of his  Book, he relates,\
that on Flaviss his being in  publick Affembly, cholen Edilis, of\
Superintendant of the publick Buildings, the Nobiliry were to ditfult\
od, that feveral of them laid down their gold Kings and Other Tokens\
of Honour and Effeem. And the eloquent Cicere, in his ith Oration\
againft Verres, reproaches him for beflowing, in  publick Affembly of\
the People, the Tokens of Honour, Gold Kings, on mean and unworthy\
People: With whom agrees Afconins, faying, That the Fasces, Civc\
Crown and gold Rings were, by the People, look\'92 on as Badges of Li\
berty and Nebilicy, and always actended with Honour and profitable\
Incomes.\
The Greeks repured the Hat or Cap as  Token of noble Extrac\
tion; wherefore they reprefented the Head of Ulilfes covered with \
Cop of Hor, as being noble both by Father and Mother. For this\
Reafon, we commonly fee on the ancient Coims and Medals an Hat of\
Cag, circomsribed LiBERT AS.\
The Dismond is indifputably the hardeff, and, for its (parkling, the\

The embreider\'92 Goat, called Tunica Palmata, was an UUnder-gar-\

Olive branch. By him is  plaifter Sphinx. Alfo  Sword and Shield,\
 Lyre or Harp,  burning Lamp, an ink horn with Pens and  Roll\

Cedar and Myrtle, and the third of Oak-leaves. On the Wall, or\
in  fmall Table, we fee, in Bass relief, the Fable of Minerva brought\
forth out of Tupiter' Brain.\
Explanation of the Objects.\
Mercury implies the impreffion of Words upon the Mind, and the\
Force of Eloquence: Wherefore, the Ancients believ\'92, he was the\
Meffenger and Incerpreter of the Gods.\
The Square-flone whereon he flands fignifies the Regard for and Sta-\
bility of the Laws and Rules whereby to direlt our Speeches: For\
which Reafon Mercury is Hiled Tetragenus, or Square, that is firm and\
certain.\
His Staff or Caducens intimates, that obltinate Tyrants mult yield\
to the Laws and fluent Charms of Eloquence. By the Serpents tuined\
about the golden Rod the Ancients mean, that Eloquence, temper\'92 with\
Ingenuity and Prudence, can cafily bring Men to Reafon. Some alfo\
would have the golden Rod in the Hand of Mercury to lignity, the Ex-\
cellence and Eminence of honourable Offices due to thole who imploy\
their Eloquence (the Gift of Heaven) in their Neighbours Welfare and\
the common Good.\
By the Olive-branch in Mercury' Hand is underfood, Peace; for\
the ncients believed, it compoted the Differences of contending Parties.\
His Wings at Head and Feet were aftigned him to fignify, the Readi-\
nets and Force of Eloquence.\

 compare Jurifprudence to the Sword and Shield: For as  War.\
rior thereby defends himself and annoys his Enemy, to  Council gets\
his Caule by the Dint of frong Arguments and well grounded Con.\
clutions.\
The ancient Romans fignified, by the Lyre or Harg,  Man of great\
Learning and Judgment; for that Inftrument is compofed of divers\
Strings and Scunds, producing fine Harmony; like the Lawyer when\
he reconciles the Difference of Things to Reafon, in order to make con-\
teking Parties agree. By the Harg or Lyre, we alfo underlland,\
that Harmony arifes from different and diffonant Cords; and\
that People of contrary Sentiments meeting together, may, by\
 good Union, ferle and trantmit to Pofterity an excellent Form of\
Government. And as Plate, in his Timans, fliles the Soul  Concert or\
tweer Harmony, to Concord may be juftly call\'92, the Soul of the State.\
The Greets and Romans fay, the Lyre was partly invented by Alercury\
and parrly by others.\
The Shape of the ancient Lyre is this: It was bent like two Horms,\
join\'92 together, having  fwelling Belly, and on cop an Handle.  is\
said to have had but three Strings, and thefe could produce feven\
Tunes, making  perfed Harmony. The three Strings were affigned\
in lmitation of the three Scafons of the Vear Known to the Eoyptians,\
 Summer, Uinter and Spring, each confifting of four Months; and\
they artribured the Canras to the Summer, the Bass to Winter and the\
Ire to the Spring. Others fay, that this Application respects Man;\
whole Body, confitting of four Elements, and the Soul, in reference to\
its Acts, of three, thus makes the Number feven; which together\
Produce  perfelt Harmonr.\

Wherefore the Lizp is tomerimes taken for the Works done by us\
 for as the Night, thro' is Stillness, is very proper for Scudy,\
to the Greek Poers allo gave the Night  Name which fignified the pro-\
ducing Underftanding, Wildom and Gladnets; as the Mind is ther\
apt for Mediration. Accordingly, the frequent Proverb of Scudents\
is, Plus Oli quam Vini; He spint mere in Oilthan Wine; meaning\
more Time in diligent Labour of the Mind, to attain Sciences, than\
in taking Walks, Feafting or other Diverfions. Epicharmus uted to las.\
that he, who would findy great Things, muft not, for the Sake of\
Eale, (pare the Nights.\

ChaP.  the Sieve, the fame People hicroglyphically meant; the Fruitful.\
acts of Infiruction in Arts and Sciences; allo, the Writers of facred\
and myfterious Things: For as the sieve feparates the Good from the\
Bad, to their Lawyers, who were alto Hiled Prielts, Knew how, thro'\
their Prudence and Wifdom, to diffinguish between Things concerning\
Life and Death; accordingly, they made ufe of the Word Sieve for\
exprefting whats true and known. Others fay, that by that Imple.\
ment is fignified,  Man of great Knowledge and Perfection, who can\
difcourfe of Things divine and human with equal Penetration. More.\
over, as the sieve feparates the Flour from the Bran, fo Experience\
fits us for difcerning between good and bad, right and wrong. Where-\
fore Virgil, in the firft Book of his Georgies, righily files it, Myffica\
Vannus lacchi, the myftic Fan (or Sieve) of laccbus. Some apply to\
this Point the Saying of the Philofopher Antifiberes; that it were\
great Folly not to know how to diffinguith the Corn from the Chaff;\
meaning the learned and beneficial Citizens from the illiterate.\
Next to the Bible the chief Authors for Law are, viz. among the\
Greeks, Solon, Lycurgus, Demoffbeses and Ifocrates: Among the Ro-\

The Herb or Plower Iris is an Emblem of Eloquence, according to\
Hemer, who, to defcribe that of the Trejan Embaffadors, reprefents\
them as having eaten the blooming Iris; meaning, their being the.\
roughly skill\'92 in pleating Eloquence; for that Flower, by its Variety\
of Colours, is not unlike the heavenly Iris of Rainbow, whom the\
Ancients accounted the Goddets of Eloquence.\
The Garland of Laurel, intermixed with lvy-leaves, fignities, that\
Lawyers are, for their excellent Labours and Parts, to be had in perpe-\

Several Reafons are affigned for this Sort of Crowns. Some fay, that\
originally the freadians were firft honoured with it for the Antiqui.\
ty of their Oracles. Others think it proceeded from that Trees be.\
ing iacred to Jupiter, the Patron of the Dodongan Oracle, and Proted.\
or of Towns; and that therefore it was very reafonable to crown those,\
who had faved  Citizen either by Arms or Law, with the Leaves of\
that Tree, dedicated to the Tutelar-god of all Towns. Others are of\
Opinion, that the Oat was the firft-made of the Trees, and has been\
the firft Nourifher of Mankind, and Material for the Oracles. We fee\

in  fmall Picture is feen  Landskip, exhibiring among other Things,\
 Rock,  Palm,  Cedar-tree and an Hill fending forth abun-\
dance of Water. On the Wall, in Bass-relief, is an Elephant rearing\
his Trunk towards Heaven, as alfo  Stork and Cock: But above all,\
we muff not forget the fruitful Muffard-feed,  Sprig whereof we have\
fet, in  Pot or Vafe, on the Table with the other Objects; an Expla-\
nation whereof follows.\
Adamamins and others tell us, that the Power of the Univerfe\
mull yield to the Dillates of Religion.  further Explanation of the\
Bible is unneceffary, fince it is fufficiently known to every Body.\
The Altar is accounted the Hicroglyphic of Piety; of which, \
have treated in Book IN. pas.   compares the Lamp to the Body, the Habitation of the\
Soul; and its sbining Ligbt to the Faculy of Underllanding. But in\
Scripture, we often find, that by the Lamp are meant the Doctors and\
Teachers of Arts, Sciences and Myleries, who should be fet on the Can-\
dlefick, in order to expel Darkness, and light thefe in the Houfe. In\
another Paltage, it' faid, that the Light ought not to be bidden, &.\
And if the Light, according to Scholafticus in his Climax, come to be\
in Darknels, what will not the Darknefs of Nature, or Men ignorant\
of God, be guitty of ? Some again underftand by the Light, the Goffel:\
Others, St. John the Baptiff, who is alto called,  burning Lamp.\
The Prophets were alfo Lamps, but burning dim, as (peaking myfte-\
rioufly: Bur St. John, as with  Finger, has pointed out our Saviour.\
Eucherins obferves, that by the Lamp is fometimes meant, good\
Works; and therefore the Gofpel lays, \'97 Let yoar Light fo shine\
before Men, that they may fee your geod Werks, &. The Light or\
Fire fometimes likewife hieroglyphically fignifies, Devotion and Piety.\
Hearthly Things can in any wife unite us with the heavenly, no-\
thing in Nature has greater Affinity with the Mind and Spirt than\
Fire, becaufe it lights and clears every thing, and makes us intimate\
with Heaven.\

The Aportle St. Puul Cays, that the Word of God is quick and pow\

mating, that tho' the Stone in the Kidncys feem incurable, yer the\
Word of God can convert and cure the hard Stone of our Unbelief\
For, by our Saviour' Coming on Earth, we have learnt what the Fleh\
and Spirit incline to; and his Doltrine has, like  trvo-edged Sword,\
divided the Spirit from the Fleth, that we might afterwards lead \
fpirirual Life, as being not in the Fleth, but in the Spirit, efteeming\
the Corruption of the Fleth  great Gain, when, thro' the Spirit, we\
obtain eternal Life.\
Eacherius thinks, that the Words in Pl. Cxxvil.\'97 As Arrows are\
in the Hand of  mighty Man, fo are the Children of the Touth, allude\
to the Apofiles and their Miffion into all Countries; becaute, in their\
Travels, they pierced Men' Hearts with the Doltrine of Chriff, as with\
 durting frrow, and brought them from Darkness to Light: For\
by the frrows, in feveral Places of Scripture, is underftood Gods\
Word, penetrating the Soul as with  twoedged Sword.\
We find in facred Writ, that the Almighty is to be praited with\
Drans or Timbrels. And Gregory, in the  Book of his Epitilesto\
Atbanassss, emblematically thews by the Drum, kind Remembrance;\
Fer, lays he, as the Materials of that Inffrument are long before pre\
pared to fit it for Sound, so  Man should pioufly endeavour to thank his\
Greater, and loudly praife him for his Benefits.\
The Bells hanging, according to Mlofers Command, at the Hem of\
the High-prieft' Garment, emblemarically fienified the Publifhing of\
\
God' Will; and his being heard by their lingling on entring into\
of coming forth of the Holy of Holies, intimates, that the Minittry\
should always have the Word and Laws of God in their Mouchs, for\
rebuking, exhorting or comforting, according to the Weakness and\
Trantgreffions of Men.\
The Harg formerly reprefented all Kinds of Arts and Virrues:\

Chap.  Orpbins and Proclas among the Heathens, and Dovid among the\

By Water and Fire, or the Ciffern and Cenfer, the EEgyptian Prielts\
underffood  Purgation from Spots and Filth; even from the Darknels\
of Igaorance by Means of pure Doctrine. Accordingly, after Fune-\
rals, the Ancients purified themfelves with Water and fmoking Per-\
fumes, the latter hieroglyphically reprefenting Prayers and divine Doc-\
rine, as Hefychins Bishop of Terusalem writes.\
The fame People meant by the Sieve the Fruitfulness of Inftruction\
in Arts and Sciences. Others, the End of all Things, as by ofcen exa-\
mining ourtelves to learn Quietness of Life, and by due Reffection on\
what is paft, prefent and to come, to make Profperity and Adverfity\
equal.\
Dodrine and Inftruction those People called  Bo. which, being\
interpreted, fignifies Plenty, or all that is necelfary for Life;\
as it the Study of Sciences require  good Forcune. Ariffotle fays,\
the Rich should Rudy Philofophy. And Eechariab,  noted Man,\
among the Fews, \'97 If you have Flour, you will learn the Law:\
 you have Knowledge in the Law, you will vant no Flour: The Law\
implying Knowledge and Sciences, and the Flour every Thingnecelfary\
for Suftenance. But  think, according to REgyprian Wildom, that\
this Dotrine rather respects the Soul than the Body; for its believed,\
that the Basket of unleavend Bread, which Haron and his Sons only\
were to offer, hicroolyphically fignitied the Tongue or Word, or eter-\
nal and heavenly Eloquence; for as Brend fuppores the Body, fo the\
Word of God nourifhes to eternal Life. And becaule Bread, by  ge-\
peral Confent, implies Doctrine and Inftruction; to whom muft we re-\
turn our Thanks, but to him who by his Doctrine has enlightened our\
Urderllanding, and is the Fountain of Plenty and Perfection. In this\
Seate the Bread, called the Loaves of two Tenth-deals of fine Flour,.\
offer\'92, as in Leviticus xxii. for  Meatoffering, fignitied the Law and.\
the Gofpel; but according to our Saviour when under Temptation, that\
 Man did not live by Bread alone, but by every Word preceeding out of\
the Mouth of God.\
in Baking, the Leoven has in Scripture divers Sigaifications: Among\
others it implies human Sciences. Now Sciences are divided into bu-\
man and divine, the former fubject to the Diverficy of Words, but the\

 endlets; and thus Nature, Philofophy, Ethies and Thcology are\
very comformable to the Deiry: But Grammar, Rhccorick, and Dis-\

yin is not used in Offerings. For Divines underfland by it, human Sci-\
ences, the Matter and Force whereof lies only in Words; which ne-\
verthelets are Ards, becaute the Purity of Speech, which Grammar\
reaches, thews the Beauty and Excellence of Eloquence obtained by\
Rhetorick, and the Merhod of Reafoning and Oppofition, gained by\
Dialectica, is an Help to many other Sciences.\
Philolophers fay, that the Products of the Earth are owing to Sult.\
Divines compare it to the Colpel, alledging Leriticus, Chap.  Wilh\
oll thine Offerings they salt offer Satt: Or in all your Doctrines you\
mult be governed by thofe of the Apoftles, who, according to our\
Saviour, are the Salt of the Earth. The Frankincenfe put on the  according to the Fewish Rite, the feventy Interprecers have\

The Tewish Prielts were commanded to fet the People  Pattern of\
Chaftity, Piety and good Behaviour, and to be always ready to walk\
in God' Paths, as appears by the white Linnen Girdle, fignifying the\
molt facred and myfferious Doltrine, by which they ought to govern\
chemfelves and their Congregations. Tcremiah\'92 Girdle had the same\
Micaning, as Cirif largely thews. As the Girdle was white Linnes,\
we are led to confider the firft Matter it was made of, to wit\
Flax.\
The Seed of Flix comes up as green as Grass in  short Time alta\
fowing; and having bloffom\'92 and fet is seed, tis then pull\'92, ad\
rotted in Water, and afterwards laid to dry in the Sun; and then being\

After boiling in frong Lye it is made into  Web of Linnen, and\
whitened, for  Dress wherein to appear before God. The Carem\
ceffary about this Herb, which is an Emblem of undefiled Life, ough\
concinually to be had in View; that, laying afide Things vain and iwr\
profitable, we may, by Means of Science, render ourfelves irreprore\
able, and thro' Adverfity and Temptations obtain the white Garmen\

Divines are rightly compar\'92 to  Wheel; that, by fortaking earchly\

The Sapphire was always in great Elleem, as emblemitically re-\
prefenting Sovereignty and Pricilhood. Some fay, that this Stone\
draws heavenly influences from Tupiter and Saturn; and that thofe\
who wear it obtain all their Defires; as from Tupiter, Dominion and\
Auchority, and from Sarurn, the Prieithood. But, according to the\
Fathers, this Stone reprefents the Throne fpoken of by Exetiel,\
to wit, the Seat of God, eternal, good and Almighty. And Eucbe-\
riss underllands, by the Make of the Heavens, the Society of the\
Pious and Elect: Wherefore, fays Heficbins, the Throne of Sapphire\
lignifies the tenth of Empyreal Heaven: For by the Colour he under-\
Rands, Purity, Clearnels and heavenly Light, always intlrulting the\
Church in unalterable and pure Doctrines.\
We learn from Scripture, that the Olive-free was originally the Em-\
blem of Peace; for no fooner did the Waters abate, but the the Dove,\
which Noah fent, foon after returned with an Olive-teaf, as  Token\
that the Wrath of Heaven being appeared, God took Compaftion on\
the Remains of human Race and other Creatures in the Ark, and\
therefore cauted the Waters to retire into the Bowels of the Earth.\
The Olivebranch is alfo, in Scripture, the Emblem of  pious Min;\
swe fee in the Gofpel, that the Light ought to burn pure on the Can-\
deffick, whereby our Saviour intimates, that both Preachers and Hear-\
ers should fill their Lamps with the Oil of Chriflian Virrues. The\

Hope; accordingly, Baplins with\'92 we might be like it, becaufe, -\
bounding with Bloffoms and Thining Greenness, if always affords\
Hope of what is to come; or the durable Prairs of Piety and Mercy.\
The wifell Egyplians and Greeks did, when Men' Underilendings\

prielliy Garb, Trath, found Dobtrine and Difcourfes, which with their\
Explacations let Men into the Knowledge of Things or Pbilesophy,\
and his glittering Robe fignified, pare Drvinity, having no other Ten-\
dercy but  Correction of Manners and leading to Virrue and Heaven.\
Scripture teaches, that the Spirit of Wildom enters not into the Heart of\
the Wicked: Accordingly, Mofes denied the Unclean and Sinful an\
Entrance into the Tabernacle Thereby intimating, that thofe who\
improve in Virrue and the Knowledge of God, ought by the Ole of\
the fre Loaves (according to Cyril) or the five tart Books of the Law,\
to prepare their Hearts for the two Fithes, of the Doctrine of the .\
Vangelifts and Apottles, and therein to preferve. Next to the Science\
for Improvement of Manners, Divines should endeavour at Diffind.\
nets, Plainnels and Order in their Speeches; which the Learned call\
Disleffica; whofe Province is to determine Controverfies and refolve\
Doubrs by reafoning juftly : For altho, like Moses, they practifed moral\
Duties, and were received into the Sanctuary, yet they rouch\'92 not on\
facred Things, otherwife than by means of their Specches. Affer\
this, they enquired into natural Philofophy, or Phyficks, having, for\
Subject, the Univerfe and all created Beings; this Science clear\'92 their\
Doubis and Scruples, and prepar\'92 them for contemplating the glorions\
Baiiding of the Heavens, in order to thank their Creator for the\
Knowleege received. Their laft Study was Theology, which, as we\
have feid, comprehends all Sciences: This gives Divines fuch  con\
fant Peace as neicher the Regularity of human Deportment, pureh .\
loquence, of the moft exad Inquiries into Nature, could afford them\
But this unchangeable Peace and firm Alliance with God they obtain\
by fubmitting their Knowledge, Inclinations and carnal Affections to\
the Rules prescribed by Reafon. This mutual Friendship, which the\
Tribagereass efteemed the main Point in Thilofophy, leads us into ihe\
moft fecret Part of the Sanduary, in order to view the Glory of God,\
fill at laft, arriving at the highell Degree of Knowledge, we courage\
oully defeat Offris, or the Enemy of our Souls.\
Tho' the aforefaid Instruction confift of  Parts, yet Solomon, the wi\

Of Still life.\
Chap.  of Men, divides it into three Sciences, to wit, Esbies, Phyfies,\
and Metaphyfies, which he has handled in his Proverts, Ecclepaffes,\
and Song or Carlicam Canticerum; reaching in the Troverbs, moral\
Obligations; in Ecclefsaffes, the Nature of Things; and in his Song,\
the Contemplation of Things lupernatural. This seems well to agree\
with the Mention in Scripture of the Ged of Abrabam, Hact and Ta-\
 For Abrabams obeying God in all Things thews an Example of\
moral Duries; Iaac\'92 digging Wells and fearching the Depths of the\
Earth, fignifies Thyfies, or natural Philofophy; and Jacet' Dream\
of the Ladder, and the Afcent and Defcent of the Angels thereon, the\
Contemplation of divine Things. Both the Hebrew, Greek and La-\
tin Divines have largely handled this Subject. Even the Elements\
seem to inculcate this Doctrine: For the Earth, Water and Air, by\
their wonderful Conjunction reprefent the different Degrees of the Ser-\
eaces: The Earth and Moifture implying the Hiffory of Things, as \
Teacher of moral Duries: The Waters, diffurbed by the Winds,\
thew the Turmoils happening in human ctions, which Esbies ferve\
toallay; the Air admonithes, that, at length railing the whole Force of\
our Thoughts upwards, we ought continually to contemplare the di-\
vine Nature, call\'92 by the Greeks, Tbheologia, which is the Top and\
Limit of our Underffanding. We fay nothing here of Dialetfica, be-\

and embalm their Memories to Pofferity. Ariffotte, in his  Bock\
of moral Duties, and  Book to Theodat, is of the same Opinion;\

believing, that Man, by Comparifon, may be called, square, or per-\

not liatle to Genare. Ancient Divines reach, that Neab' Ark, which\
God commanded to be built square, fignified the excellent Paftors of\
the Church, by whofe Infiraction, notwithffanding any Snares or He.\
refies, Men were led to eternal Happiness. For Adamantins exhores\

fays, Thes art my Rock. And our Saviour, intimating the Durstion of\
the Church, tays, He will baild it on  Rock. Agreeable whereto is\
the Dream of Nebacbadnezzar, in which he law  great lmage,\
whofe Head was of Gold, Breall and Arms of Silver, Belly and Thighs\
of Brats, and Legs and Feer of Iron and Clay: And that  Stone was\
fut out without Hands, which fmote the lmage and broke it in Pieces,\
which the Wind carried away, to that no Place was found for them;\
and the Stone that fmore the image became  great Mountain, and filt.\

The Palmiree, as having the lower Parts of its Stem thin and Knotty,\
but higher up becoming thick, andagreeablefor its countizual, elegant and\
fpreading Verdure, fignifies, that how abjed foever the Condition of\
the Righreous may be in the Beginning, they at laft gain wonderful\
Beauty in Virtues and good Qualiries. But let me add the Words of\
the pious and learned Lucherins: The Palm-tree, fays he, differs from\
all others, becaute they are thickeff docenwards, and ran tapering uf.\
wards, and with mere pointed Branches; and thefe may be compared\
to Worlalings, who, flighting the beft Things, seek their Satisfaltion or\
ly in the frail and momentary: Thefe Men (pare no Labour or Troubl\
in beaping Ricbes; will even purchase temperal Henours at the Ha\
Lord of their Lrses; but fion at ence wben they are to beftow an Hlows\
Service on their Creator, or to faccear  difiress\'92 Neighbour. Whert\
as, the Pious may rightly be compared to the Palmaree, which, by it\
render Stem, despising carihty Tleafures, exalls its Virines on high, tha\
\
\
Of Still lfe.\
Chap: \
 may adbere to and obey the Will of the Creater. Wherefore tis faid,\
that the Righteous shall grow and bloffom as the Palmtree.\
The Gedar-tree, as yielding excellent and ufeful Fruit, is the Em-\
blem of Mercy and Piety; two Virtues beft becoming the Pillars of\
the Church, who are continually to warch over the left Sheep of the House\
of Ifrael, and to practife Works of Mercy on them, according to St.\
James: Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this.\
to visst the Fatherless and Widows in their Afffictions, and to keep him-\
self unspotted from the Werld.\
We read in the Pfalms, that from the springing Waters of Irael\
comes forth the Praise of the Lord in the Congregation of the Saints. By\
which, Divines underftand the Books of the Law and Prophets, which.\
as Springs of living Waters, lupplied the Ifractites with the Knowledge\
of God, and being fill\'92 with his Spirit, their holy Men compoted\
Hymas to the Glory of his Name. Several Commentators on Scrip-\
ture and illuftrious Inftruments of the Church would fignify, by the\
Poringing Waters the Apolties and firft Teachers; and Eathymins and\
the primitive Fathers, the Preaching of the Golpel. And David, in\
Pf. cv. Cays, He fends the Springs into the Valleys, wbich run among the\
Hills; they give Drink to every Beaft of the Field: Thereby intimaring\
that no Place is to hilly or unattainable, which God' Law cannot pes\
Detralc.\
Writers mention, that the Elephans (who is known to be the mofl\
docible of Quadrupedes, and by Nature fuperior to other Bealts) par-\
cicularly loves Charity and Piery; for as foon as the new Moon en\
lightens the Earth, he purities himfelf in  clear River; and, when\
fick, takes Grass and other Herbage with his Trunk, and Kings it fo-\
wards Heaven, as if he thereby invok\'92 the divine Afliftance in his weak\
Condition.\
Scripture, as remarkably speaking of the Stork, emblematically means.\
 puritied Underffanding and  Mind exalced above worldly Things.\
For this Bird always builds on the Tops of the higheft Houles to lave.\
himself from the Wiles of Beafts; and, after harching his Voung; is.\
at continual War with the Snake, which, always creeping on the\
Ground and into the Holes thereof, is an Emblem of vicious Affec-\
tions. Wherefore, in imitation of the Stort; Men should exalc their\
Minds and feck . Dwelling-place in Heaven, where they wilkbe freed:\
from all the Wiles of the Flethr and the Crafts of the Devil\

 to feed and nurfe the Cock; meaning, that they should feed\
their souls with the Knowledge of divine Things. Wherefore Seerg.\
full of Hope of  fpeedy Union of his immortal\
fes, when dying,\
Part with the Deiry, faid, he was bound in Duty to offer  Cock to\
SEfialspins, meaning the Phytician of the Soul; for, knowing his\
Diffolution was at hand, he believed he should now be cured of all his\
Infirmities. Plaros Followers and Commentators fay, that the Offering\
 Cock implies the Souls Departure for Heaven, to publith for ever\
the Glory and Praife of Phebus.\
By the Alylard:cel are fignified Things, which, from small and\
mean Beginnings, produce Plenty of Fruic. Wherefore our Saviour\
favs, If re have Fate as  Gram of Muttardfeed, &cc. For tho'\
the seed of this Plant be fmall, yet, being duly husbanded in good\
Ground, it rields  Plant turpaffing all others, which, in  thort Time,\
becomes  Tree for Fowls of the Airto build in. And such is the\
Fruitfulnets of Diviniry; which, proceeding from small Seed, foon be\
comes  Tree, the Expantion of whole Branches thades the whole\
Earth, and yields  Place for the Fowls of the Air to lodge in, or,\
according to Hegecius, Mlen taken up with the Contemplation of divine\
Tkings. Other learned Men fay, that this seed implies the wonderful\
Power of God, which, as small and contemptible Seed, lies hid in the\
Reading of Scripture, and is defpited by many for its Tartness; but\
on chewing, frengthens and cleanfes the Stomach, corrects Vapours\
and Humidiries disturbing the Brain, and retines the Taffe, in order to\
our more exalt Search into the Writings of wife Men and divine My.\
Heries. For, according to Herare,\
Rimo alco ferus et, ut non mitescere possit,\
Si mede Cultura fatientem commodat aurem.\
Of,\
The Brears remaining wild we need not fear,\
fter good Learning hus Admiffion there.\
But waving Herace; our Saviour charges us to fearch the Scriptures;\
which fome Diiciples, on  certain Occafion, finding of too Charp and\
difagreeable  Talle, thought too hard, and not to be underffood: Bul\
being prepared with this seed, they will appear berter to us than we\
at firlt expected; difpelling the Darknels of our Underitanding, and\
purging\

  it of all earthly Humidiries and evil Thoughts, till, with Hy-\
far, we, in any Dillrels, difcover the Fountain of living Water in the\
Wilderness of this Life, wherewith to refreth and firengthen our\
chirfty and fainting Souls. Moreover, the Musardfeed coming up\
green and being with Difficulty to be rooted out after Sowing, implies,\
the conflant Rife and Propagation of divine Truchs. And thofe who\
have once tried the agreeable Taffe of the Plant, will never be drawn\
from aling it: This Sprig, having got Root in the Heart, will crow\
and produce Seed, which wild Bealts cannot tread down, Cold or Heat\
wither, or Persecutions extirpate. By the fame Seed is alto fignified,\
 bright and vigilant Soul and an high Underflanding; for they who\
are feized with the Lethargy have their Heads, after Shaving, rubb\'92.\
with it for their Recovery. And thus our circumcifed Hearts are like\
wife, with the Mullard-feed, cleanted from the Lethargy of Sin, for\
Convertion. Pythagergs, once talting  Leaf of this Plant, afterwards\
much admird it, and found that its Spirits flew upwards, as if afcend-\
ing to Heaven; for the Virtue going up the Nofe to the Brain, purges\
it, and clears the Underftanding. Democritus faid, that  few Graims\
of it boild with other Greens made them foft and tender. Let us,\
in like Manner, to mix the emblematick Muftardfeed with our divine\
Thoughts, that, when become tender, they may fead  Steam and\
(weet Savour up to Heaven, where our Souls, united with God, can be\
so more affected with Hunger, Thirff or Drowfiness, but continually.\
employed in prailing the Almighty.\

Triumphal Crowns, and other Rewards of Honeur.\
  learn from Hillory, how noble the ancient Romans were in\
gratifring the Virtue, Valour and Conduct of their Citizens,\
Solfiers and Commanders, belides their ordinary Pay, with Triumphal\
Crowns, Jewels and other Prefents, as an Example to others to tread\
in the same Steps, for the Good of their Country. And we judge\
this Point very proper to be handled next to Still lfe, as it will con\
duce to make the embleratick Sense of  good Piece more perfelt.\
After  Commander had gained either  great Advantage or Viltory\
orer the Enemy, in  Siege, Battle or Sea-fight, he, according to\
Cultom, made an exalt Inquiry, what Perfons had behaved with the\
greateft Valour and Refolution; and then, placing himfelf on  Stage\
raifed for thar Purpote, and returning Thanks to the Gods for the Vic\
fory obtained, he commended the Army in general for their fleady\
Adherence, and each Company in particular which had shewed the great\
off Courage: Then. naming them one after another, he extoll\'92 their\
Valour, ftiling them Friends and Lovers of their Country, and telling\
them how highly ther obliged the Common wealth by their Loyaly\
and brave Behaviour: And thereupon, in the Name of the Senate, he di\
ftribured among them many rich Prefents, confifting of Crowns of Gold\
and Silver, Girdles, Gold Chains, Bracelets, Kings for Ears and Fir\
gers, Armour, Shiclds, Pikes, Swords, Javelins, Standards, fine Horfe\
furniture, and other elegantly wrought warlike Inftruments; which\
hone durff ufe or wear but thofe who had purchafed them in the Manner\
aforefaid. The Romas Story abounds with fuch Occurrences, but especially\
Titus Livins, who relates, that the Conful Papirius Curfor bellowed\
Gold Bracelets among  Men, and afterwards magnificently rewart\
ed  whole Legion. He tells us the tame Things of Scipio, when he\
waged. War in Spain and other Countries. And we read, tha\
LaTAs Antonius, Son of Lucius Fabins Quadiatus, was twice dignitied\
by the Emperor Tiberins, with Gold Ornaments for the Neck and\
ArtIs.\
Bur beides the native Valour and milicary Difcipline, for which the\
ancient Romans were particularly famous, we learn from Pliny and St\
HI Siltlife.\
  that ofcentimes  fingle Perfon by his Virtue and Valour obtained\
all the aforelaid Ornaments; as we fee in Marcus Sergins, who received\
almoll all those Tokens of Honour, and even in the Baules of Tbrass-\
menus and Trebia, and the bloody one at Canns; (in all which, the\
Remans were defeated by Hannibal) he obtain\'92  Civit Crown. Tis\
related of this Sergins, that, having in Battle loff his right Hand, and\
fixed an ironone in its Place, he to managed his left, as, in one Day, to\
day  armed Men one after another; and that in Fights and Skirmithes,\
he had received  Wounds in the Fore-parts of his Body. And yet this\
Man is inferior to Lucins Sicinnias Dentatus, Overfeer of the City of\
Rome; of whom Pliny, Selinus, Valerius Maximus and Aulus Gellins\
unanimoutly report, that his great Merit had gained him, from the Se-\
nate, above  honorary Prefents of all Sorts, and that he  times\
made his Entrance in Triumph with the Generals whom, by his Va\
lour and Conduct, he had affifted in their Conquelts; and that he could\
thew  great Number of Lances and Pikes, uniron\'92, which, as to\
many Tokens of Honour, fell to his Share; as allo,  gold and  Neckornaments,  coflly Horfe-furnitures,  Bracelets,  Crowns,  Caftrenfes,  Mural,  Obfidional, and  know not\
how many Navalor Roffral Crowns. He had received  Wounds, and\
thofe in his Fore-parts only; difarmed the Enemy z times, and fought\
 Bartles. In  Word, he was filed the Roman Acbilles.\
The Crowns, bellow\'92 on Men of particular Merit, had Degrees of\
Dignity, and particular Names fuiting the Nature of the Victories;\
 Corona Obpdionalis, Civica, Triumphalis, Ovalis, Muralis, Navalis\
and Castrensis.\
The Corong Obsidionalis, or Obfidional Crown, was the moft excellent\
of all; for when  Roman Town or Camp, befieged and reduced to\
Extremity, was relieved by  Reman Captain, the Common-wealth\
rewarded the Action in the moft noble Manner, viz. with the afore-\
said Crown and  Triumph. This Crown, tho' made of Grass, was\
accounted of higher Worth than if of Gold and enrich\'92 with precious\
Stones: The Grass was pull\'92 up in the Field of Bartle; wherefore this\
Crown is faid to be facred to Mars, (which Boccatins feems to af-\
firm) poffibly becaute the Grass grows mofly in open Places and\
Fields of Encampment. The great Quintus Fabius was, in Reward of\
his Merit, by the general Confent of the Senace and Roman People,\
honour\'92 with this Crown, when, in the  Panic War, he delivered\
the City from the approaching Ruin and Excremity which Hannibal\
had brought it to. Emilius ucipie had the fame Cifi in Africa, for\
  XI\
Of Stilllife.\
 the Conful Mlanhas and his Forces out of the Power of the\
Enemy. Calpurnias obrain\'92 the fame Honour in Sicity; as did allo\
the incomparable Lycius Sicinmis Dentatus.\
The Corons Civics, or Civic Crown, was given to him who had pre-\
ferved  Roman Citizen from imminent Danger, or releafed from Cap\
Evitr. This Crown was made of Oak Sprigs and Leaves with the\
Frut hanging at it, and, by the General\'92 Order, who gave it to the\
Perton fet ar Liberty, pur on the Deliverer' Head. But tho'  Perfon\
had fived  King or other great Ally of the Romans from falling into\
the Enemies Hands, yer he got not this Crown, which was only due to\
him who had freed  Roman Citizen from Death or Slavery. Pling\
firs, this Crown was allo prefented to him who flew the firft of the\
Exemy befieging  Reman Town. It was the ext in Dignity to the\
Corms OEplionalis, and worn on feveral Occations; especially on the\
great Fellivals and Solemnires; and in the Plays and other publick\
Sports thofe who were honour\'92 with it fat next to the Senate, and, at\
their Entrance, were received by them with all the Marks of Resped.\
Thete Perfons, with their Fathers and Grandfathers, were entirely ex-\
empied from all Charges and Taxes, as having begor Sons to beneticial\
to the Common wealch; they were allo ar Liverry to accept or refule\
publick Offices. Several Romins obtain\'92 this Honour, efpecially the\
aforelaid valiant Lucias Sirinnius Dentatus, who  times gloried in it;\
as Capitelinus did lix. The brave Marcus Sergins likewile received it\
from the Genare, and, in  Word, all thofe, who, in an extraordinary\
Manner, had beneirced the Ciry or Country. The famous Cicere was\
to crown\'92 by  paracular Decree of the Senate, for having happily\
deliver\'92 the City from the imminent Danger of the Catiline Confpiracj.\
Thefe Crowns, tho' feemingly fimple, as being made of Grats and\
Sprigs of Trees, were yet of greater Account than thole of Gold and\
Sewels. They were of Ork, becaute the Acorn was the moft ancient\
Food, and becaute that Tree was facred to Tupiter the Tucclargod\
The Viltors, in the Capiteline Games, inflitured by Domitian, as allo\
Stage-players, Muficians and Poets were likewile crowned with Ort-\
Ieaves.\
The Corons Triumphalis, or Triumphal Crown, was given to the\
General who, having overthrown the Enemy in  pitche Bartle, had\
thereby either faved  Roman Ally, or annexed some Dominion to the\
Common-wealth; wherefore he was alfo introduced into the City in\
Triumph, riding in  gill Chanot drawn by four or, according to fome,\
fix whice Horfes. This Crown was made of Laurel, facred to Apals\
 Stillclise.\
  its Greenness and red Berriss, and fignified, that the Viltory is at-\
cended with much Trouble, Danger and Bloodfhed. Serrys relates,\
that the Soldiers ufed to follow the Charior of the Conqueror, allo\
crowned with Laurel, to purify them, on entring the City, from the\
Blood of the Slain. By the Suffrage of the Senate, the Victors in the\
Wreftting Games were honourd with the fame Crown: And it was an\
ciently given to Meneminent for heroic Poetry and Eloquence: Where\
fore Hefied tays, Tbe Mafes had beflow\'92 on him  Scepter and Crown of\
Lourel. The Roman Priekts and South-fayers likewile crowned them\
felves with Laurel: Even thofe who follow\'92 the Army wore  Sprig\
of it on their Helmets, inflead of  Feather, becaute the Tree was ac\
counted and called by them  fore-telling one.\
The Corona Ovalis, (given to  General, of other prime Perton,\
who had beaten the Enemy with little Refiftance, or, having undertook\
the War without the express Command of the Senate, had gained\
some confiderable Fortrets, Town or Place) was made of Myrcle-\
leaves,  Tree facred to tenus. This Crown denoted, that the War\
was carried on without great Bloodthed; and therefore publick Rejoic-\
ings were made for it, but without much Triumph. When  Victory\
was gained over Slaves, or Pyrates and Robbers, the Victors had the\
same Sort of Crowns, becaute fuch Enemies were judged unworthy of\
feeling the Reman Valour. The principal Generals who obtained this,\
and the triumphal Crown aforelaid,  shall mention among the Tri\
Umphs.\
The Corong Muralis, or Mural Crown, was the Reward of  Sol-\
dier or Officer, who, in affaulcing  Town of the Enemy, firll advanced\
 Ladder, and valiancly mounted the Walls, and made Way for Con-\
quell. This Crown was of Gold, reprefenting the Bartlements of the\
Town wall they had conquerd; or elfe being like that which the\
Poets afcribe to Cybele, the Mother of the Gods, or Mother Earth.\
Round it were engraven Lyons, the Emblems of Valour and Genero-\
fity. Suctonius relates, that common Soldiers received it, as well as\
Captains and Generals, on  publick Tellimony from others, that they\
hill gained the Top of the Enemies Walls. Manlius Capitelinus was.\
according to Pliny, firft honoured with this Crown. And Scipie gave\
it to  Trebellins and Sextas Digitas, on their jointly firft mounting\
the Enemies Walls.\
The Corona Navalis, or Naval Crown, was given to him who, in\
 Sea-engagement, firff entred into an Enemy' Ship, and made him-\
telf Maffer of it. This Crown was allo of Gold, and its Circle fet\
round\

The fame Crown was the Prefent of the ancient Atbenians to thofe\
who firted our Ships of War for the publick Service, or firft landed\
and increnched on the Enemy' Ground.\
The Romans, in Process of Time, placed an Hedge-hog on the Cir\
cle of this Crown, becaufe that Creature' Defence lying in his Skin,\
wherein he rolls himself up, he was effcemed the Emblem of  Sea-\

eaces the Sea, and its Floods.\
The Corona Cafrensss was given, by the chief Commander, to him,\
who, in Battle, firft enter\'92 the Enemy' Camp. This Crown was  Circle, to which were affixed Palifades of the same Metal. They\
alto had it who firlt deffroy\'92 the Palifades of the Enemy, and there.\

great Number of Romans in thofe Times of Valour.\

vileges on thofe who excell\'92 in warlike Archievements, cauling them,\

Chair; as we read of the great Scipie: And, it often happen\'92, fince\
all Things center\'92 in the Voice and Confent of the People, that some\
of the Soldiery were invefted with greater Power and Privileges. All\
Generals, who, by Conquelt, had enlarged the Empire, were allowed\
to fet up their Starues in the Confular Dress. Augytus, to eremize\

Senate, to affign the Children of fuch as fell in Barcle, the liberal\
Enjoyment of the Pay of their deceafed Parents; and to the old and\

himself to attain all the Degrees of Honour by the Hricteff Virtue.\

the Triumphs, by which they honour\'92 and roured the Valour of\
their Heroes\
The Triumph was an Entrance and Welcome of  General, by De-\
cree of the Senate, after an happy Expedition and the Conclution of \
War, whereby, in the moff folemn and pompous Manner, they thew.\
ed him their great Elteem. On the Day of Entry, the Inhabitants of\
all the Towns flock\'92 to Rome, and the whole City, Temples, Streets,\
Gates, Houfes and Windows were hung with all Sorts of coftly Stulls,\
in Gold, Silver, and Silk, and beautifully deckt with great Variety of\
green Branches and Flowers. in  Word, nothing was wanting to\
thew either the Power, Magnificence or Joy of the Romans, on this\
Occation. The Senate, Clergy, Nobility and moft eminent Citizens\
and therefore the greatef Part of Rome) richly dreft, met the Con\
queror without the Towngates. He far in an Ivory Chair, called Se.\
des Curalis, in  Gold Chariot (parkling with precious Scones, and\
drawn either by four or fix whice Horfes magnificently equipt; and\
was drelt in  Garment of Purple and Gold, called Toga Patmars,\
crown\'92 with Lrel, and the Staff of Command in his Hand, or elfe\
 winged lmage of Vittery, holding  Crown of Laurel or  Palm\
branch. Someimes this Figure was placed behind him, holding in its\
right Hand  Crown of Laurel over his Head, as we fee it both Ways\
in the ancient Bassreliefs and Medals. The Prifoners of War, dref\
like Slaves, and with fhorn Heads, and the King or General, with the\
moff eminent of the Vanquith\'92, were led in fercer\'92 Couples before\
the Chariot; which the Roman Legions followed, in Troops or Com\
panies, on Foor and Horfe-back, in their Order, richly arm\'92, and\
with their Pikes and Lances twined with Laurel, as  Token of general\
Joy: But they who had moft fignalized themfelves in Valour, marchd\
on each side of the Charior, with Crowns of Laurel on their Heads,\
and Palm-branches in their Hands. Before the Conqueror went like\
wife fome Carriages laden with the Arms, Banners, Gold and Silver\
Vafes, Jewels and all Sores of Gold and Silver Coin, taken as Booy\
from the Enemy; together with the Gifts and Prefents he had received\
from the Friends and Allies of the Romans. Next came some Callles\
and Towers of Wood, elegantly carved, refembling the Towns and\
Fortreffes gained of the Enemy. In their Pallage, the rmy feigged\
some Battles, in to lively  Manner as thereby to affect the Spectaios\
with all Sorts of Paffions, as Corrow, Joy, and Fright. The Vaney\
of thefe Sights was to great and exceffive as to fpin out the Cavalcade\
for three or four Days; and being arrived at the Capirel, all the Arms\
a Stilthise.\
  Beoty, called Manubia, taken from the Enemy, were hung up and\
depofited in the Temple of Tupiter, as an eternal Mlemoria of the\
Virtue of the Conquerors Here the Senate return\'92 them Thanks for\
the Service done to their Country, and, commonly chuling the Victor\
  Coadjutor in the Government, the Joy concluded with  magnifi-\
cent Entertainment. But, for forming  better Idea of thefe Tri-\
umphs, and the Order therein obferved,  shall, as far as my Mc-\
mory will permit, give fome Examples of them out of the Roman\
Hiffories.\
Plutarch defcribes the Triumph vored to Paulus Emilins, for\
his Viltory over the Great Perfens, King of Macedoma, in this\
Manner.\
Firfl, the People of Rome and the neighbouring Towns, magnifi-\
cently drell, appeard at the Doors and Windows, in the Balconies,\
Carrets and on Tops of Houles, in great Mulcitudes, as Speclators of\
the Soletmnity. All the Temples in Rome, richly adorned, were fet\
open. The Houfes and Streets were wonderfully garnith\'92 with all\
Sorts of collly Hangings and fill\'92 with Greens, Flowers, choice Per-\
fames, and  thouland other fine and delightful Things. And as the\
Concourfe of People was very great, Alen with Staves were appointed\
to make and preferve  Lane or Pallage thro' them, for the March of\
the Triumphers. The firft Day was spent in the Proceltion of the\
Baaners, Standards, Enligns, Statues, Coloffes, Pictures and Figures,\
all placed on Carriages elegantly painted, and flowly driven. The fe-\
cond Day was taken up with the Paffage of the bright Armour of the\
ranquith\'92 King and Macedonians, placed on neat Chariots or Carri-\
ages made for that Purpofe. To thefe fucceeded g Mcn, partly\
carrying the Gold and Silver Coin in  large Silver Dithes and Vales,\
each weighing three Talents, and carried by four Men. The Re-\
mainder of thefe Men bore Fountains and Rately Vafes of Silver, art-\
fully wrought. On the third Day appear\'92 the firft Company, pre-\
ceded by  great Number of Pipers, Drums, Hautboys and Trum\
Pets, making  warlike Mulic as if preparing for an Onfet. Thefe\
were followed by  Cows, deckt with gile Horns and facred Linnen\
Coverings, aid all Sorts of green Garlands wreath\'92 with Flowers, led,\
for Viltims, by beautiful young Men richly dreft, and fucceeded by \
Company of Children carrying Gold and Silver Dithes, for the Ufe of\
the Sacrifice. After thefe, came the Bearers of the Gold Vafes with\
Gold Coin, in Number  followed by feveral great Officers of the\
Aetinue of Antigohus and Seleucus, late Kings of Macedonia, and even\
of\
\
\
Of Stiltlife.\
 XI.\
of Perfeas himself, carrying the exceffive large Gold Veffel, weighing\
ten Talents, and curich\'92 with all Sores of precious Stones and Dis-\
monds, which was made by Emiliss' exprets Order. Next to thefe\
appeard the Body-chariot of the conquer\'92 King, and therein his Coat\
of Arms, Diadem, or Royal Headband, Crown and Scepter. Then\
followed the Children of the unhappy Prince, attended by  great\
Number of his Courtiers, as Stewards, Secretaries and other such Do-\
meftics, weeping and lamenting their Slavery in fuch  Manner as,\
confidering the Vicifficude of human Affairs, to raife Compaftion in the\
Spectators; especially the Sight of the three innocent Children, two\
Sons and  Daughter, who, by Reafon of their tender Age, were in\
tentible of their unhappy Condition. After thefe appeared the Father,\
drell in Black, according to the Cultom of his Country, and walking\
full of Terror and Concern on this Occafion. Next to him came his\
Friends, Favourites, and Confidents, who, fixing their Eyes on him,\
and birterly weeping, mov\'92 many of the Romans themfelves, with\
Tears in their Eyes, to pity both their and the King' forrowful Condi=\
tion. To thefe fucceeded the Gold Crowns which the ancient free Ci\
ties had pretented to the Conqueror, as  Gratulation for his Viltory:\
And then came Enilias himfelf, fitting on  Gold triumphal Charict,\
drelt in  purple Garment richly wrought with Gold, with  Laurel\
branch in his Hand, and  Crown of the fame on his Head. He was\
follow\'92 by the Army, Horfe and Foor, orderly marthall\'92 under their\
proper Erfigae, having Garlands of Laurel and Palmbranches in their\
Hands, and linging Hymns in Praife of the Viltor and Victory. Thus\
Prtius Enilius made his triumphal Entrance into the famous City\
of Rove, whee he offer\'92 the Booty in the Temple of Tupitir\
Capirolinas, and returned the God Thanks for his Viltory and\
Triumph.\
All other Triumphs were manag\'92' much in the same Manner, with\
Abacement of fome Circumftances, according to the Pleafure of the\
General who was honoured with them. And tho' we find the Solem\
nity regulated by Laws, precifely direlting in what Manner, at what\
Time, and thro' what Gates and Streets the Cavalcade was to pats,\
yet, as for the Plays, Shews, and other lets Appurtenances, they were\
leffend or angmented at the Will of the Victor, with  Liberty to\
chufe the Chariot. Hiffory rells us, that the Chariot was commonly\
drawn by four white Horfes; but we alfo find Bulls ufed for the fame\
Purpole. Pompey the Great, having fubdued Africa, made his Eary\
on  Chariot drawn by Elephants. Sucrenins relates, that Tulius C Still life.\
Chap.  criumph\'92 in one with forty Elephants. The Emperor Cordianus\
iumph\'92 in the fame Manner. Caras Marins, having subjected  and extended the Roman Jurifdiction into Egypt, was drawn by the\
same Kind of Bealls. Scipice Africanus triumph\'92 with Elephams fer\
the same Reafon. The Emperor Auguffus, on his victorious Return\
from the Eaff and ending the War with Anthony, was, by Confent of\
the Senate and People of Rome, drawn by four Elephants. The Em-\
peror Vespassan had the fame Honour on finithing feveral great Wars in\
the Eot; the Elephants denoting the Conquelt of Countries, where\
those Creatures breed. Flavins, in his Hiftories, tells us, that the\
Emperor Harelian, who was King of the Gotbs, made his Entrance on\
 Chariot drawn by Stags. But Marcus Antoniss made ufe of tame\
Lions; intimating, that, in the Civil Wars, he would make the moft\
Valiant fubmit to his Commands: Which Cicero in his Orations,\
called Philippica, objects him, faying, that his triumphal Cha-\
riot with Lions implied, an arbtrary Man aiming at Monarr\
CA\
The Roman Generals, when they triumph\'92, had alfo  Cultom of\
carrying one or more young Children in their Chariots; as we garber\
from Cicero' Speech before Mureng. Some uted to be attended with\
 great Number of flrange wild Beafts, as Lions, Bears, Tygers, Rhi-\
noceroles, Panthers, Dromedaries, and tuch like; as Josephas, in his\
Hifories of the Vespasians, mentions. Others had Vocal and infiru-\
mental Mufic and other Diverlions. Among thefe Triumphs, thole\
of Pempey the Great, Cafar, the two Scipic', Brothers, and feveral\
Emperors had fomething lingular; as Blondas, in his Treatife, entituld,\
Rome Triumpbant, largely difcourfes. The triumphins Conquerors\
were likewile allowed to fet up their Starues in Temples and\
publick Places, and to erelt Columns and coftly Structures of Mar-\
ble, called Areus Triumphales, whereon were carved in Balsrelief\
their Bartles and Viftories, for eternal Monuments to Polterity\
Remains whereof we fee to this Day at Rome and elfewhere. Herein\
the Romans imitated the ancient Greefs, who, for  Memorial of great\
Altions, fet up Trephies, made in the following Manner. in the Place\
of Victory, they fixed the highelt Tree to be found in the Neighbour-\
hood, and then, chopping off the Branches, they, in Honour to the\
Viltor, hung, on the remaining Limbs, the Arms of the Vanquith\'92;\
calling that Tree, Trephaum, from the Greet Word Tropi, which fig.\
nifies, Overthrow, Flight and giving way; becaute the Enemies were,\
in that Place, put to Flight. The Romans afterwards made ufe of\
No.  Still lifs.\

them for the fame Pixpole; for Salluffins in his Memeirs relates\
chat Porgey, having conquer\'92 the Ipaniards, planted his Trophies on\
the Tops of the higheft Pjresces. And this Cullom afterwards grew\
into fuch Effcem, that they were made of Stone. But, according to\
Scripture, the Ulage was very ancient among other Narions; for it\
appears in Chap.  of  Sam that Saul, having vanquih\'92 Ayag, King\
of the Imalckires, and, being come to Mount Carmel, fer up an Arcus\
Tikmpbslis, or Place. in  Word, the Honour of Triumphing was\
accounted by the Romans as  Token of the higheft Efteem; and there.\
fore, to obtain, it, their Generals (pared for no Toils or Dangers in\
Warlike Archievements: Add to this, the Riches commonly arnting\
from fixh Glory by the Prefents made them by the Allies and the\
Boory of the Enemy. In my Opinion, Hifforians have defcribed this\
Matter to circumftancially, on purpote to put Princes and Governours\
in mind of rewarding the Deferts of their Generals, Soldiers and\
Rien of Merit, and thar the Unskilful, Cowardly and unfit for Com\
mand might not be ranged with thote who willingly facrificed their\
Fortunss, Capacities and Bodily Labours to the Bencht of their Coun\
Irv. ccording to Punlas Orces gro Perions have been honourd\
with the Romin Triumph, of whom the Emperor Probur, in whole\

that he refolved to make  Sort of one furpaffing it in Magnificen:.\
To which end, he cauted Proclamation to be made throughout his\
Kingdom, that, at  certain Time, he would at Duptnes hold  grand\
 Lacommon Tournament: Which Curioficy drew our of Greece and\

Caralcaue was in the following Mlanner.\

 TFraians and gess Gulltians, follow\'92 by  vall Number of\
other Nations, called, for their Silver Shields,  pyressides. After\
theie came  Ranks of Sword-plavers, called, by the Romins,  and then  Knights, with Chaplets of Gold abour their\
Heads, and their Hories cortly equipt with old embroider\'92 Houlings\
and gold and filver Bridles. Thefe were followed by  other\
Knights, called Companions, affociated with fome of the King' Frieed\
and Conidents. Then appeared  Noblemen on Foot, and ate\

CMaP.   other Knights, called the King' Troops. Next came\
 Knights in gold Armour, over which they had Coats of Ar-\
mourrichiy embroider\'92 with Gold and Silver, and artfully adorned with\
allforts of Animals. To thefe fucceeded  Chariots, each drawn by\
fix Horfes, follow\'92 by\
 others, each with  After thefe appear\'92 \
Chariot with Elephants, followed by  of the fame Kind of Creatures,\
and thofe by Soo Boys, having Garlands and Crowns ornamented with\
Gold in their Hands. Next came  fat Oxen with  Indian\
Elephants Teeth. After thefe were carried an infinite Number of Idols\
and Figures of deceafed Perfons who had been famousfor Artsand Sciences,\
dreft in gold and filver Stuffs adorned with precious Stones, with their\
Names, Dignities and Actions written on the Pedeftals. Then came\
Slaves bearing Idols, reprefenting Night and Morning, Midday and\
Evening, and an intinice Number of gold and filver Veffels of great Value.\
Next appear\'92  of the King' Pages dreft in gold Stufts, follow\'92\
by  Ladies carrying gold Boxes fill\'92 with all manner of rich Per-\
fumes and odoriferous Balm, and thefe by  Sedans of maffy Silver\
carrying as many Ladies, and thofe by  gold Sedans with Ladies\
dreft in Gold, Silver and Jewels. The Streets abounded with all forts of\
rich Oils, Balms and Perfumes. This Cavalcade latted thirty Days\
fucceffively, attended with Plays, Tourniments and Shews; during\
which Time, every Perion, after perfuming himself, was allowed to\
fit at the Royal Tables, rgoo in Number, and to feaft at the King'\
Expence. To proceed to the Romans.\
Another Solemnity obtain\'92 among them, call\'92 Oratio; which was\
inferior to the Triumph in fome of its Requifires: For inftance, if\
the Viltor was not of Confular or Proconfular Dignity, or had met\
with little Refiffance from the Enemy, or gain\'92 the Victory without\
great Blood-thed, or had overcome People of small Worth, or (as we\
said, speaking of the Corona Ovalis) when the War was undertaken\
without the express Command of the Senate, Cc. in fuch Cafes, the\
Viltors were folemaly welcom\'92 with the Overio, in the following\
Manner.\
The General enter\'92 the City on horfe-back, or, as anciently, on\
foot, crown\'92 with Myrle, ( Tree facred to Fenus) becaute the Vic-\
tory was gain\'92 not in  Martial, but in  Manner becoming that\
Goddess and Women, as Aulus Gellins fays; and the Troops in their\
Proceffion appear\'92 not in Arms, and, inflead of Drums, Trumpets and\
other Warlike Inftruments, their Mulic was Flutes and other fofe\
Sounds. The General entered with the Booty in an orderly Manner,\
   XI.\
Of Stillife.\
 by his Army, and the Senace folesinly received him without\
the City-gares, highly commending his Altions. Hiffories tell us, that\
feveral great Generals fued for and accepted this Honour. The firff\
was Paftamiss Libertus, on his having fubdued the Sabises, and next\
Marcus Marcellss after the Conquett of Syracuse. Suctonins relates,\
that Augytiss, after the Barcle of Pbilippi, and on finithing the Warin\
Sicify, obtained that Honour. And Pliny fays, that feveral Generals,\
denied by the Senate, the Honour of the great Triumph, were decreed\
the Oratre; which was to called, from the General' offering  Sheep,\
in Laun Ovis, when he came to the Capitol, inflead of  Bull, facrit\
ced in the Great Trrumph. Others think the Word is derived from\
the Shours of the People, who ufed to cry, OcI or elfe Ove! Whatever\
the Truch is, this folemn Entrance was always call\'92, by the Remans,\
Oratio.\
Other Tnumphs of thofe People  shall, for Brevity, omit (peaking\
of. He who wants further information, may read Appianus Atexan-\
drinus and Ammianus Marcellinus, the former defcribing the Triumph\
of Scipie Africanns, and the latter that of the Emperor Consfar\

GGrecian Games, and to whose Henour infituted.\
HE Anriquity and Manners of the Grecian-Games being some\
what unknown to many curious Arcifts,  think it will be ac\
ceptable to give  fhort Description (as well as  can) of the four prin\
cipal Games to highly and to ofcen excolled by the Greek and Roman\
Writers\
The firfl and principal were called the Olympic Games, held near\
the City Olynfia, in the Province of Elis, and inftituted in Honour of\
Tupiter Olmpins, by the Idaan Hercules and his four Brothers, Paoncus,\
Idas, Tafus and Epimedes, meeting together from Mount lda in Cun\
dis, and, being five Brethren, they were fliled the Idaan Dactyl.\
Thefe Cames being celebrated every five Vears with great Solemnty,\
the Ancients therefore reckon\'92 their Time by Otympiads, thereby\
underftanding  Period of five Vears. They confitted of five forts of\
Exercifes, viz. Running, Wrefiling, Boxing, Throwing the Coit and\
Leapins\
\
\
Of Stilllife.\
  The Place of Exercife was fenced in with Pales,: and po.\
Speltacor was fuffer\'92 to come within it.\
Some pretend, thefe Games were infliruced by Tapiter, after he had\
deflroyed the Giants who attempted to fform Heaven; and that Apello\
oot the Preference in our running Mercury; that Mars bore away the\
Prize in Wrelling, Boxing, Coc. Others prove, that each of the\
aforefaid Brethren invented his Game and Exercife, and that, being five\
in Number, they were, from the five Fingers, named Dactyls, Duity.\
 in Greek, fignifying  Finger.\
The Greeks called thefe five Exercifes Pentatblen; and the Latins,\
Quinquertium. Two of them had  Dependance on the Legs, viz.\
Running and Leaping; two on the Arms, as the Coils and Boxing, and\
the Wreltling respected both Arms and Legs. The Victor, in all the\
five Exercifes, was, by the Greeks, called Pancratiaffes;  Word com-\
pounded of Pan and Krates, fignifying,  bellowing the whole Force\
of the Body. In Boxing, all Advantages might be taken for overcom=\
ing the Antagonift; and the Prize was adjudged to him who gained his\
Point moft dextrouly. Accordingly, they truck with Fifts and El.\
bows, Kick\'92, bit, ferarch\'92 and (prain\'92 the Kingers, Hands and other.\
Parts of the Body. They even endeavour\'92 to thrull out each others\
Eyes with their Thumbs.. in Chort,, no Artifice was omitted for gain:.\
ing the Victory.\
We shall briefly relate in what Manner the aforelaid five Exercifes\
ere performed.\
The Circus, wherein they ran on foot, was originally  Stadium,.\
or  Geometrical Feet in Length: But, in the  Olympiad, they\
doubled it. This Race was at firff on foot, and in  light Dref\
but afterwards on horle-back, and in Armour. Men, called Runners.\
this Exercife\
on foot, were alfo admitted armed from Top to Toe;\
being judged very proper for the Bodies of Warriors. The firft Vic-\
for herein was Demaratus of Hereg: And the Hymas fing in their\
Honour, fufficiently teflify their running in Armour. But the firtt,,\
who got the Prize in running without Armour, was Chorabus, of Elis.\
after  long Contell with him about it.. Arrachion, of Phigalia. ob-\
tained the Prize in the second and third Exercifes; and Potyerates, of\
Moffene,  Man of noble Extraction, got much Honour and Glory in\
 fourth;, wherein he was Viltor.\
The Wreting was undertaken after the Body had been thoroughly\
anointed with Ayl, in order to prevent  Cripe, and then daubed with.\
fine Duft, to dry the Sweat.. Thus prepared, the Wreftlers entered.\
the Lifts, and began with feizing the Hands, then the rms and Body\
under.\
\
\
Of Still Rfd.\
 XI\
under the thort Ribs, Cor. Thus endeavouring, by various Mechods of\
Strength and Dexterity, in Kicking, puthing, and other Tricks, to\
Hing one another on their Backs; for  Fall on the Belly weat for\
nothing. Before they encerd the King they cauted their Parts to be\
foundly rubb\'92, to make them more fupple and agile.\
Boxing, and fighting with Slings were the moft dangerous Exercifes\
The former was ancrently performed with Ox-leather Thongs tied\
about the Hands, by which, with wonderful Activity, they dealt each\
other very hard Blows. But the Slings confifted of small Lea.\
therttraps, armed ar the Ends with little leaden Balls, the Blow\
whereof, when it happen\'92 on the Head, lay\'92 the Adverlary\
dead.\
The Coit was  flat, round, heavy Piece of Stone or Lead, to try\
the Force of Arms and Hands, and to fee who could fling higheft and\
furtheit: An Exercife Htill in Ufe, in many Places, to this Day; but\
with this Difference, that the Ancients, with  Leg lifted up, threw\
the Coir ar  Mark, fet up on  small Pyramid, and refembling \
Pine-apple.\
The titth Exercife was lets perilous, as confifting only of divers\
Miahnners of Leaping.\
The ancient Garlands or Crowns, given as  Prize to the Viltoron\
theic Occaions, were made of Olive-leaves; but they varied according\
to the Times; for they were afterwards compoted of Couch -grats,\
Willow, Laurel, Myrle, Oak, Palm and wild Parlley-leaves; as\
Piatarch, in the Lifs of Cuts Uricents, relates. But when made of\
Olive-leaves, they chole  felect Kind, called Calliffepbanes, . . be.\
fifst Crown, having hanging Branches, like the Myrcle, very proper\
for twiling Garlands. The Leaves of fuch Garland differed much\
from others, in that, being white withour, the Green, when twilled,\
was inward; whereas the others were white within, and appeared greed\
withour. Herexies and his Brethren firft brought this Plant into\
Greece from the Northern Countries, as Punfunias, in his Olsmpus, tells\
us.\
The Pyttian Gumes were inftituted long before the Uphmian, yet aftee\
the Obmbic, and celebrated in Honour of Apollo, for his Victory orer\
the frightful Serpent Pyrton. Some think they were to called,\
from Pyrbss, the Place of Celebration, or elfe from the Greek Word\
Pyrbelar, to confult; becaute they confulted there the Oracle, in order\
to know the Events of Things to come. The Exercifes in thefe Games\
only differed from the Ohmpic in this, that the Pythian were per\
formel\
\
\
 Still life.\
Chap:  under the Sound of all Sorts of Vocal and Inftrumental Malx.\
Thote Games, from time to time, had feveral Alteraciens in Form.\
and Solemnity, after the inlicution of the Pancretium or Quinquertium:\
And it is related, that in the firtt & Pyrhiades, wherein the moft illuf\
vious Hferoes and Gods of the Ancients enter\'92 the Lifts, for the Sake\
of the Prize; Gaffer prevail\'92 in the Horferace; Pollux in Boxing;\
Calais in Running on foot; Zetbes in Running in complete Armour;\
Peleas in Throwing the Coit; Telamen in Wreftling; and Hercules\
in the Pancratium, or, all the Games.\
in each of thefe Games and Exercifes, the Victors were crowned\
with Laurel, which in particular was confecrared to them; becaute the\
Ancients believed, by what they have feigned of Penens' Daughter,\
with whom spotfo was to much enamour\'92, and who was metamor-\
phiz\'92 into that Tree, that the God took  fingular Delight in it.\
But others will have the inflitution of the Pythian Games to be long\
before Apollo' Amour with the beautiful Daphne: And before the\
Laurel bore that Dillinction, both the Triumphal and Victors Crowns\
and Garlands were made of Paim or Oak-leaves; as Orid, in his Firft\
Book of Mctamerphesss, teftifies. Plutarch and Punsanmas relate, that\
Thefeus, on his Return from Creta, adorned the Victors, in the Games\
inflituted in Honour of Apollo, with Garlands of Palm, as Tokens of\
Praife and Renown; for the Laurel was not known ill after the Pyrhian\
Games were fertled, and when known, it gave the Rife to the aforefaid.\
Fable of Dupbne; and both the Tree and Leaves being found of to ex\
traordinary  Make and Nature, illurious Victors and Men of Learning\
were commonly crowned with it. Some again fay, that Apolle affected\
the Leaves and Bloffoms of the Apple-tree, before he chofe the Law-\
rel, and therefore the Viltors in Running, Wreilling, Cc. ought to be\
crowned with that; as the Poet Archias, in his Aythelog. lib. . cap.\
 relates. But Lucimas afferts, that tho', in the Pythiun Games, the\
Garlands of Laurel began to prevail, yet they were intermixt with\
fine yellow Apples: Some Writers even affirm, that the Laurel of\
Delphos bore fuch large Berries or Fruit, as almoff to gain the Name\
of Apples. But the true Reafon of this Difference proceeded from the\
fererar Alteracions made both in the Prizes and Times of holding\
thofe Games; for originally they were celebrated every. mingb Vear\
from the Number of Nymphsfeigned, by the Ancients, to come from.\
Mount Parnasfus, to offer to Apelle on his having overcome the Del.\
Phic Montter Python) and afterwards every psth.\

mory of frebemoras, otherwife call\'92 Opbeltes, Son of Lycurgus, on\
account of his being kill\'92 by  Serpent in this Wood. Which Ac-\
cident fome relare thus: Oedigns, having, thro' Miltake, married his\
own Mother, the Widow of Lains King of Tbebes, begat on her two\
Sons, Freocles and Polnices, to whom he refigned the Royal Dignity,\
on condition they govern\'92 by turns: But Ereocles, as the Eldell, having\
obrain\'92 the firff Vears Adminitration, refus\'92' to admit his Brother as\
 Parrner to govern the fecond Vear, who thereupon, in Difcontent,\
follicuing the Aid of Adrafius, King of Arges, whofe Daughter, call\'92\
Argis, he married, the King, in Conjunction with his other Son-\
in law, Tydeas, raifed  great Army, in order to wage War with the\
Thebans, and bring them to Reaton. The Iffue of this War was,\
the Death of the two Brothers in  Duel; and their Bodies, according to\
Cutom, beinglaid on  large Pile of Wood to be burnt, the Flames hap.\
pen\'92 to divide and feparate, as if they bore Witness of the immorial\
Hatred of the two Brethren in their Life times, which ceafed not with\
their Deaths Now in the rmy, which Adraffus fent to Polynices'\
Affirtance, were feven Commanders, who, being arrived in the Iland\
Lemnes, pertaining to  bracis, and feized with an extream Thirfl, met\
Hipppjle, carrying, in her Arms, the Child Oppettes, Son of Lycurgus\
(Prieft of Tuoner) and Kuridice, whom, being  Native of that Coun\
try, they increated to thew them where to get fome Water. Where\
upon the, in hatle, yer fearful of laying the Child on the Ground, as\
forbidden by the Oracle, before he could walk, fet him naked on the\
Grats by  large Plant of wild Parlley, near  Fountain, where  Ser\
pent, lying perdue, fuddenly wound itfelf about the Childs Neck,\
and throtuled him, while the was gone to draw Water. The Com\
manders, being apprifed of this unhappy ccident, Kill\'92 the Serpent,\
and, to folace the Father, inflituted, in Honour of his Son to fuddenly\
loll, the aforefaid Games, to be held every chird Vear: Wherefore\
originally only Soldiers and their Defcendants were admitted to them,\
tho', in procets of Time, they were free for every Perfon. Theagenes,\
in his Memoirs of Egina, Book  Chap.  relates, that Hipppile\
fied from Lemnes to Nemal, on account of  Combination among the\
Women, to Kill all the Men, only our of Jealouty, becaute, by the\
Inligation of Venus, highly incens\'92 againft them, they had had to do\
with other Women. Accordingly they all put their Defign in Praltice,\

Chap  him in  Bakers Trough. (This happen\'92 foon after the Departure\
of the Argenents, and their rrival in this Ifland.) But being difco-\
vered, they flung him, with the Trough, into the Sea, and condemned\
Hipppyle to die, for not agreeing to their general Refolution. She,\
hearing this, made her Elcape, but, in her Flight, was taken by Pi-\
 and fold for  Slave to Lycurgus, whofe Wife, Euridice, defirire\
the might be put to Death, for the Misforcune of her Child, the hid\
herfelf in  remote and folitary Place; where being difcovered, by the\
Southlayer Amphiaraus, to the two Sons of Euridice, Theas and Kunoe-\
ts, who made diligent Search after her, the was, thro' their intercef-\
fion, and the Commanders Tellimony of her Innocence, pardon\'92, and\
readmitted into Favour. Others will have it, that Hercales inflituted\
thefe Games, on having killed, in the Wood Nemaa,  terrible Lyon\
who devoured all before him, and lay\'92 the Country walle. Some lay,\
they were fet up in Honour and Memory of Archemoras; but that Her-\
cales, after having flain the emaan Lyon, with whofe Skin he cover\'92\
his Head and Body, brought them under  Regulation, and dedicated\
them to Tapiter; appointing their Solemnization to be every three\
Vears, on the  Day of the Month, called, by the Corinthians, Pa-\
Mmes, and, by the Athenians, Boedromies, antwering our Month of\
Angut: And the rather, as Tbefeus had, in that Month, happily van-\
quittd the Amazons. Bur others are of Opinion, that it was done in\
Memory of Opbettes, who, by his own Death, prefaged the Fare of\
the Lacedemomans, at War with the Thebans. Vet some think, that\
this was another Opbelfes, Son of Expbetas and Creufa, who, being laid\
on the Ground by his Nurfe, while the went to thew some Commanders\
 Fountain, was killed by  Serpent.\
The Nemaan Games were therefore inflituted in Memory and Confo-\
lation of Lycurgus, Enridice and Opbeltes, and the Judges, who deter-\
mined the Prizes, were dreft in black and mourning Garments. For\
Oppettes was afterwards called Archemorus, becaute Amphiarans had,\
at his Birth, prefaged him an early and untimely Death; Archo figni-\
lying, in Greek, Beginning, and Moros, Death; as if they faid\
Ding Bortly after his Birth: in which Sente (peaks the Poct,\
Nascentes merimur, Finifque ab Origine pendet;\
That is, We begin dyingfrom our Births, and our Beginnings and Ends\
have an inseparable Umon.\
The Exercifes in thefe Games were the same as in the others: But\
the Victors were crowned with\
green Parfley, moftly ufed in Fune\
rals, to perpetuate the Memory\
of Archenerys. Whether the Greek\

\
Schnrn, with us, common Parfley, and the Petroselinon, or Stone parsley,\
be the tame, let Botanifts decermine. Originally, the Victors in thefe\
Cdime were crowned with Garlands of Olives; but after the Defeat of\
the Las they began to be prefented with one of wild Parfley, in\
ifemery of thots who were flam in that bloody Bartle: And after this\
Regilarion, the faid Herb, inflead of crowning the Head on Occations\
of prful Meetings, ferv\'92 only in Times of Sorrow and Mourning.\
For, according to the Greek Saying, this Herb is very earchj, as\
ipreiding  long Time over the Ground, and often bearing to be dug\
ip, in order to get deeper Roor. The feed of it alfo, on lowing, is\
\
lo.., than others in coming up; wherefore it was as neceffary, thit\
the morral Greet Ofeckres, atterwards (as we have faid, called hois.\
MTHis would be crowned with earthly Honour. For of the four prin\'ac\
cipil Games, which we handle in this Chapter, two, according to\
the Poet  are lacred to Mortals, and the others to Denies:\
The Moreals are frccenor is and Arclicerts, who is alfo called Fule-\
  and the Gods are Tugiter and Apolte. The wild Parlley is not\
without Reaion appropriated to thefe Games; becaute some think it\
foang from the Blood of the Child, killed by the serpent: fet this\
contradicts thoie who far, that Hipppite laid the Child on this Plant;\
which therefore was already known at that Time. We shall now pro-\
cxel to the  iai Gumrs.\
This Solemnity was performed at Night, in the Lihmus of Cerizs,\
Parting Ltris from the Contnent of Greece; and had rather the face\
of  Stertnce and iis Mifteries, than of  Feltiral. It was intlitured\
by SirfEis, Son of Eoles, on his finding there on the Ground, the\

Chap:  with the other Child Melicerts, to the Mountains Geranes, fi-\
tuated between Megara and Corintb. But the, finally, alfo yielding to\
Rage, caff herfelf, with the Child, from the Rock Moluris, into the\
Sea; where the was metamorpholed into  Sea-nymph, and called\
Lencothea, and he into  Sea-god, under the Name of Palamon. The\
dead Body of Melicerts being afterwards brought on Shore by  Dol-\
phin, Sippbus, King of Corinmb, who was his Uncle, commanded\
him to be buried in the Wphoms, and  Circus to be there erected, for\
the Celebration of the aforefaid Games.\
But the Poet Archias fays, that on lnos flinging herfelf, with Mich-\
cits, into the Sea,  Dolphin landed their Bodies on the Schamentian\
Shore, where Amphimachus and Denacinus took them up and brought\
them to Sippphus, King of Corinth; and then they were deified, the\
by the Name of Lencothed, which in Greek fignifies, the white Goddess,\
and he by that of Palamon.\
Lencothea, called, by the Latins, Mruta, is Day-break; and Pa-\
lamen, or Portunus, the Vebemence of Storms and Billows: For pallein,\
in Greck, lignities, to tess, move, and puss violently against each other;\
whence comes the Name of Palamon: He was the Son of Matata,\
of Morning, becaufe the Winds commonly begin to arife with Day-\
break.\
Others tell us, that Melicerta' dead Body being call on the Shore of\
the Wphmas, and lying unburied, it cauted  great Plague; and\
that, on confulting the Oracle; touching the Crufe of the Infec-\
tion, antwer was made, that Afehcerts ought to have  magnificent\
Funeral, and folemn Races and Games should be appointed in his Ho-\
Bour and Memory. The Corinthians obeyed, and the Body was ac-\
cordingly taken up by Amphimachus and Donacinus, and in an honour-\
able Manner bursed in the Place aforelaid; and the Games and Fu-\
heral Rices being inflitured, the Plague ceafed: But afterwards it broke\
out afreth on their Omiffion of the Solemnity; wherefore, in this their\
Mimoll Difiress, the People, re confulting the Oracle, were told, they\
mull for ever celebrate the Games they had begun in Mlemory of Mc-\
lierts, and diftribute the Rewards to the Victors. But Alusans, de-\
Cribing thefe Cames, fays, that the Cultom was to perform, every\
his Years, two Sorts of Games and Races in the Ipamus; one in\
Honour of Niptane, near his Temple; and the other in Memory of\
Pelicerta.\
The Prize in the Libmian Games was originally  Crown of Parfley,\
elegantly wreathed; but afterwards,  Garland of Pine-leaves, on\

curn, with  Palmbranch, as Paufanias fays. Morcover, the Conque.\
fors at fuch Times were to much honour\'92, as to be met by their\
Fellow-citizens, and brought fome Miles upon their Shoulders. They\
mide not their Entrance thro' the common Gates, like other People,\
but triumphanly over  ftacely Bridge or Paltage, made over the\
Walls for that Purpofe, and their Names were cut on Pillars\
fet up in the public Places of the Town, to perpecuate their Me.\
mories\
We shall, to conclude this Chapter, fubjoin  thort Description\
of some particular Garlands or Crowns, lacred to the Heatheniss\
Deities.\
The Phenicians, as Eufebius ceftifies, honour\'92 and worhipp\'92 the\
Herbs and Plints. The Greeks, in imitation of them, render\'92 almof\
the fame Duries, not only to Trees, but alfo to Herbs and Flowers.\
Thefe maintain\'92, that the Charites, or three Graces, were the very\
tird Crowners of Punfors. Pherecydes fays, that Saturn was crowned\
before any others. Ver, according to Drodorus, Tupiter claims this\
Honour, for his Conquelt over the Giants. But, not to pretermit the\
Egigtian Monuments, Ifs firft crowned herfelf with green Sprigs and\
Eirs of Corn; of which, according to the Egyptian Writer, Leen, the\
was the Inventor.\
The Ost and its Fruit, as Apolledorus writes, were facred to the\
Goddels Rbes, otherwife called, the Earth; that Martals, who pro-\
ceed from it, might wear the Badges of their univerfal Mother. The\
same Tres was alto peculiar to Tupiter, the tucelar God.\
The Pine and its Fruit were confecrated to the Goddefs Cybele, whom\
the Ancients believed to be the Mother of all Things; becaute the,\
carefully containing the Seedoriginally given her, does, by the Warmth\
of the Sun, yearly bring forth new Shoots. The Pine apple, in its\
Shape, allo refembles  rifing Flame, and keeps its Seed in small and\
teparate Cells, which, by the Earth' Heat, in time (prings up\
and grows. We likewife fee  certain Medal, with the Head of\
Cbele on one Side, and  fmall Garland of Pine-turgs on the other,\
and intcribed EMTPNALAN, . . those of Smyrns. The Arcadians,\
believing Pan to be the God of the Univerfe, dedicated the Pine-appe\
to him allo.\
Saturn, Tupiter, Apolle and Esculapins were crowned with Laured:\
Satarn, as the God of Triumphs; Tupiter, for his Viltory over the\
Giants\
\
\
Of Stilllise.\
  polle, for the Love of Daphne, metamorphos' into that\
Tree; tho' before, the Ralm was facred to him, on his killing the Def\
phic Dragon; but tscalapins wears it for no other Reafon, than that\
it is ufetul for feveral Remedies.\
The ancient Romans, on their None Caprotina, or Feftivals Kept\
monthly, in Honour of Tane, crowned that Goddess with Fig-leaves,\
as  Memorial of the City of Rome (reduced to the urmoff Extremity\
by the Gaals, who demanded of the Senate feveral noble Virgins as\
Hollages) regaining its Freedom by the Contrivance of the Virgin Pbi-\
lotis, who thewing the Romans how to flide down from the Walls,\
by the Branches of  Fig-tree growing thereon, and facred to June,\
gave them an Opportunity of falling on the Enemy when drunk and\
alleep (which the had cunningly inticed them to) and, by  great\
Slaughter, to obtain  compleat Victory over them. The Pemegra-\
nate was conlecrated to June by the People of Mycenc. The white\
Lilly is alfo facred to her; and therefore called Fles Tunonius, or, ac\
cording to fome, Fles Regalis; not to much out of Respect to the Qucen\
or Goddefs, but becaute that Flower almoff furpalfes all others in\
Height.\
Minerva, who is faid to be  Virgin, rightfully laid Claim to\
the Olivetree, which affects Purity and Challity, as well as the.\
 find no Trees particularly facred to Mars; but it is notorious,\
that the Herb commonly call\'92 Dogsgrass is appropriated to.\
him.\
They, who are converfant with the Poets, know, that the Myrile-\
free fignities Delight and  Mind richly endow\'92. The Ancients fay,\
that Tree furpaffes all others in tender and beautiful Leaves, and their\
continual Greennets and Smell; which recommends it to tenus, the\
moft beautiful, moft tender and moft perfect of the Goddeffes. In old\
Times, Men, on Fellival-days, ufed to put into each others Hands;\
Branches of this Tree, as Tokens of Joy, and that they should join\
in Cherus. And Herace fays, that, in Lent-time, cben the Earth, by\
her Variety of Flowers, seems to rejoice, we ought to adorn our Heads\
with wreathed Myrtle. The Apple-tree lignifying Love, is allo facred\
to Venus. And the Ears of Corn to Geres.\
The lry, dedicated to Bacchus, was in great Efteemamong the Egyp-\
lians, for being always green, and not thedding irs Leaves rill after\
Harvell. They moftly uled it in Garlands; and the Kind bearing black\
Berries was etpecially confecrated to Bacchas, who, by. that People,\
is called Ofiis, and from whence this Green allo borrows ir' Name;\
for.\
\
\
Of Stilllife.\
Book XI\
 they called it Chenetris, . . the Plant of Offris. And Dienisus,\
which is likewife the Name of Bacchas) having carried his Viltories\
into Indis, built there Ryfa,  large Town, and planted it round with,\
. to perpetuate his Memory. This Plant was facred to Bacchus,\
 becaute he as well as Phobas is always reprefented youthful; or\
\
tha. the Tongue and Spiries of Father Liber are tied up, as the fry.\
\
Cackes aold of any thing that it comes at : For tho' Horace lays, that\
to Drs:varl is, in his Cups, free from all Care, even the greatet Po-\
cir, ret rs as true, that the :quor captivates the Senfes, taking\
away all Power of Judging. The fame Plant is likewife an Emblem\
of Ao: ro: only for its growing morlly near old Trees, Buldings and\
\
RLas,  allo as Wine, which is old and work\'92 off, is highly\
 Wherefore Pintaras as well as Horare moftly extol it. The\
Ii. as allo facred to Burchks; accordingly, he is often reprefented\
cround with the Tw:gs thereof: Tho' after his Conqueft of Tades, he\
likewle wore Lrare:; for be, as well as Satain, is accounted the God\
of Triazg:. The fine was allo peculiar to Kbes. And the Crown.\
of irs Tu gs, which adorns the Head of Hecure, implies only, the\
Subrilzes anl Snares which Father Funnus, by the Operations of Wine\
ieiling Mer to extravagencies) laid for his Daughter.\
TheGzergs is iacred to Plare, God of Hell; and of the Sprigs and\
Leaves of it the Ancients made Garlands. Irs richor\'92  mournful\
Tree, and proper for Places of Burnal, becaute, when once cut, it\
Rhoots no more. Its Branches, fet in the Ground near Tombs, or carved\
on them, lignife, that the Deceated endeavoured, by Prayers, to be\
recteriled ro the Inferral Geds: Wherefore, horace lays, Aien aie at\
tenled to Hill by no ofker Tree than the unhappy and batefull Cpress.\
Plaiss Crown is allo compoted of the Herb Adranthum, otherwife calld\
Cafilli Tececis. Some have crown\'92 him with Narciffus Flowers and\
their Leaves;  Flower proper for deceated Perfons, on account of the\
unhappy End of the Vouth who was transform\'92 into it: Wherefore\
PEMREs lays, that the Hellish Furies, Afecte, Tisphne and Alegerd,\
had Garlands of the Jume Flower about their Heads, as Servants and\
Executioners of the Commands of Plaro. The Pinetree has muh\
Agreement with the Cifreis, in being allo the Emblem of Death; for,\
when once cut, like the Ciprogs, it never thoors out again; wherefore,\
and for it' Bixterness and Sharpnels, the Pine-apple, both in ancient and\
modern Acceptation, fignifies Denth.\
The dabk cokar\'92 Pephir was facred to Hercules; becaute Naturs\
the tit\
lifts, by this Heroe and the two Colours of that Tree, imply,\
difere\

Chap:  Times which fungrintend and govern all Things; for one of the\
Colours, being White, fifhifies the Day, and the other which is Dark,\
the Night. Some have alfo rank\'92 the Poplar in the Number of un-\
happy Trees; for, in the lffe of Rbodes, the Funeral games in Honour of\
Ttepolemus were celebrated, and the Performers of them crown\'92\
with it.\
The Peachtree was facred to Ifs and to Harpocrates: The Plane-\
tree to the Genii: And  Garland of Flowers to Ariadne. The Ruccha-\
nats, in celebrating the Vine-featt of Bucchus, were coif\'92 with\
GrEEns.\

due Regard to their Warlike Accoutrements, Dreffes and Man-\

as appears by their Works, who, on beter Confideration and greater\
Experience, have afterwards correded their Errors. But  mean not,\
by expoting the Miftakes of other Men, to palliate my own;  have\
had my Faults as well, and perhaps greater than they;  am fentible,\

General, and the Scabbard by his Side has no Tie of Girdle about his\
Body. How can he ule the sword, when, with one Hand, he holds\
the Reins of the Horfes? Thefe things are very improper and unna=\
rural: Bet perkaps his Inducement was, that he might thew the beay.\
tirul Body of the Heroe with greater Advantage. In the latt Place,\
the Town walls appear fo low as to be eafily reach\'92 oyer.\
Poyfin likewile, in the Print of the Death of Germanicus, has inter-\
mixt Greet with Roman Helmets. Let it not be thought, that we are\
unjut to the Merits of fuch orear Mafters, by fo nice an Exgmen of\
their Performances; fince my Purpofe herein is only, by thewing other\
Alen' Faults, to correlt our own. But  am as willing to thew mine,\
a they occur to my Niemory: Witnels, my TEneas receiving the Arms\
of Tinus, where  have allo made  Roman Helmet. And my Father,\
in his Representation of Sences, incroduces one of Nero' Captains, fland\
ing by him, with  Geect Head -piece. Now, Art allows not fuch Li-\
berties either in Military Furnture or any thing elfe. Each Nation\
has irs particular Drefs, Manners and Cultoms. How can we exhibit\
an Egrplian Prospett, withour thewing tome Tokens of that Country,\
as, Palmtrees, Pyramids and People drell in the Eggptian Mode?\
Wherefore lee me recommend Care to evey Perfon, and that they do\
not build too much on other Mens Works. It is better to be nice\
than negligent. Ler us underfland  Thng never fo well, we may\
yet err thro' Haffe or Careleffnets.\
Thinking it prefumptuous, to enumerate all the Particulars of the\
Afilitary Order of the Ancients, as having been largely handled by\
feveral Authors; we shall therefore, accordng to our imall Ability and\
for the Service of curious Artifts, only touch briefly on fome of the\
principal Matters relaring to their Arms, believing the Relidue\
will follow in the Courfe of their Praltice.  shall begin with the\
Giecks.\
The Greek Foot were divided into two forts, Pikemen or Heary.\
armd, and Arcbers or Light arm\'92. The Pikeman uted  Buckler, \
fort of Boots,  Pike  or  Feet in Length, and  Sword. The\
Stowreff had, for Defence,  Afacedonian round Shield of four Feet\
Diameter. The Archer; bore Bucklers of Wicker, Bows, thort Pikes\
and Slings. They wore long Hair and Beards, and Helmets or Head\
pieces fomewhat projecting over the Face, handfomely wrought with\
imagery or Foliage, fet off with Plumes and other elegant Ornaments\
Their Military Dreffes always excelld in Variety and Elegance\
Their Coats of Armour reached down to the Knees, cut out, on the\
Shoulder\
\
\
 Stiltlife.\
Chap  and below, into Straps which were often adorned with Lions-\
heads. Some intlead of Strags, had wifted Fringes. The Generals and No-\
bility wore Buskins of young Lions or Tygersskins; or elfe, neat Sandals:\
But the inferior Sort had plain Sandals with Strings. Their Swords\
hung by their left side by  fmall Hook on the Girdle, and on their\
right side was  Dagger.\
in the Roman Military Order the young Men, between  and  of Age, were appointed for Velites, or fuift Footmen or Light-\
arm\'92; the Haftati, for Darters or Pikemen; tuch as were in their\
Prime, for Principes; and the Aged, for Triaris.\
The Velites wore  lmall Buckler of  Foot and  half long, an\
Head piece,  Sword and  Lance three Feet long and  Thumb\
thick, arm\'92 with  sharp triangular pointed Steel or Head of  Foot\
in Length. Some carried Slings; others, Bows.\
The Haffati and Principes wore  Chort Coat of Armour, that they\
might be the firter for March and the Management of all Sorts of\
Arms; they had long Breeches reaching half-way the Legs and clofe at\
the Knees, an Helmer, and  large Oval Buckler two Feet and an half in\
the Tranfverfe, and four or five Feet in the conjugate Diameter: They\
were girt with Swordson both Sides; that on the Left much longer than\
the other, which, like  Dagger, was but  Span long. Their other\
Weapons were, two Darts or wooden Staves; one thin, like an Arrow,\
and three Cubits long, and headed with Iron; and the other of the\
tame Length, and as thick as the Breadth of the Hand, with  fonted\
Iron Head as long as the Staff, and let halfway into the Wood, and\
belet with Hooks: This lron, next the Wood, was  Finger and \
half in Thicknets.\
The Triaris bore the fame Arms as the Principes, except that in-\
Read of the Darts they ufed Pikes, formerly carried by the Hafati\
and from whence they took their Name) who left them for the Darts.\
The richeff armed themfelves with commodious Body-coats inflead of\
Brealt-pieces. The Romans generally wore thort Hair, with thaved\
Chins, but the Hair growing on each side of their Checks. Vet we\
mull obferve, that Scipie was the only Perfon amons them who had\
long Hair. The Reman Helmets cloting with the Forchead, were\
made either of double Leather, lron or Brass, and crefted on Top, like\
the Greeks, but less fumptuous; except thofe of the Generals and other\
Commanders, which were plum\'92. Some alfo had wing' Helmets,\
and, on the Crefl,  Smake of Dragon or an Eagte' Head. We find\
likewife, that the ancient Romans, in their Marches; carried  Saw, .\
No.  \
Basker,\

Of Stillise.\
 XI\
Basker,  Spade, an Ax,  Bridle,  Sickle and Provifion for three\
Days. The Herculanm, of the old Troopen and the Toviniani, or,\
according to Vegetins, Toviunm, were two felelt Roman Legions, con-\
titling of  Men each, and ferving in Sclavenis, to whom the\
Emperor Diocketianas (who cauted himfelf to be stiled, Tupiter and\
Mhrriminianas Hercules) after they had gaind him the imperial Dig.\
ir, gave that Name, in Preference to all other Legions, for their\
Valour. Thefe, befides their large Swords and oblong Shields, had\
Darts, the infides whereof were run with Lead, and called Manerbur-\
Ers, which, for their Heavinets forwards, they could caft with fuch\
Force and Certainty, that, before they ufed Arrows and Swords, they\
to gall\'92 the Enemy and their Horfes, as to gain the Emperors feveral\
great Bartles.\
The Roman Horfe wore an Helmet and Brealt-piece like the Foot,\
had  Crots fhield by the Horfes Side,  long Sword on their right\
side,  Javelin in their Hands, and in their Quivers three or more Ar-\
rows, broadiron\'92 yet tharp-pointed, and not inferior to the Javelins.\
The Ensigns, both of Foot and Horfe, wore Lyons Skins over their\
military Dreffes; and the Trumpets the fame, fave that the two Fore-\
paws of the Skins were, by thefe latter, tied under their Chins, ferring\
them allo for Cloaks. Thefe Skins were not meerly flead with the\
Hair on, but alto firred for Service, and underneath either fringed or\
elegantly cur our.\
The anidiens and Cretians, under Roman Command and aiding them\
on Horfeback, as Need requird, were arm\'92 with Bows and Arrons,\
and alio with Slings, wherewith they dexteroutly fiung Stones. Pirj\
Writss, that even the Scerfe  Machme of War) with which ancienly\
ther uied to throw large Stones and Timbers, was the Invention of\
Edc Creticns.\
Ths Ligrions, who for  long Time valiantly kept the Romins ai\
Bay, were well-dikiplin\'92 Soldiers; arm\'92 with  Breatt-piece, an Hel\
me:,  Shield and in  clofe Dreis. They were allo very expert in\
\
rowing the Javelin.\
The   barbarous Peopie and Horfemen, wore crefted Hel\
Fcs forsed on Top; ther carried Bows, Duggers and Battle-axes.\
The Sorbian Women, called Amrsins, offcnrimes appear\'92, in   VinenEias fays, in antique Silver Helmers and Brealt-piece,\
becaufe their Country abounded with that Nictal. But, according to\
ancient Memoirs, their military Dreffes were only adorn\'92 with ser\
pents Skins wrought in Silver. They had the left Breaff bare, but the\
fight\
\
\
Of Stilllife.\
  which was fear\'92, that they might, with greater Eale, ule the\
Bow and caff the Dart, cover\'92 like the refl of their Bodies. Their\
Garment, button\'92 below, reached not quite to their Knees. Their\
Defence was  Target or large round Shield, cut hollow, at one of the\
Extremities, into the Form of two conjoin\'92 Crefcents, having  Part\
in the Middle for covering and guarding the Arm and Hand One of\
thefe Cuts ferved for managing the Lance and the other to look thro.\
They likewife carried Axes and Hammers.\
The Goths, together with the great Attily, defcended from the Scy-\
thians, were arm\'92 with Bows, Arrows, long and firong Spears or\
Lances, Shields and Helmets. The Horfemen, fullarmourd and car\
rying Rrong Lances, Hammers and Clubs, would leap on their Horles\
without the Help of the Stirrupor other Advantage; especially on lmooth\
lee, or in fnowy Ground, where they generally fought their greatell Bar-\
tles. Sometimes, as Need requir\'92, and in the Heat of Bactle, they would,\
in full Gallop, throw themfelves on another Horfe, turning and winding,\
with incredible Swifiness, even, carching up  Lance from the Ground,\
Co. An Evidence what great Warriors thefe People formerly were.\
The Persians and Spartans were very much alike in Drels, except\
in their Head ornaments. The former wore Turbants, and the latter,\
Caps, like  Night cap, yet pointed on Top and curling forwards; or\
clle, lron Head-pieces, like the Remans, but plain and without  Cred.\
They had long Hair and their Beards almofl hid their Ears. On the\
other Hand, the Persions shav\'92 both Head and Face. Their Veft-\
ment, girt about the Middle, reach\'92 below the Knees: They wore\
allo long open Breeches and wide Stockings and Shoes. They uled fcaled\
Arms, round Shields, Greaves or Shinarmour, Scimitars, Daggers, shore\
Spears but long Bows: The Scimitars hung on the right Thigh, cross\
the Body, and the Dagger on the fame Side, but at the Girdle. Ar\
their Back, was the Quirer.\
Darins, the laft King of Perfia, was commonly array\'92 in  rich\
Purple Mantle intermixt with white Strips, fatten\'92 on each Shoulder\
with precious Stones, and before, with  gold Chain or Hook. His\
Cost of Armour, wrought with Gold, was embroider\'92 on the Breaft\
with three golden Eagles, having pread tings and Tails and Billscurning\
towards each other; and between the Kings and Tails were feen the\
following Letters, KIKETIRRTATOS, ligitying, ahears Conquerer. Ac\
his golden Girdle, girt loofely and womanith, hung  Scimitar,\
the Scabbard whereof was befet with precious Stones.\

The Foor, to hrike Terror into their Enemies, wore Skins of Lyons,\
Frgers, Leepards and other wild Bealls; and had, for Weapons, large\

Soldiers, and bore  Shield,  Pike, an Helmet and Sword.\
Thus  think to have made some Provifion for further Inquiry, that\
Artills may not be at  Loss. He, who wants more Information, can\
read Virgil, Ammianus Marcellinus, Vegetius, Polybins, and Herodotus\
Halicarnafus; which laft, in the Life of Kerxes, lays down all the\
Particulars relating to each People and all forts of Barbarians. Vitru-\
vits allo has written  Treatife of the Roman Military Exercife.\
Hemer, in his lhad, (peaking of Fights wherein some had gold, brats\
and Reel Armour, fays \'97 He pustd him in the Belly, but piered\
not his Armour\
And, in another Paltage \'97 He dealt him\
such  Blow on his Steel-breat as to make it firike Fire and refound.\
Now, if it be ask\'92, what fort of Armour this mult have been, of\
malty Gold and other Metal? and whether it could be poffible for any\
Perfon to move, bend and turn in fuch Armour as thew\'92 the Mukcles\
and Limbs and fat clofe to the Body? Iantwer, they could not, and\
that the Notion of their having been thus is wrong.  think thofe are\
alfo out of the way who fuppole, they are to reprefented for the Sake of\
Decorum, and that this is Reafon enough, without confidering\
whether it be postible or not; fince other Reafons may be affign\'92.\
which can give better Satisfaction without forcing Nature. For\
my Part,  believe, that the Arms and their Ufe were anciently as now,\
and that the Coats of Armour were, like our Buff-coats, made of Lea-\
ther. They may pothibly have been to contrived as to thew the Muf\
ling; But granting it, they mutt be much firter for Ufe than if of Steel\
or tolid Gold. Wherefore  cannot but think they were made of\
Leather and of all forts of Colours, wrought or embroider\'92 with\
Silver or Gold, even coverif over with Gold lke our gilt Learner.\
and fet off with Scales, Foliage and other fuch Ornaments.  rerem.\

Book XI\
 enricld, The great Number of the Roman Forces, that the Roman\
Armours, Breakt pieces or Milicary Coats (as there called) were lined\
with trool and cover\'92 with the Skins of Wolves, Lions and other\
wild Beafts of Litys. Nevertheless, to support the Opinions of the Pocis,\
 that ther had gold, brats and fieel Breaft and Belly-pieces, fa.\
Herd with fmail Hooks and Buckles on the Shoulfers and Sides, to\
ward off Blows; but they were plain and wiihout Muteling; and not\
par on bur in times of Preparation for Bartle. Wherefore they\
are much to blame, who incroduce fuch Accourrements on every Occy-\

 being, in Painting, abfolucely neceffary, firft, to diffinguith the Na-\

gree, by Tokens either devited by themfelves, or appropriated by\
others;  think proper to handle this Point largely, in order to thew\
the Greamets of the Roman Power, and the many foreign Troops enter-\
tain\'92 in their Service:  fay both Painters and Staruaries, especially the\
latter ought to be acquainted with thefe Things, that, in reprefenting\
either  particular Nation or Heroe, they may, on their Shichls, exhi\
bit the proper Bidges of Diltinstion whereby to be preiently known by\
Perfons converfant in Antiquiries. This Knowledge is as necelfary for\
Hinory-painiers, fince Hillories frequently make mention of  Con\
gres of fereral Nirions and their Heroes in one Place, without de\
 their Atmis hL Bakers;  Point which coff me much Trouble\
to gain, but proved of greater Advantage in the Ufes  made there\
of, and which  increduce here as having tome Relation to the preced\

On confuling Hiffories,  fird, the Ancients, infiead of Banners,\

Chap.  People, from that Time reprefented it in the Entigns and Arms by\
 Wiff of Hay; cauting this Token, as an happy one, to be born before\
him in the enfueing Wars. The Romans afterwards painted, on their\
Enligas and Standards, small red Flames, in Token of Success; as in the\
Battle with the Sabines near Eretum, where the rms of the former\
appeared by Night as if on Fire, without being damaged. Thus the\
Standards and Entions of the Legions, by the Sight whereof the Sol\
diers knew the Wills of their Generals, were from Time to Time aug-\
mented. They had alfo, at different Times, divers other Tokens; as\
openright Hands, the Image of their Emperors in Silver or Gold or gilt;\
and fomerimes there hung under them  small Pendent, having the Genc-\
fals or Peoples Motto, . . . . They likewife bare in their Ban\
nets, the Reprefentation of Welves, Minotaurs, eild Bours, Horfes,\
Bulls and Dragons, till at laft they fixed on the Eagle for the chief Field-\
Handard. The Romans uted the Wolf, Minotaur, wild Boar, Horfe,\
Bull and Dragon, for the following Reafons; the Welf, partly, as he\
was facred to Afars the God of War, and partly, becaute his Penetrati-\
on is to great, that he can fee as well by Night as Day: Whereby they\
meant, that  prudent General ought always to be on his Guard, to as\
not to be fuprized by the Stratagems of the Enemy. By the Ainetour,\
lays Vegetins, they lignified, that as this Beall kept himfelf in the moft\
hidden Part of the Labyrinth, to the Deligns of  General ought to be\
kept secret. The wild Boar, becaute no Peace or Ceffation of Arms was\
made without it. Videour  Book, . gos. treating of the Ofirings.\
The Horfe, as being of great Account among the Romans, and the pro-\
per Sign of War. The Bull, becaute the ancrent Romiins pretended, that\
the Word (Ratia) was derived from Rruls, which now  dars fignifies  or Bull. The Dragon they commonly painted on the Banners of\
the Foot, and each Century had one; whence the Bearer of it, accord-\
ing to Vegetins, was called Dragon, ins. Ammianus Mlarceers tells us\
the Manner of carrying it. They tied, fays he, to the Tips of their gitt\
Pikes (which were gold jringed and befet with Pearts and preetzts Stokes)\

has henot extended the Reman Dominion?, What refifting Nation has\
not felr the Effect of their Deliberations, and the Valour wherewith\
they put them in Execution ? And yet  know from Hiffory, that the\
Eagh was in Ufe long before among the Persans: For Cyrus the Foun.\
der of that Monarchy, bore, according to Kenephen,  gold Eagle with\
preas Wings, on  long Pike, as if he would fly ever the Univerle;\
which Cuffom his Succeliors retained as  Royal Token. By  conflant\
Confent of the Soothfayers, all Nations anciently afcribed to this Bird,\
the Hozour of believing he prognofticated good Luck and happy Success\
many Undertakings: In which Senfe Tuliaas tells us, that ffiere, when\
roung who was of mean Birth on his Mother' Side) making his firff\
Campaign, an Eagle ffew down and fat on his Shield: Which was judg-\
ed as  Pretage of his becoming, in Time, an excellent General and  as afterwards came to pass. The Pocts even fay, that this Bird\
implies Profperity affigned to any Perfon by divine Providence. This\
Opinion owes ir' Rile to the Relation of Angcreon, the firtt Writer of\
Antiquities, that Tupiter, intending to deftroy the Giants who threatend\
to Horm Heaven, the Powers of which he offered to, was, by the acciden\
tal Flight of an Eagle, affured of an happy Success and Viltory; which\
afterwards obtaining, he always bore  golden Eagle in his Arms and\
Banners, as  perperual Memorial thereof. From Tupiter the Cretians\
affurmed that Bird, and from them the Candiots. Kneas the Trajanin\
troduced him among the Latins; and from them the Romans, in Pro-\
cels of Time, came to ule him for their Arms: Tho' Lippar is of Opini\
on, they affumed him after the Example of the Perssons. The Tuscans,\
beaten by the Remans in their laft Conflict near the City of Eretum, on\
the Borders of the Sabines, preiented Turquinias Priscus, King of the\
Romans, their King' Regalis, to wit,  gold Crown,  purple Gar\
ment, and Mande of various Colours, allo an Irory Chair, and an\
Irory Scepter with an Eagle on Top, which he and his Succeffors always\
bore. After the Banithment of the Kings, the Senate took the Eagh\
from their Scepters, and fet him on their Pikes, exalcing him above\
all their other rms, whether the Wolf, Minotaur, Horse, Wild Bear,\
ec. Alyriss, when  Child, happening to find an Eagle' Neft with\
 Joung,  Prefage of his two Contulats, often placed the faid Number\
in his Arms; and in his lecond Confulat, affigned the Eagte to the\
Reman Legions, uling him only in Battles, in order to spirt the Sot\
diers and atture them of Viltory. The other Military Tokens were\
fet on the Tenrs; but larius took them down; and from that Time\
no Legion was without two Eugles. But Tosephus, in his fourth Book,\

Thefe Eagles were but fmall, and of Silver, and many had the Thun-\
der in their Talons. The Romans firft ufed flver Eagles, as did allo\
Bratus, becaute Silver is the brightelf Metal, and moft like the Day,\
and therefore propereff for  Military Token: But afterwards, they\
made ifieim of Gold, as more flately and furpafting the Silver. The\
Romans firft ufed filver Tokens as being originally frugal and laving;\
but at length they yielded to none, even not to the Persians, in Lux-\

Leamed would derive the Lofis word Seatam,  Shield, from Sculpturs,\
becaute it was cuftomary to engrave or reprefent glorious Actions and\
Hiffories upon them) were anciently  certain Sign of the Valour of\
thofe who carried them. And, left the Soldiers, in the heat of Bat-\
tle, should mistake their Comrades, each Legion, according to Vege.\
fins, had particular Marks on their Shields; and on the Infide of which\
was Written each Soldiers Name, and what Company he belonged to.\
The Shields or Targets were of different Makes at the Place where\
they guarded the Hand: As, thofe of the firff Armenian Order had\
two indentures cut out down the Sides; as we have faid in the foregoing\

Emblem touching Plowers.\
Touthful Flora sits here attired in Blue, Vellow and Red, attended by fear\
Children, representing the Four Sealons, each dreft in  Garment, or\
Drapery, of the Colour peculiar to him, and dancing with Flowers and\
Fruits, which they present to ber.\
   . . Of Flowers in general.\
  Spring being the moff delightful Seafon of the\
 Vear, it is no Wonder thar Flowers have  particular\
 Charmabove other Objects; and this not only in Nature,\
 but allo in  Painting; which, though ever to indiffe-\
rent, Lovers often prefer before  fine Piece of Hiffory or\
Be\
Landskip.\
It is remarkable, that, amidl the various Choices in the Art of\
Painting, none is more Feminine,\
or proper for Women than this;\
No.  Plowers.\
Book XII\
 the Realon is plain. lis allo to be noted, that, of thofe Choices,\
ose is as perfed as the other, with respect to Art, were it ever to\
tingular; and tho' this Choice is but  small Part of the whole,\
yet it is attended with as many Excellencies: For as  Bunch of Grapes\
carries its perfection, to the leall Grain does the fame. But tho' both\
the Parts, as well as the Whole, fall under the fame Rules, and one\
Mafter underfland his Branch as well as the other; yet he, who has\
from his Vouth applied himself to this or that fingle Choice, let his\
Progrets therein be what it will, can perform nothing elfe thats good.\
We have many inftances of excellent Mafters who departed from the\
general to particular Choices with Applante, but of none who have\
done the contrary without Difcredit.  reckon Difcredit as BadanEix-\
change as Copper for Gold, or Water for Wine. Of the former Sort\
are innumerable Ialian and French as well as Low Dutch Mafters;\
but of the latter few, among whom Vereff alone claims the Laurel,\
to the Wonder of thofe who knew him when he painted Flowers: For,\
if ever  Painter excelled in that Branch, he was the Perfon: Neither\
Mario da Fieri, Father Segers, or de Heem came up to luch  Pirch;\
and yet, thro'  bad Exchange, he at laft fell from an agreeable spring\
into  forrowful Winter, wherein he perished.  bring this Example\
for two Reafons: Firft, in Confirmation of my Affertion, that he, who\
can perform the moft difficult Things, may ealily, even without Trow-\
ble, artain thole of less Confideration; but not the contrary without\
Difadrantage and Discredis. Secondly, Becaufe my Delign is to treat\
of Flewers, as an effectual Admonition to thofe who would bellow their\
Time with Advantage on that fingle Choice.\
Fhair painting is certainly  commendable Etudy; but, as there are\
double and fingle Flowers, to there are two Sorts of Flower-painters;\
the one fingular and timple, and the other rich and ingenious; of which\
latter Sort we have bur few, and of the former Abundance. Three\
Things are efpecially necelfary in  good Flower-picce Firtt,\
Ctvice and beautiful Flowers: Secondly, Good Disposstion and Harmony:\
Ard lafly, Aest and feft Penciling. Firtt, The Flowers mult not be poor\
beautiful, and in Eyteem. Secondly,\
or mean, but fuch as are large,\
they alwayskeep their proper Quility\
That, whether lying or flanding,\
and Shage, . . that the Round frem not, by too extravagant  Spread,\
to be Tilangular, squire or oblong, whereby to miffake one Flower for an\
other; that the mot noble and beautiful have the Predeminancy, and\
that, by their placing, they produce an agreeable Mixture of Colours, de\
lighting and fatistying the Eye; confifting, in to ordering the flrong and\
Rriped\

  with the faint Ones, asto exhibit  lovely Rainbow. Laflly, That\
each Flower be well expressd, according to it' Nature and Quality;\
as, one thin, another thick, this foft and limber, that fet and fliff, one\
thining, another dull and gloflels.\
We are, in the next Place, to fuppofe, that it is impoffible to be \
Matter without  firm and exaft Draught, and thorough Acquaintance\
with Perspective, together with good Knowledge of the Colours and their\
Bodies, and which will fand beft; and laftly,  due inquiry into the\
Nature of Flowers, that they may be bundled accordingly.\
He who would follow this Study in good earnelf, ought to be Mlafter of\
 Flower-garden, which he should carefully cultivate, that he may, in\
the Seafons, be furnished with fine and choice Flowers: For tho' model-\
ling be  great Affiftance in Winter Practice, when the Life is not to\
be had, yet no Perfection is attainable without the Life. He who is\
 firm and nimble Draftiman, and  good Manager of Water-colours,\
has  double Advantage, and may in Time get  Treafure of beauti-\
ful modelled Flowers, bearing good Prices and great Etteem among the\
Curious. After the Flowers, the green Leofing of them is of great im-\
portance, thro' irs various Qualities and Difference in Textare and Co-\
Jour, cauling  Flower-piece to look natural and more decorous.\
CH   II. Of painting Flowers in Halls, Apartments, Galleries,\
but principally on Gielings for Ornament.\
  the Buliness of  good Flower-painter, principally to aim\
at what is praile worthy. What great Things, what glorious\
Occafions do there not offer for  Mafters Fame! But this lies not always\
in the Reprefentations of Garlands of Flowers, Pots, Glatsbottles,\
Bucterflies, flying Beetles, Cobwebs, or Drops of Water, any more than\
in neat penciling and bright Colours, with which we think to fet the\
World in  Gaze. Such Triffes are two low, and the Repetitions too\
irkfome for the Tale of noble Souls. WharOpportunities do not daily\
happen in Palaces, Gardens, Galleries, and Apartments, for thewing\
our Skill and Ingenuity  Suppofe to yourself  lofty Room, buill with\
white Marble, and fet out with fine Piltures and Batsreliefs, for the\
common Recreation of young Gentlemen and Ladies: This Room\

fine and large Feftoons of Flowers: Between the Pilafters, and over\

the Bufsreliefs, much Green; yet fomewhatlets in Cafe any Landskips\
be there; and on the white Marble may be all Sorts of beautiful\
coloured Flowers. On red Marble contrarily white and yellow ones, (or.\
according to the Rules of Arc, and in large Parts: Now light, then .\
gain dark Leafing, as the Marter and Ground require. But of the fo-\
veral Grounds and Colours of Flowers fuitable to them, we shall here.\
after treat particularly. On the Cieling, there may be thin Branches\
of airy Foliage, alfo intermixed with Flowers, here Feftoon wife,\
there in Croups, faltened with Ribbons or Kings, and having in some\
Places loofe Sprigs and Leaves projecting from the Ground, and returning\
their proper Shadesthereon (which tho' the Life is not to be had, may by\
some such mude Tkings be performed) that they may seem more nacurally\
to hang off. Such Flowers and Leaves ought to be Rrongly and boldly\
handled, but yer to as to feem faftened to the Work; well confidering\
the Colour and Lighmess or Darkness of the Ground, and chuling for\
it Flowers of fuch Colours, that fome may look as if picking to it, and\
others coming of. Now, if many Feffoons be to hang in fuch  Place,\
or Room, they muft needs have  like Length, Breadch, and Fullnets,\
and be placed equally high or low. What Difference is it to us, whe\
ther the Proprietor defire to have Flowers or Fruits, or  Mixture of\
both ? Forthe Feffoons may be filled with Peaches, Apricocks, Mul\
berries, Plumbs, cec. hanging on their Twigs. Over the Repretents-\
tion of  Bacchanal, fome Bunches of white and blue Grapes, intermixed\
with Pine -apples, look becoming. On the lcove may hang loofly\
over it Purarers of all Sorts of Colours, intersperfed with Pappies, ried\
here and there with Ribbons, as molt proper for that Place.\
 should not luch Sorts of Ornament be agreeable when nacurally\
dilpoted and painted; elpecially, if well-lighted, and the Ground-sades\
dittr express\'92 on the Grountl The Company before-mentioned may\
\
 raile Mirch enough among themfelves; but to pleafant \
Sight mutneeds be  great Addition to it. Ler us therefore take hold\
of every Opportunity that offers, and in the mean Time exercife our\
Talents in the Attainment of  great Handling. Let us exchangs our\
small Cloaths for whole Walls; our Pots and Bortles, for Vales; and\
 mudilling, for  beautiful Manner. Let us enquire what Flowersare\
Purater-fise, and which the principal; conjoining their Sense, Applier\
tien and Colour together with their profer Grounds.\

\
Of Flewers:\
    . III. That  Flower-painter should underfland Perspeltive:\
Also the Mistake of reprefenting Things improperly.\
 have already afferted, that  good Flower-painter mull needs\
underfland Perspective; and yet (which is to be lamented) few\
know any thing of it; poffibly fuppoting, they have no Occation for it,\
and that therefore this Branch is to much eafier than Hiffors or any\
Thing elfe, which cannot fubliff without Perspective, as indiffutably re-\
quiring more By-works, viz. Architelture, Landship, or other Ob-\
jelt cauting Ground shades, which never happen in their Work: And\
should they at any time be non-plusd, they canger Help from thofe who\
are acquainted with Perspective. If therefore they have but  Point of\
Sight, they think that fufficient; and yet not for the Sake of the Flowers,\
but folely for the Corner of  marble Table or Slab, whereon they fet\
 Flowerglats, as if the lighting or thading of the Flowers were  Mar-\
ter of indifference; this from  side, that fronting, one from below,\
another from above; whence their Pieces have ufually many Points\
of Sight, sometimes as many as there are Flowers. But it cannot be\
otherwife, fince they often paint after Models; placinga Flower on\
the left Side, which ffood before on the right, and the contrary, or elfe\
below or above; which they imagine nobody will difcover, becaute\
they cannot fee it themfelves.\
Another ridiculous Cultom of fome Flower-painters, in my Opinion,\
is, that, in painting anr gloffi Rodies, fuch as Flower-glalies, gold, fil\
ver or copper Vales, afrer the Life, they fail not to thew therein the\
Panes of the Winmbes, and afcerwards to hang the Pictures in Halls\
and Galleries, which have nene. Here let me take Notice of an ex-\
traordinary nice and finith\'92 Piece of that Nature, painted by  certain\
known Gentlewoman, wherein not only fome Stalks of the Flowers\
appeared naturally through the Glats, but allo ber own Picture in ber\
Postare of painting, with luch an Air, as evidently thewed it was the\
who fat in it; nor did the forger to reprefent allo the Windores and\
Panes, Sky and Clouds. We need not quettion, whether the endeavoured\
by the Depth of her Penetration, to turpats her Mlafter in that Piece\
of Work. This Cale is - kin to that of  certain young Arciff, who\

    IV. Of Flowers on all Sorts of Grounds.\
 AT Wbite is fet off by Black, and the contrary, needs no De-\
monttration; and, on the other Hand, White on White, and Black\
on Black caules  picking tegether. Of which parricular Notice ought\
to be taken, that Flowers may have their des Force and Effect; to or-\
dering them, that fome seem to pick to the Ground, and others to come\
of from it. The moll proper Grounds for Flowers are thefe.\
The Colour of blue lomb-fione\
Dark-olive or green Serpentine.\
Lightgrey Freeitone.\
Thire Marble, but of  second Tint\
This Obtervation would rather lfoil  good Ordonnance than have\
the defired Effect, if we did not maturely wegh, what Ufes we would\
put thefe Grounds to, as allo where the Flowers most properly ought\
to have the greatett Strength, and where the greateff Wcahnels, in or\
der that the Principaf ( mean, the lxed Stone and Wood worn) may\
not thereby be overpowered.  lay Strength, with re-pett to Force and\
Beauty; but  mean not by Wesknys, that the Colour, Light or shade\
should be weakened or fullied : However  thall, in the Scquel, explain\
what  meanby that Word.\
Any Cobur fuits in White; but the darket moft beautifully. Warm\
Colours are preferable to the broken ones, and the mot weak ought to\
be on the Excremities; but few whice ones, and thofe with Caution.\
What  now tay concerns the Dispesstion; which  shall more plainly\
handle in treeting of Feffoons and Croups of Flowers.\
The black Groands, tho' quite different from the preceding with re-\
ped to great Force, can give little Reffexion, and therefore do not ad\
mit of light or weak Flowers; but nevertheless fall under the fame\
Rules and Obfervations as Flowers on  white Ground; becaute the\
Greens, by their Union, have  Relacion to the Ground and Colour.\

proceed to their Disposstion in Groups and Feftoons.\
 Chall compofe each Group of particular emblematic Colours, as Tet\

The firft Group, Tellow, having for its principal Flower,  Turnfol,\
Africanor Marigeld, Anemone, Sc. which  Rile, Upper-power or\

Durk Green agrees with all light Flowers. And\
Pale Green, with dark Ffowers.\
Ender thele Groups, there should always be either  Motte or Verso.\
As for Fgjoons, they may be handled in the fame Manner, yet with\
lets Coannement: If the emblematic Colour have but the middle Place,\
that is fufficient; the other Parts may be filled up with fuch Colours\
as we pleafe, provided they have fomewhat less Brightness than the\
principal: For Initance, let the middle Flowers be large and high\
coloured, as Africans or Marigelds, Tellow and Red; on the right side\
may be Purgh, as Rofes, Anemones; and on the left Blue, as Iris, Fles\
Principis, Hyscinths, Cc. The Purple Side mixed with lirle White\
and lets Fellow; the Blue Side, with Fellow and Red; and the  in the Middle, wich Violer, dark Blue, litle Purple and White.\
in  second Feffoon, White may poticts the middle Place, as white\
Roses, Lillies and orters; on the right side may be Tellow, and on\
the left pale Red. The Tillow may be diverfified with Purple, Vio.\

whether in the middle or largeft, as allo thole on the Sides require their\
Particular small divernifying Flowers, . . the fingle coloured with\
ipeckled or Itriped; and the contrary.\
if either Group or Fedoon, fuit or close Flowers should always be\
placed in the mor refiered Part. The open ones are moftly fer on the\
Sides, in order to create Sbade. For Inilance; let the middle Part of\

As for the Colours, there are fingle and half teleared Flswers: The\
fingle-coloured are Peonies, Rofts, CSc. And the others striped or\
speckled with two or more Colours; as Anemones with White and Red,\
Hriped Rofes, Tulips, Eec. Which ought to be to regularly ordered, as to\
raile in the Eyea ballancing Mixture; and to unite the frong and weak\
that the one do not project coomuch, and the other too little; and that, at\
 Diftance, and at one View, the Feffoon may have its due Sway. Vet\
if here or there it be either too weak or too Rrong, you mult recollet\
how it may be helped. Wherefore obferve, that Tellow. and Red. are\
firong Colours; and contrarily, Blue and Viclet weak.  too much Tel.\
low and Red come together, place fomewhat Blue or Vigket between;\
and if too much Blue or Violet, some Tellow or Red.\
To begin  Feftoon well, you ought firtt to mark- out its Course.\
as you will have it, either thick or thin: Next, lay on the Green\
with fuch Leafing as you think proper, but fomewhat large, and\
with due Light and Shade according to its Light. Being dry, lay in the\

   Obfervations of Confequence in  Feffoon, Cronp, or Gar\

Places of Hanging.\
Tis ealy to conceive, that many small Tbings coming fegether, produce,\
at  Diftance, only  confuted Mass, and little affect the Senfes, as hav-\
ing nothing in them to make any impreffion, or is worth Remark:\
And tho' each Flower have is particular Name, Shape, and Colour,\
yet they are only considered in general, under the Nume of Flowers; be\
canle of their being placed either fee high or foo diffast. Such Feftoons\
of Croups look well on Paper and in Hand, of on Tea-tables, Toilets\
and the like, either in Painting or Needle-work. On the other Hand,\
large Flowers may be feen diflnctly at  Distance, in their Qualities,\
Shapes, and Beauries Theneach Flower gers  Name; this is  Rofe,\
that  Papover, C in  Word, Feftoons, Groups or Garlands, placed\
high, or to be viewed at fome Diftance, ought to be difpoted in great\
Maffes, and separate, with few speckled or priped Flowers, eitber large\
or smatt, as having no Eiffelt but when feen near. Wherefore tis ne\
ceffary to take, in their Sreads, others of fingle Colours, in order to fet\
off the Work with mere Forse and Diffinttion, and to give the Eye Sais\
faction For this Reafon, when sees in Hand, they ought to unite, and ont\
of Hand, to look more feparate and difinct. Bur  shall explain this by\
some Examples; chuling two Groups, one agreeably amiring, fo as to\
be viewed sear, and the other, the contrary\
in the middle of the former is  wbite Rese, andbehind it  Centifelid,\
behind which is  Purple, and behind that  Peony. Now, thefe four\
Colours difter but half  Tint from each other, compoting together an\
half Ball gradually rounding.\
The latter contrarily, tho' having allo  white Flower in the middle,\
has behind it  purple one, and benind that  dark Viclet,  Colow\
cdarker than that of the Peony: And thefe will create  greater Forfe\
than the former, as ftarting more suddenty from each other, and differing\
 whole Tint, as the others did but an half one. Whence, tisevidest,\
that the more difintt the Tints are, the more lively and firong they wil\
appear.\

Three Sorts of Flowers are preper for Intermixture, viz. Tellow, Red\
and Blue, all in their greateft Beauty.\
If the Work confill moftly of Red and Tellow, it ought to be inter-\
mixed with Blue; and if of Blae, you mult take Tellow; but if of\
all three, you are to ule White, to diftriburing it as to refreth the Eye.\
Now, for Proof of all that has been faid,  shill thew here two Me-\

its Performances; and taftly, the Ovalificationof an Excher and Engraver.\
The Art of Engroving is queltionlets noble and praife worthy;\
becaute it respects Painting, as Painting does Nature: For as the\
latter has Nature for ir' Modelor Object, which it faichfully imitaces\
with the Pencil; to Engraving likewife copies Painting, either with\
the Needle or Graver, in fuch Manner as only to fland in Need of Co\
lours; which, when required, may be added to it. Painting confifts\
in  near and good Outline, Propertion, Light and Shade: And thele\
are alto the Foundations of Engraving. Painting diffinguithes between\
common Light and Sunthine: Engraving does, or can do, the fame.\
In fine, whatever the ose performs with the Pencil, the other can ex\
press with the Needle or Graver, and as seatly, whether Scufts of all\
Kinds, Wool, Silk, Sarin, Linnen, Glass, Water, Gold, Wood, Stone, C Performances are to the Sight, what Fome is to the Ear. Paint\

Chap.  Wonders of Painting in it' Abfence; but Engraving makes itfelf\
every where prefent; flying over the Univerfe, as well as the found\
ing Trumpet of Fame. It keeps an eternal Regifter of every Thing\
that is Praife-worthy: And as the intire Welfare, even Happiness or\
Uphappiness of  good Painter, depends on the Gertainty or Uncertainty\
of the Engraver, as  shall fhew in my Remarks on Prints after Paint\
ings or Deligns; to the latter ought to difengage himself from Preji-\
dice and inclnation to this or that particular Manner, and exert his\
Skill in an exaft Imitation of what he is to Engrave of Etch, after any\
Manner or any Mafter, be it flat or riting, dark or light, without  or Dimunutien, except with the Licence of the Painter or Defigner.\
His Work mulf be like  clearLooking-glats, which exhibits all Objects\
true and without Falficy. As to the manual Operation,  fine Hand-\
ling is  great Step to Grace; and, in order to it, the Knowledge of\
three Things is abfolucely necelfary, to wit, The Art of Drawing,\
Perspettive, and the Dottrine of Light and Sbade: Thefe, as Principals.\
compote the Theory of the whole Work. He ought allo to be very\
diligent in batching with the Pen or red Chalk, in order thereby to get\
 frm Handling: And it behoves him as much as the Painter, to draw\
after the naked Life and dressd Layman. He should likewife be fur-\
withed with Prints; both engraved and eiched, of the moff famous\
Mallers.\

fore mentioned are only requifite in fuch as reprefent  complest Picture:\
For there is  great Difference between Boot and other Prints: Tbe for-\
er express the Whafter which is represented, even, were it deligned in\
whice Marble, Batsrelief, nay in Snow or Sand; and the latter confider.\
only the Mafter who painted it, and his Art, together with that\
of the Engraver and his Capacity. Forthis Reafon, Book-prints Hand\
in need of Explanation; but other Prints, not : For the Golour is in the\
one, what the Writing is in the other.\
\
   . IV. Of the Difference between Engraving and Etching.\
CCOR DING to the general Opinion, and not without Rea.\
fon, Erching is accounted more loofe and Defigner like than\
Engraving; becaute there is no Difference between Erching and Draw.\
ing as to the Handling; but the Difference berween Drawing and En.\
 is very great. The Management of the Needle is the same\
 thar of Chalk or the Pen: The Place lies ffat and firm like the\
Paper to draw upon. But we find the contrary in Engraving; wherein\
the Graver is held almod parallel with the Plate, and the larter is\
moreable on  Cuikion or Sandbag. And as to Force, there is alloless\
Occafion for it in Erching than Engraving.\
Now to prove, that Etching mutt needs be more Deligner-like than\
Engraving, let us only make our Remarks on both in the Courte of\
their Bulinets, each having  Delign before him; and then we shall find\
the Reafon to be, that in the one, both the Drawing, and Plate are\
ixt before the Arcid, and he only moves his Hand; whereas the otper\
cannor go forward wirhout firring, the Plate beingcontinually rurning,\
and boch the Hund and Arm employed in directing the Graver; by\
which Means, Engraversare often hindered from perceiving the Dit-\
terence berween their Work and the Pattern, before  Part, nay. the\
whole, be tiniined. Wherefore, in my Opiniph,. Eiching is Ixperior te\
Engravingin Exaltnels and Speed:  fay in Speed, becaute three or more\
Plates\

Of Engraving.\
Chap.  alfo\
Plates may be etched, before one can be engraved. Etching\
 we\
moft Defigner-like, becaute of its near Affinity with Drawing,\
daily experiment; for, where one Painter or Deligner engraves for his\
Pleafure, an hundred take to Erching, and make good Progress\
therein; becaute of the flow Advances in Engraving compared to Etch-\
ing, whether in Figures or Buildings, but elpecially Landskip. And\
fince Painters of Deligners care not to have their Defigas cenfured and\
corrected by others, they chufe rather to erch them themfelves, than\
to fet about Engraving; an Art not to be maftered without much Ex-\
pence of Time, in getting Knowledge how to handle the Tool;\
whereby it would become rather Labour than Diverfion.\
Many Engravers etch for Pleafure, becaute of its Eafiness; but fel.\
dom any Etcher handles the Graver, unless in Cafe of Neceffity. To\
this perhaps it may be objected, that, as each Painter or Deligner has \
particular Choice wherein he labours moft, as one in the Ordonnance,\
another in Nicety of Drafc, and  third in the neat finithing of fome\
Particular Things, therefore the Tiule of Designer-like in Etching, is\
not ablolutely due to Painters or Deligners: To which  anfiver, that\
undoubtedly the Word muft not be underftood to relate to modern De-\
figners, becaute it was in Ufe before Erching was brought to its prefent\
Perfection; as appears by Caracci, Titian, Antome Temperta, C excelled in Delign, and ufed the Needle with no other View, than\
to give the World the Deligns, which they counted capital and moft.\
praife-worthy, for the Encouragement and Confideration of the less\
Knowing. Whereby we plainly perceive, that their incention was only\
to putforth their own Performances in such  Manner as fafely to be re-\
lied on; accordingly, we fcarce fee any more in them than an Out line:\
But this is to firm and correlt, that, however tlightly the other Parts\
may be feratcht, thefe Works thus of their own Hands, are more\
valued than thofe of the belt and molt famous Engravers or Etchers.\
We have an Example in the Print of the Woman by the Well, eicht by\
Caracot himself, how much it differs from that done by Le Potre, and\
another by Bishop. Whata vaft Difference is there between Perrier'\
and Bishop\'92 Works, as to the Deligner likencts and Loofencts of Hand\
ling! And in Landskips, between Titians and Perelles:  could, if\
need required, produce more Proofs of the Anciquity of the Word\
Defgner-like; but shall wave them; and acquaint the Reader, how\
oddly  took to Etching, and how ftrangely  drudged, before  could\
gain my Point.\

Haring in my fouth an Inclination for Etching, but no Knowledge\
of what was good or bad, as feeing no other Examples than the old and\
foorly engraved Prints of Raphael, Michael Angele, Taul Veronefe,\
Tintoret, (Ec. (Which yet were excellent for their fine Out-line) and few\
erchr ones; my flender Actempts may be eatily gueff at. Indeed  cannor\
ber fill think of it with Wonder; for  begannot with Copperor Sicel,\
Eit  Piece of Pewter and  Nail, about  Fingers Length, which, with\
great Pains,  ground to  Point after my own Way. Firtl,  tried on-\
iy lingle Strokes, and then croli-hatching, which looked ftrange enough.\
Ar., inficad of  Rollirg-prets,  rubbed the Bickfides of my Proots\
with the Nail. This however did not abate my Curiofity; which\
Csilv increated, tho' my Work appeared to black as to be fcarce intel-\
lisitie. My Father, feeing this, could not forbear laughing; and, for\
Hemour' Sake, gave two or three of my Proofs to Bartbolet, and he\
agzin to Nstalis the famous Engraver, who beffowed on me some little\
Ihitructien and  fmall Copper-plare to try on. But what Drudgery\
hed  urdergone before  ferarcht this beautiful Plate: Boses Book of\
Eiching happening to be publifhed about that Time, Ileft off plaguing\
myfelf, and cheerfully fer about (plitting of Wood, providing Needles,\
boiling Grounds, cleaning Plates, buying Aqua fortis. Wax, E before, Iknew of no betrer Ground than thick and foul Oil, out\
of the Smuth-por, boiled to  Blacknets; which gave me no little\
Trouble to get off the Plsteagain after it was bit, and which therefore\
 was obliged to put in the Fire, till it was foff as Lesd. Things fo\
far facceeding according to my With,  happened to fee some Prints of\
Vouet, from France, which fpurred my Curioficy: And  should cer\
fainly hive made early and good Progress, had not my Father been fear-\
full might fix my Thoughts on this Study, to the Negleft of Painting.\
Wherefore he diffuaded me from it, faying, it was too foon to enter on\
to difficule  Pallime, and inftrating me in other Things as delightful\
 advantageous. Marrying some Years after,  went to Helland,\
where Ire-affumed this noble Art with great Pleafure, and which  do\
not repent of; tho' some think it the Caufe of my Misfortune. The\
Trath of this, Ged knows: Vet had  faved Candle and ufed more\
Day-light for it, perhaps my old Age might have proved more com-\
fortable to me: Butalas! thofe two noble Sifters, Painting and Eich-\
ifg, are now vanifhed with my Sight.\
Let the Readerjudge, whether he ever heard of  firanger Way of\
Eiching. However,  mention it here to thew, that  diligent Man,\
getting\
\
\
Of Engraving.\
  better Inftruction, may in Time gain his Point. Its certain,\
that few young Men would have had Patience enough to drudge as  without inftruction; but that an induftrious Tyro, after leaving\
his Mafter, may postibly improve through Diligence and Study is very\
natural; even to as to excel him in Neatness, Smoothness and Expedi-\
tion, as well in Erching as Engraving,  mean, in the Use of the Graver\
and Needle, but not in Knowledge. By Knowledge  undertland,\
keeping the Likeness of  beautiful Face, Hands and Feet, according\
to what we fay in the fecond Chapter, that the Knowledge confifts in \
correlt Our-line, Proportion, Light and Shade, and Peripective: For\
we commonly fee the greatell Faults committed in the aforelaid Parts,\
for want of Knowledge, and not inuring themfelves to drace by Hand\
large Things after small, and the centrary,, but accultoming them-\
felves to squaring;  Practice not difficult to  Swincherd'\'92 Boy, if he\
underffood the Divition of Squares and Management of Chalk. But they\
may yet be erroneousenough in tracing their Object on the Plate, though\
drawn upon Squares; for, miffing the Out-line in the leaft, either inwardly\
of outwardly, it prefently becomes too lirtle or too big: But the Tyro\
cannot fee this for want of due Knowledge: And tho' he may be fen-\
fible, that here or there he has  little miffed the Our-line, yet he\
palles it over as  Matter of no great Moment; and if he propofe to\
help it in the Erching or Engraving, he may poffibly forget it before\
he come to far in the Work: He commonly thinks no farther than\
what is already on the Plate. Whence we may eafily conclude, that he\
who knows not what conflitutes Beaury, can be as little fenlible that \
mall Difference in  Face, rm or Hand is of any great Confequence.\
Another Difficulty, no less than the former, is, that tho', the Tyro have\
the Out-line correctly drawn on the Plite, yet he may ranover it when\
he comes to sbade or batch. And as this frequently happens,  shall here\
give the Reafon of it.\
In either Engraving or Eiching any Thing, the Off-work, whether\
Buildings, Landskip or even the Grounds, ought always to be begus\
fift, that, by referving the principal Things for the laft, the Hand may\
be prepared to handlethem with more Boldness. Now, the Tyro being\
to eagrave or etch  Ground behind his Figure, be it naked or dreft, he\
will not only (especially in Engraving) end his Harching againtt the\
Out-line, but fomerimes exceed it; whereby the Parts, whether Arm,\
Leg or Hand, muff needs lofe their true Proportion and Quality: And\
thus, the almoff imperceptible and tender rifing Mufcles, Foldsand Hol\

 are made even and confequently fliff and formal Neverthelefs\
the Work goes on; and when they come to fee the Miftake, they fcrape,\
burnith and rub to bring it right again; which  grant is well enough\
in cafe of Need. But alas! How feldom is it prattifed? If it be fome-\
thing of no great Contequence, it remains as it was, without further\
Iafpedion. Thisl know, not by Hearfay bat Experience. Wherefore\
they, who have an laclination for Engraving, should apply to  Painter\
for lattraction in beautral Proportion, and in drawing every Thing by\
Hard, wheeker Prints, Drawings, Paintings, Plailter-figures, even the\
Lite xtolf. For Painters firff reach the Theory, or Knowledge of Pro\
pertion, and then the Practice of Colouring; whereas many Engravers\
begin with the Pridice or Handling.\
As for the straping, turnisbing, and rubbing eut before-mentioned,\
it is  Point which ought to be well underftood, becaufe it affets\
not either the too great Darkneis or Hardnets of the Hatching, but the\
Ost-line; as  shall thew by the Example of the Faces in Plate\
IXII.\
In the Pace , the hatch\'92 Ground runs over the Outline of the\
Check; whereby it appears more funk in, as in that of , and thus\
the Out-line is loff. Now, this Face being to be finithed, and the\
Check brought right again, to much muft be fcraped off within the\
Line, as to give the Check irs former Swell; and if the Face be\
 fourth Part less, the Difference will be to much the greater, epc-\
cially in  Portrait, and greater sill if it be in Profile; as Face \
thews, wherein we fee, how little foever be taken off with the Ground\
from the Tip of the Nofe, Mouth and Chin, it will produce another\
Aspect: Whence tis evident, what  vall Alceration this muft caute\
in the Likenets.\
in this Art as well as Painting, it is  conflant Rule to begin\
with the Ground or Back-work; and Engravers and Erchers do it for\
the fame Reafon as Painters: For, when the principal Figures are fr-\
nished, the whole Piece is reckoned as good as done: The general Re.\
ronching is only to bring Harmony or Keeping into the Work; here\
fomewhar more Strength, there more Faintness, (Oc. But what we\

tis bit; as in , when the Hatchings which takes away the Swell\
from the Checks, is stopped up with Stop ground, whether then the\
former Roundness cannot be again ferch\'92 out, with  fine Needle, on\
the same Ground, that all may bite together?  antwer, that this will\
make bad Work: But if fomething be wanting, it muft be touched\
up with the Graver. However,  shall thew another Method: Make\
 Burnither pretty hot, and rub it gently and speedily over the Part you\
would have out, and then it will clofe up the Harching, to that you\
need neither to fop up nor bite. Now etch thereon what is neceffary.\
and thus all may be bit at once. Thefe Osfervations, especially that\
of not carelessly spoiling the Out line, as in the Examples  and , are\
very needful.\
Let any Perfon now confider, how litile  fine Ordonnance of  fi-\
mous Mafter, when put out of Hand in fuch  Condition, can te like\

that without the former Knowledge it is imposfible to become  good\

the Miftakes to be apparent and convincing, cannot poffibly mend them.\
Even great Mafters fometimes blunder; as we fee in Asdran' Battles.\

to lay it of once as far it ought to be, and then somewbat to Hop up\
the Ends or Extremities. He, who negleds this, is obliged to make\
thift with fifging; yet that mutt not be too closs. The beft Way is,\
firff, with  fine Needle, to continue the Harching  little further, and\
then, with  finer, to extend it till if come to nothing; which we call\
broken Haiching, as was old Vifcher'\'92 Way in his Boors after Cfade,\
whereby he pretily expreffed the Colour of  Face, and fetched out\

to one who has not got the Firmaets of the Needle. If you would\

make it your Practice, you need not Rop to foften the Hatching; for\
the Points thus lengthened anfiver the same Purpose; and then you\
can proceed with Certainty, especially if you ufe the fame Needle with\
which the Hatching is continued in the Light, round the Relief; the\
Shades again ought to be fofcened with the fame Needle that made\
them: Then the slipping of the large Needle in the Shade will not be\
 visible: Fet, would you work the laft sipping in the Light with\
 fimaller Needle, you may; but, becaufe the Shade ends more fuddenly\
than the Relief in the Light,  should ufe no others; for the Ripping\
is  nice Point to him who will be curious. The Stips ought allo\
to be equal,  fay, equally diffant, and not to come between the Ex-\
tremities of the Strokes. If it be asked, whether any Thing, harch\'92\
teo wide, can be darkened with slipping intlead of  third Stroke?\
My Opinion is, that it. may ; and that any flight Thing can be per-\
formed in this Manner: But the Work is more tedious. Things to\
touched up look very neat: For by Hrong Strokes, fainter ones, more\
foint and Points, we can very commodioufly darken an Object more or\
lets at pleafure. Bonlanger has, in my Opinion, over-slipp\'92 his\
Prints; which makes them look rather like Ministure than any Thing\
elle; whereforeI cannot much commend hipping: And why: Becouse of\
the Inequality and Hungriness of the Points or Stips, occasioned by\
touching one barder than anoiber, whereby, in biring, one penciraies.\
the Copper more than another, be the Dot ever fo small Add to\
this, the impesfibilny of making the stips perfectly round. They will\
always be more or less lengish; as may be easily proved by  magnify-\
ing Class.\
 have feen, in engraved Prints of Gotteins, the faint Tint upon\
the Relief cross -harch\'92, as well as in the Shade; but this is only pro-\
per for Engraving, effecially in Hligh Fmishing; becaufe, in Eiching,\
the Crotshatching expreffes  coming Shade, and then it may be\
very well effected by Hipping, as brosd-lighted Objects want not fo\
much Darknets in the Light.\
Now, if any Thing should happen to be amiss, and you\
would beat it out and mend it, take  Proof and fatten it nestly be-\
hind your Plate, and then beat out what you would have away. This\
may be Done even to an Hair; and if you care not to firike on the\
Paper; you may mark the Place with  sharp Point on the Copper,\
to as to fee it; which will do as well, though the fpoiling  Proof\
is but  Trifle: Vet the Proof, when once dry, is no more fit forthis\
Ofe:\

Ufe: Wherefore the Work muft be done as foon as the Proof comes\
from the Press. For,\
being werted again, it will always be uncertain,\
and unlike the Plate. In order to find thefe lictle Places of mishir\
Spors with ftill greater Eafe ( Mechod which many Engravers make\
 Secret of) take  fine Thread or String, and put it crosswife about\
the Plate, tring it on the Edges, to that the Center of the Cross\
come exactly upon the misbit Spor or Place: Then laying the Place,\
Backlide upwards, on  imooth and hard Stone, beat the Place gently\
with  pointed Hammer; and then, with fome Stuff taken from the\
Oit-lone, rub it out. Thus you may find all the Places, how small\
foever, even to an Hair, on the Backfide of the Plate.\

 we have afferted, that each Object requires almoft  particular\
 Fanding, to  think Basereless call for it: For manr, who\
can eich well after  fine Pifture or Drawing, are at  Loss when\
ther come to imitace and reprefent  Batsreliet. They lay the Strokes\
therein as in other Objects; tho', in my Opinion, the Difference be\
very great; especally, if we would not handle them in the Manner\
of Perrier and Pictro Sanrs, but according to Rule; tho' the former\
underflood in the bed of the two, fince his Works better preserve ite\
Stoniness and Design; and yer, he has added some Things of his own:\
But the other has done it to fuch Excgs, as thereby to render his\
orks obicure. His Folds indeed are tas, yer luperffuous, and impro-\
per for Stone, and more like Gold, Sil, or or Bronze; appearing better\
in  Print than in Stone. In my Opinion, Sany underftood not the\
Naked, Proportion, Mukeling, or Mocion; wherefore  cannot by anj\
means allow him the Preference. The Trurh is, they are good for \
Drawing; but were they to be compared with the Life, we should df\
cover  great Difference. In the next Place, it is abfurd to imagise\
that to many Bals-reliets as are found at Rome and in other Places\
both under Cover and exposed, in and upon the Triumphal Arches\
Frizes, Niches, Pediments, Pedeftals,ancient Walls, Tombs, Columasent\

 was once asked, whether, fince the Batsreliefs fland in many dif\
ferent Places, Moulds or Modets have not fometimes been taken from\
them by one or other, from which they sbadowed their Drowings, dit-\
poting thefe Models, asufual, in  left or right Light, as they thought\
proper: Which is not improbable. We might likewife light fome\
from above, others from below, from  Side, frenting and from be-\
kind, in order to ufe them on any Occation; which would be  great\
Help to thofe who know little or nothing of Modelling.\
We have faid, that we think the Bassreliefs of Perrier better in\
Design than thofe of Pietro Sanci, but much inferior in Finishing; tho'\
the Works of the latter, for the Reafon before affigned, have na ff\
finity with the Stoniness. And yet tome think, that were the Figures\
 or  Feet high, they would have another Look; for then the Parts\
would appear more grand; and thole of Perrier on the other Hand,\
too flim and dull; which  do not difown: Neverthelels it muft be \
greed, that this Obfervation is good, in order to thew the Difference\
between carving in Stone, and chasing in Gold, or Silver. But itslike\
wife true, that had Perrier finithed his Drawings as well as Santi, they\
would have been much finer and more ufeful: For its eafier to leave\
out Superffuities than make Addicions. Iis not improbable, that Suntis\
Intention, by his Method of Management, was, that he might\
be of greater Service to Painters, Statuaries, and Chafers than Per-\
rier.\
We have affirmed, that Pietre Santi has possibly added much of his\
own. Now, it is alfo not unlikely, that Perrier drew his Objects from\
 greater Diffance than Santi, whereby he could not fee all the minute\
Parts: And  cannot but at the fame Time think, that Santi defigned\
moft of his Bats reliefs affer undamaged Within door-Work, in Halls,\
Chambers, and other inclofed Places; whereas Perrier poffibly took his\
from Without door-Work, luch as Pediments, Froncifpieces, Frizes and\
the like, half eaten up by the Weather. We might kill fubjoin, that Per.\
rier worked only to thew the World that fuch excellent Things were at\
Rome, and at the fame Time to difplay his light and firm Manner\
of Drawing; whereas Santi had not only  View to Profit, but allo\
to be generally ufeful to curious Artifts and others. How true this is\
let the Pirtuess determine.\

As to the right Hlandling of Batsreliefs,  think it abfolutely ne-\
ccffary, that every Thing be etched equally coarse or fine with one and\
tee Jame Ncedle, without any Difference with respect to Stuffs; as being\
the beft Method for reprefencing the Stone-werf welf; unless it were\
bit  grey one with  Fore-ground and Offskip, when the Strokes ought\
to diminith of grow faint, according to Perspettive.\
There is likewife lirtle Obfervation made about the Lights of Pass-\
reliefs For oftentimes Things, fainted sharp and in Sun-sbine, are exhi-\
bited in the Plate with  common Light, thro' the Roundness of the\
Srates; and fometimes we fee the contrary. But thefe are Liberties\
which neither Erchers nor Engravers ought to take. He, whole Pro-\
vince is to imitate, let him exaftly follow the beaten Path. in relation to\
elching Bass reliefs,  sharp Light or San shine is very improper, and ren\
ders them difagrecable. But as for Embellishments in Sun-hine, the Mar-\

  to be wondered, that, among the many Arts and manual\
 Engroving is to little, and Etching fo much treated\
of: The Reafon whereof is palt my Apprehention. Many Painters\
and Lovers, for the Encobragement of thole who would make it their\
Bufiness, or to fhew their Skill, have earneftly firove to fay fomething\
of it. But no Engraver has, to my Knowledge, undertaken the Task;\
poffibly, as not thinking themfelves fufficient for it; or elfe becaute\
they would keep it as  Secret from each other. But the moff pro\
bable Reafon, as  think, is, the late Appearance of this Art; which\
is evident, fince the Remans till their latter Times knew nothing of\
Irs certain, that Engraving, as well as Painting, is founded as much\
on Iecory as Proffice, and that both depend on eftablifhed and politive\
Rules, which, if orderly followed, will make  Man  Mafter.\

 not frange, that more Engravers have applied to Painting,\
chan\
Painters to Engraving; becaute the latter have to many excellent Books,\
for their Encouragement, publifhed by indicious Mafters: Whereas.\
Engravers have not one touching their Practice. But as every Thing has\
its Time, to we mult hope for it in this.\

We have before mentioned, Firft, On what Bafis Engraving is found\

Ritutes an agreeable Print. Wherefore we shall now difcuts the Ma-\
nagement of the Strokes in Objects, according to their Natures and Courfes,\
with respett to Perspective, and as well in Erching as Engraving, toge\
ther with fome Examples for illuftrating the Point, and preventing and\
correcting Millakes.\
in Plate  XXl. is  Wheel marked , having  Spokes, or Points;\
as allo  Staf; fer upright in the Ground, croffed by the Horizon.\
This Wheel thews, that each Spoke ought to have  particular Course.\
according to irs Turn, and that the Scrokes muft be governed by the\
Extremity of each Spoke, as may be here feen. The foremoft runs cir-\
cular; the second, eval; the third, almost freight, C Compare allo\
the foremoll Spoke  with the hinder one , how much they differ in\
Force; for  approaches, and  recires; which cannot be otherwife\
according to Perspective. Again, the Strokes drawn with  Ruler, and\
running off towards the Point of Sight, grow gradually finer and\
fointer. Now tho' the short or cress barching ought, by eftablished\
Rule,\
\
\
 Engraving\
Book KIII\
 to be mere visible and firong than the long, yet few are obferyed\
to make any Diffinet:on therein.\
We have faid before, that each Object, whether Fleth, Scone,\
Grounds, Csc. requires  particular Stroke; and among others, that\
Wood elpecially mult be thick-fircked glong the Grain, and contequently\
cress Patcred with  finer Stroke: But now we thew the contrary; for\
the cress ones are frenger than those running with the Grain; which here\
cannot be otherwife. If some fay that  contradilt myfelf, in making\
the Crols-drokes thus againtt the Grain;  shall, for their Sarisfiltion,\
thew mr Reafon for it. Obfervethen, that any Thing turned has no -\
ther Graintean what the Chizel makes; and as the Turner works againt\
the Gran, and the Wood retains more or leis Marks of the Tool, it\
mud be expreited accordingly in Engraving. But  fecond Queftion may\
be, whether it would nor do as well, if both the Harchings were equal-\
iy tre or coarle!  anfwer, ir would, as to the Sbade, but not with re-\
 ro the Sruff. For it would be more proper to stone, Copper, Wax\
\
and tuch like. Neverthelets thefe Obfervations are geas ally hule heed\
ed, tho' allo founded on certain Rules of this Art.\
As forthe Stoff, it thews, that the Srrokes, begnning round from\
below, grow Breighter as they approach the Herizon; and above the\
Her:zin, the same, but in  reverfed Manner.\
Now let us confider the other Example, in Plate  XXl. wherein the\
reiring Paragets thew the Diminution or Faminets of the Strokes, not\
only in fuch, but in any other Objects, according to their Diftance and\
Going off, the one in  greater the other in  lets Degree. Hereby we\
may plainly difcover the perverfe Notion of some Men, namely, that\
Diminaticn implies growing scanty or vider. See  with  fingle\
Stroke from one End to the other. Now, alcho' the Offfrokes feem\
neater than the near, yet they are not to in Falt: But as the Place di\
minishes, so the Strokes close and thin, in tuch Manner, that they be:ome\
aeither cleter nor more feanty. The Diminution of the Figures and the\
three Tskes bears the fame Conttruction. Nevertheless,  am fentible,\
that manr, even old Malters, do otherwife, in handling their retiring\
Obje.Ts. Figures, Trees, Offship and Sky more coartly behind chan\
forwards  have even obferved, that they clofe-harch the neareff and\
Darkeff Sky, and work wider and wider towards the Horizon; but this\
more in Erching than Engraving; poffibly to fave the Trouble of uing\
 or more Needles, or of fopping up, which is properly the Point this\
Example ans at. For  do not ask here, whether it creates more\
Trouble; but thew, what may poffibly be thought to be of less Mo\

gs ten or twelve Steps  part, and at the fame Diftances on the Parapet,\
three Vases, alfo numbered    whereby may be plainly perceived,\
how much the one differs from the other. But altho' in thefe Figures\
the Meaning is fufficiently to be underflood, to wit, that the further\
they are, the more fine and close the Strokes become, yer  have added the\
Vafesto them for the Sake of thofe who may be curious enough to count\
the Strokes. When they will find, not  Stroke more or less in the one\
than the other; which in the Figures would be redious Work. Ob-\
ferve, in the next Place, the Ground-sade of each Figure againtt the\
Parapet, each growing faint according to ir' Diftance, and with what\
Certainty the accurate Tints of the Figures may be perceived thereon;\
even to Know, how much they diminish and grow finer; and at the fame\
Time how much the Light differs. Bur let it not be thought fufficient,\
that the Shades diminith or grow faint, and the White remain all ever\
light; fince we know, that the Plan or Ground cannot thew its Levef\
otherwife, than by Means of Light forwards, going off darker and\
darber. For initance, were  white Figure or white Stone flanding for-\
wards, and you would place fuch another further in, where the Ground\
is darker, you mult govern yourfelf by the Groand where the firgt Object\
fands; as being subject to the fame Rule, if Things be well finithed.\
If the Plan or Ground be fnished, the Figures ought to be so likewife:\
Are they airily handiel anI brordlighted, the Ground mut be the same.\
And tho' the Ground, in its Colour, be more or less dark, yet that is.\
not regarded in this Cae, becaule we are (peaking only of the Diminn-\
tion of the Tints, confi-ing of White and Black. Suppote, the Floor\
were of white Mla,ble, and the Figares the same, or in white Draperies;\
the foremoft would be breadlighted, and the mere diffant less and less\
White, were it even in Sun shine; nay, if the Light came from bebind,\
or from assde, the most diffant would only keep an utmoft Heightening;\
and Killless, were the Colours exprefied in it; as they who underftand\
Perspective well know : Nor canit be otherwife; as may be feen in the\
firtt Example in the Child' Handholding the End of the hindmoll Spoke,\
which planly appears to have little orno Whiceness. And as for the Stuffe\
of the Objects, as Linnen, Cloth and fuch like, some may rather think\
them poffible to be so worked than the Nated; becaute, having already.\
engraved forwards as neat and fine as may be, we can therefore further\
in not express any Thing finer or neater: But fay, that as Things,\
having the urmoft Neatness, do not become neater by Disfance, nor al.\
terin the Eye, but difappear; fo, when the Objects are very remote,\
neither Silk, Linnen or Woollen is to be diftinguithed, to far as concerns\

the Histening: Bur the coarse Parts always keep their Forms. And this\
Obfervation respelts not only the three Stufts, but alfo Figures, Stones,\
Greands, Trees, &cc. Here tome perhaps may fay, how can the\
Strokes postibly unite with the Light, when they, as they retire, ought\
to be clofer and clefer, especially with the Air, (which, on the Ho-\
rizon, is clear and bright and free from Clouds) unless they widen\
more and more towards the Horizon, were they ever fo faint: To\
which  anfwer, as Experience will prove, that when the Strokes thus\
thin and grow fant in their going off, they certainly difappear and\
he away, nay, become at latt invisible, and unite enough with the\
ight, even were it Sunshine, tho' they be ever so closc. And fuch \
Length  think the Gravercan go when skilfully managed. In Etching,\
he Needlecan do the fame by flopping up.\
However,  queition not but my Propolition will be caxed with im-\
Poffibility and purzling Novelcy, especially by fuch as are not thorough\
Engravers, who may blame me for thus dilcloting the Grounds of this\
roble Art, and to plainly thewing Truth: But my Anfwer, in the\
irf Place, is, that  find myself obliged in Duty to do fo, fince allmy\
Withestend towards irs arriving at the greateft Perfeltion: Secondly,\
becaute what  lay down is prelcribed by certain Rules of the Mathe.\
maties; the few are sensible, that the Art of Engraving, in general,\
flows therefrem, and that different Objects require different Handlings;\
but rather believe, that  good Manner of Drawing will eafily lead to\
Engraving:  Notion true enough in Erching, tho' even therein the\
Point lies moft in the Biting and Stopping  As to Engraving, you\
mull certainly be converfant with the Handling and Force of the Graver;\
two Pomts not to be artained without great Experience: Tho, in the\
Begnning, tis better for an Ercher to have no Handling at all; becaute\
he may then gradually the better bring the Graver to the Needle, and\
in an Umformity of Strokes adapt the one to the other, and make them\
harmonious: Whereas fome, relying too much on the Graver, ule it\
here and there, in their flovenly Works, without any Difference, and\
that, with incredible Carelessnets; fometimes cutting  Foreground,\
Stone of Stem of  Tree, neat and smooth, which ought to be rough and\
knobby; when at the fame time they are working  Face or marble Fi-\

or Defire of Eafe, or their ignorance; lince fuch Doings are againtt\

The one is here and there sipp\'92, and the other is not. But perhaps\
the Plate was not well bit. It alfo fometimes happens, that we are\
obliged to rub out Things, which makes good my Affertion; For, if the\
Fault lie in the Plate, the Mafter ought, as much as poffible, to help\
it by his Knowledge and Judgment. Could he handle the Graver,\
why did he not thew it, and make Things agree ? And if he was not\
Mafter of the Graver, why did he not better follow the Strokes of the\
Needle? Had he, inflead of Cross harching, made the Strokes fomewhat\
finer and criple harched them, and ufed some sipping, then it would have\
been paftable\
There is another Print with an Ornament round it, reprefenting \

make the Graver and the Ncedle agree.\
 featible some will determipne, that many Things, fuch as Wa-\
\
ter, Silver, Gold and such like smooth and shining Bodies, can be more\
conveniently express\'92 with the Graver than the Needle: But, in my\
Opinion,  skilful Hand can give every Thing it' Naruralness.\
Tis. very Rrange to me, in the qld Prints, that the Mafters have\
in nothing reprelented the natural Qualities, but eich\'92 every Thing after\
one Manner, whether Wudities, Draperies, Air, Grounds of Stone; ex-\

and always made the Water dark and brown. Now, to create Difference\
in sining Bodies, my Thoughts are, that you firft lay the Strokesiffrong\

them by putting thinner between;  mean, in Water, black Marble,\

 it be asked, why in Eiching, the Strokes which are close and\
thick fomdimes fy ap, tho' the Plact be in good Condition, and the\
Ground netther burnt nor too hard :  antwer, that  have found by\
Experience, that when the Water is too flrong, and at firff bires roo\
tharp, we muft then take our Chance; becaute the Place, being cold,\
cannot grow warm to foon as the Ground, which therefore is jorcibly\
liffed from the Plate, and prefencly rifes; and the fooner, if the Strokesbe\
clofe and thick; which happens not to cafily in the render Parts, where,\
by the Thinness and Widch of the Strokes, the Water has not to much\
Power to get underthem. To prevent this, the Water mult be some\
what seeatened, and the Ground and Plate gradually made warm, in or-\
der to make them unite with each other; especially in cold Weather:\
For in the warm Months of Tune, Tuly and Auguft is not neceffary,\
becaute we then ule harder. Grounds.\
Now, to Know whether the Ground be in good Condition,  make \
Scratch of two, with  large Needle, in  (pare Place of the Place; and\
if the Ground come out of the Strokes like Dubt, it is then roo bard,\
but if in Curls, is in good Temper, especially if you can blow them off.\
If they cansor be wiped off with  foff Feather, bur stick to the Cround,\
is then foo foft. This is  nice Point. Ir fomerimes happened to me,\
that here and there they remained in the Strokes.\

they pur our the Out-lines, which are made too frong on the light Side,\
with Srop- ground, which, you know, alwaysllows more or lessover them,\
especially if the Place be hor: But confider what Trouble they mutt\
atterwards have, when the Our line is gone; for they are obliged to\
renew with the Graver all the Strokes running againit it. Wherefore,\
the beft Way is, to trace the Drawing nearly on the Place, and mark\
at firfl, fofly with  fmall Point, the dark Touches, as thofe of the\
Eyes, Nofeand Mourh, on the haded Side; yet nst os the Ligbt. But\

  ' no Figure of this Art is to be found in Cafar Ripa, as\
having been unknown to him, yet fince, in our Times, thro'\
its Foundation laid by Princes, and the Kind Affiltance of great Mes,\
is arrived at to great Perfection,  hope the following Figure will\
hot be unacceptable to the Profeffors and Lovers of it.\
Figure of the black Art, or Merro-tinco.\
Here you fee  young and plump Virgin, of  freth Complexion,\
and amiable Countenance, drelsd in black Vetvet, lined and faced with\
Sky-blae powdered with gold glittering Stars. She has  broad gold\
Girdle embroidered with black Bats, which diminith towards the Arms.\
Her Head attire is wanton and modiss, adorned here and there with\
small Flowers. About her Neck is  gold Chain, to which hangs \
Medal, exhibiting  burning Alfar and thefe Words, MA GNR\
BRIT ANNIE. in her right Hand is  small Tool like  Lan\
cet, together with  Feather; and in the Left  Table, whereon is\
painted an Head on  black Ground, reprefenting Nature. She poifes\
airily on one Leg, as if the were dancing.\
Explanation:\
The Art is reprefented young and plump, to fignify that the is Kill\
growing. The black Velvef Gown and Stars imply, that, like the Stars\
the is lprung from dark Night. The golden Girdle and Bats give us\
to underfland, that, tho' her Productions are not very lafing, yet\
the makes great Gains. The Chain, with the Medal and Alrar there\

and in Nearness has not it' Fellow; it may even compare with \
Painting, how foff and fivent foever, abaring for the Colours. Indeed\
in Duration and Wear Tis the weakeff; but, on the other hand, its\
Expedicioufnets brings in more Money.\
This noble Art is preferable to any Engraving in reprefenting uncom-\

 think it does not improperly bear the Name of the Black Art.  nor to be of above fHry Vears flanding, and yet is arrived\
at to great Perfection; tho' other Arts have required more Time. But\
Englind, where the Climare is healthful and temperate, has contri-\

Furtherame: For Prince Rupert gave us the firft Example. Wherefore\
We may rightly sile it soble. The firft Print  faw of this Prince was\
of an old Man\'92 Head, with  Cloth about it, taken, as far as  know,\
from an Iilfur Painting. It was defigned to fine and great, and broad\
handled, as if aathed with the Pencil by the bett Mafter: It even\
looked, by Reafon of the natural Sofinels or Mcling, not to be lets\

Chap.  many are to eager in this Art to legrs seat Scraping, as to neg-\
let the principal Part, the Ostline, which they often over run, and can-\
not be brought right again; and when cerreff Defgs is wanting in  or Print, what judicious Perfon will approve it? Indeed, we cannot\
manage here as in Etching, (where the Our line may be traced on the\
Plate with  Needle) For the Whire fometimes goes out, or is to faint\
as fcarce to be feen; belides, its inconvenient to scrape Figures againft\
 light Ground; tho' Artifts generally ule to work the Figure firft, and\
then the Offskip against it. Now, to prevent this Inconvenience, firft\
fcrape your Back-ground, and (pare the neat Out line; rather keeping\
 little from it till the Figure be finithed : Afcerwards, you may gently\
fcrape nearer. Thus you will not fo eafily run over the Outline, as\
when you begin with the Figure.\
There is  great Difference berween the Erching, Engraving and\
Scraping of Painters and that of Engravers; for the former, making it\
only their Divertion, do not finith Things to very highly as the latter\
who have been brought up therein, and make it their conflant Bulinets\
Painters are fatisfied with thewing only good Defign and general De-\
corum; becaute, while they were neatly to finith one Place, they can\
work another.\
This Art is certainly ealy to  Perfon of good Knowledge Butif\
the Work be not light enough at firft, go over it  second Time. indeed\
you muft not think to finith up atonce, becaute, rill  Proof be taken,\
you cannot poffibly know what Condition your Plate is in. Do like\
the Painters, firft to dead colour with bread Parts and then prip. Now,\
having  Proof, you can give the Work it' main Heightening, and thus\
with Patience finith every Part;  Point requiring neither much Time\
nor Study, but  little Obfervation., There is publifhed  Print of \
little Satyr, which in an Hour' Time  fcraped loofein my Hand, as\
 walked in  Garden; and, after  Proof taken, finithed in another\
Hour. Few learn this Art, becaute, as Ithink, they cannot be perfuaded \
how eafy it is, and with what few Circumflances actended: But should\
the Lovers fet about it,, we may poffibly in Time fee it become too.\
