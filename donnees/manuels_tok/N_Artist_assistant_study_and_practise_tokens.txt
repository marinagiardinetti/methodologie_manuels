the artist assistant in the study and practise of mechanical sciences calculated for the improvement of genius illustrated with copper-plates printed for the author and sold by robinson london and swinney birmingham prefage it is needless to apologize for sending forth this production as it is calculated to improve the rising gemius and to render the study and practice of the polite arts easy and agreeable to those who wish to tread the pleasing paths of science we need no greater stimulation to the study of the arts than due contemplation of their significancy to mankind and reflection on the estimation in which they have been held by the wisest men and in the greatest nations upon carth tn trace their beginning among men we should find them coeval with man hiinfelf the remembrance of the most extraordinary events as well as the learning of the first men was preserved by means of the fine arts re¬ calling to memory the great actions of their an¬ cestors they were the noblest spur to their pos- terity to imitate their virtues so beneficial to society and all great minds have ever been most sensible to impreffions of this kind it is not easy to imagine higher merit than that of inspiring those who were the most ca- pable iu exerting themselves in the service of human nature with love of glory and imn- mortality it is no wonder then if the arts were held in distinguished honour by the reatest kings and the most powerful coin- ronwealths and that mankind considered and- honoured artists as the common benesactors to human society and in truth higher anti- quity or more noble origin than that of the polite arts can not possibly be conccived we shall begin with drawing and range the treatises on designing perspective co- lours painting enamelling japanning lac- quering staining engraving casting bronz- ing gilding silvering in regular suc- cession under the respective heads illustrating and explaining the most material subjects with elegant engraved designs those mentioned above are the principal topies by which-this work is intended to pro- mote the improvement of the more curious kinds of manufactures but besides those ar- ticles there is number of others of con- siderable moment touched upon in tlis vo- lume some in more copious and others only in brief manner according to the im¬ portance of the matter or the room given for an advantageous enlargement the judgment or skill of the author in the design or execution of this performance he candidly desires to submit to the public and hopes that the system of inslruction here laid down will furnissi such ideas as with the assistance of practice will readily enable those who wifh to attain thorough knowledge of the arts to reach the summit of their de- sires which is his sole aim in publishing this compendium the artist ’ assistant preliminary to drawing the first and indispensible requisite towards forming painter is genius for the absence of which divine gift no human acquirements can compensate as without that spark of ætherial flame study would be misapplied and labour thrown away painting bears very near resemblance to her sister poetry and the painter like the bard must be born one picture as well as poem would afford little pleasure though formed accord- ing to the strictest rules and worked up with the most indefatigable attention were genius wanting to com¬ plete the design design which may be faid to be¬ like the celebrated statue fafhiioned by prometheus lovely but lifeless unless genius like the fire which he is fabled to have stolen from heaven darts its in- vigorating ray and gives soul to the finished piece but though genius is absolutely necessary since- nothing can be well done without it it will not alone do all things but must be assisted by rules reflection and assiduity the memory may be not iinproperly called the repository whcre genius treafures up the idcas which pafs before it in con¬ tinual succession from this repository tlie artist jselects such materials as the occasion demands di- rected by his judgment above all nature is the grand object of his me¬ ditation and ought never to be out of his sight na- ture is the only source of beauty sor nothing can be pleasing that is not natural the designer who oversteps the modesty of nature may court applause from the ignorant and vulgar but must not expect ghe approbation of the discerning and polite design comprehends invention and dispositions invention furnishies the subject and disposition places that subject in the most proper situation fon exhibition nature supplies the objects art con- trasts diversifics and groups them but as every painter may not have time or opportunity to view nature in all her various lights he will do well to contemplate the works of those great masters who knew how to make judicious choice of subjects and to execute them with taste and effect on these he may rely almost as confidently as on nature her- self and will find them of the utmost use to affist his invention genius need not disdain to call to its aid the productions of kindred genius and as wit hath remarked the young painter who should neglect the study of the most eminent profefsors of that science on pretence of setting up for an ori¬ ginal would be esteemed really an original an author whose title to genius is indisputable will not write the worse for having learned his grammar and for being acquainted with what other writers have said upon the subject which he pur poses to illustrate an intimâte knowledge of the beauties of the antients will be of no small advan- tage for they made nature their peculiar study and transmitted to us examples in sculpture which haved triumphed equally over the rage of time and bar- barians examples which have ever been consider- ed as forming perfect rule of beauty- close and servile imitation however is not what we would wisn to recommend man may find his account in attending to the manner and storing up the observations of well-bred and in- telligent acquaintance without ridiculously affect- ing his gait or copying his phrascology there are not wanting some who attribute the decline of painting to à dearth of genius whereas it seems to spring from very different cause the truth is sew parents arc judges of the real bent of their children ’ inclination another word for ge- nius and fewer still give themselves the trouble of seeking for it considering what line of life accords most with their own wilhes or convenience but of those few who really discover in what science nature intended their littlc ones to excel how rarely do we mect with one who takes the right method to insure success by directing their studies in the proper channel for though one should be apt to smile at the ab- furdity of those parents or guardians who find- ing boy possessed of genius for painting should by way of initiatinghim in that delightful art grave- ly recommend to him the study of the classics since it seems full as reasonable to expect him to become poet from contemplating the works of guido titian and raphael as to become painter from turning over the leaves of homer horace and ovid yet can any thing be more common than to see lad condeinned to undergo course of latin and greek let the profession for which he is de- figned be whatever it may but life methinks is too fhort to admit of six or seven years and those the most important ones being trifled away in learning what perhaps will prove of very little fervice to him in the situation which he is to be hercaster hereafter placed however if words instead of things must be the object of his study it is cer- tainly of as much importance that he should be able to clothe his thoughts in the habit of his own country as in that of any other living language is at least of as much use as dead one and it has been but too often remaked that many an artist who could exprefs his ideas with uncom- mon delicacy and perspicuity on canvass has so ill succeeded when attempting to describe them on paper as to incur no small share of ridicule from the coarseness and obscurity of his diction the subjects first proposed to the pupil ’ attention will be foand to influence his future practice more than may be easily imagined first inprefsions sink deep and last long and ill habits acquired in the early part of life will sometimes adhere too closely to be entirely removed by the strongest exertions of maturer judgment it will be therefore necessary to be careful that the works of none but eminent masters be put into his hands every figure nay every stroke given him as pattern should be maf- terly that he may be familiarized to beauty taste and symmetry experience has evinced that more real improve¬ ment will acerue to the learner from being used to copy things in relief than from copying drawings he will by this methiod become acquainted with the principles of light and fhade and the nature of the clear obscure by the magic force of which the paintings of patrhasius were termed realities and the fingers of apelles ’ famed alexander in the character of jupiter the thunderer seemed to fhoot sorward while the lightning appeared to slassz from them but but above all the young student must apply his taisk with pleafure as well as with perfeverance or improvement can not reasonably be expected if the mind instead of being sired with emulation loomily contemplates the cmployment as penance or must the patient artist be too easily satisfied with his own performance he must review it and ertouch its again and again he must search for its blemishes with the most rigid scrutiny till by repeated efforts he brings it as near to perscction is possible in word diligenee in the beginning fo any study will render the progress of it easy and the end delightful drawing has been by some people esteemed as an ornamental superfluity in education but it reality most usesul accomplishinent at the same time so elegant and agreeable an amusement for leisure hours that every neglector of it has felt and confessed its loss this is become so univer- sally known that nothing is thought more necessary so complete the education of youth than instructions for drawing especially if their inclination or ge- nius leads that way for exclusive of its great use to painters engravers architects engineers gardeners cabinet-makers carvers embroiderers statuaries modellers chafers tapestry-weavers and number of artists and mechanics concerned in design ing how very agreeable and entertainingmust it be or what can be more useful than for any one lo be able to fketch or draw fine view from building or any uncommon romantic production of nature nothing is more properly calculated for the man of common business or the gentleman in painting it is the sole basis on which excellence is erected and it is in reality the foundation of the polite arts the the materials necessary for drawing are black ead pencils camel hair pencils rule and com¬ passes crow quill pens red wvhite and black chalk crayons and indiæn ink the black lead pencil should not be held so near the point as à pers in writing the use of it being for the sketch or first outlinc of the piece which should be drawn with freedoin as any wrong stroké or line may with case be erased by rubbing the work gently with crumb of stale bread in or- der to acquire knowledge of the face begin with drawing the features ’ separate placing the copy at such distance as the eye may meafure both it and the drawing without moving the head sketch in the first outline very light and in rubbing out leave faint traces of the sirst fketch by proceeding in this manner without ithe afsistance of rule or compasses the outline should be brought to an ap- proved exactness and in placing the fcatures à perfect oval should be formed through which perpendicular line is drawn in the middle and acrofs the centre of this diameter line from one side of the oval to the other on these all the seâ- tures of the face are to be drawn according to the following rules for drawing head the perpendicular must be divided into four equal parts ’ one from the crown of the head te the top of the forehead two from the top of the forehead to the eye-brows three from the eyè brows to the bottom of the nôse four from thenco to the bottom of tlte chin the diamêter line divide into five parts ths breadth of thè face being supposed the length eyes this is to be understood in fulf tron face only and thiese proportions are raiher inéon stant in diss-rent men as to length and ihage bi in well proportioned face are nearly right and should be strictly observed when the face turns to either side then the dis- tances are to be lessened on that side froin you more or less in proportion to its turning most artists begin the drawing with the nose that being the centre and then proceed to the other fcatures observing that the top of the ear is to rife parallel to the eye-brows the eye to be placed so as to leave exactly the length of onc cye betwixt them the nostrils should not project further than the corner of the cye and the middle of the mouth should be on the perpendicular line in order to understand better tlie different turnings of the face it may be vory advantageous to procure piece of wood made in the shape and sixc of an egg draw line down the middle as before directed divide this in two cqual parts and draw another across the centre let the features be made as accurate as pos- sible from the foregoing directions by turning this oval great varicty of faces will appear according as it is inclined or gurned but care must be taken to observe in what manner the nosé projects be- yond the round of the oval perfect knowledge of this may cnable the student to form an idea of the face better than merely copying prints or pic- tures without it but aster this acquisition let the best drawingsor pictures be studied that can be pro- cured previus to which those paffions in man¬ ner of le brun may merit imitation thie po¬ sitions and actions of the hands are fo various no per¬ fect rule or method can be given sor drawing them time and painshould be employed in bestowing care on those members for it is very necessary not not only to avoid all lameness and imperfection but also to make them appear with life and spirit the atfainment of which must be acquired by appli¬ cation and practice carefully imitating such pos¬ tures both in hands and feet as can be procured in good prints or drawings lines and meafures and such mechanical rules are not only perplexing but rejected in the practice of the best masters the properest method is to lightly fketch the whole shape of the hand or foot with its position or action and examine carefully that it is correct rubbing out and altering till it is so when the bending of the knuckles the- veins joints and tendons may be drawn with much ease after the shape and propor- tion is made perfect in size and attitude after proper study of the legs arms hands feet and the student has reason to deem him- self sufficiently practised in drawing features the human figure entire should be his next attempt to meafure which according to lesson from tressnoy the aritients have commonly allowed eight heads though some of them have but seven but we ordinarily divide the figures into ten faces that is to fay from the- crown of the head to the sole of the foot in the following manner from the crown of the head to the forelicad is the third part of face the face begins at the root of the lowest hairs whick are upon the forehead and ends at the bottom of the chin the face is divided into three proportional parts the first contains the forehead the second the nose and the third the mouth and chin from the chin to the pit betwixt the collar bones are two lengths of nofe from the pit betwixt the collar bones to the bottom of the breast one face from the bottom of the breast to the navel one face from the navel to the genitors one face from thé genitors to the upper part of the knees two faces the knee contains half face from the lower part of the knee to the ancle two faces from the ancle to the sole of the foot half face man when his arms are stretched out is from the longest finger of his right hand to the longest of his left as broad as he is long- from one side of the breast to the other two faces the bone of the arm called humerus is the length of two faces from the shoulder to the elbow from the end of the elbow to the root of the lit¬ tle finger the bone called cubitus with part of the hand contains two faces from the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit betwixt the collar-bones one face lf you would be satisfied in the meafures of breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other so that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body you must obferve that thé boxes of the elbows with the humerus and of the humerus with the shoulder-blade bear the pro- portion of half face when the arms are stretch- ed out the sole of the foot is the sixth part figure the hand is the length of the face the thumb contains nose the inside of the arm from the place wlere the muscle disappears which makes the brcast called the pectoral muscle to the middle of thé arm four nofes from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand five noscs the longest toe is nose long to the utmost parts of the teats and the pit be¬ twixt the collar-bones of woman are an equi- lateral triangle for the breadth of the limbs no precise meafure can be given because the meafures themselves are changeable according to the quality of the persons and according to the movement of the muscles in drawing figure there should be slight sketch made of the whole not beginning with the head and finishing it then proceeding to the other parts method customary to many in consequence of which the head is often disproportioned or some part void of drawing sketch in the whole outline of the figure lightly and measure with the eye or draw the pencil or finger over any way to determine exactness without the rule or compaffes in begin- ning the sketch the héad is the first object then the shoulders in exact breadth the trunk of the body next observing with accuracy the breadth of the waist next the legs and lastly the arms and hands the principal difficulty is overcome when per- fect outline is procured after which the shado ws claim the attention of the student as every ap- pearance of bodies reprefented animate or inani¬ mate mate in distance shape substance and distinc- tion are perfected by this let them be first made broad and massy without attending to the many little distracted parts which fall under second con- sideration thus far is necessary to observe in co- pying prints or drawings but in drawing from plaister figure the eye will discover ét that side light- est that the light falls upon most well set figures have broad mafs of light which should be well attended to before the smaller parts are di- vided the outline should be exceedingly faint in such parts as receive the light the rising of muscle may by its appearance prove deceiving and scem darker than it really is but by castin the eye to the other darker shadows true degree of its teint may be afcertained and sometimes tlie light may catch on the projection of bone near the mass of fhadow which must be scumbled very tenderly or it will have harsh unpleasing effect this may also be regulated by comparing it with the stronger lights observing this rule with care and exactneis is the only true means of preserving the consistency of the whole together there is no branch of drawing or painting re- quires taste in the execution more than the drapery to manage the folds in such manner as shall give grace and dignity to the figure to dress it without fafhion prejudice or caprice so as the imitation may be taken for reality and bear the test of ages requires the fullest exertion of true genius many artists first draw the naked figure and cloath it after- wards forming the drapery to the shape and pro- portion of the limbs easy and flowing not sitting toò close but seeming to have free motion mak- ing ing first the great folds and tlien properly dividing them by strokes that do not cross nor are yct but somc uscful remarks from work lately published include every other necessary ob- servation concerning the human body some artists reject the use of drawings or prints for the students imitation it is say they ser- vile method of proceeding because it cramps the ideas and hence genius suffers too grcât à con¬ finement notwith standing this the usual prac- tice is to copy after prints and drawings at first and imagine experience has determined the ad- vantages accruing from this method to set the drawings ’ in particular of the most eminent art- ists before young beginner at his first commence- ment must be highly beneficial as it most undoubt¬ edly will prevent rudeness and inaccuracy against which the most exact can not be too much guard- ed how much more then ought the young stu- dent to observe this caution somc geniuses re- quire restriction and when this happens to be the case the placing of accurate works besore them must hold them in subjection sroin which alone correctneis is to be expected exact copies are absolutely to be required at first this will im¬ perceptibly produce habit of correctness till by degrees the student will make himsels master of those grand essentials to perscction truth bold- riess and freedom truth will be acquired by this accustomed correctnefs boldness and free- dom will follow after as the certain consequence and on those the excellence of the performance must depend copying the drawings of good masters has also another considerable advantage teach ing teaching good method of execution by which many laborious and sruitless efforts will be pre- vented of designing design is used in painting sor the first idea of large work drawn roughly and in little with an intention to be executed and finished in- large it is the simple contour or out-lincs of the figures intended to be reprefented or the lines that termi- nate and circumscribe them such design is some- times drawn in crayons or ink without any sha- dows at all sometimes it is hatched that is the shadows are expressed by sensible out-lines usually drawn acrofs each other with the pen crayon or graver sometimes again the shadows are done with the crayon rubbed so that there does not ap- pear any lincs at other times the grains or strokes of the crayon appear as not being rubbed some- times the design is washed that is the shadows are done with pencil in indian ink or some other li- quor and sometimes the design is coloured that is colours are laid on much like those intended for the ground work the cssential requisites of design are correctnefs good taste clegance character diversity expression and perspective correctness depends on the just- ness of the proportion and knowledge of anatô- my taste is certain manner of correctness pecu- iar to onc ’ self derived either from nature maf¬ ters ters or studies or all of them united elegance gives delicacy that not only strikes persons of judgment but communicates an agreeablenefs that pleases universally the character is what is pecu- liar to each thing wherein there must be diversity insomuch that every thing has its peculiar character to distinguishit the expreffion is the reprefentation of an object according to the circumstances it is supposed to be in perspective is the reprefentation of the parts of painting or afigure according to the situation they are in with regard to the point of sight the design or draught is part of the greatest amport and extent in painting it is acquired chief- ly by genius and application rules being of less avail here than in any other branches of the art as colouring the principal rules that regard de- sign are that novices accustom themselves to copy good originals at first sight not to use squares in lest they stint and consine their judgment to design well from life before they practise per- spective to learn to adjust the size of their figures to the visual angle and the distance of the eye from the model or object to mark out all the parts of their design before they begin to snade to make their contours in great pieces without taking no¬ tice of the little muscles and other breaks to make themselves masters of the rules of perspective to observe the perpendicular parallel and distance of every stroke to compare and oppose the parts that meet and traverse the perpendicular so as to form kind of square in the mind which is the great and almost the only rule of designing justly to have not only to the model but to the parts al- ready ready designed there being no such thing as design¬ ing with strict justness but by comparing and pro- portioning every part to the first all the other rules relate to perspective of the expression of the passions that language which above all others painter should carefully endeavour to learn and from nature herseff is the language of the paffions with- -out it the finest work must appear lifelefs and inani¬ mate it is not enough for painter-to be able to delineate the most exquisite forms give them the most graceful attitudes and compose them well together it is not enough to dress them out with propriety and in the most beautiful colours it is not enough in sine by the powerful magie of light and shade to make the canvass vanisn no he must likewise know how to cloath his figures with grief with joy with fear with anger he must in some fort write on their faces what they think and what they feel he must give them fife and speech it is indeed in this branch that painting truly soars and in man¬ ner rises superior to herself it-is-inthis branch fhe makes the spectator apprehend much more than what she expresses the means employed in her imitations by paint- ing are the circumspection of terms the chiaroscura and colours all which appear solely calcilated to strike the visual faculty notwithstanding which she contrives to represent hard and fost rough and smooth surfages which are objects of touch and thie by by means of certain tints and certain chiaroscura wliich has different look in marble in the bark vf trees in downy and delicate substances nay she contrives to exprefs sound and motion by means of light and shade and certain particular configu- rations in some landscape ’ of diderich ’ we al- most hear the water murmur and see it tremble along the sides of the river and of the boats upon it in the battles of burgognone we are really apt to fancy that the trumpet sounds and we see the horse who has thrown his rider scamper along the plain but what is still more wondersul painting in virtue of her various colours and certain particular tgestures expresses even the sentiments and most hid- den affections of the soul and renders her visible so as to make the eye not only touch and hear but even kindle into ’ passion and reason many have written and amongst the rest the famous le brûn on ’ the various changes that ac- cording to various paffions happen in the muscles of the face whichis as it wcre the dumb tongue of the soul they observe for example that in fits-of anger the facc reddens the muscles of the lips puff out the eyes sparkle and that on the contrary in fits of melancholy the eyes grow motionlefs and dead the face pale and the lips sink in it may be of service to painter-to read these and such other re- marks but it will be ofinfinitely more service to study thein in nature itself from which they have been borrowed and which exhibits them in that lively manner which neither tongue nor pen can express but if painter is to have immediate recourse to nature in any thing it is particularly in treating thofc very minute and almost imperceptible differ- ences ences by which however things very different from each other are often expressed this is par- ticularly the case with regard to the passions of laughing and crying as in these however contra- ry the muscles of the sace operate nearly in the saine manner to lionardo de vinci the best masters that painter can have recourse to in this branch are those dumb men who have found out the me- thod of expressing their sentiments by the motion of their hands eyes eye-brows and in short every other part of the body this advice no no doubt is very good but then such gestures must be imitated with great sobriety and moderation least they should appear too strong and exaggerated and the piece should shew nothing but pantomimes when speaking figures alone are to be exhibited and so become theatrical and second-hand or at least look like the copy of theatrical and second- hand nature « as the famous pietro de cortona was one day finishing the face of crying

not forbear cxpressing his approba¬ tion by crying out oh how well that child cries to whom the able artist said has your majesty mind to sce how easy it is to make children laughp behold will prove

examples of strong expression afforded by the venetian flemifn or lombard schools deprived of that great happinefs the happiness of being able to contemplate at leisure the works of the antients the

which are generally considered as the books of the ignorant and of the ignorant only he had undertaken to make the instructors even of the earned one would imagine that he intended in some measure to justify quintilian who affirms that painting has more power over us than all the arts of rhetorick there is not indeed single pic- ture of raphael ’ from the study of which those who are curious in point of exprefsion may not reap great benefit particularly his martyrdom of saint felicitas his magdalen in the house of the pharisee his transfiguration his joseph explain- ing to pharaoh his dream

make make any thing of the matter and it is probably from this very groupe that albani who studied raphael so closely drew the following precept of his ec that it behoves painter to exprefs more cir- cumstances than one by every attitude and so to employ his figures that by barely seeing what they are actually about one may be able to guefs both what they have been already doing and are next going to do this know to be difficult precept but know too that it is only by due observance of it the eye and the mind can be made to hang 'in suspence on painted piece of canvas it is expreffion that painter ambitious to soar in his profefsion must above all things labour to per- fect himself in it is the last goal of his art as so- crates proves to parrhafius it is in expreffion that dumb poetry consists and what the prince of our poets calls visible language erté hadéo ie hedeyrtén perspective derspective is the art of delineating visible objects on plain surface such as they appear at distance or height upon transparent plane placed perpendicular to the horizon between the eye and the object there are three forts of perspective viz linear aerial and specular perspective linear perspective to which most properly belongs our definition and which is branch of the mathema¬ tics regards the position magnitude form of the several lines or contours of objects and exprefs their dim inution aerial perspective which makes part of the art of painting regards the colour lustre strength bold- ness of distantobjects considered as seen through column of air and expresses the diminutions therof specular perspective reprefents the objects in coni¬ cal spherical or other mirrours erect and clear whereas on lawn and other plancs they appear con- fused and irregular these three sorts of perspective have cach its par- ticular doctrine but before we proceed on the ex- planation of the doctrine we must teach our pupils what are planes in perspective of which there are five forts viz perspective geometrical horizontal vertical and objective plane perspective plane is plain pellucid furface ordi¬ narily perpendicular to the horizon and placed be- tween the spectator ’ eye and the object he views through which the optick rays emitted from the se- veral points of the objects are supposed to pafs to the eye and in their passage to leave marks that represent them on the said plane geometrical plane is plane parallel to the ho¬ rizon whereon the object to be del incated is supposed to be placed this planc is usually at right angles with the perspective plane- horizontal planc is plane passing through the spectator ’ eye parallel to the horizon cutting the perspective plane when that is perpendicular to the geometrical onc at right angles.- vertical plane is plane passing through the spectator ’ eye perpendicular to the geometrical one and usually parallel to the perspective plane an objective plane is any plane situate in the hori¬ zontal zontal plane whiose reprefentation is required in perspective there are likewise several different lines in per- spective viz terrestrial line geometrical line line of the front vertical line visual line line of station objective line and line of distance -- geometrical line in perspective is right line drawn in any man¬ ner on the geometrical plane -- terrestrial line or fundamental line is right line wherein the geome- trical plane and that of the picture or draught inter- sect one another such is the line formed by the in¬ tersection of the geometrical plane and the perspec- tive plane- line of the front is any right line parallel to the terrestrial line -- vertical line is the common section ofthe vertical and of the draught visual line is the line or ray imagined to pass from the object to the eye.-an objective line is any line dravn on the geometrical plane whose represent- -ation is sought for in draughts or pictures line of station according to some writers is the common sec- tion of the geometrical and vertical planes others mean by it the perpendicular height ofthe cye above the geometrical plane whose representation is sought for in draughts or pictures.- line of distance is right line drawn from the eye to the principal point this as it is perpendicular to the perpendiculars of the plane or table can only be the distance of the eye from the table-the point of the distance in perspective is point in the horizontal line at such distance from the principal point as is that of the eye from the same there are other points besides this point of dis- tance in perspective viz the point of sight the third point the objective point the accidental point and the the vifual point wliich term point is used for va- rious parts or places with regard to the perspective plane -- the point of sight or of the eye is point on the plane marked out by right line drawn srom the eye perpendicular to the plane this is also called the principal point this point is in the in¬ tersection of the horizontal and vertical planes some authors call it the principal point and give the aame point of sight or vifion to the point wherein the eye is actually placed and where all the rays terminatethe third point is apoint taken at dif- cretion in the line of distance wherein all the diago¬ nals dratyn from the divisions of the geometrical planc whose reprefentation is required on the perspective plane -- an accidental point is point in the horizon¬ tal lines where lines parallel to one another though not perpendicular to the picture or repesentation meet.-—

of marble each foot square your first business is to draw an ichnographical plan or ground plot of it which is thus performed hav¬ ing made an exact square of the size you intend your plan divide the base and horizon into eight equal parts and from every division in the base to its opposite point in the horizon rule perpendicular lines then divide the sides into the same number ruling parallel lines across from point to point so will your pavement be divided into sixty-four square feet because the eight fcet in length multiplied by the same in breadth give the number of square feet or pieces of marble contained in the wholc then rule diagonals from corner to corner and thus will your ground plot appear as in fig now to lay this in perspective draw another square to your intended size and divide the base line into eight equai parts as before then fix your point of sight in the middle of the hori¬ zon and from the fame point rulc lincs to every division in the base after which rule diago¬ nal lincs from to and froin to answer- able to those in the ground plot and your square will be reduced to the triangle then from the point where tlie diagonal de intersects the line to the opposite intersection where the diagonal crosses the line rulc parallel line which is the abridgment of the square then through the points where tlie diagonals cross the rest of thetines wlich go from the base to the point of sight rule parallel lines and your square pavement will be laid in perspective as in to find the height and proportion of any objeëts as they appear above the horizon on fupposed planc sce fig xii first rule your horizontal line and fix your point of sight as at then mark the place of your nearest pillar by making dot for the base or bottom as at and another for the sum- mit or top as ’ at rule à line from to the point of sight and another from to and these two- lines will give the height of any number of pillars as for example suppose you would have à pillar at fix your dot for the base and rule from thence parallel line to meet tlie diagonal at then rule the perpendicular de to the di- agonal which perpendicular is the height of your figure required at or if you would place pillars at and observe the same method ruling the parallels fg and and the perpendiculars gh and kl will give their heights at the distances requi red to find the diameter or thickness of pillars at any particular distances you are also to be guided by that nearest the bafe for instance suppose your nearest pillar to be ten feet high and one foot in diameter divide it from top to bottom into ten equal parts and set off one of them upon the base of the pillar then rulé line from the point of sight to the diameter and you will have the thickness of- all your pillars on their respective pa¬ rallels or bascs the same rule exemplified in objects below the borizoxe sce fig xiii if you would know the heights of number of figures below the horizon rule your horizontal line qr and fix your point of sight as at then place your nearest figure or mark the dots sor the head and feet by the points and which an¬ swers the same purpose and rule from these dots to the point of sight the lines pand bp and ie you would find the height of figure to be drawn at rule from thence the parallel to the di- agonal bp and the perpendicular de will give the height required the same directions will shew the height of figure at any other distance you have mind to place it as at and by ruling the parallelsf and and from each of these their respective perpendiculars gh and no which perpendiculars will shew the heights of the figures at and to drav direct view see fig xiv to illustrate this example suppose you were to draw the inside of church as reprefented in this figure first take your station at the point in the center of the base line from which you have à front view of the whole body of the church with all the pillars on each side then fix your horizon at any height you think proper as at de bisect it by the perpendicular ea and where these two lines intersect is the point of sight this perpendicular will pafs through the center of all the he arches in the dome or cupola which centers may be sound by any three given points as in fig vii next divide your base line into any given number of feet and the visual lines ruled from these divisions to the point of sight will reduce all your objects to their just proportion by setting off heir height upon perpendicular raised at their re- spective distances the base in the example here given is divided into twelve equal parts of five feet each from which supposing your front co- umn to be thirty-five feet high take seven divi¬ ions from the base line of your drawing and set them off upon the perpendicular then sup- posing this column to be five feet thick at the base set off one of those divisions upon the parallel ik which is the breadth required so that by pro- portioning this scale to any distance by the fore- going directions you may not only find the dimen- ions of all your- columns but also of every distinct part of them as well as of all the doors windows and other objects that occur for instance having found the height and breadth of your nearest co- lumn draw from the top and bottom of the said column to the point of sight the lines hfand kf after which rule the line from the base of the column to the point of sight and you have the height and breadth of all the rest of the columns as has been already shewn in fig xii by ruling lines from the points to the point of sight you will see that all the summits and bases of your columns doors windows must tend immediately to that point and by lines drawn from the points on each side of the correspoudent points on the opposite side may be seen all the parts of your building lying upon the fame parallel to draw an oblique viexv sce fig xv first draw your horizontal linc then if your favourite object be on the right hand as at cy place yourself on the left hand upon the base line as at then from that station erect pependicular which will pafs through the horizon at the point of sightf to which rule the diagonals gf and which will shew the roof and base of vour principal building and will also as before direct- ed serve as standard for all the rest observe also either in direct or oblique vicws whether the prospect before you makes curve for jf it does you must be careful to make the same curve in your drawing to draw perspective viev wvherein are accidental points see fig xvi rule your horizontal line and on one part of it fix your point of sight as at from which rule the diagonals cd and ce on the one side and ef and and ce ’ on the other which will shew the roofs and bases of all the houses in the street directly facing you supposing yourself placed at in the center of the base line then fix your accidental points and upon the horizontal line and rule from them to the angles and where the streets on each side take different direction towards the acci¬ dental points and and the lines gi and gk give the roofs and bases of all the buildings on one side asl and mhdo on the other accidental points seldom intervene where the dis- tance is small as in noblemen ’ feats groves canals which may be drawn by the strict rules of per- spective but where the prospect is extensive and aried including mountains bridges castles rivers recipices woods cities it will require such an infinite number of accidental points that it will be better to do them as nature shall dictate and your ipened judgment approve to find the center for the roof of house in an obtique view sce plate iv suppose from the point of sight the visual lines and be drawn bc being one perpendicu- lar given and de the other rule the diagonals rom dto and from eto and the perpendicu- ar fg raised through the point of their intersec- ion will shew the true center of the roof as will appear by ruling the lines ge and for want of being acquainted with this necessary rule many who have been well versed in othier parts of perspective have spoiled the look of their picture drawing the roofs of their houses out of their rue perpendicular perspective is either employed in reprefenting tlie ichonographies and ground-plots of objects as projec- five plancs or in scenographies and reprefentations of the bodies themselves lchnography in perspective is the vicw of any thing cut off by plain parallel to the horizon just it the base or bottom of it so that ichnography is the same with what is otherwise called the plan geometrical plan or ground-plot of any thing scenography scenography in perspective is representation of body on perspective planc or à description there- of in all its dimensions such as it appears to thc cye the ichnography of building represents the plan or ground-work of the building the ortho- graphy the front or one of the sides and the sceno¬ graphy the whole building front sides height and all raised on the gcometrical plan projcction in perspective denotes the appearance or representation of anobject on the perspective plane the projection gr of point is point through which the optick ray passes from the objective point through the plane to the cye orit is the point where- in the plane cuts the optick ray and hence is easily conceived what is meant by the projection of line plane or folid the projection of the sphere in planc is repre- sentation of several points or places of the surface of the sphere and of the cirles described thereon or of any assigned parts thcreof such as they appear to the eyc fituate at any given distance upon transparent plane placed between the eye and the spliere the principal use of the projection of the sphere is in the constructionof planisphicres and particularly maps and charts which are said to be of this orthat projection according to the several situations of the eye and the perspective plane with regard to the meridians paral- lels and other points and places to be represented the projcction of the spliere is usually divided into orthographic and stereographic ortiographie projection is that wherein the super- fites of the sphere is drawn on aplane cutting it in the middde the cyc being placed at an infinite distance vertically to one of the hemispheres the laws laws of this fort of projection are these the rays which the cye at an infinite distance perceives any object are parallel right line perpendicu- ar to the plane of the projection is projected into point where that right line cuts the plane of the projection right line not perpendicular but either parallel or oblique to the plane of the projec- ion is projected into right line and is always comprehended between tlie extreme perpendiculars the projection of the right line is the greatest when that line is parallel to the plane of the pro- jection hence it is evident that line parallel the plane of the projection is projected into light line equal to itself but if it be oblique to the plane of the projection it is projected into one which is less plane furface at right angles to the plane of the projection is projected into that light line in which it cuts the plane of the projec- ion hence it is evident that à circle standing at light angles to the plane of the projection which basses through its center is projected into that diameter in which it cuts the plane of the projec- ion circle parallel to the plane of the pro- ection is projected into circle equal to itself and circle oblique to the plane of the projection is projected into an ellipsis stereographic projection is that wherein the sur- ace and circles of the sphere are drawn upon the plane of great circle the eye being in the pole of that circle as to the properties of this fort of pro- ection- in this projection riglit circle is pro- ected into linc of half tangents the repre- entation of right circle perpendicularly opposed the eye will be circle in the plane of the pro- jection the reprefentation of circle placed obliquely to the eye will be circle in the plané of projection great ciréle is to be projected on the plane of another great circle its center will lie in the line of measure distant from the center of the primitive by the of its elevation above the plane of the primitive if lesser cir- cle whose poles lie in the plane of the projection were to be projected the center of its representa- tion would lie in the line of meafures distant from the center of the primitive by the rcant of the lesser circles distance from its pole and its semi- diameter or radius be equal to the tang of that distance if lesser circle were to bepygojected whose poles lie not in the plane of the projection its diameter in the projection if it falls on each side of the pole of the primitive will be equal ’ to the sum of the half tangents of its greatest and ncarest distance from the pole of the primitive set each way from the center of the primitive in the line of meafures if the lesser circle to be pro- jected falls entirely on one side of the pole of pro- jection and does not encompass it then will all its diameter be equal to the difference of the half tan¬ gents of its greatest and nearest distance from the pole of the primitivc set off from the center of the primitive one and the same way in the line of measures in the stereographic projection the angles made by the circles of the surface of rthe sphere are equal to the angles made by their re- presentation in the planc of their projection colours metbhd of preparing the various kinds used in painting it will now be proper to explain in an easy man- ner the method of preparing the various bodies employed by painters for producing the difference of light and shade which may be termed either pig- ments or fluids as they are solid or aqueous and are distinguished in their several kinds according to the manner of working them as oil-colours water- colours enamel-colours but their variety are too numerous to be in general use most painters therefore select set out of them and become very unjustly prejudiced against those they reject it is no little impediment to their improvement in the profession that they are not more extensively ac- quainted with all the ingredients fit for their pur- poses those colours which become transparent in oil such as-lake prussian blue and brown pink are frequently used without the admixture of white or any other opake pigment by which means the teint of the ground on which they are laid retains in some degree its force and the real colour pro- duced in painting is the combined effect of both this is called glazing and the pigments endued with the property of becoming transparent in oil are called glazing colours as colours are obtained from various substances the means of preparing tlieni are conscquciitly vari- ous some being of simple nature and requirinig only to be purified and reduced to proper con¬ sistence or texture and others being compounds of different bodies to be formed only by complex pro- cesses it is therefore very difficult to give such ge¬ neral directions for the making every fort of co- lour as may be intelligible to all the utensils to be employed as well as the methods to be pursued be¬ ing such as belong to different arts and trades where neverthelets simple means and the use of such utensiis as are generally knoin may be suffi- cient to performswhat is wanting it is best to avoid all techriical terms and more complex methods of operation adopting such mode of instruction as may be universally intelligible -- we now proceed to the nature and preparation of the different co- lours as they follow in their clafses class ib of red colours vermillion is one of the most useful colours in every kind of painting except enamel or on glafs as it is of moderate price spends to greât advan- tage in any kind of work and stands or holds its colour class red scarlet or tending to the orange crimson or tending to the purple vermillion carmine native cinnabar lake red lead rose pink scarle oker red oker common indian red venetian rec spanisn brown terra di sienna burnt the artist ’ assistant extremely well it may be prepared in great perfection by the following process take of quick silver cighteen pounds of flowers of sulphur six pounds melt the sulphur in an earthen pot and pour in the quick silver gradual¬ ly being also gently warmed and stir them well together with the small end of tobacco-pipe but if from the esservescence on adding the latter quantities of the quicksilver they take fire extin- guissi it by throwing wet cloth which should be had ready over the vessel when the mafs is cold powder it so that the several parts may be well mixed together but it is not necessary to réduce it by nicer levigation to an impalpable state having then prepared an oblong glass body or sublimer by coating it well with fire-lute over the whole sursace of the glafs and working proper rim of the same round it by which it may be hung in the furnace in such manner that one half of it may be exposed to the fire fix it in proper furnace and let the powdered mafs be put into it so as to nearly sill the part that is within the furnace piece of broken tile being laid over the mouth of the glafs sublime then the contents with as strong heat as may be used without blowing the fumes of the vermillion out of the mouth of the sublimer when the sublima¬ tion is over which may be perceived by the abatement of the heat towards the top of the body discontinue the fire and after tlie body is cold take it out of the furnace and break it collect then together all the parts of the sublimed cakc separating carefully from them any dross that may have been left at the bottom of the body as also any any lighter substance that may havé formed in the neck and appears tobe dissimilar to the rest le- vigate the more perfect part and when reduced to fine powder it will be vermillion proper for use but on the perfectness of the levigation de- pends in great degree the brightnefs and good¬ ness of the vermillion in order thercfore to per- form this it is necessary that two or three mills of different closcnefs should be employed and the last should be of steel and set as finely as possible it is common perhaps general sor dealers to fo- phisticate vermillion with red lcad but to detect with certainty the fraud both with respect to the ge- neral fact and the proportion use the sollowing means takc small but known quantity of vermil- lion suspected to be adulterated and put it into crucible having first mixed with it about the faine quantity in bulk of charcoal dust put the cruci- ble into common fire liaving first covered it with lesser crucible inverted into it and give à heat sufficient to suse lead when the crucible being taken out of the fire should be well shaken by striking it against the ground if the suspected adulteration has been practised the lead will be sound reduced to its metalline state in the bottoin of the crucible and being weighed and com¬ pared with the quantity of cinnabar that was put into the crucible the proportion of the adultera- tion may be thence certainly known but if no lead be found in the crucible it may be safcly in¬ serred that no red lead had been commixt with the vermillion native native cinnabar it found naturally formed in the earth though seldom fo pure as to be sit for the uses of painting at least without being purisied by sublimation the mistaken notion that it would stand better than ver- million because it was natural production has made it to be coveted by painters who are curious on colours it is however not worth their while so be folicitous about it as it never excelled the best vermillion in brightness and what is generally fold or it is pigment compounded of quicksilver and ’ sulphur red lead or minum the goodnefs of red lead may be seen by its bright- nefs and mixture of any kind will make it of dull appearance it is-pn this account not fo liable to be fophisticated as white lead or vermillion it is lead calcined till it acquires proper degree of co- lour by exposing it with large furface to the fire scarlet oker is an ochrous earthy or rather irony fubstance and is the basis of green vitriol feparated from the at acid of-the vitriol by calcination it is kind of orange fcarlet colour and rivals any of the native okers from its certainty of standing and extreme strength and warmth either as ground or in the shade of carnations it is ufeful as colour in any kind of painting the manner of its preparation is is follows take of green vitriol or copperas any quantity and being put into crucible of whicl it will sill two thirds set it on common fire to boil takirig care that it do not boil over till the matter be near- ly dry when it will be greatly diminished in quantity fill then the crucible to the same height again and repcat the boiling and replenisn- ing till the crucible be silled with dry matter take it then from this fire and put-it into wind- furnace or if the quantity be small it may be con¬ tinued in the same fire the coals being heaped up round it let the contents be calcined there till they become of red colour when cold which must be examined by taking little of the matter out of the middle and suffcring it to cool for so long as it remains hot the red colour will not ap- pear though it be sufficiently calcined when duly calcined take the oker out of the crucible while hot and put it into water in which the parts of the broken crucible may be be snaked likewise to obtain more easily what shall adhere to them and stir the oker well about in the water that all the remaining vitriol may be melted out of it let it then settle and when the water appears clear pour it off and add fresh quantity taking out all the broken pieces of the crucible and proceed as before repeating several times this treatinent wath fressi quantities of water then purify the oker from any remaining soulness by washing over and havitig brought it to proper state of dryness by draining off the fluid by silter in which the paper must be covezed with linen cloth lay it to dry on boards common common indian red is substituted in place of the real kind brought from the east-indies serving equally well sor com¬ mon purposes giving teint verging to scarlet varying from the true indian red which is great- ly ineliried to the purple and on account of its warm though not bright colour it is much used as well in finer as coarser paintings in oil it is af- forded cheap and may be thus managed take of the caput mortuum or oker lest in the iron pots after the distillation of aquafortis from nitre and vitriol two parts and of the ca- put mortuum or colcothar left in the long necks after the distillation of oil of vitriol one part break the lumps found among them and put them into tubs with good quantity of water and hav¬ ing let them stand for day or two frequent- ly stirring them well about lade off as much wa- ter as can be got clear from them and add fresti quantity repeating the same treatment till all the falts be washed out and the water come off nearly insipid the red powder which remains must then be washed over and being freed from the water laid out to dry when this is designed for nicer purposes it should be washed over again in basons the grofs manner of lading it out of one tub into another not fitting it always completely to such ends venetian red useful to house-painters in imitating mahogany-¬ and is à native red oker inclining to scarlet and casily easily prepared by mixing it with the colcothar or caput mortuum taken out of the aquafortis pots and washed over it requires no other preparation for use than to be well ground with oil unless when it is used in miniature painting -- when it should be washed over with tlie utmost care spanish brown resembles the venetian red very much in colour but is souler it is à native pigment and used much in the fame state nature produces it being dug up in several parts of england no other preparation is necdful than freeing it well from stones and filthi and grinding it with oil to render it fit for colour- men in the preparation of cloths for pictures and other coarse work- caleineel or burne terra di siennx is originally yellow but when modcrately cal- cined becomes an orange red though not very bright it is native oker brought hither srom italy in the state in which it is naturally found it is calcined by putting lumps of it either in cruci- ble or naked in common sire and continuing it there till the colour be changed from yellow to red it is exceedingly ufeful in oil-painting and admits of no adulteration it may be distinguished fromn other ochrous earths by its semi-transparency carmine is bright crimson colour of great advantage in painting as well in water as varnish the prepara- tion of it is kept fecret by thosc who prepare it in persection and the superiority of the french car- mine shews that the proper method is wanting in england -- though some wrongly attribute the excellence to qualities in the air and water of france there are several recipes for this colour but rather than insert impersect instructions for an article of great confequence we choose to be silent lak the best of what is commonly sold is made from the colour extracted from scarlet rags and deposited on the cuttle-bone which may be done in the fol¬ lowing manner take -pound of the best pearl-ashes and hav¬ ing dissolved them in two quarts of water purisy them by filtering through paper add then to this solution two more quarts of water and having put in pound of scarlet shreds procured of the taylors which must be entirely clean boil them in pewter boiler till the shreds appear to have wholly lost their scarlet colour take them out of the solution and press them well dipping them aster in water and pressing them again that all the fluid they had imbibed may be got from them in order to be put back to the rest take then another pound of the scarlct shreds and repeat the like treatment of them in the same solution as also third and fourth pound while this is doing dissolve pound and half of cuttle- fish-bone in pound of strong aquafortis in glass receiver adding more of the bone if it ap- pear pear to produce any ebullition in the aquafortis and having strained off this solution through flannel pour it into the other by degrees observ- ing whether it produce any esservescence on put- ting in the last quantity which if it do in any great degree more of the cuttle-fish-bone must be dissolved in aquafortis and the solution very gra- dually added till no ebullition appear to be raised by it in the mixture if this be properly ma¬ naged the fluid will soon become clear and co- lourless and the tinging particles extracted from the shreds together with the cuttle-fish-bone will subside to the bottom and form crimson sediment which is the lake the water must then be poured off and two gallons of hard spring water must be put to the lake and well stirred about to mix tliem this being likewise poured off after the lake has again settled to the bottom must be replaced by another two gal- lons and the same method must be repeated four or five times but if hard water can not be pro- cured or the lake appear too purple half an ounce of alum should be added to each quantity of water before it be used when the lake is thus fufficiently freed from the salts it must have the water drained from it in filter covered with linen cloth which has been so worn as to have no nap or down remaining on its furface after the lake has been drained to proper drynefs it must be dropped on clean boards by means of proper funnel through which the drops being suffered to pafs and rest on the board at proper distances they will become small cones or pyramids in which form the lake must be suffered to dry and the preparation is then completed pink the basis of this pigment is principally chalk and the tinging substance extracted from brasil of campeachy wood it will not stand with oil or wa¬ ter and is seldom employed but for the coarse work of house painters or for paper hanging unless se- cured from flying with varnish when if good it may be substituted for lake it is prepared as follows take brasil wood six pounds or three pounds of brasil and three of peachy wood boil them an hour with three gallons of water in which quarter of pound of alum is dissolved purify then the fluid by straining through flannel and put back the wood into the boiler with the same quantity of alum and proceed as before repeat- ing this third time mix then the three quan¬ tities of tincture together and evaporate them till only two quarts of fluid remain which eva¬ poration must be performed first in the pewter boiler and afterwards in ralneo mariae pre- pare in the mean time eight pounds of chalk by washing over pound of alum being put into the water used for that purpose which after the chalk is washed must be poured off and supplied by fresn quantity till the chalk be freed from the salt formed by the alum after which it must be dried to the consistence of stiff clay the chalk and tincture as above prepared must be then well mixed together by grinding and af- terwards laid out to dry where neither the sun or cold air can reach it though if it can be con¬ veniently done gentle heat may be used red red oker is native earth brought chiefly from oxsord- shire and burnt afterwards by those who pre- pare it in large ovens till by calcination it becomes red it is very useful as well in the more delicate as coarser paintings in oil for it stands infalliby for nicer purposes it should be washed over but for others it may be used in the state in which it is sound in the fhops class ilt blue colours ultramarine is bright blue colour of the high- est value in every kind of painting being equally serviceable in all even in enamel it has à trans- parent effect in oil and in some degree in watera and will stand without the lcast hazard of slying by reason of its high price prussian blue has been much introduced to the prejudice of painting in ge¬ neral as tlie fkies of landfkapes and many other parts of modern pictures shew the loss of ultra- marine by their changing from warm or elcar blue to faint green or olive teint the methods liave been continually varied by those who have at- tempted class ii blue

take the lapis lazuli and break it into very small pieces or rather ’ grofs powder put it into erucible and cover it securely to prevent the coals srom salling amongst it caleine it then with strong fire sor an hour is thiere be any large quantity or less time in proportion and quench it when taken out of the fire in vinegar stirring them well together and suffer it to re- main in that state for à day or two pour off then the vinegar except what may be necessary sor moistening the calcined lapis lazuli in grind- ing which operation it must then undergo in mortar of flint or glafs till reduced to the greaf- est degree of finenefs those means may effect but if it appear yet too hard to be easily ground give it another short calcination and quench it second time in vinegar the vinegar must

and pour on it water of the warmth of blood let it stand quarter of an hour and as the water softens the cake it will let loose the finest part of the cal- cined matter which on genely stirring the water but without breaking the cake or separating it into lesser parts will be suspended in the water and must be poured off with it into another vessel the quantity of water must be then renewed and the same operation repeated fecond or third time and as the mafs appears slack in affording the colour it must be moved and stirred in the manner of kneading with the ivory spatula but et not not

dried and will be then duly prepared for use uitramarine is subject to be adulterated on ac- count of its great price -- this is frequently done by precipitation of copper made by alkaline salt and is very injurious because the magistery of cop- per if the ultramarine sophisticated with it be used in painting either with oil or water will change its hue and turn black and in enamel painting as soon as fluxed it will become green and consequently make the effect of the ultrama¬ rine vary from what is intended this fraud may be easily detected by pouring some diluted spirit the artist assistant of

this glafs must be treated in the same manner as the first observing when the colour has subsided the oil must be poured off and fresli quantity put in its place this having been likewise poured off the colour must then be well washed to free it from the remaining oil first in boiling water and af- terwards in some of the lixivium abovementioned made boiling hot also as much of the lixivium being poured off when the colour has subsided as can be separated from it that way the colour must be thoroughly freed from the remainder by fre- quent ablutions with clean water aster which the water must

yellows at present in use except the king ’ yellow but if it touch iron along with the least watry moisture it will be changed by it for which reason care should be taken to employ an ivory spatula

when dissolved with water cx- tremely well adapted to the pencil it is much used in miniature painting and drawings of small kinds there is fort frequently sold for it made as follows takke of isinglass six ounces reduce it to size bby dissolving it over the fire in double its weighht of water take then of spanish liquorice one oounce and dissolve it also in double its weigh ht of water and grind up with it an ounce of ivoory black prepared as above directed in add this mixture to the size while hot and stir the whole together till all the ingredients be thoroughly incorporated then evaporate away the water in balnco mariae and cast the remain- ing ccomposition into leaded moulds greafed or make it up in any other form the preceding are the chief of the substances here will be occasion to mention in drawing and painting but crayon and enamel colours will be created tof in their places of painting painting is the art of representing on flat supierficies by the duct of draught and the de- grees of colours all forts of visible objects this definition contains three things viz the draught the colours and the composition and thougl this last part does not appear expressed in very clear manner in this definition it can not- withstanding be understood by these last words visible objects containing the matter of the subjects which the painter proposes to represent the composition contains two things viz the invent ion and the disposition by the invention painter inust siud and intoduce into his subject the objects which he judges most proper to express anc adorn it and by the disposition he must place them in manner the most advantageous to draw grand effect from them and to please the eve in shewing beautiful parts for the draught.- painter must do it correctly with good taste well diversified sometimes heroic and sometimes rural according to the character of the figures he wants to introduce the attitudes are to be natural expreslive va- ried in their actions and contrasted in their mem¬ bers they ought to be simple or noble animated or moderated according to the fubject of the picture and the discretion of the painter attitude in painting is the posture or gesture of figure or the disposition of its parts by which we discover the action it is engaged in and the very sentiment supposed to be in the mind of the person repre sented the expressions must be just to the subject the principal figures having noble and sublime oncs and keeping medium between the exaggerated and insipid expression in painting denotes natural and lively representation of the subject or of the seve- ral objects intended to be shewn the term expref- sion is ordinarily confounded with that of paffion but they differ in this that exprefsion is general term implying representation of an object agree- able to its nature and character and the use or office it is to have in the work whereas paffion in painting denotes motion in the body accom¬ panied with certain dispositions or airs in the face which mark an agitation in the soul so that every passion passion is an exprefsion but not every cxpreffion passion the extremities mean the head feet and hands must be worked with more precision and exactness than all the rest and must concur together to ren- der the actton of the figures more expressive the draperies must be well ordered the folds or plaits thereof large in small number as much as possible and well contrasted the stuffs thick or light according to the quality and convenieney of figures drapery in painting -is the reprefentation of the garments or cloathing of human figures animals must be principally characterized by an ingenious and special touch landskape ought not to be cut by too many ob- jects they should be few but well chosen and in case great quantity of objects be introduced in it they must be ingeniously grouped with lights and shadows the sight well bound and free the trees different in form colour and touch as much as prudence and the variety of nature require it that touch should be always light the fore parts of the landskape rich cither by the objects or by greater exactness of work which render the things true and palpable the sky is to be light and no object on the ground ought to dispute with its æthereal character except smooth waters and polished bo- dies which arc susceptible of all colours opposed to them of celestial as well as terrestrial ones the clouds must be well chosen well touched and well placed group in painting is an asfemblage or knot of two or more figures of men beasts fruits or the like which which have some apparent relation to cach other in good painting it is necessary that all the figures be divided into two or three groops or separate col- lections such and such thing make group with such and fuch other of different nature and kind the antique laomedon is fine group ofthree beau¬ tiful figures the perspective must be regular and not of simple practice very little exact in the coloris which includes two things the local colour and the clair-obscure the local colour is nothing else but that which is natural to each object in what place soever it be found the clair-obscure is the art of distributing advan¬ tageously the lights and shadows as well on the par- ticular objects as in the whole of the picture on the particular objecis to give them convenient relievo and roundness and in the whole of the picture that the objects may be seen in it with pleafure by giving occasion to the sight to rest itself from space to space by an ingenious distribution of grand clairs and large shadows which afford one another mutual suc- cours by their oppositions so that the great clairs are rests for the great shadows as the great shadows will be rests for the great clairs in the description of colours there must be an ac- cord which may producc the same effect sor the eyes as music does sor the ears if there be several groups of clair-obscure in picture one of them must be more sensible than the rest so that there may be unity of object as in the composition there is unity of subject as to the pencil it must be bold and light if pos¬ sible but whether it appears smooth like that of cor- regio egio or uneven and rough like that of rembrant should be al ways fost as to licences if onc is forced to take any they nust be imperceptible judicious advantageous and uthorifed the three first are for the art of the ainter and the last regards history the invention which is an essential parf of the rt consists only in finding the objects which must nter the picture according to tlie imagination of he painter false or true fabulous or historical as to the composition- some have consounded he first part of painting with the genius others vith fertility of thoughts and others with the lisposition of objects but all those things are dif- erent from one another thought that to give lear idca of the first part of painting should all it composition and divide it into two viz nvention and disposition the invention finds only he objects of the painting and the disposition laces them the invention is formed by reading in the fubjects xtracted from history or the fable it is pure ffect of the imagination in metaphorical sulyjects contributes to the fidelity of the history as to the learness of the allegories and in what manner oever it is ufed it must never keep the mind of he spectator in fuspence by any obscurity as to the design which consider as the second art of painting the qualities or conditions required in design are correctness good taste elegance character di- versity expression and perspective correctness depends principally on the justness of the proportions and à knowledge of anatomy- taste taste is an idea or manner of designing which arises either srom the complexion and natural dis- position or from education one ’ master studies elegance gives the figure kind of delicacy which strikes people of judgment and certain agrecableness which pleases every body the cha- racter is what is peculiar to cach thing in which there must be diversity in as much as every thing has its particular character to distinguish it the expression is as already observed the repre- sentation of an object according to its character and the several circumstances it is supposed to be in the perspective is the representation of the parts of painting or figure according to the situation they are in with respect to the point of sight the principal rulcs that regard the design are that novices accustom themselves to copy good origi- nals at first sight not to use squares in drawing for fear of stinting and confining their judgment to they begin the practice of perspective rules in de- signing aster the life to learn to adjust the bignefs of their sigures to the visual angle and the distance of the eye from the model or object to mark it at all the parts of their design before they begin to shiadow to make their contours in great pieces without taking notice of the little inuscles and other breaks to make themselves masters of the rules of perspective to observe every stroke as to its perpen- dicular parallel and distance and particularly so to compare and oppose the parts that meet upon and traverse the perpendicular as to form kind of square in the mind which is the great and al- most the only rule of designing justly to have regard the artist ’ assistant not only to the model but also to the part already designed there being no such thing as de- signing with strict justness but by comparing and proportioning every part to the first as to attitudes in them the ponderation and contrast are founded in nature it performs no ac- tion without shewing those two parts and was it to fail in it it would be cither deprived of motion or constrained in its action as to expreffions -- they are the touch-stone of the judgment of the painter he shews by the just- ness wherewith he distributes them his penetra- tion and discernment as to the extremities viz the head feet and hands must be more finished than any other things as to draperies -- it is said in painting to throw drapery or give drapery instead of cloathing figure draperies are not to be set in form as our cloaths are but the plaits must be found as by chance round the members that they may make them appear such as they are and by an indus- trious artifice contrast them in shewing them and caress them by their tender sinuosities and softness as to the landskape.—this kind of painting con¬ tains an abridgment of all the others the painter who practises it must have an universal knowledge of the parts of his art if not in so great à detail as those who commonly paint history at least specu- latively and in general and if he does not finish all the objects in particular which compose his piece or accompany his landfkape he is obliged at least to exprefs in lively manner the taste and character thereof and to give the much more spirit to his works that it is less finished let landfkape be ever so well finished if the comparison of the objects does not render them va- luable and preserve their characters if the sites be not well chosen or are not supplied by fine intelligence of the clair-obscure if the touches be not judicious if the places be not animated by figures animals or other objects which are most commonly in motion and if the truth and variety of nature be not joined to the good taste of the colour and to the extraordinary sensations the paint- ing will never gain reputation among connoisseurs as to perspective.- some authors have imagined that perspective and painting were the same thing because there was no painting without perspective though the proposition is false absolutely speaking since the body which can not be without shadow is not notwithstanding the same thing with the shadow but however it is true in that sense that painter can not do without perspective and that he does not draw alike nor give à stroke of his pencil without perspective having some part in it at least habitually the colouring in its general sense takes in what- ever relates to the nature and union of colours their agreement or antipathy how to use them to advantage in light and shadow so as to shew relievo in the figures and sinking of the ground what relates to the æriel perspective the dimi¬ nution of colours by means of the interposition of air the various accidents and circumstances of the luminary and the medium the different lights both of the bodies illuminating and illuminated their reflections shadows different views with regard either to the position of the eye or the object what what produces strength boldnefs sweetness in paintings well coloured the various manners of colouring both in figures landfkapes as to the pencil-here the word pencil signifies only the manner of using it in the application of colours and when those fame colours have not been too much agitated and as it is faid too much tormented by the motion of heavy hand but on the contrary the motion appears free quick and light it is said that the work is of good peneil but that free pencil is of but little signification un- lefs it be guided by the head and shew that the the painter is master of his art in word fine pencil is to painting what music is to fine voice since both are esteemed in proportion of the grand effect and harmony which-accompany them the next thing our pupil painter is to provide himself with is colours for which he has in- structions fufficient to guide his choice in proper selection-his next care is pencils brushes to apply them there are pencils of various kinds and more of various matters the most useful are made of badgers and squirrels hair thofe of swans down and those of boars bristles which last are bound on to stick bigger or less according to the uses they are destined for and when large are called brushes the others are inclosed in the barrel of quill besides pencils we must have pallat which is little oval table or picce of wood or ivory very thin and smoothi on and round which the painters place the feveral colours they have occasion for ready for the pencil the middle serves to mix the colours on and to make the teints required in the work it has no handle but in lieu thereof hole at one end to put the thumb through to hold it with regard to the materials in painting the matter whereon they are applied and the manner of applying them is of various kinds lience came painting in fresco painting in oil painting in water colours or limning painting in miniature painting in enamel and painting on glass fresco is kind of painting performed on freshi plaister or on wall laid with mortar not yet dry and with water colours the colours used are white made of lime slaked long ago and white marble dust oker both red and yellow violet red verditer lapis lazuli smalt black earth all which are only ground and worked up with water and most of them grow brighter and brighter as the fresco dries this fort of painting is chiefly performed on walls and vaults newly plaistered with lime and sand but the plaister is only to be laid in propor¬ tion as the painting goes on no more being to be done at once than the painter can dispatch in day while it is dry before he begins to paint cartoon or design is usually made on paper to be chalked and trans¬ ferred to the wall about half an hour after the plaister is applied painting in oil is performed on walls on wood canvas stones and all sorts of metals to paint on wall.when well dry you must give it two or three washes with boiling oil till the plaister remains quite greasy and will imbibe no more over this are applied desiccative or drying colours viz white chalk red oker or other chalks beaten beaten pretty stiff this layer being well dried you will sketch and design your subject and at last paint it over mixing little varnish with your colours to save the varnishing afterwards others to fortify their wall better against mois- ture cover it with plaister of lime marblé dust or cement made of beaten tiles soaked with lin¬ seed oil and at last prepare composition of greek pitch mastich and thick varnish boiled together which they apply hot over the former plaister when dry the colours are applied as before to paint on wood-they usually give their ground layer of white tempered with size or they apply the oil abovementioned the rest as in painting on walls to paint on cloth or canvas-the canvas being stretched on frame you must give it layer of size or paste water when dry you shall go over with pumice storie to smooth off the knots when the cloth is dry lay of oker must be laid on sometimes mixing with it little white lead to make it dry the sooner when dry you will go again over it with the pumice stone to make it fmooth after this second layer composed of white lead and little charcoal black is sometimes added to render the ground of an afh colour observing in each manner to lay on as little colour as possible as little oil is to be used as possible if it be de- sired to have the colours keep frefh for this reafon some mix them with oil of aspic which evaporates immediately yet serves to make them manageable with the pencil as to oils the best are those of walnuts linseed aspic and turpentine the desiccative or drying oils are à nut oil boiled with litharge and sandarach others with spirit of wine mastich and gumlacca the next operation is to draw the design on the canvas and afterwards to prime the work whicha is done by laying lay of white all over it except on the lincs of the draught which must be kept visible then if the picture be history piecc or portrait the painter begins by the face or faces which together with all the other naked parts to be pronounced in the picture are called carnations the carnations are made with white and carmine and brown blue and yellow for the shadows ac- cording to the complexion the painter designs to give to the figure or figures he is to represent the application of colours in painting is con¬ sidered either with regard to the kinds of painting in works of various colours or in those of one single colour first in the larger picces the colours are rather laid on full so as they may be impressed or incor- porated together which make them hold the more firmly or else the more agrecable ones which dry too hard and too hastily are mixed with little colour and the clearest of the oil but in both cases the colours are to be laid on strong at first it being eafy to weaken those which are to be thrust back and to heighten the others the touches to be bold by the conduct of free and steady pencil that the work may appear the most finished at proper distance and the figures animated with life and spirit for glazed colours care must be taken that the under colour be painted strong and that it be body colour and laid smooth in finished works which are to be viewed near at hand the process is either by applying each co- lour in its place preserving their purity without fretting or tormenting them but sweetly sostening off the extremities or by filling up all the great parts with one single colour and laying the other colours which are to form the litile things upon it which is the more expeditious way but more apt to decay for the second the kinds of pictures in one co- lour are two viz camieux where the degradations of colours of objects afar off are usually managed by lights or with crayons and bafs relievo which is an imitation of sculpture of whatsoever matter and colour in both these the colours are wrought dry for the oconomy and dispensing of colours in paintings regard is either to be had first to tle qualities of the colours to appropriate them ac- cording to their value and agreement or secondly to their effect in the union and oconomy of the work for the qualities ’ it must be observed that white represents light and gives the brifkness and height- ening black on the contrary like darkneis ob- the light parts and by that they serve each other to loosen the objects proper choice to be- made of colours and the too much charged manner to be avoided both in carnations where red colours are not to be affected or rather resembling thè flesn when flead from the fkin how delicate foever being always of bloom colour in the drapery where the painter has his whole stock of colours to choose out of to procure good cffect and in the landskape landfkape to dispose those colours near one another which mutually asfist and raise each others force and brifkness as red and green yellow and blue to manage them so as that they may be accom- modated to the effects of the great parts of light and colours that the strong colours lead to the soft ones and make them more looked at bringing them forwards or keeping them back according to the situation and the degree of force required for the effects of colours they either regard the union or the oconomy with respect to the first care must be taken that they be laid so as to be sweetly united under the briskness of some prin- cipal one that they participate of the prevailing light of this piece and that they partake of each other by the communication of light and the help of reslection for the oconomy in managing their degrees re- gard is to be had to the contrast or the opposition intervening in the union of thie colours that by sweet interruption the brifkness which otherwise fades and palls may be raised to the harmony which makes the variety of colours agree supply- ing and sustaining the weakness of some by the strength of others neglecting some places on pur- pose to ferve as basis or repose to the sight and to inhance those which are to prevail through the piece to the degredation where the better to pro- portion the colours that fall behind some of the same kind are to be preserved in their purity as standard for those carried afar off to be compared by in order to justify the diminution regard being always had to the quality of the air which when loaded with vapours weakens the colours more than than when clear to the situation of the colours where care must be taken that tlie purest and the strongest be placed before or in the front of the piece and that by their force the compound ones which are to appear at distance be kept back particularly the glazed colours to be used in the first rank lastly to tlie expreffion of the subject and the nature of the matters or stuffs whether shining or dull opake or ’ transparent polished or rough the different colours which you are to employ in your picture are to be mixed as follows for violet colour take indigo white lead and lake mix them all well together and the more or less of each quantity will make it deeper or lighter lead colour is made of white and indigo well mixed together scarlet of lake red lead and little vermillion ’ though in fine paintings would pre- fer carmine with very small quantity of ultra- marine and still sialler one of fine ceruss light green of pink and smalt middle and light green of verdigrise and pink deep and sad green indigo and pink purple colour of spanish brown indigo and white well mixed murrey colour of- white and lake flame colour of red lead and masticot heightened with whitc but these gene- ral rules are not to captivate the imagination of painter no more than the following ones for good painter who has good natural genius for his art and takes pleasure in the practice thereos makes often new discoveries to render his draperies moré beautiful as for carnations they are always made of tho same mixture of colours the whole secret consisting in the judicious application thereof after painter has transferred his draught on his canvas and has primed it he begins his piece first by drawing the eyes or nose having while he works his right hand supported with moll-stick or stay made of heavy wood not subject to bend about yard long havingat the end which leans against the picture ball of ravelled cotton with leather over it the other end held with the left- hand making the white thereof with white lcad with little charcoal black this sinished he leaves from the eye in face full front the distance of an eye then draws the proportion of the nose after- wards makes the mouth cars this done he lays his carnation or flesh colour over the face casting in here and there fome shadows which he works in by degrees with the flesh colour which slesh colour is commonly compounded of white lead lake and vermillion or carmine this last being best there is no fixed rule sor heightening or deepening this colour for it is left to the discretion and judg- ment of the painter who must consult in this his own imagination with regard to the age country of the person whose face he endeavours to re- present then he shadows the face over as he sees cause and finifhes the nose compassing the tip of it with some dark or light reddish shadows which shadows for the face are commonly compounded ofivory black white lead vermillion lake fca- coal black the cheeks and lips are fhadowed with vermillion or carmine and lake mixed toge- ther and the mouth stroke is made with lake only as to the circles of the eyes for grey eyes they are made of charcoal black and white lead height- ened and deepened at pleasure the black circle of the the eye is made of umber scacoal black and little white mixed together the round ball in the eye of lamp black and verdigrise since the lamp black will hardly dry without it the same colours used in painting and shadowing the face are used in painting the hands and shadowing them between the fingers when painter wants to make flesh colour of swarthy complexion he mixes white le ad lake and yellow oker together and shadows it with mixture of umber and seacoal black for black hairs he uses lamp black only and when he will have them brighter mixes it with little umber white and red lead putting in more umber if he wants them browner and more white lead if whiter but if quite dark he adds à little seacoal black yellow hairs are made of mixture of masticot umber yellow oker and little red lead increasing the quantity of umber and red lead if they be wanted redder for white hairs he takes an equal quantity of ivory black and of umber viz half of each and tempers them well upon his pallat with white lead taking more or less of those three colours according as the hairs are to be height- ened or deepened the teeth are made of white lead and shadowed with charcoal black as to the different stuffs the figures are to be cloathed with it must be left entirely to the ima¬ gination and judgment of the painter the several colours used in painting are also called teints and semi-teints considering the co¬ lours as more or less high or bright or deep or thin or weakened and diminished to give the proper relievo or softriefs for distance to the several objects and the lessening and render- ing dim and confused-.the appcarance of different objects in landskape fo as they shall appear there as they would do to an eye placed at that distance from them is called in painting degradation as to painting in water colours called limning in contra-distinction of painting properly so called which is done in oil colours the usual colours are proper enough excepting the white made of lime which is only used in fresco but the azure or ul¬ tramarine must always be mixed up with size or with guin in regard to yolks of eggs they give bluc colours greenish tincture but there are always ap- plied two lays of hot size before the colours mixed even with size are laid on the composition made with eggs and the juice of the fig tree being only used for touching up and finishing and to prevent the necessity of having the fire always at hand to keep the size hot yet it is certain that the size colours hold the best and are accordingly always used in cartoons .this size is made of shreds of thin leather or of parchment to limn on linen the best is that which is old half worn and close.this is stamped with white lead or fine plaister beaten up with size which once dry we must go over it with layer of the same size the colours are all ground in water each by it- self and in proportion as they are required in working are diluted with their size water-lf the yolks of eggs are desired they must be diluted with water made of equal quantity of common water and vinegar with the yolk white and shell of an egg and the end of the little branches of fig the artist ’ assistant trec cut small all well beaten together in an earthen pan painting in miniature is delicate kind of paint- ing consisting of litile points or dots instcad of lines usually donc on vellum with very thin sim¬ ple water colours tlie colours for miniature may be mixed up with water of guin-arabic or gum-tragacanth the operation is usu ally made on vellum on which the design is drawn with carmine or somc other colour which may render the lines discernable the draught is filled afterwards with very thin and smooth lay of white yet some choose to paint on the naked vellum without any lay and in my opinion it contributes much towards incorporating well the colours that the dots may not appear so visible and so coarse as they do-without it when the lay is dry the painter searches with his pencil all the lines of the draught lest some of tlaem should be either much weakened or entirely obliterated by the lay of white then he begins as in all other paintings by the face dipping first the point of his pencil in water and rubbing it afterwards on the colour he designs to employ when thus rubbed he makes the point thereof with the tip of his lips and then applies it on the vellum repeating the famc process every time he wants colours and hav¬ ing different pencils for the different colours he has also before him shell with gum water in case he wants to dip his pencil in it as it often happens painting in mosaic is an asfemblage of little pieces of glass

others purple thers again are striped crimson on white or straw coloured grounds the green is the common green begun with sap green and finished with mixture of gumboage and indigo making some parts with guimboage little carmine and green as fading which which makes pleasing appearance in picture- though not in nature balsam the balsam is varied with white and red stripes sometimes all red to be painted as the other flowers so variegated the leaves are pleafant green and the stalk of fine red and very smooth and transparent sweet scented pea this beautisul blossom is thus variegated the two outer petals are purplish crimson the two inner are dcep bluc little inelining to the pur- ple the most inner part is white just tinged with purple the purplish crimson to be begun with deep carmine and finished with purple adding in¬ digo for the deepest shade the blue which in- clines to purple begin with prussian blue and as the shades grow stronger adding carmine and in- green jasmin our common jasmines are fnowy white which whén properly composed by throwing the flower artfully on the green leaves have very light and pleasing appcaraiice but the jasminc we have here chosen from nature is the large catalonian jasmine being the most conspicuous in shape and varied in colour the outside being pleafant crimson in¬ clining to purple and the inside pure white the leaves of both are deepisn green there is also yellow jasmine with leaves broader and of shiining green hyacinth hyacinth hyacinths arc blue or white others are white with faint tinge of crimson the blue oncs are begun with bice shadowing with prussian bluc and finissiing with indigo the light parts may be worked at discretion either leaving the paper by ncatly shading with bice or by laying it all over and heightening with white the white hyacinths may be coloured in the same manner as the white lilv for those with blusn of crimson faint tinge of carmine must be tenderly wafhed over and sinishing as directed for the white ones if ultra- marine is used instead of bice it will make the work appear more delicate the stalk and lcaves are blueissi green done with the same mixture as the lily auricul this beautiful flower is by the gardeners art so varied that particular description of its varieties would be endless much esteemed fort is to be coloured thus begin with pale lay of gumboage shadowing it with bistre leaving broad space round the centre white which part is to be sha- dowed with indian ink mixed with sap green then that part which is begun with gumboage is to be variegated with purplisn red made by mix- ture of carmine and prussian blue the hollow in the centre must be à strong yellow shadowed with gumboage and carmine mixed together this done it is to be neatly dotted with white mostly on the centre mixing indian ink proportionably with the white as the flower becomes dark the stalk and leaves are greyisn green to be painted with mix¬ ture ture of sap green white and indigo adding more indigo for the shades nemon of these flowers especially the double ones there is such variety and the colours on them so diver- sisied that we can only mention the richest forts and leave the practitioner to the study of nature that inexhaustible fund of improvement the large petals are white striped or clouded with carmirie the small petals are done with pale straw colour shaded with neat lines of carmine or green made with indigo and gumboage according to fancy the stalk is brown by mixture of carmine and sap green shaded with indigo and carmine the leaves sap green and finished with gumboage and indigo double jonquil this flower is fine yellow to be done with gumboage and shadowed with carmine and gumboage mixed together and the darkest parts with bistre and little carmine the stalks and leaves are blueish green made with prussian blue and sap green adding indigo in the darkest parts the upper part of the stalk is browii tulip this flower is not at all inferior to the carnation as to variety though somewhat different in dispo- sition of colour the tulip being generally orna- mented with stripes of various colours crimsons and purples upon either white yellow or straw colour ground are the most common for the mix- tures and shading which colours any student by recollecting recollecting the preceding directions will be en- abled properly to colour this flower the lcaves and stalk inay be done in the same manner of those of the carnation rose the rose is and very justly the favourite of the painters seldom left out in any composition where it can be admitted esteemed for its natural ten¬ derness of colour and boldness of shape it furnishes matter for the most masterly pencil our common method of colouring this flower is to begin with lay of thin carmine and to shadow it by using the carmine in degrees thicker and consequently darker this manner by its gay appearance at first courts the eye but is evidently erroneous for notwithstanding the finest colours we can use are but dirt when compared with the natural gaity of the teints on flowers yet the colouring the rose with carmine only gives it à disagrecable and un- natural glare to prevent which it is here recom¬ mended after the sirst or lightest carmine is laid on soften it with faint wasn of prussian blues then proceed with pure carmine and to give power to the darkest parts of the slower and roundness to its appcarance add little indigo if one is re- presented so much blown as to shew the buttons in the middle they are first to be laid with gumboage and shadowed with gumboage and carmine mixed together the stalks are brownish done with sap green and little carmine adding indigo for the shades on the dark side the upper sides of the leaves are done with sap green shadowed with gumboage and indigo mixed together to make dark green tlie backs or under sides are à dullisn green made of white indigo and little sap green it is not pleasing in naturc but to make some of the leaves ycllowish brown as if witbering gives natural and pleasant air in painting which is to be done with mixture of gumboage sap green and carmine the striped or mundi-rose this species of the rose is thus varicgated the ground colour is so pale crimson as to be almost white which is to be begun with lay of carmine so thin as only just to tinge the paper the striping with carmine deep according to fancy even as strong as in some tulips finishing the striped part with the shades usual for crimsons the pale part must be finished according to the rules for white flowers only adding little carmine so as to make it faint blush for the leaves and stalk the directions given sor the foregoing rose are sufficient ranun cul ranunclas are varioussy coloured some are white edged or coloured with crimson others straw co- lour or yellow striped with scarlet which may be executed according to the directions given for other slowers of the same colour repetition of the mixture of the colours being needlefs the leaves are done with sap green shadowing with indigo and gumboage taking the liberty of making some leaves yellowish or brown whieh makes pleasing variety in the work the stalk is to be made brown by mixture of carmine and sap green there is such an infinite variety of carnations that particular description of them would be end- less being composed of the following colours white crimson scarlet and purple and those colours so diversified that the student may take the liberty of his fancy without danger of deviating from what may happen in natiire the cup leaves and stalk arc pale blueish green to be done with mixture of prussian bluc sap green and white adding in- digo sor the darkest parts martagon martagons are some yellow others most rich fcarlet the yellow ones are done with pale gum¬ boage shading with bistre carmine and yellow mixed together so as to make pleafant brown at the base of each petal are neat spots of strong indigo the stalks and leaves are pleafant green to be done with- sap green and very little prussian blue the bottom of each leaf swells into roundisti knob which is considerably paler than the other parts the scarlet ’ ones are to be smootlily laid with red lead shading with carmine adding indigo for the deepest shades the style filaments and buttons are orange colour laid first with gumboage and shadowed with carmine poppy the instructions given for the carnation are ald that are required for this flower only observing that it is diversified by different colours on the edges of the petals not striped or clouded as that flower sun-flower the petals of this noble though common flower are fine yellow painted in the fame manner as the yellow part of the jonquil the centre is à strong reedifh brown iade with ycllow carmine and in- digo using more carmine and indigo for the deep¬ est sndes the leaves and stalk are pleasant green done with sap green shadowed with the same colour and deepened with indigo and guinboage il lilies are either white or orange colour the white ones are done by leaving the paper for the lightest parts and shadowing with mixture of indian ink indigo and very little sap green keeping as has been before recommended for other flowers proper gradation of the shades the but- tons arc orange colour and the style pale green the leaves and stalk are blueish green with mixture of sap green and prussian blue finishing with indigo the orange coloured ones are done in the same manner as the direction given with the jonquil spotting the inside of each petal with in¬ digo towards its bafe the buds while young are green turning to the orange as they ripen which makes pleasing varicty in the colouring double stock double stocks are purplish crimson or va- riegated with white and crimson the cluster of smali petals in the middle is green which diffuses itself faintly on the larger ones and affords plcafing ctiversitv the stalk and leaves are à whitisn green african africans are either yellow or orange colour the yellow ones are to be done according to the di- rections for the yellow part of the jonquil either pale or deeper at discretion and the orange colour ones as the cup of the jonquil the stalk and leaves are pleafant green holyhock holyhocks vary from the palest rose colours to the deepest crimson some are white which in afford an agreeable contrast to the other flowers by their beautiful shape but if reprefented singly it is easily imagined any of the other co- lours are the most interesting for which the me- thod laid down for painting the rose will answer- using the same colours deeper according to fancy preserving proportionable shade of colour that the deep shades may not appear too suddenly dark to drovn the effect of the pale colours the stalæ and leaves are pale green to be done with sap green mixed with white for the pale colours the same colour only less white for the next shade and adding little indigo sor the darkest snades passion flower this flower is in nature so beautifully singular in its structure that without the advantage of colour in which it is also delightful it would engage the attention of every curiotis observer of nature the petals are greenish white to be painted with mixture of indian ink and sap green leaving the paper in the light parts the th reads are so exactly set set and coloured as to form three circles of differ- ent colours viz the outer one blue shadowed with prussian blue the next is white to be done by continuing the stroke with slake white making the space between each thread dark with the indian ink and indigo the inner circle-is reddish pur- ple done with mixture of carmine and little prussian blue the centre of the flower is pale yellov the five buttons are yellow in the inside which is the part mostly seen by their curling back as soon as the flower blows the other parts which project from the centre are pale green excepting the three projections for the top which are purple the bud is pale green with tinge of red at its end the leaves are dark green to be done with indigo gumboage and little indian ink mixed together the stalk and tendrils are made brown with sap green and carmine the religious have named this flower from supposition of its parts describing the passion of our lord honey-suckle the outside of this flower is begun with lay of carmine mixed with little lake adding indigo for the dark shades some flowers in the same cluster are more purple than others wliich may be done at discretion to make variety of colour by adding prussian blue to the carmine the insides of tlie petals which are shewn by their splitting and curl- ing back at the ends are some white others straw colour the white to be fhadowed with indian ink mixed with very little sap green the straw colour with very pale lay of gumboage shadowed with bistre the style and buttons seen at the ends ends of the flower are faint green the stalks are purplish brown with carmine and litile sap green the leaves sap green shadowed with gum¬ boage and indigo heart ease the two upper petals of this flower are rich purple the other three yellow or straw colour edged and otherwise stained with purple or olive colour with very fine lines of deep purple be- ginning at the base and spreading delicately over each petal the stalk and leaves are pleasant green convolvulus bluc is the principal colour of the convolvulus but the base is stained with yellow which gradually becomes white and spreads itself in rays like star in the centre the leaves and stalk are whitish green pin the single pink does not admit of so great va- riety as the carnation but it is nevertheless so va- riegated as to make it an agreeable flower for sattins silks the most common are either white or crimson others are striped white and red others are white spotted with red others edged with red which may be worked according to the rules for the other flowers so diversified with the same co¬ lours the leaves and stalk are blueish green only at the joints there is for the most part yel- lowish tinge which is also at the bottom of the cup and scales painting on silks sattins having with the utmost circumspection laid down the rulcs for painting on paper we now proceed for the amusement and instruction of those ingenious ladies who delight in the abovementioned branch with the same care to give the following ne- cessary instructions when the outline is made according to the astist ’ sancy wash of isinglafs should with care be laid on to take away the glare and sleekness of the sattin otherwise the colours will not work freely the isinglass to be melted in very clear water over the fire so as not to be very glutinous otherwise it will discolour the sattin and consequently spoil the colours in the foregoing rules we have recommended for the most part the leaving the paper for the light parts of flower and working with colours mostly transparent but here the lights are to be made by small tincture of the colour of the intended flower mixt with flake white so much as just to make degree from the colour of the sattin if white or if any other colour to be mixed proportionably the colour of the slower for instance if blue slower the bice or verditer very small quantity of it with the white using less of it proportionally as the snades grow darker and in the most dark in- digo alone may be used it being by that time opake enough but great care must be used not to lay the colours on too thick otherwise they will crack little white sugar-caudy will be found very ne- cessary when mixt with the gum water as pre- ventive ventive to that inconveniency if flower hap- pens to be of so deep colour as not to admit of any pure white in the lightest of the parts fort of priming of white should be laid on after which when dry begin with the ground colour of the flower proceeding gradually with the shades as in the above directions which with lively flowers peculiarly chosen from nature for the purpose we hope will be sufficient to initiate our ingenious and fair students in this most delightful amufcment painting with crayons whether the painter works with oil colours water colours or crayons the grand object of his pursuit is still the same just imitation of nature but each species has its peculiar rules and methods painting with crayons requires in many respects treatment different from painting in oil colours because all colours used dry are in their nature of much warmer complexion than wlien wet with oils or any other binding fluid let this be prov¬ ed by matter of fact -- mr. cotes painted portrait of sir william chambers which is in lord bes- borough ’ collection an ingenious foreigner had discovered method of fixing crayon pictures so that they would not rub or receive an injury if any ac- cident happened to the glafs thé society for the encouragement of arts had before offered pre- mium to any one who should discover so valuable secret for which premium he made application mr. cotes being eminent in his profession was de- sired to lend picture sor the trial and give his judgment which was made on this portrait of sir william chambers the crayons he indeed so per- fectly fixed as to resist any rub or brush without the least injury which before would have entirely de- faced or spoiled it but the picture which before had particularly warm brilliant and agrceable effect in comparison became cold and purple and though in one sense the attempt succecded to the de¬ signed intention of fixing the colours yet the bind- ing quality of whatever fluid was made use of in the process changed the complexion of the colours rendering the cold teints too predominant for this reason in order to produce rich picture much greater portion of what painters term cooling teints must be applied in crayon painting than would be judicious to use in oils without any danger of mistake it is to be supposed the not being acquaint- ed with this observation is one great cause why so many oil painters have no better success when they attempt crayon painting on the contrary crayon painters being so much used to those teints which arè of cold nature when used wet are apt to in¬ troduce them too much when they paint with oils which is seldom productive of good effect another observation would make which requi res particular notice from the student who has been conversant with oil painting prior to his attempts with crayons oil painters begin their pictures much lighter and fainter than they intend to finish them which prefents the future colouring clear and bril- liant the light underneath greatly assisting the trans- parent glazing and scumbling colours which if they we re were laid over any part already too dark would but increase its heavy effect on the contrary crayons being made of dry colours are difficult to procure sufficiently dark the crayon painter therefore will find an absolute necessity to begin his picture as dark and rich as possible except in the strongest lights for if once the grey and light teints becomc pre- dominant it will be next to impossible for him in the deep shadows especially to restore depth and brilliancy having no opportunity of glazing or scum¬ bling to give the effect as the grey teints being mixtures with whiting underneath will contin ually work up and render the attempt abortive shall now endeavour to give the student some directions towards the attainment of excellence in this art the student must provide himself with some strong blue paper the thicker the better if the grain is not too coarse and knotty though it is almost im- possible to get any intirely free from knots the knots should be levelled with penknife or razor otherwise they will prove excecdingly troublesome aster this is done the paper must be pasted very smooth on linen cloth previoussy strained on frame the size according to the artist ’ plea- sure on this the picture is to be execnted but it is most eligible not to paste the paper on till the whole subject is first dead-coloured the method of doing this is very easy by laying the paper with the dead¬ that side of the paper should be pasted which has the strokes from the wires most evident that the painting may be on the smoothest side otherwise the lines which these wires have leit in the paper will prove troublesome and look unpleasant dead-colour on its face upon fmooth board or ta- ble when by means of brush the backside of the paper must be covered with paste the frame with the strained cloth must then be laid on the pasted sidc of the paper after which turn the painted side uppermost and lay piece of clean paper upon it to prevent smearing this being done it may be stroked gently over with the hand by which means all the air between the cloth and the paper will be foreed out when the paste is perfectly dry the student may proceed with the painting the advantages arifing from pasting the paper æ in the frame according to this methed after the picture is begun are very great as the crayons will adhere much better than any other way which will enable the student to finisn the picture with firmer body of colour and greater lustre the late mr. cotes discovered this method by accident and estecmed it valuable ac- quisition and remember on particular occa- sion he removed fine crayon picture of rozalba ’ and placed it on another strained cloth without the least injury by soaking the canvas with wet sponge till some crayon pictures are painted on vel lum but the animal salts in the skin very often cause thein to mildew it must be con¬ fessed the vellum gives tuc picture foft effect but its use can not be recommended in our unfavourable climate others make ule of smalt grouids le tour lately painter of note in paris often used them with great success the method to prepare them is to brusti over the paper with gum water waich directly strew with smalt moderately fine the superfluous part of which should be swept off with painter ’ brush when the gum water is perfectly dry on this the picture is to be painted but we have paper now in england to be procured of so excellent à texture as to render this preparation perhaps unniccessary till the paste between the cloth and paper was suf- ficiently wet to admit of separation when painters want to make very correct copy of picture they generally make use of tiffany or black gauze strained tight on frame which they lay flat on the subject to be imitated and with piece of sketching chalk trace all the outlines on the tiffany they then lay the canvas to be painted on flat upon the floor placing the tiffany witla the chalked lines upon it and with an handkerchief brush the whole over this presents the exact out- lincs of the picture on the canvas the crayon painter may also make use of this method when the subject of his imitation is in oils but in copy- ing crayon picture he must have recourse zo the following method on account of the glass the picture being placed upon the esel let the out- lines be drawn on the glafs with small camel ’ hair pencil dipped in lake ground thin with oils which must be done with great exactness after this is ac- complifhed take sneet of paper of the same size and place it on the glafs stroking over all the lines with the hand by which means the colours will adhere to the paper which must be picreed with pin holes pretty close to each other the paper in- tended to be used for the painting must next be laid upon table and thie pierced paper placed upon it then with some fine pounded charcoal tied up in piece of lawn rub over the perforated strokes which will give an exact outline great care must be taken not to brush this off till the whole is drawn over with sketching chalk which is composition made of whiting and tobacco-pipe clay rolled like crayons and pointed at each end when the student paints immediately from the life it will be most prudent to make correct draw- ing of the outlines on another paper the size of the picture he is going to paint which he may trace by the preceding method because erroneous strokes of the sketching chalk which are not to be avoided without great expertness will prevent the crayons from adhering to the paper owing to certain greasy quality in the composition the student will find the sitting posture with the box of crayons on his lap the most convenient me- thod for him to paint thie part of the picture he is immediately painting should be rather below his sace for if it is placed too high the arm will be fatigucd let the windows of the room where he paints be darkened at least to the height of six feet from the ground and the subject to be painted should be situated in such manner that the light may fall with every advantage on the face avoiding too much shadow which seldom has good effect in portrait painting especially if the face he paints has any degree of delicacy before he begins to paint let him be attentive to his subject and ap- propriate the action or attitude proper to the age of the subject if child let it be childifh if young lady express more vivacity than in the majestic beauty of middle aged woman who also should not be expressed with the same gravity as person sar advanced in years let the embellishments of the picture and introduction of birds animals be regulated by the rules of propricty and con- sistency the features of the face being carefully drawn with chalk let the student take crayon of pure carmine armine and carefully draw the nostril and edge of he nose next the fhadow then with the faintest armine teint lay in the strongest light upon the nose and forehead which must be executed broad de is then to proceed gradually with the second teint and the succeeding ones till he arrives at the shadows which must be covcred brilliant enriched with much lake carminc little broken with brilliant green this method will at first offen- lively strike the eye from its crude appearance but finishing it will be good soundation to pro- duce pleasing effect colours being much more easily sullied when too bright than when the sirst colouring is dull to raise the picture into bril- iant state the several pearly tcints discernable in ine complexions must be imitated with bluc ver- diter and white which answers to the ultramarine teints used in oils but if the parts of thie face where these teints appear are in shadow the crayons composed of black and white must be substituted in hteir place though all the face when first coloured should be laid in as brilliant as possible yet each part hsould be kept in its proper tone by which means the rotundity of the face will be preserved let the student be careful when he begins the eyes to draw them with crayon inclined to the carmine teint of whatever colour the iris are of he must lay them in brilliant and af-first not load- ed with colour but executed lightly no notice is to be taken of the pupil yet the student must let the light of the eyc incline very much to the blue cast cautiously avoiding staring white appear- ance which when once introduced is seldom over- come preserving broad shadozy thrown on its up¬ per part by the eye-lash black and heavy te int is also to be avoided in the eye-brows it is there- fore best to exccute them like broad glowing shadow at first on which in the finishing thc hairs of the brow are to be painted by which method of proceeding the former teints will shiew them¬ selves through and produce the most pleasing effect the student should begin the lips with pure car- mine and lake and in the shadow use some car- mine and black the strong vermillion teints should be laid on afterwards he must beware of executing them with stiff harsh lines gently intermixing each with the neighbouring colours making the sha¬ dow beneath broad and enriched with brilliant crayons he must form the corner of the mouth with carmine brown oker and greens variously intermixed if the hair is dark he should pre- serve much of the lake and deep carmine teints therein this may be easily overpowered by the warmer hair teints which as obferved in paint- ing the eye-brows will produce richer effect when thie picture is finishied on the contrary if this method is unknown or neglected poverty of co- louring will be disce rnable after the student has covered over or as artists term it has dead-coloured the head he is to sweeten the whole together by rubbing it over with his finger beginning at the strongest light upon the forehead passing his finger very lightly and unit- ing it with the next teint which he must continue till the whole is sweetened together often wiping his finger on towel to prevent the colours being sullied he must be cautious not to smooth or sweeteien his picture too often because it will give rise to thin and scanty effect and have more the appear- ance obf drawing than solid painting as nothing but body of rich colours can constitute rich ef- fect to avoid this as the student finds it ne- cessary to sweeten with the finger he must conti¬ nually replenish the picture with more crayon when the head is brought to fome degree of for- wardniess let the back ground be laid in which must be treated in different manner covering it as thin asis possible and rubbing it into the paper with- leather stump near the face the paper should be almost free from colour for this will do great service to thee head and by its thinnefs give both soft and solid appearance in the back ground also crayons which have whiting in their composition should be used but seldom or never without cau- tion but chiefly such as are the most brilliant and the lezast adulterated the ground being painted thin naext the hair will give the student an oppor¬ tunity of painting the edges of the hair over in light aand free manner when he gives the finishing touche es the student having proceeded thus far the face hair and back ground being entirely covered he must carefully vicw the whole at some distance re- markining in what respect it is out of keeping that is whhat parts are too light and what too dark be- ing particularly attentive to the white or chalky appearrances which must be subdued with lake and carmine the above method being properly put into exccution will produce the appearance of paintinng principally composed of three colours viz carminne black and white which is the best pre- parâation paration painter can make for producing finc crayon picture the next step is to compleat the back ground and the hair as the dust in painting these will fall on the face and would much injure it if that was compleated first from thence proceed to the forchead finishing downward till the whole pic- ture is compleated back grounds may be of various colours but it requires great taste and judgment to suit them pro¬ perly to different complexions in general strong coloured head should have weak and tender teint- ed ground and on the contrary delicate com¬ plexion should be opposed with strong and power- ful teints by which proper contrast between the figure and the back ground the picture will reccive great force and strike the spectator much more than it could possibly do was this circumstance of contrast not attended to young painters often treat the back grounds of pictures as matter of very little or no consequencco when it is most certain great part of the beauty and brilliancy of the picture especially the face de- pends upon the teints being well suited the darks kept in their proper places and the whole being perfectly in subordination to the face thus sim¬ ple back ground requires attention but the difficulty is still greater when variety of objects are intro- duced such as hills trees buildings in thesc cases one rule must be strictly attended to that each grand object be disposed so as to contrast each other this is not meant merely respecting thcir forms but their colour their light shade for instance we will suppose the sigure recciving the strongest light behind the figure and very near at hand are the stems of some large trees these must have shade thrown over them cither from diiving cloud or some other interposing circumstance be¬ hind these stems of trees and at distance are seen rees on rising ground these should receive the light as contrast to the former if an ar- chitectural back ground be chosen the same rule must be applied suppose building at moderate distance is placed behind the figure receiving the light column or some other object in shadow should intervene to preserve proper decorum in the piece or what will have the same effect fhadow must be thrown over the lower part of the build- ng which will give equal fatisfaction or repose to the eye it must be remembered the light must be always placed against the dark and the weak against the strong in order to produce force and effect and vice versa in painting over the forehead the last time begin the highest light with the most faint vermillion teint in the same place where the faint carmine was first laid keeping it broad in the same manner in the next shade succeeding the lightest the stu- dent must work in some light blue teints composed of verditer and white intermixing with them some of the deeper vermillion teints swectening theni to- ether witli great caution insensibly melting them into one another increasing the proportion of cacli colour as his judgment shall direct some brilliant yellows may also be used but sparingly and to- wards this direction is sor the finest complexions but tlie student must vary his colouring according to his subject wards the roots of the hair strong verditer teints intermixed with greens will be of singular service cooling crayons composed of black and white should succeed these and melt into the hair be¬ neath the eyes the pleasing pearly teints are to be preserved composed of verditer and white and un- der the nose and on the temples the same may be used beneath the lips teints of this kind also are proper mixing them with the light greens and some vermillion the introducticn of greens and blues into the face in painting has often given furprize to those who are unacquainted with the art but there is rea- son sufficient sor their introduction though it may appear strange at first in order to break and correct the other colours the carmine predominating in the dead colour is as has been observed the best preparation for the succeeding teints the crudeness of this prepara- tion must be corrected by varioussy intermixing greens blues and yellows which of these are to be used is to be determined by the degree of carmine in the dead colour and the complexion intended the blue and yellow are of nature diametrically opposite and serve to correct the reds and oppose one another the greens being compounded of both these colours is of peculiar use in many cases where the transition is not to be so violent the student attentively considering nature will discover plcasing varicty of colours on the sur- face and discernible through clear and transpa¬ rent fkin this variety will be still increased by the effect of light and shade he will perceive one part inelining to the vermillion red another to the car- mine mine or lake one to the blue this to the green and that to the yellow in order to produce these different effects he will apply those colours to which the teints are most inclined yet in crayon painting it is often best to compound the mixed colours upon the picture such as blue and yellow instead of green blue and carmine instead of purple red and yellow instead of orange in other circum- stances the compounds already mixed should be used but in this case there can be no absolute rulc given it must be left to thie experience and discre- tion of the painter though the student may be greatly assisted in the commencement of his studies by an able master to direct and point out the best method to treat circumstances of this nature as they oc- cur in practice which may at first appear obscure and mysterious but will soon to good capacity become demonstrably clear upon certain and sure principles tlie circumstances that require different treatment are so various and so many as to render it impossible here to descend to every particular in finishing the checks let the pure lake clear them from any dust contracted from the other crayons then with the lake may be intermixed the bright vermillion and last of all if the subject should require it few touches of the orange coloured crayon but witli extreme caution after this sweeten that part with the finger as little as possible for fear of producing heavy disagrecable effect on the cheeks as the beauty of crayon picture consists in onc colour shewing itself through or rather be¬ tween another this the student can not too often re- mark it being the only method of imitating beau- tiful complexions the artists assistant the eye is the most difficult feature to cxecute in crayons as every part must be expressed with the utmost nicety to appear finished at the same time that the painter must preserve its breadth and so- lidity while he is particularizing the parts to accomplish this it will be good general rule for the student to use his crayon in sweetening as much and his finger as little as possible when he wants point to touch small part with he may break off à litle of his crayon against the box which will produce corner fit to work with in the minutest parts if the eye-lashes are dark he must use some of the carmine and brown oker and the crayon of carmine and black and with these he may also touch the iris of the eye if brown or hazel mak- ing broad shadow caused by the eye-lash red te ints of vermillion carmine and lake will exe- cute the corners of the eye properly but if the eye-lids are too red they will have disagreeable fore appearance the pupil of the eye must be made of pure lamp-black between this and the lower part of the iris the light will catch very strong but it must not be made too sudden but be gently diffused round the pupil till it is lost in shadc when the eye-balls are sufficiently prepared the shining speck must be made with pure white crayon which should be first broken to point and then laid on firm but as it is possible they may be defective in neatness they should be corrected with pin taking off the redundant parts by which means they may be formed as neat as can be re- quired the difficulty with respect to the nose is to pre- serve the lincs properly determined and at the same time me so artfully blended into the cheek as to ex- ress its projection and yet no real linc to be per¬ eptibie upon close examination in some circum¬ ances it should be quite blended with the check which appears behind it and determined entirely with slight touch of red chalk the shadow caused the nose is generally the darkest in the whale face artaking of no reflection from its ’ surrounding parts carmine and brovn oker carmine and black and such brilliant crâyons will compose it best the student having before prepared the lips with the strongest lake and carmine must with these colours make them compleatly correct and when nishing introduce the strong vermillions but with great caution as they are extremely predominant this if properly touched will ’ give the lips an ap- pearance équal if not superior to those executed in oils notwithstanding the seeming superiority the lat- er has by means of glazing of which the former is entirely destitute when the student paints the neck he should avoid expressing the muscles too strong in the stem nor should the bones appear too evident on the chest is both have an unpleasing effect denoting violent agitation of the body circumstance seldom ne- cessary to exprefs in portrait painting the most necessary part to be expréssed and which should ever be observed even in the most delicate subjects is strong marking just above the place where the collar bones unite and if the head is much thrown the method with which painters in oils express transparency in the lips is by painting them first with light vermillion teints and when dry touching them over with pure lake over the shoulders some notice should be taken of the large muscle that rises from behind the ear and is inserted into the pit between the collar bones all inferior muscles should be in general quite avoided the student will find this caution ne- cessary as iost subjects especially thin persons have the muscles of the neck much more evident than would be judicious to imitate as few necks are too long it may be necessary to give some addi¬ tion to the stem fault on the other side being quite unpardonable nothing being more ungraceful than fhort neck in colouring the neck let the student preserve the stem of pearly hue and the light not so strong as on the chest if any part of the breast appears it ’ transparency must also be ex- pressed by pearly teints but the upper part of the chest should be coloured with beautiful vermillions delicately blended with the other of the materials the perfection of the crayons consists in great meafure in their softnefs for it is impossible to execute brilliant pictuze with them if they are otherwise on which account great care should be observed in the preparing them to prevent their being hard -- in all compositions flake white and white lead should be wholly rejected because the slightest touch with either of these will unavoidably turn black the usual objection to crayon paintings is that they are subject to change but whenever this happens it it is entirely owing to an injudicious use of the above¬ mentioned whites which will stand only in oils to obviate the bad effects arising from the use of sucl crayons let the student make use of common whit¬ ing prepared in the sollowing manner take large vesfel of water put the whiting into it and mix them well together let this stand about half minute then pour off the top into another vessel and throw the gritty sediment away let what is prepared rest about minute and then pour it off as before which will purify the whiting and render it free from all dirt and grittiness. -- when this is done let the whiting settle and then pour the water from it aster which lay it on the chalk to dry and keep it for use either for white crayons or the purpose of preparing teints with other colours for with this all other teints may be fafely prepared the student must be provided with large flexible pallet-knife large stone and muller to levigate the colours two or three large pieces of chalk to ab- sorb the moisture from the colours after they are le¬ vigated piece of flat glafs to prevent the moisture from being absorbed too much till the colours are rolled into form and vessels for water spirits as necessity and convenience shall direct ds carmine aud lake it is rather difficult to procure either good car- mine or good lake good carmine is inclined to the vermillion teint and should be an impalpable pow¬ der and good lake to the carmine teint the car- minc crayons are prepared in the sollowing manner as their texture is inclinable to hardness instead of grinding and rolling them take sufficient quan¬ tity of carmine lay it upon the grinding-stone mix it with levigating knife with spirits of winc till it becomes smooth and even yet the less friction produced by the knife the better the chalk-stone being ready lay the colour upon it to absorb the spirit but be careful that it is laid on in proper shape for painting the simple colour being prepared the next step is to compose the different teints by mixture with whiting the proportion to be observed consisting of twen ty gradations to one which may be clearly un- derstood by the sollowing directions take some of the simple colour and levigate it with spirits of wine adding about one part of washed whiting to threc parts of carmine of which when properly in- corporated make two parcels the next gradation should be composed of equal quantities of carmine and whiting of which four crayons may be made the third composition should have one fourth car- mine and three fourths whiting of this make six crayoas which will be good praportion with the rest the last teint should be made of whiting very faintly tinged with carmine of which make about eight crayons which will compleat the abovemen¬ tioned proportion though these teints made with whiting may be rolled yet the pure carmine will not bear it but must be left on the chalk-stone till perfectly dry lake is colour very apt to be hard to prevent which the student must observe the following particulars take take about half the quantity of lake intended for the crayons and grind it very fine with spirits of wing let it dry and then pulverize it which is easily done if the lake is good then take the other half and grind it with spirits after which mix it with the pulverized lake and lay it out directly in crayons on the -chalk the colour will not bear rolling the simple colour being thus prepared proceed with the compound crayons as directed be- ’ fore aand in the same degrees of gradation as the carmine teints vermillion or native cinnabar the best is inclined to the carmine teint to prepare this colour mix it on the stone with soft water or spirits after which it may be rolled into crayons blues prussian blue is colour very apt to bind and is rendered soft with more difficulty than carmine and lake the same method of preparation is to be followed with this as directed with respect to lake only it is ne- cessary to grind larger quantity of the pure colour as it is chiefly used for painting draperies blue verditer is colour naturally gritty and therefore it is necessary to washi it well its particles are so coarse as to require some binding matter to unite them otherwise the crayons will never adhere together to accomplish this take quantity sufficient to form two or three crayons to which add paece of slack- ed plaister of paris about the size of pea mix these well together and form the crayons upon the chalk this blue is extremely brilliant and will be of great use in heightening draperies greens brilliant greens are produced with great dif- ficulty which may be procured of those who make it their businefs to prepare them yet the following compositions will be found useful take yellow oker and after grinding it with spirits mix it with the powder of prussian blue then temper it with knife and lay the crayons on the chalk without rolling them besides this use king ’ yellow mixed with prussian blue brown oker and prussian blue the crayons made of these last may be rolled yellows kings yellow is the most useful and the most brilliant levi gated with spirits of wine and compose the differ- ent teints as before directed yellow oker and na- ples yellow ground with spirits will make useful crayons orange is produced with king ’ -yellow and vermillion ground together with spirits and the tcints formed as in other cases but no grcat quantity of them is required browns roman oker aud prussian blue mixed in disserent proportions will be useful browns cullens-earth is sine dark brown after six or eight of the simple crayons are prepared several rich compound teints may be produced from it by mixture with carmine in various degrees black carminc and this colour mixed together make useful teints for painting hair several gradations may be produced from each of these by mixture with whiting- um ber may be treated in just the same manner only it is necessary to levigate it with spirits of wine purples prussian blue ground with spirits and mixed with pulverized lake will produce good purple carmine thus mixed with prussian blue will produce purple something different from the former va¬ rious teints may be made from either of these com¬ pounds by mixture with whiting blac amp-black is the only full black that can be used with safety as all others are subject to mildew cinnabar mixed with carmine-this is compo¬ sition of great use and teints made from this witli whiting will be found very serviceable carmine and black is another good compound of which five or six gradations should be made some partaking more of the black and others having the carmine most predominant besides several teints by mixture with whiting cinnabar and black is also very useful compound from which several different teints should be made prussian blue and black is another good compound and will be found of singular service in painting draperies it is impossible to lay down rules sor forming every te int necessary in composing set of crayons ’ there béing many accidental compofitions entirely dependent on fancy and opinion the student shoald make it à rule to save thé leavings of his colouys for of these he may form various teints which will occasionally be useful of rolling the crayons and disposing them for painting the different compositions of colours must bè cût into proper magnitude after they are prepared in order to be rollec into pastils for the convenience of using them each crayon should be formed in the left'hand with the ball of the right first formed cylindrically and then taperéd at each end if the composition is too dry dip the finger in water if too wet the composition must be llaid upon the chalk again to absorb iore lof the mbis- ture thé crayons ’ shoultf be rolléd as quick ’ as pos- sible and when fnifhed must ue ’ laid upen- the chalk again to absorb afl remaining moisture after the ’ gradation of teints from one colour are formée the chalk and the grinding-stone thould be well scraped and cleansed with water before it is used for another colour when the set of crayons is compleated according to the rules prescribed they should be arranged in classes for the convenience of painting with them some thin drawers divided into number of par- titions is the most convenient method of disposing them properly the crayons should be deposited according to the several gradations of light the bottom of the partitions must be covered with bran as bed for the colours because it not only preferves them clcan but prevents their break ing the box made use of when the student painfs should be about foot square with nine partitions in the upper corner on the left hand supposing the box to be in thelap when he paints let him place the black and grey crayons those being the most sel- dom used in the second partition the blues in the third tlie greens and browns in the fist partition on the left hand of the second row the carmines lakes vermillions and all deep reds the yellows and orange in the middle and the pearly teints next and as these last are of very delicate nature they must be kept very clean that the gradations of colour may be easily distinguished in the lowest roxv let the first partition contain piece of fine linen rag to wipe the crayons with while they are using the second all the pure lake and vermil¬ lion teints and the other partition may contain those teints which from their complex nature can not be elassed with any of the former for enamel grounds the matter of the enamel inust be first finely le- vigated and searced and the body to be enamel- led should be made perfectly clean the enamel must be then laid on as even as possible by brufh or pencil being first tempered with oil of spikc and the distance of time betwixt the laying on the ground and burning the piece should not be too great because the oil will exhale and leave tlic matter of the enamel dry incohering powder which will be liable to be rubbed or shaken off by the least violence this is the common method but there is much better way of managing this part of the work by means of fearce in which the enamel is spread with very little trouble and the greatest part of the oil of spike saved the method of performing this is to rub the surface to be enamelled over with oil of spike and then being laid on fheet of paper or piece of leather to save that part of the enamel which does not fall on pioper object to searce the matter upon the oiled surface till it lie of proper thickneis but great care must be taken in this method of proceed- ing not to shake or move too forcibly the pieces of work thus covered with the powdered enamel- it is usual to add oil of turpentine to the oils of spike or lavender in order to make them go fur- ther and save the expence attending the free use of them and others add also little olive or linseed oil or some in the place of them crude turpen¬ tine the use of the spirit of turpentine is very allowable for it is the same for this purpose as the oils of spike or lavender except that it wants the glutinous quality which makes them serviceable in spreading the enamel but with respect to the use of the oils of olive and linseed or any other sub- stantial oil it is very detrimental tending to re- duce the metalline calxes and leaving small pro¬ portion of black coal or ashes which must necessa- rily injure the white colour of the ground when plates as in the case of pictures dial- plates are to ’ be enamelled they should always be made convex on the outside and concave within and all pieces of enamel formed of metal where the figure does not admit of their being thick and solid should be of the same kind or form otherwise they will be very apt to warp in the heat and can- not be brought straight after they are taken out of the fire without cracking the enamel for this reason likewise it is proper to enamel the work all over as well on the wrong as right sides to pre- vent the heat from calcining the metal which would both contribute to its warping and weaken the texture of it the enamel being laid on the body to be enamel- led when tlie fixt muffle is used the piece must be gently- listed on to the false bottom and put in that state into the muffle fixt in furnace by thrust- ing the false bottom into it as far as it will go but is best to defer this till the fire be perfectly in or- der which may be known by putting bit of tile or china with some enamel on it of the same tone with that used as proof and another proof of the same kind may be also put along with the work into tlie mussie which being taken out may shiew how the operation proceeds pit-coal may be used in the furnace where enamel is burnt with the sixt muffle or in coffins which is indeed one principal conveniency attending thre use of them as it faves considerable expence of charcoal but where the open muffle is used char- coal alone should be employed as the fuines of mi¬ neral coal are very detrimental to some colours and destructive of the grounds if whitened by arsenic as the common white glafs the colours being prepared they must be reduced to powder by due levigation and washing over where they are required to be extremely fine and here is no unvitrified salt in the mixture they must then be tempered on china or dutch tile with oil of spike or lavender to which most artists add likewise oil of turpentine and some but think erroneously as have before mentioned litile linsced or olive oil and in this state they are to be used as paint of any other kind but it should be avoided to mix more of the colours with the es- sential oils than will be immediately used because they dry away extremely fast and would not only be wasted but give cohesion to the particles of the colours that would make them work less freely when again diluted with oil the colours being thus laid on the pieces to be painted the proceeding must be in all respects the same as with the grounds in whatever manner they are to be burnt éither in the muffles or coffins but greater nicety must be observed with respect to the fire as the effects of any error in that point are of much greater consequence in the burning the colours than the grounds especially if the white of the grounds be sormed from the calx of tin or antimony and not arsenic pit-coal as was above observed may be employed for burning as well the colours as the grounds where the muffle or coffins are used or any other method pursued that wholly hinders the smoke and fumes from having any access to the enamel enamel painting of enamel painting differs from all other kinds in the vehicle employed for the colours to hold the parts together and bind them to the ground they are laid upon this is glafs or some vitreous body which being mixed with the colours and fused or melted by means of heat becomes fluid and hav¬ ing incorporated with the colours in that state forms together with them hard mafs when grown cold it answers therefore the same end in this as oil gum-water size or varnish in the other kinds of painting the glass or vitreous body applied to this purpose of mixing with the colours in order to bind them to the grounds is called flux and makes one of the principal substances used in enamel painting when this flux is easily fusible that is to say melts with less degree of heat it is in the stile of those who work in enamel said to be soft and when it is reluctant to melt and requires greater degree of heat it is called hard thefe terms are as well applied to the matter of the enamel grounds and all other vitreous sub¬ stances concerned as to the fluxes it is in general perfection perfection of the flux to be soft or run easily into fusion but the great point with respect to this par¬ ticular is that when seve ral mixtures of colours and fluxes are used at the fame time they should all cor- respond to each other in the degree of this quality ocherwise some would be rendered too fluid and perhaps run the matter of the enamel ground into fusion and mix with it while others remained solid and insufficiently fused themselves it is always necessary likewise that the enamel of the ground should be considerably harder than the mixtures for the colours for if they both melt with the same de- gree of heat they will neceffarily run together it being requisite that the body painted in enamel should undergo heat sufficient to melt soft glafs the matter of such body can only be gold silver copper porcelean or china-ware hard glass and earthen- ware and where the metals are used if the paint- ing be of the nature of picture or demand vari- ety of colours it is necessary that ground of white or some other colour should be laid on the metal the body of which ground must necessarily be of the same vitreous nature as the flux but harder as nothing else can endure so grcat hoat that is capable of in¬ corporating with and binding the matter of the white or other colour to the surface of the metal the ground therefore makes another principal sub¬ stance used in en amel painting the third substance is the colour which must likewise be body capable of suffering the heat of melted glass and such as will either itself be con- verted into glafs or kindly incorporate with it in melted statc this of course confines the matter of such colour to metals earthis or other mineral bodies all vegetable and animal substances being calcined and analized with less degree of heat than the low¬ est sufficient to work enamel the fourth kind of substance is what shall call the secondary vehicle which is some fluid body for laying on the ground and working with the pencil the flux and colours when mixt together since as they form only dry powder they could not be used as paint without some such medium but as this is to serve only for spreading and laying on the matter of the enamel and not like other vehicles to assist in holding the colours together and binding them to the ground that being in this kind of painting the office of the flux it is necessary that it should be some such substance as will evaporate and dry away without leaving any part behind as it would otherwise be heterogeneous matter with regard to the enamel and consequently injurious to it essen- tial oils have been therefore used for this purpose as they have the quality of wholly drying away on the first approach of heat together with slight unc¬ tuosity which renders them capable of making the matter of the enamel work properly with the pencil the preparation of these several substances have been in great measure monopolized by the ventians except what were prepared at dresden since the establishment of the china manufactories the few others who have had any knowledge of this matter have practised the preparing only some kinds and even at present there are perhaps none in this country who make more than small part of the va¬ riety necessary for though many possess the know¬ ledge of some particular articles yet they are ignorant with regard to others which are again perhaps known to those who are ignorant of thefe as there has been hitherto no means afforded to the practisers of it of learning the particulars of this art in system and deeper knowledge of the principles and prac- tice of chemistry is requisite to the attaining it with¬ out being taught than could well fall to the share of painters or other artists shall therefore be mope minute in my instructions for the making the several kinds of the grounds sluxes and colours in order that they who are concerned in or may be desirons to apply themselves to the art of painting in enamel which is now become the basis of considerable manufacture in this countiy may furnisn themselves with whatever is necessary in its greatest perfection besides the knowledge of the preparation of the above substances and of that part of the art of using them which belongs to painters in general there is another requisitc this is the burning as it is called the grounds in order to forming them on the body to be painted or enamelled as also the co- lours with the fluxes after they are laid on the grounds what is meant by burning is the giving such heat to the matter when laid on the body to be painted as will fuse or melt it and consequently give to the flux or vitreous part of the composition the proper qualities of vehicle for binding the colours to the ground and holding the parts together as this requires particular apparatus shall en¬ deavour to shew the method of constructing it in the most expeditious and easy manner and give such cautions for the conduct of the operation both for burning the grounds and painting as may best teach those who are lefs experienced in it to attain to per- fection in this art it can not be expected neverthe- less considering the niccty of the subject such direc- tions can be given as will insure success in the first trials with regard to several of the processes or even the general operations but whoever will make themselves masters of the principles on which they depend which arc all along intimated will easily be able to correct their own errors judgment formed by some little experience is likewise requisite for the preparing well the colours with certainty for as disserent parcels of the same substance vary frequently in their qualities with regard to the degree or proportion it is necessary to make allowance accordingly in the proportion of the quantities in the mixtures this can not be done till some little previous trial be made and the power of judging of them be gained by an experimental acquaintancc with them but as the materials in ge¬ neral are very cheap and the experiments may be made in the same fire where actual business is donc whoever would excel in the art of preparing and using enamels should take considerable scope of experimental enquiry into the effect of all the various proportions and commixtures of the substances used of the substances used for forming fluxes minum or red lead is used as à fluxing body for forming the enamel for grounds as also in coin¬ pounding fluxes for the colours it requires no pre- paration for these purposes only it is proper it should be pure which may be known by the me- thod before given page this flux renders the enamel soft but producing some proportion of yel- low colour is not fit for all uses fixt alkaline salt of vegetables is sometime used also in forming the mixture for enamel grounds as likewise likewise in some compositions of fluxes for the colours it makes less soft enamel than the lead but is free from yellow or any other colour and therefore proper for some purposcs borax is falt of very peculiar qualities amongst which is that of promoting vitrification and the fusion of any glafs when vitrified in greater degree than any other substance known on which account it is of the greatest consequence in forming fluxes for enamel it requires neverthelefs either to be previously calcined or brought to vitreous state which it suffers srom the application of moderate heat alone and it must also be finely powdered before it be mixed with other ingredients in sluxes its use is not much known in common practice though of the greatest consequence to the art of enamelling as not only set of softer colours may be produced by the aid of it than can be other- wise had but the degree of cach may be brought to correspond by the employing it in different pro- portions according to the respective hardnefs of the other ingredients which differ so mucl as not to be regulated justly by any other means common salt may be also used as slux in ena- melling particularly where there is occafion for glazings as it is not only extremely fluid and free of tenacity when used but also less subject to crack than any other vitreous body whatever but for fluxes for grounds and colours in enamel it is not frequently necessary to multiply ingredients as the above three substances may when properly applied sufficiently answer most purposes the same reason- ing extends to nitre and arsenic which though they have the qualities of fluxes possess yet along with them them such others with respect to their effect on se- veral of the substances that compose the calours as renders the methods of using them difficult and comples of the substances used for forming the body of enamel cor fluxes white sand is used as body for the fluxes and grounds of-enamel it should be reduced previously to an impalpable powder in order that it may be mixed more intimately with the other ingredients which not only accelerates the vitrification but renders the glafs much more perfect the kind of sand proper for this purpose is that brought from lynn in norsolk and called by the name of that place flints are used for the same purpose as the white sand and it is proper to use them when that can¬ not be procured of the right kind they require to be calcined before they are applied to any purpose of vitrification this is to be done by putting them into any fire and continuing them there till the whole substance become white when they must be taken out and while in their full heat im¬ mersed in cold water and kept there for some time by such treatment they will be rendered of very brittle and calcarious texture and very easy to be powdered which must be done to perfect degree for the reason above given where small quantities of the matter of any kind of enamel is to be pre- pared calcined flints are preferable to fand as they are much more eafily reduced to an impalpablé pow¬ der and the troublé of the previous calcination is very little there is fort of store which the french call milon that forms the upper crust and lies round the free-stone in most quarries this stone will lofe- its tenacity in moderate fire and when calcined runs much sooner into vitrification than either flints or sand it is ’ therefore when it can bé obtained à better matter for the body of fluxes or soft enamel ihan either of tlie other it will with the ’ same proportion of the slux ing ingredients make much softer flux or it otherwise admits of the diminn- tion of the proportion of some of them vhich for inany experimental reasons is in certain ’ cales an advantage of the substances used for producing wbite coloar in enamel for forming the grounds putty or caleined tin is used as body of colour for the enamél grounds as tin is very troublesome in calcination requiring fong continuance of sire and to be spread into à very thin surface it is mucl the best way to procure it for the purposes of enamel- ling ready calcined of those who make it their broper businefs to calcine it for the use of lapida- ries and other artists who use it for they have large furnaces fitly constructed for performing that operation in large quantities and can consequently afford it much cheaper than it can be prepared in small quantities besides the sparing the trouble tt must be demanded of them by the name of puttys and care must be taken that-it be not sophisticated which it seldom fails to be before it comes out of their hands for common purposes the sophistica- tion which is generally by chalk lime or some such white carth may be thus distinguished pat the putty into crucible with some tallow or other rgease and give it the heat of fusion or what is sufficient to melt it supplying the greafe in freshi quantities as it burns away till the caleined tin ap- pears to have regained its metallic state suffer then the remainder of the grease to burn away and the chalk or earth if any were mixed with it will be found swimming on the furface of the metal to which however the afhes of the grease must he sup- pofed to have added some little quantity- there another body with which the putty or calx of tin may be adulterated that will not disco¬ ver itself by this method of reduction of the tin- it is white lead which in this manner of treatment would run into fusion and mix with the ’ tin and could therefore not be distinguished from it but it may be easily rendered perceptible by another man¬ ner of proceeding which is to take the putty suf- pected to be adulterated with it and having put it into crucible without any admixture and invert- ed another crucible over it as cover to give it moderate heat carefully avoiding thât the smoke or coal of the fire may have any access to it to change its colour if there be any white lead mixed with the putty it will shew itself when removed from ghe fire and become cold in yellow or brown co- lour if no such colour supervene but the putty appear equally white as before it was heated con¬ clufion may be safely made that it was not adulte- rated by white lead or that if fophisticated at all it must be by some white earth which may be made percéptible by the reduction of tin in the manner before mentioned uitramarine ultramarine the preparation of which we have before given is used in enamel where very bright blues of lighter teint are wanted and sometimes indeed in other cases by those who do not under- stand the right use of zaffer and smalt but there are sew instances where zaffer when perfectly good aluxed with borax and little calcined flint or ve- netian glafs to take off the fusible quality of the borax will not equally well answer with the best ultramarine the ultramarine requires no prepara- tion when ufed in enamel painting previously to its being mixtwith the proper flux and what relates to its general qualities and the means of distinguishing its goodness or genuinenefs we have along with its preparation before taught and the following uitramarine afhies are ufed where light semi-trans- parent blues are wanted but they are so frequently adulterated with precipitations of copper which of course turn green on fluxing that it is very necessary to be cautious in the use of any parcél not previ¬ ously tried zaffer is used for producing blue green purple and black- colours in enamel it is an earth obtain- ed by calcining kind of stone called cobalt and when it is mixed with any kind of vitreous bodies it vitrifies at the same time assuming strong blue colour but for the most part verging to the purple it is to be had in state proper for use of those co- lourmen who make it ’ their particular businefs to supply the glass-makers with colours the goodness of zaffer can fcarcely be known but by an actual trial of it and comparing the effect of it wiih that of some other known to be good and used in the same proportion magnesia is an earth which when sluxed with any vitreous body produces broken crimson or oul rose colour it is ’ ’ to be had prepared fit for ise except more perfect levigation srom those who sell colours to tlie glafs-makers it is uscful not only for some purposes as red but for the several compositions for black purple and some browns- the goodness of the magnesia must be determined the same means as that of zaffer smalt is as before mentioned zaffer vitrified with proper additions which are generally fixt aikaline salts and sands or calcined flints whicl are some- times used as blue in enamel but being hard it requires for such purposes to be used with flux which increasing the body of glass in too great for the tinge is apt to dilute the colour too much where great force is wanted therefore the use of the zaffer itself is in most cafes prefcrable there have nevertheless been as was above observed some parcels of smalt or vitrified calx of cobalt brought from saxony which are of an extreme strong body of colour and will bear any proportion of slux necessary to render them as foft as my be re- quired without weakening the colour too much for any purpose common smalt however ground very ine and mixt with fourth part of its weight of borax which is much the most powerful and kind- ly flux for zaffer will run pretty well and may be used where either full colour is not demanded or where the work will admit of the colours being laid on thick the goodness of smalt may be judged of by its bright and deep colour and the less it in clines to the purple the better in order to judge of the strength of the colour the smalt should be reduced to sine powder for in grosser state every degree of fineness renders it so disferent that judg- ment can not be easily formed of it smalt is to he had of all colourmen and is not subject to any adul¬ terations which would not be obvious on inspection gold is used in enamel to produce crimson ar ruby colour which by the mistaken sense of the latin word purpureus has been called purple by all the english and french writers it must be previ¬ ousty reduced to the state of precipitated powder by dissolving in aqua regia and making precipi¬ tation by means of tin fixt alkaline salt or some other metaflic or alkaline body silver is used for producing yellow colour in en amel it must be previoufly reduced to the state of powder which may be done either by pre- cipitation from spirit of nitre or by calcination with sulphur the precipitation of silver from spi- rit of nitre may be performed by dissolving an ounce of silver in two or three ounces of spirit of nitre and precipitating and edulcarating it copper is used in enamel painting for the form- ing green blue and red colours but it must be previously either calcined or reduced to the state of powder by precipitation iron is used to produce on orange red or foul scarlet colour in enamel as also transparent yel- low and to asfist likewise in the formation of greens and other compound colours it is prepared many ways both by corrosion and precipitation some of which indeed make real difference but most of them lead to the same end antimony is used for producing yellow colour in enamel as well as the white before mentioned and indeed it is the most useful and most used of any substance whatever for that purpose it is pre- ared only by levigation to which its texture not- withstanding its being semi-metal very well fuits glass of antimony is also used sometimes in enamel painting being itself fine transparent orange colour but as it wants body it has no great effect out in compositions orpiment has been also used in enamel for pro- ducing yellow colour but it is very tender with egard to the fire and requires so foft flux while at the same time antimony properly managed will to well supply the place of it that it is rarely used- powdered bricks have been also used for com- ounding yellow colours in enamel but as they act only in consequence of the oker they contain they are certainly inferior to the prepared okers we have given the most active flux amongst salts is borax which indeed possesses this power in the greatest degree hi¬ therto known of any simple whatever the next is dead which vitrifies with very moderate degree of heat and asfimilates to glass with itself not only many kinds of earth but all metals and semi-metals except gold and silver in their entire state arsenic os the next powerful flux only it requires to be fixed by conjoining it with some other body al- ready vitrified otherwise it sublimes and flies away before it arrives at the vitrefactive heat the seve- ral kinds of salts liave the next degree of sluxing power and among them sea salt possesses the great- est but they are not sufficiently strong themselves to form an enamel flux soft enough to be used in painting though as they are colourless which is not the case of vitrified lead they are very ne- cessary to be compounded with lead or used in its place assisted by borax where absence of every de- gree of colour is necessary in the flux painting apon glass the antient manner of painting upon glass was very simple and consequently very easy it con- sisted in the mere arrangement of pieces of glass of different colours in some fort of symmetry and constituted what is now called mosaie work in process of time they came to attempt more re- gular designs and also to reprefent figures heightened with all their shades yet they proceeded no farther than the contours of the figures in black with water- colours and hatching the draperies after the same manner on glasses of the colour of the object they designed to paint for the carnation they used glass ef bright red colour and upon this they drew the principal lineaments of the sace with black but in time the taste for this fort of painting im¬ proving considerably and the art being found appli¬ cable to the adorning of churches they found out means of incorporating the colours in the glafs it- self by heating them in the fire to proper degree having first laid on the colours the colours used in painting or staining of glafs are very different from those used in painting either in water or oil colours forblack take scales of iron one ounce scales of copper one ounce jet half-an ounce réduce them to powder and mix them for blue take powder of blue one pound sal nitre half pound mix them and grind them well together for carnation take red chalk eight ounces iron scales and litharge of silver of each two ounces gum arabic half an ounce dissolve in water grind all together sor half an hour as stiff as you can then putit in glafs and stir it well and let it stand to settle fourteen days for green take red lead one pound scales of copper one pound and flint five pounds divide them into three parts and add to them as much sal nitre put them into crucible and melt them with strong fire and when it is cold powder it and grind it on porphyry for gold colour take silver an ounce antimony half an ounce melt them in crucible then pound the mafs to powder and grind it on copperplate add to it yellow oker or brick dust calcined again fifteen ounces and grind them well together with water for purple take minum one pound brown stone one pound white flint five pounds divide them into

them fine and mix them for white take jet two parts white flint ground on glafs very fine one part mix them for yellow take spanish brown ten parts leaf silver one part antimony half part put all into cru- cible and calcine them well those beautiful works which were made in the glafs-houfes were of two kinds in some the colour was diffused through the wholc substance of the glass in others which were the more common the colour was only on one side scarce penetrating with- in the substance above one third of line though this was more or less according to the nature of the co- lour the yellow being always found to enter the deepest these last though not so strong and beautiful as the former were of more advantage to the work- men by reason that on the fame glass though already coloured they could shew other kind of colours where there was occasion to embroider draperies enrich them with soliages or reprefent other orna- ments of gold silver in order to this they made use of emery grinding ot wearing down the surface of the glafs till such time as they were got through the colour to the clear glass this done they applied the proper colours on the other side of the glafs by this means the new colours were hindered from running and mix ing with the former when they exposed the glasses to the fire when indeed the ornaments were to appear white the glafs was only bared of its colour with emery without tinging the place with any colour at all and this was the manner by which they wrought their lights and heightenings on all kinds of colour the first thing to be done in order to paint or stain glass in the modern way is to design and even colour the whole subject on paper then they chuse such pieces of glafs as are clear even and smooth and proper to receive the several parts and procecd to distribute the design itself or papers it is drawn on into pieces suitable to those of the glafs always tak ing care that the glasfes may join in the contours of the figures and the folds of the draperies that the carnations and other finer parts may not be impaired by the lead with which the pieces arc to be joined together the distribution being made they mark wiii the glasses as well as papers that they may be known again which donc applying every part of the design upon the glafs intended for it they copy our transser the design upon this glafs with the black colour diluted in gum water by tracing and follow- ing all the lines and strokes as they appear through the glafs with the point of pencil when these strokes are well dried which will happen in about two days the work being only in black and white they give slight wasn over with urine gum arabic and little black and repeat it several times according as the shades are desired to be heightened with this precaution never to apply new wash till the former is sufficiently dried this done the lights and risings are given by ubbing off the colour in the respective places with wooden point or the handle of pencil as to the other colours abovementioned they are used with gum water much as in painting in mi¬ niature taking care to apply them lightly sor fear of effacing the outlines of the design or even for the greater security to apply them on the other ide especially yellow which is very pernicous to the other colours by blending therewith and here too as in pieces of black and white particu- ar regard must always be had not to lay colour on colour or lay on new lay till such time as the former are well dried it may be added that the yellow is the only co- our that penetrates through the glafs and incorpo¬ rates therewith by the fire the rest and particu- larly the blue which is very difficult to use re- maining on the surface or at lcast entering very lit- tie when the painting of all the pieces is finished they are carried to the lurnâce or oven to anneal or bake the colours the furnace here used is small built of brick from eighteen to thirty inches square at six inches from the bottom is an ’ aperture to put in the fuel and maintain the fire over this aperture is grate made of thrce-square bars of iron which traverse the furnace and divide it into two parts two inches above this partition is another little aper¬ ture through which they take out pieces to exa- mine how the coction goes forward on the grate is placed à square carthen pan six or seven inches deep and five or six inehes less every way than the perimeter or the furnace on the one side hereof is little aperture through which to make trials placcd directly opposite to that of the furnaces des- tined for the same end in this pan are the pieces of glafs to be placed in the sollowing manner first the bottom of the pan is covered with three strata or layers of quick lime pulverized those strata being separated by two others of old broken glafs the design whereof is to secure the painted glass from the too intense heat of the fire this done the glasïes are laid horizontally on the last or upper¬ moft layer of lime the first row of glafs they cover over witli layer of the same powder an inch deep and over this they lay another range of glasses and thus al- ternately till the pan is quite full taking care that the whole heap always end with laver of the lime powder the pan being thus prepared they cover up the furnace with tiles on square table of earthenware closely luted all round only leaving five little aper¬ ures one at cach corner and another in tlie min¬ dle to serve as chimnies things thus disposed there remains nothing but to give the fire to the work the fire for the first two hours must be very moderate and iust be increased in proportion as the coction advances for the space of ten or twelve hours in which time it is usually compleated at last the fire which at first was charcoal is to be of dry wood so that the flame covers the whole pan and even issucs out at the chimneys during the last hours they make essays from time to time by taking out pieces laid for the pur¬ purpose through the little aperture of the furnace and pan to see whether the yellow be perfect and the other colours in good order when the an¬ nealing is thought sufficient they proceed with great haste to extinguish the fire which otherwise would soon burn the colours and break the glaffes of japanning by japanning is to be here understood the art of covering bodies by grounds of opake colours in varnish which may be either afterwards deco- rated by paintings or gilding or left in plain state this-is not at present practised so frequently on chairs tables and other furniture of houses ex- cept tea waiters as formerly but the introduction of it for ornamenting coaches snuff-boxes and skreens in which there is à rivalship betwixt ourselves and the french renders the cultivation and propaga- tion of this art of great importance to commerce shall therefore be more explicit in shewing the me- thods both now and formerly in use with the ap- plication of each to the several purposes to which they are best adapted and point out at the fame tiine several very material improvements that are at prefent enjoyed only by particular persons or not at all hitherto brought into practice the substances which admit of being japanned are almost every kind that are dry and rigid and not too flexible as wood metals leather and paper pre- pared wood and metals do not requirè any ofher prepa- ration but to have their surfaces perfcctly éven and clean but leather should bé fecurely strain- ed either on frames or on boards as its bend ing or forming folds would ’ otherwise crack and force off the coats of varnish paper also shoulû be treated in the same manner and 'have previous strong coat of some kind of size but it is rarely made the subject of japanning till it is converted in¬ to papier mache or wrought by other means into such form that its original state particularly with respect to flexibility is lost one principal variation in the manner of japan¬ ning is the using or omitting any priming or under coat on the work to be japanned in the older prac- tice such priming was always used and is at pre- sent retained in the french manner of japanning coaches and snuff boxes of the papier mache but in tlie birmingham manufacture it has been always rejected the advantage of using such priming or under coat is that it makes à saving in the quantity of varnisn used because the matter of which the priming is composed fills up the inequalities of the body to be varnished and makes it easy by means of rubbing and water-polishing to gain an even surface for the varnishi this was therefore such conveni¬ ence in the case of wood as the giving hardnefs and firmness to the ground was also in the case of leather that it became an established method and is therefore retained even in the instance of the papier mache by the french who applied the recejved method of japanning to that kind of work on its introduction there is neverthelefs this in¬ convenience always attending the use of an under coat of size that the japan coats of varnish and co- lour will he constantly liable to be cracked and peeled off by any violence and will not endure near so long as the bodies japanned in the same manner but without any such priming this may be easily observed in comparing the wear of the paris and birmingham snuff-boxes which latter when good of their kind never peel or crack or suffer any damage unlefs by great violence and such continued rubbing as wastes away the sub- stance of the varnisn while the japan coats of the parisian boxes crack and fly off in flakes when- ever any knock or fall particularly near the edges exposes them to be injured but the bir- mingham manufacturers who originally practised the japanning only on metals to which the reason above given for the use of priming did not extend and who took up this art of themselves as an in- vention of course omitted at first the use of any sach under coat and not finding it more necessary in the instance of papier mache than on metals continue still to reject it on which account the boxes of their manufacture are with regard to the wear much better than the french the laying on the colours with varnish instead of gum water is also another variation from the me- thod of japanning formerly practised but the much greater strength of the work where they are laid on in varnisn or oil has occasioned this way to be exploded with the greatest reason in all regular manufactures however they who may practise ja- panning on cabinets or other such pieces as are not exposed to much wear or violence for their amuse- ment only and consequently may not find ’ it wortli their while to encumber themselves with the prepa¬ rations necessary for the other methods may paint with water colours on an under coat laid on the wood or other substance of which the piece to be japanned is formed and then finisn with the proper coats of varnish according to the methods below taught if the colours are tempered with the strongest isinglass size and honey instead of gum water and laid on very flat and even the work will not be much in- fcrior in appearance to that done by the other me- thod and will last as long as the common old japan work except the best kinds of the true japan it is practised likewise in imitation of what is sometimes done in the indian work to paint witl water colours on grounds of gold in which case the isinglafs size with sugar-candy or honey as above directed is the best vehicle imitations are also made of japan work by colour- ing prints gluing them to wood work and then giv¬ ing them ffifring appearance by the use of some white varnisn of japan grounds.-the proper japan grounds are either such as are formed by the varnish and co- lour where the whole is to remain of one simple colour or by the varnish either coloured or with- out colour on which some painting or other deco- ration is afterwards to be laid it is necessary howe ver before proceed to speak of the particular grounds to shew the manner-of laying on the priming or under coat where any such is used this priming is of the same nature with that called clear coating or vulgarly clear coaling prac¬ tised erroneously by the house-painters and con- sists only in laying on and drying in the most even manner composition of size and whiting the com¬ mon size has been generally used for this purppse but where the work is of nicer kind it is bêtter fo employ the glovers or the parchment size and if third of isinglass be added it will be still better and if not laid on too thick much less liable to peel and crack the work should be prepared for this priming by being well smoothed with the fish-skin or glass-shaver and being made thoroughly clean should be brushed over once or twice with hot size diluted with two thirds of water if it be of the common strength the priming should then be laid on with brush as even as possible and should be formed of size whose consistence is betwixt the common kind and glue mixt with as much whiting as will give it à sufficient body of colour to hide the surface of whatever it is laid upon but not more if the surface be very even on wlich the priming used two coats of it laid on in this manner will be sufficient but if on trial with fine wet rag it will not receivé proper water polish on accouht of ary inequalitiès not sufficiently filled up and cô- vered two or more coats must be given it and whether grèâter or less number be üsed thé work fhould be moothed after the last coât but one is' dry by rubbing it with dutch rushes when the last coat is dry the water polifhi should be given by passing over every part of it with sine rag gently moistened till the whole appear perfectly plain and even the prifhiing will then be compleated and the work ready to receive the painting or co- loured vamilh the rest of the proceedings are the same in this case as where nô priming is ised of common grounds of varnish which are to be painted uponwhere wood ôr téather is to be ja- panned and nofpriming is used the best preparation is to lay two or three coats of coarse varnish com- bosed in the fbllowing manner take of rectifiéd spirit of wine one pint and of coarse seed-lac and resineach two ounces dissolve the seed-lac and resin in the spirit and then strain off the varnish this varnish ’ as well as all 'others formed ’ of spirit of wine must be laid on in warm place and ifit can be conveniently managed the piece of work to be varnishied should be made warm likewise and for the same reason all dampness should be ’ avoided for either cold or moisture chill this kind of varnish and prevent its taking proper hold of the substanée on which it is laid when the work is so prepared or by the priming with the composition of size and whiting above de- scribed the proper japan ground miist be laid on which is much the best formed of shell-lac varnish and and the colour desired if white be not in question which demands à péculiar treatment as fhail below explain or great brightnefs be not required when also other means must bé pursued the colours used with the shell-lac varnish may- be any pigments whatever which give the teint of the ground desired and they may be mixt together to form browns or any compound colours but with respect to such as require peculiar methods for the producing them of the first degree of brightnefs shall particularize them below the colours for grounds may otherwise be mixed with the white varnisnes formed in oil of turpentinc bût these varnishes haye no advantages over thé shell-tac but in their whiteness which preferves thé brightness of the colours and they are at the samé time greatly inferior in hardnefs to it as metals never require to be under coated with whiting they may be treated in the same manner as wood or leather when the under coat is omitted ex- cept in the instances particularly spoken of below of white japan grounds.-the forming ground perfectly white and of the first degree of hardnefs remains hitherto desideratum or matter sought for in the art of japanning as there are no substances which can be dissolved so as to form very hard varnish but what have too much colour not to de- prave the whiteness when laid ’ on ofa due thicknefs over the work except some very late discoveries not hitherto brought into practice the nearest approach however to perfect white varnish by means already known to the public is made by the following composition take slake white or white lead wafhed over and ground up with sixth of its weight of starch and tlien dried and temperit properly for spread¬ ing with mastic varnissi or compound them with gum animi lay these on the body to be japan¬ ned prepared either with or without the under coat of whiting in the manner as above ordered and then varnish over it with five or six coats of the fol¬ lowing varnish provide any quantity of the best seed-lac and pick out ofit all the clearest and whitest grains re- serving the more coloured and fouler parts for the coarser varnisnes such as that abovementioned for priming or preparing wood or leather take of this picked seed-lac two ounces and of gum animi three ounces and dissolve them being previously reduced to à grofs powder in about quart of spirit of wine and strain off the clear varnisn the seed-lac will yet give slight tinge to this com¬ position but can not be omitted where the varnish is wanted to be hard though where softer will an- swer the end the proportion may be diminished and little crude turpentine added to the gum animi to take off the brittleness very good varnish free entirely from all britile- ness may be formed by dissolving as much gum animi as the oil will take in old nut or poppy oil which must be made to boil gently when the gum is put into it the ground of white colour itself may be laid on in this varnisn and then coat or two of it may be put over the ground but it must be well diluted with oil of turpentine when it is used this though free from brittlenefs is never- thelefs liable to susser by being indented or bruised by any slight strokes and it will not well bear any polish but may be brought to very smooth surface without if it be judicioussy managed in the lay ing it on it is likewise somewhat tedious in drying and will require some timc where several coats are laid on as the last ought not to contain much oil of tur- pentine it must be observed likewise that the gum resin such as the animi copal can never be dif- solved in substantial oils by the medium of heat without considerable change in the colour of the oils by the degree of heat necessary to produce the solution method of dissolving gum copal in oil of turpentine is however now discovered by gen¬ tleman of great abilities in chemistry and he has also obtained method of dissolving amber in the same menstruum so that we may hope soon to sce the art of japanning carried to consummate degree of perfection when the public are put in possession of these most important inventions or the fruits of them of blue japan grounds.-blue japan grounds may be formed of bright prussian blue or of verditer glazed over by prussian blue or of smalt the co- lour may be best mixed with shell-lac varnish and brought to polishing state by five or six coats of varnisn of seed-lac but the varnish neverthelefs will somewhat injure the colour by giving to true blue cast of green and fouling in some de¬ gree warm blue by the yellow it contains wherc therefore bright blue is required and less de- gree of hardness can be dispensed with the method before directed in the case of white grounds must be pursued of red japan grounds for scarlet japan ground vermillion may be used but the vermillion alone has glaring effect that renders it much less beau- ful than the crimson produced by glazing it over with carmine or sine lake or even with rose pink which has very good effect used for this purposc for very bright crimson nevertheless instead of glazing with carmine the indian lake known in shops by the name of safflower should be used dis- solved in the spirit of which the varnisn is com¬ pounded which it readily admits of when good but in this case instead of glazing with the shell¬ lac varnish the upper or polishing coats need only be used as they will equally receive and convey the tinge of the indian lake which may be actually dissolved by spirit of wine and this will be found much cheaper method than using carmine if not- withstanding the highest degree of brightness be required the white vamnishes must be used it is at prefent however very difficult to obtain this kind of lake for it does not appear that more than one considerable quantity was ever brought over and put into the hands of colourmen and this being now expended they have not the means of fressi supply it however may be easily had from the same place whence the former quantity was procured by any persons who go thither in the east india company ’ ships of yellow japan grounds.-for bright yellow grounds king ’ yellow or turpeth mineral should be employed either alone or mixed with fine dutch pink the effect may be still more heighte ned by dissolving powdered turmeric root in the spirit of wine of which the upper or polishing coat is made which spirit of wine must be strained from off the regs before the seed-lac be added to it to form the varnisn the seed-lac varnish is not equally injurious here and with greens as in the case of other colours be¬ cause being only tinged with reddisn yellow it is lit- tle more than an addition to the force of the colours yellow grounds may be likewise formed of the dutch pink only which when good will not be wanting in brightnels tholigh extremely cheap- of green japan grounds-green grounds may be produced by mixing king ’ yellow and bright prussian blue or ractrer turpeth mineral and prussian blue cheap but souler kind may be had from verdi- rise with litile of the abovementioned yellows or dutch pink but where very bright green is wanted the chrystals of verdigrise called distilled verdigrise should be employed and to heighten the effect they should be laid on ground of leaf old which renders the colour extremely brilliant and pleasing they may any of them be used successfully with good seed-lac varnish for the reason before given out will be still brighter with the white vamnisn of orange-coloured japan grounds.-orange-co¬ loured japan grounds may be formed by mixing ver- million or red lcad with king ’ yellow or dutch pink or red orpiment will make brighter orange ground than can be produced by any mixture of purple japan grounds.—purple japan grounds may be produced by the mixture of lake and prussian blue or fouler kind by vermillion and prussian blue they may be treated as the xest with respect the varnish of black japan grounds to be produced without heat-— black grounds may be formed by either ivory black or lamp black but the former is preferablé where it is perfectly good these may be always laid on with the shell-lac var- nisn and have their upper or polishing coats of common seec-lac varnish as the tinge or foulness of the varnish can be here no injury of common black japan grounds on iron or cop- per produced by means of heat -- for forming the common black japan grounds by means of heat the piece of work to be japanned must be painted over with drying oil and when it is of moderate dry- ness must be put into à stove of such degree of heat as will change the oil black without burning it so as to destroy or weaken its tenacity the stove should not be too hot when the work is put into it nor the heat increased too fast either of which er¬ rors would make it blister but the slower the heat is augmented and the longer it is continued pro- vided it be restrained within the due degrce the harder will be the coat of japan this kind of var- nisn requires no polisn having received when pro- perly managed sufficient one from the heat of the fine tortoise shell japan ground produced by means of heatthe best kind of tortoise shell ground produced by heat is not less valuable for its great hardnefs and enduring to be made hotter than boiling water without damage than for its beautiful appearance it is to be made by means of varnisn prepared in the following manner take of good linseed oil one gallon and of um¬ bre half pound boil them together till the ee oil becomes very brown and thick strain it then through coarse cloth and set it again to boil in which state it must be continued till it acquires pitchy consistence when it will be fit for use- having prepared thus the varnisn clean well the iron or copper-plate or rather piece which is to be japanned and then lay vermillion tempered with shell-lac varnish or with drying oil diluted with oil of turpentine very thinly on the places intend- ed to imitate ’ the more transparent parts of the tor- toise shell when the vermillion is dry brush over the whole with the black varnish tempered to due consistence with oil of turpentine and when it is set and firm put the work into stove where it may undergo very strong heat and it must be continued considcrable time if even three weeks or à month it will be the better this was given among other recipes by kunckel but appears to have been neglected till it was re- vived with great success in the birmingham manu¬ factures whère it was not only the ground of snuff- boxes dressing-boxes and other such like lesser pieces but of those beautiful tea-waiters which have been so justly esteemed and admired in several parts of europe where they have been sent this ground may be décorated with painting and gilding in the same manner as any other varnished surface which had best be done after the ground has been duly hardened by the hiot stove but it is well to give second annealing with more gentle heat af- ter it is sinished of painting japan work japan work ought pro¬ perly to be painted with colours in varnish but in order for the greater dispatch and in somc very nice works in sinall for the freer use of the pencil the colours are now most frequently temnpered in oil which should previoussy have sourth part of its weight of gum animi dissolved in it or in default of that of tlie gums sanderac or mastie as have likewise before intimated when the oil is thus used it should be well diluted with spirit of turpentine that the colours may be laid more evan- ly and thin by which means sewer of the polifhi- ing or upper coats of varnish become necessary in some instances water colours as before inentioncd are laid on grounds oft gold in tlie manner of other paintings and are best when so used in their proper appcarance without any vaf- nisn over them they are also sometimes so managed as to have the effect of embossed work the colours employed in this way sor painting are as before intimated best prepared by means of isinglafs size corrected with honey or sugar-candy the body on which the embossed work is raised need not however be tinged with the exterior colour but may be best formed of very strong gum water thick- ened to proper consistence by bole armoniac and whiting in equal parts which being laid on in the proper figure and repaired when dry may be then painted with the proper colours tempered in the isinglass size or in the general manner with shell- lac varnish of varnishing japan workthe last and finishi- ing part of japanning lies in the laying on and po- lishing the outer coats of varnish which are ne- cessary as well in the pieces that have only one simple ground of colour as with those that are painted this is in general best done with common sécd-lac varnisn except in the instances and on those those occasions where have already shevn other methods to be more cxpedient the fame reafcans which decide as tosthe sitnefs or impropriety of the varnishes with respect to the colours of the ground hold equallyswell with regard to those of the painting- or where brightnafs is the most material point and tinge of yellow will injure it seed-lac must give¬ way to the-whiter gums but where hardnefs and greater tenacity aaræ most essentiak it must be ad- iered to and where both are so necessary that it is propet one should give way t ghe othier in certain degvee reciprocally mixt varnish must be adopted this-mixed varnish as besore observed should be made of the picked sced-lac the common seedt as varnish which is the most useful preparation of the kind hitherto invented may be fhus made take of seed-lac thrce ounces and put it into wa- ter to freeit from the sticks and silch that frequently are inteimixed with it and which must be done by stirring it- about and then pouring off the water and adding fresh quantities in order to repeat the operations till it be frce from all impurities as it very effectually may be by this means dry it then and powder it groisly put it with pint of rec- tified spirit of wine info bostle of which it will not fill above two thirds shake the mixture well together and place the bottle in gentle heat till the seed appears to be dissol ved the shaking being in the mean time repeated as often as may be con¬ venient and then pour off all which can be ob¬ tained clear by that method and strain the remain- der through coarse cloth the varnish thus prepared must be kept for use in bôttle well stopt when the spirit of wine is very strong it will dissolve greater proportion of the sced-lac but this will saturate the common which is seldom of strength sufsicient sor making varnishes in perfec- tion as the chilling whichis the most incon- venient accident attending those of this kind is prevented or produced more frequently according zo the strength of the spirit will take this oportu¬ nity of sliewing method by which weaker rectified spirits may with great ease at any time be freed from the phlegm and vendered of the first degree of strength take pint of the common rectified spirit of wine and put it into bottle of which it will not fill above three parts add to it half an ounce of pearl-ashes salt of tartar or any other alkaline salt heated red hot and powdered as well as it can be without much loss of its heat shake the mixture frequently for the space of half an hour before which time great part of the phlegm will be separated from the spirit and will appear to- gether with the undissolved part of the salts in the bottom of the bottle let the spirit then be pour- ed off or freed from the phlegm and salts by means of tritorium or separating funnel ’ and let half an ounce of thie pearl-ashies heated and pow¬ dered as before besadded to it and the same trcat- ment repeated this may be done third timc if the quantity of phlegm separated by the addition of the pearl-afhies appear considerable an ounce of alum reduced to powder and madc hot but not burnt must then be put into the spirit and suffered to remain some hours the bottle being frequentlv shaken after which the spirit being poured off it will be fit for use the- the addition of the the alum is necessary to neu¬ ralize the remains of the alkaline falts or pearl- ashes which would otherwise greatly deprave the spirit with respect to varnishies and ’ lacquers wherc vegetable colours are concerned and must conse- quent ly render another distillation necessary tlie manner of using the seed-lac or white var- nissies is the same except with- zegard to the sub¬ stance used in polishing which where pure whitc or great clearness of other colours is-in question should be itself white whereas the browner soris of polishing dust as being cheaper and doing their business with greater dispatch may be used in other cafes the pieces or work to be varnished should be placed near fre or in room where there is stove and made perfectly dry and then the varnisn may be rubbed over them by the proper brusnes made for that purpose beginning in the middle and pasiing the bruih to one end and theu with another stroke from the middle passing it to the other but no part should be croffed or twice passed over in forming one coat where it can possibly be avoided when one coat is dry another must be laid over it and this inust be continucd at least sive or six timcs or more if on trial there be not à sufficient thickness of varnish to bear the polish without laying hare tie painting or the ground colour underneath when sufficient number of coats is thus laid on the work is fit to be polished which inust be done in common cases by rubbing it with rag dipped in tripoli commonly called rotten stone finely powder- ed but towards the end of the rubbing little oil of any kind should be used along with the pow¬ der and when the work appears sufficiently bright and glossy it should be well rubbed with the oil alone alone to clean it from the powder and give it still brighter lustre in the case of white grounds instead of the tripoli fine putty or wliiting must be used both- which should be washed over toi prevent the danger of damaging- the work from any fand or other gritty mattcr that may happen- to be commixt with them it -is .great iinprovement of all kinds of japan work to harden the varnish by means of heat which in every degrce that can be applied short of whæt would burn-or calcine the matter tends to give it à more firm and strong texture where metals form lie hody tlxercfore very hot stove may be used and the pieces of work may be continued- in it con¬ siderable time efpecially if the heat be gradually increased but where wood is in question heat must be sparingly used as it wouldt orherwise warp or shrink the body so as to injure the general figure of gilding japan work -- the wvarious methods of gilding which are applicable to the ornamenting japan work being exceedingly prolix and uninte rest- ing it is needless to repeat them here fhall there- fore only obferve that in gilding with geld size swhich-is almost the only method now practised im japan work where it is desired to have the gold not shine or approaclt in the lcast towards the burnisfi- ing state the size should be used either with oil of turpentine only or with very little fat oil but wheve greater lustre and appearance of polissi are wanting without the trouble of burnishing and the preparation necessary for it fat oit alone or mixed with little gold size should be used and the same proportionable effect will be produced from mean proportion of them
