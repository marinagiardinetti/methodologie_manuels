printed for sayer and bennett map and print-sellers no fleet-street the draughtsman ’ assistant or drawing made easy introduction drawing is the representation of any object either real or imaginary being the imitation of nature or art in which by qut-lines and shadows well executed in their symmetry and proportion the copy appears as if it were the real object this useful and entertaining art improves the mind refreshes and supports the memory it enables the artist to form the clearest conception without which the most laboured descriptions would be found deficient and it rescues from oblivion the actions and persons of our fore-fathers and preserves their features and deeds to future generations and retains every uncommon appearance of nature nature seems to inculcate fondness for drawing even in youth by the delight they take in pictures prints which is kind of universal language that speaks to the eye and conveys ideas understood by every nation and people on the globe the artist may at pleasure take sketches of any appearances in the works of nature or art either in his own or any foreign country and bring them homc for his future use or inspection.-with this accomplishment the nobility and gentry can judge of designs before executed and spare themselves the mortificatton of delay and the additional expence of future alterations in word it may be said to be the silent but the most expressive language of nature there is no art or profession to which drawing is not useful but more particularly the painter carver statuary engraver chaser mathematician architect navi- gator gardener weaver embroiderer whitesmith and indeed every workman whose advantage in trade may depend on variety and beauty as by the assistance of it he can lay down his designs and improve them to the fancy and satisfaction of his employers it is pity so useful branch of education should ever be neglected as several by excelling in this art have attained perfection in their respective professions and employ- ments and have distinguished themselves by works of ingenuity which have met with the protection and encouragement of the judicious part of mankind we need not point out the injury done to youth by the neglect of this necessary study and how greatly many in years of maturity lament the deficiency of it as à loss to them- selves and families no wonder it should be deemed one of the chief accomplish- ments in human life and thought worthy even of royal patronage as well as the honourable regard paid to it by the different societies in all of which spirited emulation is excited among the proficients by premiums given to such as produce the most correct and perfect designs or imitations it has ever been the misfortune of those who have professed to lay down rules for the attainment of any art or science to leave them enveloped with difficulties which if not utterly insuperable at least discourage the learner from proceeding in study which he can have little hopes will ever reward his purfuit from hence we may reasonably infer that the sald professors were totally unac- quainted if not with the theory at least with the practical part of what they un- dertook to teach others and that the instructions they have given were founded rather upon bare suppesition of their efficacy than upon the surer basis of long and repeated experience which alone could have ensured their success and from which with all due deference to the judicious whose sanction we shall at all times be ambitious to deserve we may venture to answer for the practicability of our own to obviate every objection and to remove all those difficulties which had so long blocked up the path of science and retarded if not wholly impeded the pupil in his progress to the temple of fame was the chief view in compiling the subsequent little treatise over and above the improvements made in illustrating the several arts hitherto so imperfectly and unintelligibly explained we have introduced directions for scraping in metzotinto which in this edition are still farther enlarged and which as they have never been before attempted in any books of this kind we flatter ourselves will be the more acceptable especially when it shall appear from the rules laid down for the performance of this art that it is so easy to be attained that tolerable profici- ency in drawing will enable any one to undertake it with all imaginable prospect of succe ss the reader will also find in this impression the addition of very useful problem in the article of perspective illustrated by new plate as this book is chiefly intended for the use of young practitioners we have pur- posely avoided all abstruse expressions and obsolete terms contenting ourselves with fuch familiar stile as we judged most likely to inform those minds we would wish to improve yet as the ideas of an artist are not wholly to be conveyed without some necessary terms peculiar to each branch we have taken care to explain such as could not be omitted without manifest injury to the work by familiar words of synonimous tendency wherever they occur so that we apprehend we have not left the least stumbling-block for the reader to encounter general instructions every young beginner should endeavour to improve his memory with the- beauties of the most excellent paintings and prints taking notice of the harmony of their different parts as well as of the reasons for the disposition of the lights and shades which will by degrees improve the ideas to degree of excellencys- and make the practice easy and familiar as the hand will be more ready to execute those objects the mind has so clearly conceived the use of this accomplishment is visible in many who though not able to execute yet by accustoming themselves to this study become excellent judges and are with great propriety termed connoisseurs- in the polite arts of painting engraving it will also be of essential ser- vice to the pupil to attend to the reasons assigned for the merits or defects of the per- formance as such an enquiry will greatly forward him in his study pupils should take particular notice of the original intended to be drawn from observing whether the figures or objects are upright or incline to the right or left taking care also that everv part in the copy has the same direction which may easily be discovered by frequentlv revising the sketch and comparing it attentively with the original paying due observance to this by young beginners will mend their judg- ment and in time enable them to proceed with growing pleasure materials for drawing camel ’ hair-pencils charcoal cut in long slips fitches black lead pencils crow-quill pens crayons of black white and red chalk ruler and pair of compasses porte-crayon an indian rubber indian ink instructions with examples very learner is particularly desired to perfect himself in the practice of the- first lesson in its several branches before he attempts the second and so of the second before he proceeds with the third not endeavouring to become master of the whole at once which will only perplex his ideas and weary him in the pursuit of what he will never by this means be likely to attain whereas by proceeding gra- dually the rules will be found much more easy and practicable and consequently the study infinitely more pleasing and encouraging drawing the introductory lines with the features and limbs separately endeavour to imitate perpendicular or upright strokes and then horizontal or parallel lines but without using the ruler and if care be taken few examples of this sort will give you perfection when yon have attained this proceed to the curved and twining lines observing carefully their different inclinations and when you can with ease perform these proceed to draw the qut-lines of human face as the eyes nose mouth and ears and from them proceed to the parts of the body as the arms hands legs see plate the above must be but faintly fketched so as to be easily taken down with rubber in order to make the necessary alterations before finishing profiles and ovals when you are become master of the former you may then attempt the profile or side face being careful to observe the proportion of the several parts to each other after this the full or oval face observing still the bearings of every feature with respect to the rest and keeping the proportions as exact as possible after pro- ceeding with great care in the above you may begin the qut-line of the body as in plate ii whole figures with the proportions and dimensims of the human body if on thorough examination you find you can easily imitate the different fea- tures and parts of the body you may begin the whole figure by sketching the whole very lightly with your pencil or charcoal examining the proportion of the different parts taking it down with rubber and altering where it shall appear necessary when you have brought it as near as possible toyour original proceed to finisn with the crow-quill pen and indian ink beginning with the head then proceeding to the shoulders body arms hands hips legs and feet taking care to correct any errors in the pencil sketch the remains of which will be easily erazed with rubber refrain from the use of compasses till after very minute inspection with the eye and then if the fault can not be discovered proper application of them will greatly assist the pupil to remedy the defect having by close attention and practice improved his ldeas so far as to be able to compleat figure in qut-lines we shiall proceed to instruct him in the drapery or cloathing but before we quit this subject it will be necessary in this place to give him the best method of ascertaining the proportions and dimensions of the several parts of the human body by raising perpendicular on the place you intend for the middle of the figure and divideit into heads and from such form scale to regulate the proper distances but as it has been common to divide the figure into ten parts we have tho ’ we do not so well approve of this method given an example of both of these methods together with rules for the illustration of each respectively the proportion of figure divided into eight heads see plate iii the length of the head is from the crown of the head to the bottom of the chin line ruled through the second division will directly cross the paps of the breasts the third division will fall near the navel the fourth acrofs the privities which is exactly the middle of the figure the fifth crosses the middle of the thigh the sixth is just below the bend of the knee the seventh falls little below the calf of the leg the eighth extends to the bottom of the heel observe that when the arms are extended at full length in direct line the full extent from the middle fingers of each hand is exactly the length of the figure from the middle of the collar bone to the end of the middle finger measures four heads viz the first to the bend of the shoulder the second to the elbow the third to the wrist and the fourth to the fingers ends from shoulder to shoulder in man of common size measures exactly two heads but there is no precise standard for the breadth of the limbs which vary according to the bulk of the person and the movement of the muscles the proportion of figure divided into ten parts see plate iii the first of these divisions extends from the crown of the head to the under lip the second little below the collar bone and line drawn through this part of the figure will pafs over the middle of the shoulders the third division will make line just below the paps of the breast the fourth will reach just below the navel the fifth which is the middle of the figure directly across the privities the sixth will pass over the middle of the thighs the seventh ’ crosses the bend of the knee the eighth directly through the calves of the legs the ninth reaches half way from the calf to the bottom of the heel which determines the tenth and last division of the figure the young beginner will find the foregoing rules of infinite advantage to which we would advise him to give due application till they become strongly impressed on his mind but care must be taken that too strict an observance of the preceding dimensions may not destroy that variety of compositions so absolutely necessary nor will the préservation of the same proportion be always allowed in the subject which mr. hogarth in his chapter of proportion very judicioussy remarks in his ob- servations upon the celebrated statue of the apollo belvidere where he says can not throw stronger light on what has been said hitherto of proportion than by animad- verting on remarkable beauty in the apollo belvidere which hath given it the prefer- ence even to the antinous mean super-addition of gieatness to at least as much beauty and grace as is found in the latter in the same apartment at rome are to be seen these two master-pieces of art where in viewing the antinous the spectator is silled with admiration when the apollo strikes him with surprise and as travellers express themselves with an appearance of something more than human which they are always at à loss to de- scribe but the effect of this is they say the more extraordinary as the dispropor¬ tion upon examination is evident to every common eye anatomy the foundation of design anatomy is perfect knowledge of all the parts of the human body but no more is necessary to painters than that which relates to the bones and the principle muscles that cover them there is an absolute necessity to be thoroughly acquainted with the forms and joints of the bones bécause the dimensions are often altered by morion and like- wise to understand the office and situation of the muscles since the most striking truth in design depends upon them as it is indispensably necessary that the pupil should have some knowledge in anatomy it being the fundamental part of design and enables artists to discover the beauties of the antique it is therefore earnestly recommended the student to pay some attention to it as all that is necessary for draughtsmen is very eafily retained drapery when you have drawn the qut-lines of the figure you want to cloath faintly with charcoal sketch the qut-lines of your drapery lightly with the several folds remembering that they must not cross each other due regard must likewise be had to the quality of the drapery as stuffs and woollen cloth are more harsh than silky which is always flowing and easy remember that the drapery must not stick too close to the bodv but let it seem to flow easy about it and yet appear so that the motion of the figure be free and natural be careful that the drapery supposed to be blown by breeze of wind all slow one way and draw the parts next the body before those which sty off the garments must always bend with the figure and if you make the drapery almost close to the boly the smaller must be the folds and if quite close there must be no folds but only faint shadow to represent the bend of that part of the body which it covers it is necessary the student should take every opportunity of improvement in this useful branch by remarking the folds in the drapery of gentlemen and ladies according to their several positions by this uner- ring rule of nature the learner will greatly heighten his own idea- and give superior excellence to his work thus far may serve to give the young draughtsman general idea of drapery but that he may not be at à loss in perfecting himself in this necessary branch of the art we have here subjoined the following more particular instructions viz be careful to avoid overcharging your figure with superfluity of drapery let as much of the form of the body as possible be shewn underneath it when the draperies are large throw them into as few folds as you can and let these be large and graceful on the contrarv let those which are close to the body and short be loosened by sinall folds judicioussy placed which will be the means of avoiding that stiffnefs which for want of this caution appears when the drapery is made to sit too strait and makes the figure seem as if wrapped round with bandage instead of being grace- fully cloathed when much drapery is required let the greater part if possible be thrown into shadow observe that the folds which fall in the light must have such foft and tender shadows as may make them sit hollow from the body and not seem to girt too closely to it let the folds be properly contrasted and avoid strait lines as much as possible judicious repetition of folds in circular form greatly contribute to characterise fore-shortened limb in fixed attitudes let the drapery appear likewise motionless unless exposed to the air but the drapery of figures moving with great agility should seem to play as if agitated by the wind but in proportion only to the velocity of the figures in motion we can not conclude this subject without giving this very useful caution viz let the pupil be careful how he studies statues and remember that the best of them are only memorials of those great artists whose lives were spent in endeavouring to express their own idea of perfection which varied according to the different taste of each and the nature of the materials upon which they wrought and let it be likewise remembered that there is stiffness which should be studiously avoided in copy even though correct one made after the finest statue which will never convey any idea but that of statue whereas there is such freedom observable in the imitations of nature as evidently distinguishes them from those taken either from marble or plaister of light and shade the proper distribution of light and shade in picture is absolutely necessary to be known as it not only determines the proper distance of one object from ano- ther without which the whole would be an undistinguished mass of confusion but it gives likewise to each respective object its substance roundness and effect therefore having out-lined the folds and the other parts of drapery vou may next attempt the shadowing of your figure observing the following method shadow the drawing with the pencil or pen in which great care is required first observe from which side the light comes in which if natural ought to be from the right or left for when the light comes in the middle it is called an artificial light as proceeding from some artificial luminary as candle lamp lay your shades rather faint at first so that you may heighten them at pleasure where necessary for you may at any time darken your shadows when you can not lighten them remember that your shades must be all on the same side of the figure that is to say if the right side of the face be in shade so must the same side of the body arm leg your shades must all be faint as they approach the light the strength gradually decreasing towards the extremities to prevent harshi appearance as that is never-failing sign of bad workman when one part of the body projects over or before another the part projecting must receive stronger light those parts that bend inward must be made so much the darker and shadowed deepest next the light two equal lights must never be made in the same picture the strongest light should fall upon the middle of the piece where the principal figures ought to stand diminishing gradually towards the extremities stump inade of paper or glove-leather rolled hard and cut almost to point like pencil is useful if you shade with the pencil red chalk or crayons to blend the shades and soften them into each other as also where they appear too strong to weaken them with the afcresaid roll by examining nature you will im- prove your ldeas in light and shade as well as in outlines and be enabled to form right judgment of the truth of your drawing the indian ink may be prepared for few different shades by rubbing it more or leis in water on marble stone cut in hollows for that purpose reserving one of the hollows for the water of drawing landscapes this will give the student an inexhaustible fund of amusement from the variety of subjects which nature constantly supplies for his observance and imitation and in order to improve in this study the best method is to adhere to the rules before laid down with regard to the human body by beginning with the most simple ob- jects as the outlines of cottages trees for which reason we shall give few examples in each with their proper shades but would advise the pupil not to be too hasty in the shadowing before he is perfect in the outline and as it is impos¬ sible he should excel in landscape without some knowledge of perspective we shall give some directions suitably illustrated with problems as necessary assistant to the practitioner which will prevent his being imposed on by faulty and incorrect originals where the lgnorance of perspective makes the whole landscape appear unnatural and distorted of perspective the first thing necessary to learn before we proceed to the problems is an ex- planation of the several technical terms used in the practice of this art and these are as follow the base or fundamental line is the bottom of the drawing or that part of the ground on which the person is supposed to stand looking towards the point of sight perpendicular is an upright line with respect to any part of the base parallel lines are equidistant from each other as the horizon to the base the horizon is the most distant part where the clouds seem to touch the earths and limits the sight the point of sight is that part of the horizon where all the visual rays center visual rays are beams of light conveying the likeness of any thing to the sight and the knowledge thereof to the mind points of distance are set off on the horizontal line at equal distances on each side of the point of sight diagonal lines are those drawn from the points of distance to the end of the base line the abridgment of the square is theline where the diagonals crofs tnevisual rays and must always be parallel to the base this is only of uie when the sight is limited by perpendicular as the end of church or room the foregoing terms are illustrated in plate iv fig the point of direct view is when the obiect is seen in front as house or geometrical elevation raised from ground-plot comprehending an equal space on both sides the point of sight the point of oblique view is when the object is seen sideways for instance view of canal with some remarkable buildings when the person drawing the said view is placed on the base line opposite to the buildings so that the ray of light may be more oblique and the buildings less fore-shortened and appear to greater advant age accidental points are those where objects end in the horizontal line not in the points of sight or distance serving for streets houses chairs taking diffc- rent directions schnography is plan or ground-plot to be raised in perspective scenography is bringing any thing raised in perspective from an lchnographie plaa to its proper proportion that all objects may be diminished in picture the same as in nature as the art of perspective is constructed on geometrical principles it may be ne- cessary previous to the rules themselves to demonstrate the following introductory operations from point in given line to raise perpendicular see fig ii plate iv draw the given line then set one foot of the compasses in and extend- ing them to rather more than half the length of the line stiike the arch and with the same extent of the compasses set one point in and describe the archs and then without altering the compasses set one foot in and sweep the arch next rule through the points to intersect the arch at draw the line from to which is the perpendicular required to raise perpendicular upon it being the center of the given line see fig iii plate iv divide the base line bcinto two equal parts then extend the compasses to any distance greater than or and with one foot in sweep the arch then with the same extent of compasses set one foot in and sweep the arch ƒg and from the intersection of the two arches at draw line to the center of the base line at and you have the perpendicular required to draw line parallel to or equidistant from another given line extend the compasses to the distance of the parallel required then with one foot in any point of the line given as in sweep the circle again without altering the compasses set one foot in another point as in and describe the circle then rule the line touching the outward parts of the two circles and you will then have the parallel to the line given to bisect or divide given line into two equal parts see fig plate iv having taken with your compasses any distance greater than half the given line proceed with one foot of them in to describe the arch and without altering the distance seiting one foot in sweep the arch and these arches will intersect each other in the points which joined by perpendicular will cross in the middle point having three given points not in right line how to turn circle through them see fig vi plate iv three points being fixed as at and proceed to join them by the right lines and then by fig bisect the line with the line which being doné divide the line with the line and from the middle where these lines center extend your compasses to and sweep the arch sure way of drawing an oval see fig vii plate iv divide the given line into four equal parts one foot of the compasses being set in describe circle without altering the extent of the compasses from sweep the circle then extend the compaffes one foot in and sweep- the arch with the same extent set one foot in and turn the arch the intersections must be united by perpendicular from to then proceed with- one foot of the compasses in to describe the arch and with the same extent of compasses set one foot in and turn the arch anotker certain method see fig viii plate iv rule given line then place one foot of the compasses in and describe the circle then with the same extent of compasses on the line in the- supposed point describe the cirele and through the points where the two circles intersect rule the perpendicular then having one foot of the compasses set in extend the other so as to sweep the arch to the lower ex- tremities of the circles then without altering the compasses set one foot in ty and turn the arch to join the upper extremities by the preceding examples it is evident that an oval of any form or size may be constructed at pleasure only observing always to set the compasses at an equal dis- tance from the given line on the perpendicular practical examples in perspective to draw square pavement in perspective see fig ix plate iv supposing you have piece of pavement consisting of pieces of marble each foot square your first business is to draw an lchnographical plan which is thus performed an exact square being made to the size of your intended plan proceed to divide both horizon and base into eight equal parts and from each division in the base to its opposite point in the horizon rule perpendicular lines and divide the sides into the same number ruling acrofs from point to point parallel lines so that of course vour pavement will be divided into square feet as the eight feet in length being multiplied by the eight in breadth produce the number of pieces contained in the whole then rule from corner to corner diagonal linies and you will have your ground-plot as in the same figure now to throw this into perspective draw another square as before directed and divide the base line only into eight equal parts fix your point of sight at in the center of the horizon then to every division in the base rule lines from the same point and proceed to rule diagonals from to and from to to answer thofe in the ground-plot and you will then have your square reduced to the triangle and from the point where the line is intersected by the diagonal to the opposite intersection where the line is inter- sected by the diagonal then rule parallel line which is the abridgment of the square from the rest of the lines which go from the base to the point of sight through the points which are intersected by the diagonals rule parallel lines and you will then have your square pavement laid in true perspective as in fig plate iv to find the height and proportion of objects appearing above the horizon on supposed plane see fig xi plate iv having your horizontal line ruled proceed with sixing your point of sight as at and marking the place of your nearest pillar by dot at the summit or top as at and another at the base as at then rule à line from to and another from to and these two lines give the height of any number of pil- lars for instance would you have your pillar at fix your dot for the base then meet the diagonal at by ruling parallel line and to the diagonal cn rule the perpendicular which perpendicular shews the height of the pillar required at or would you have pillar placed at observe the soregoing di- rections ruling the parallels hi and kl and the perpendicnlars im and lo will shew the required heights and distances in finding the diameter at any particular distances you are to be guided by that nearest the base as for example suppose your nearest pillar dr to be ten feet in height and one in diameter intersect from bottom to top in two equal parts and upon the base of the pillar set off one of them from the point of sight to the diameter then rule line to the point of sight from and you will have on the respective bases the thickness of each pillar the preceding rule exemplified in objects beneath the horizon see fig xie plate iv having ruled the horizontal line fix the point of sight as at then according to your judgment make dot for the feet of your figure as at and another for the head as at then rule à line from cto and from to and these two diagonals will shew the true height of any number of figures that can be wanted make dots for the place of the feet of any figure where you would have them stand as at and now to know the height of each respec- tively draw parallel lines from the dots and to the diagonal cd then raise perpendiculars from the points where the parallels intersect this diagonal at lo mr ns ot and pu and the perpendicular shews the height of the figure at as does mrof that at ns of that at tof that at l pu of that at note you will be obliged always to fix the height of one figure as at in order to find the size of the rest and the point ef sight may be placed at any dis- tance you please from the first supposed figure on the horizontal line rule your base line of any length you please as at then raise perpendi- culars as in fig ii from to and from bto next take with your com- pasies the length from to and setting one foot in turn the arch ef then with the same extent of compasses set one ’ oot in and describe the arch lastly rule line from to touching the outward parts of the two arches where- they intersect the perpendiculars and you have the square required from given line to form parallelogram see fig xiv plate iv rule given line of the length required as at then raise perpendicular at and another at as in fig ii and on them set off the proper heights as and bd join cd with line and your parallelogram is complete fig xv plate iv in this figure we have attempted to shew how to draw with- certainty that curved line wnich mr. hogarth in his ingenious analysis has stiled the line of beauty- there has however been an objection raised by some that he has omitted the rule whereby this truly useful line may be found for which reason and in order to en force the study of it we have given thisfigure not as an insult upon that celebrated author whose meaning is very clear but as .line well deserving of attention being of itself single and easily drawn and as we are desirous of following the method of that great artist in the explanation of our ideas by the most familiar objects we here inform the student that it may be plainly seen in that well-known amusement of the school-boy six-pointed star in which the contrasted halves of any two opposite points give the line which is with great propriety stiled the line of beauty to execute direct view see fig plate if you would draw direct view of house and wall or in other words geometrical elevation to be raised from plan or ground-plot by scale madæ according to the dimensions of the building first rule the base line above the- plan at any height vou please then erect perpendiculars at and for the- extremities of the house also fiom the windows marked in the plan ef gh ér no which will give the breadth of all the windows rule these perpendiculars faintly with black lead having done this suppose the bottom of the parlour or ground-floor windows to be feet above the base line take off with your compasses feet from the scale and transfer that measure from to at each end of the house then supposing the parlour windows to be feet high set off that measure from the scale and transfer it to the extremities from tor then if the distance from the top of the parlour windows to the bottom of those on the first floor be feet take it as before from the scale and set it off at each end from tos then suppose the chamber windows to be feet high transfer that distance from the scale from to at each end next supposing from the top of the first floor or chamber windows to the bottom of the cornice to be feetx take feet from the scale as before and set off that distance at each end from to then if the cornice be foot high meafure it off from the scale and transfer it to each end from to lastly suppose the roof to be feet from the top of the cornice set off feet at each end from to then rule faintly with- your pencil the parallels q rr ss tt and you have the height and breadth of all the windows which having outfined rub out the parallels- and perpendiculars with bread and setting off feet the supposed height of the- wall rule the line from to at each end and the work is ready for shading to draw an oblique view see fig ii plate first rule the horizontal line de and if the most remarkable object be on the left-hand as at having taken your station on the base line as at from that place raise perpendicular which at the point of sight will intersect the- horizon and to find the roof and base of the principal buildiag rule the dia- gonals lk and mk observe whether the prospect before you make curve which if it should be careful to make the same in your copy whether it be direct or oblique to draw view wherein are accidental points see fig iii plate .. suppose large building in which are seen two fronts taking different directionss¬ as in this view six your station at about the center of the base line after which- rule the horizontal line then fix upon that your boints of sight and and rule first the diagonals eh and and you may draw diagonals from the point of sight to and that they may take their proper directious- towards their respective points of sight accidental points seldom intervene where there is but small distance as in canalss groves noblemens seats which are to he drawn by the strictest rules of per- spective but when the prospect is extensive it must include every thing analagous thereto but as this requires such an infinite number of accidental points you had better not attempt them till your ideas are farther improved and your judgment more strengthened of enlarging and contracting fig and plate with your compasses divide your original into any number of squares and with your pencil rule from side to side and from top to bottom then divide your paper into the same number of squares bigger or lefs than the original you intend to enlarge or contract and you may to prevent mistakes number the squares both in the original and copy as they are done in the plate this done place vour original before vou and draw square by square that is to say make the same parts as are contained in one square of your original fall into the same square of your intended copy and by doing this with care you will make the one exactly corre- spond with the other in due symmetry and proportion then outline your subject with indian ink and rub out the marks of the pencil with bread and so proceed to shading of copying of draughts when you would copy print or drawing exactly of the same size rub the back of it with the dust of red chalk or black lead lay this upon vour paper and pin it down at the four corners then with blunt point trace the qutlines and breadths of the shadows which done having carefully examined it to see that nothing be omitted take it off and finish it with the pencil or pen another way to make an exact copy and at the same time to preserve the ori- ginal is to lay piece of transparent paper upon it and draw the outlines thereon with ’ black-lead pencil then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon place piece of thin post-paper reddened or blackened at the back after which proceed to trace and finish it according to the foregoing rule if vou would reverse your original you need only turn the transparent paper with the drawing you have made upon it downwards upon the post-paper and trace it as above directed of the imitation of life chuse the person you are to draw from to be of an handsome shape and good proportion as this will confirm your ideas and illustrate the rules before-mentioned place the person in the most natural and easy position always avoiding in vour early practice the copying of ungraceful or distorted attitudes which serve only to geve the young practitioner wrong bias and render him incapable of forming just and proper conception of the natural beauties and graces of the human form begin as before directed with slight sketch with vour charcoal of the main leading strokes or outlines which having done correctly proceed to finish with your pencil take particular notice of the muscles as they oecur as this will give resem- blance of the person in the outline if correctly observed before vou shadow it in drawing likeness great care is necessary to exprefs the paffions in the liveliest manner and this is done by minding the disposition of every feature with pecu- liar nicety this being by far the most difficult part the pupil has to learn we would advise him not to be too hasty to attain it before he has made thorough proficiency in the easier and more practicable branches of drawing nor would wey on the other hand discourage the efforts of genius which in the pursuit of any art or science are most certainly truly laudable and have been frequently attended with the deserved success all that we mean to inculate by this caution is not to aspire all at once or by too hasty strides to perfection but rather to ascend pro- gressively the necessary steps which lead towards it of history the student has in this branch the whole art of drawing as it were blended together and when he has so far gained his point as to draw compleatly the- human body this will be the most delightful employment that can be imagined for the choice of subjects he need never be at à loss as his own or his neighbour ’ families will furnisn him with abundance books will likewise greatly afsist him particularly the sacred history which is replete with an inexhaustible fund of events above all others worthy to be recorded and therefore most deserving his- ferious attention to this we may add the history of our own country wherein the illustrious actions of ancient heroes as well as those of our contemporaries and particularly our gallant officers military and naval in the last war afford ample matter for the exercise of the ingenious artist as to beasts birds flowers fruits plants we think it wholly unnecessary togive any directions concerning them as the subjects we have already discussed are by far the most usefül and he- who can draw human figure correctly is sufficiently qualified for every other branch of this noble art but as the experienced draughtsman nay sometimes chuse- to vary the object of his study which when perfect in anatomical subjects he- may do with safety we have given few examples of beasts birds shipping for his farther entertainment and amusement observations on design as well in regard to theory as practice the theory of design is only to be acquired by studying the best authors who have laid down the scientifical rules for the attainment of this art by sound knowledge in the theory of design those who are unable to draw the most simple objects may be enabled to give their opinion upon the performances of the best masters in this case theory being detached from practice is equally considered and distinguished by the epithet of taste there is another method of acquiring taste which is by frequently examining good pictures in the prefence of those who are esteemed connoisseurs in the art who generally pafs their judgment with- out reserve theory in this sense of the word has been hitherto the greatest support of painting for had taste been confined to practice only we should not be able to find so many invaluable pieces in the cabinets of princes and other encouragers of art and who could not perhaps have been permitted by their avocations to have acquired any taste for this polite art so that painting of course would have found no patronage the practical part of design is produced only by frequent application of the hand accompanied with the understanding in the imitation of various forms those objects whether persons or places which we have but transient view of are in the menory like sketches of charcoal upon paper which the whisking of feather will entirely deface how then shall the unaccustomed hand perform its function when the object is not inculcated in the mind and can in fhort time retain anly confused idea of its resemblance- this is therefore an infallible proof that the only way to attain perfection is to blend practice with theory from what has been already said it is plain that the conveyance of the similitude of objects is only to be obtained by an unwearied application the hand by prac- tice acquires à facility which gives freedom and we must correct that freedom by judgment please to observe that we do not here mean by judgment that exertion of the understanding that is necessary to compose an historical picture but relates only to proportion it being nothing uncommon for one who is good practical draughts- man to be entirely incapable of composing which we think should be with the utmost propriety ascribed to the genius
