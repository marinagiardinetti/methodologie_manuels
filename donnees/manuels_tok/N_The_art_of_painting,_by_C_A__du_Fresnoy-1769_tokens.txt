the richt honourable earl of burlington coc my lord ahe firft imprestion of this latin poem having been ad- drefted to the famous mont colbert marquis de seignelay thought could not do greater honour

publifhed of the art of painting and to the character of mr. dryden if any thing can be added is that he is one of your lordship ’ favourite authors and fuch it will be expected should account for some liberties that have been taken with his excellent trant lation the misfortune that attended him in that undertaking was that for want of competent knowledge in painting he fuffered himself to be mifled by an unskilful guide mont de piles told him in his preface that his french verfion was made at the requeft of the author himself and altered by him till it was wholly to his mind this nir dryden taking upon content thought there was no- thing more incumbent on him than t dedicatory to put it into the beft english he could and accordingly performed his part here as in every thing elfe

that should fay fomething on my behalf in respect to my prefent undertaking firft then the reader may be pleafed to know that it was not of my own choice that undertook this work many of our moft kilful painters and other artiffs were pleafed to recommend this aurber to me as one who perfectly underffood the rules of painting who gave the beff and moft con- cife intructions for performance and the fureft to inform the judgment of allwholoved this noble art that they who before were rather fond of it than knowingly admired it might defend their inclination by their reafon that they might underftand thofe excellencies which they blindly valued to as not to be farther imposed on by bad pieces and to know when nature was well imitated by the moft able mafters it is true indeed and xvi and they acknowledge it that befides the rules which are given in this treatife or which can be given in any other to make judgment of good pictures and to value them more or less when compared with one another there is farther required long converfation with the best pieces which are not very frequent either in france or england yet some we have not only from the hands of holbein rubens and vandyke one of them admirable for hiftory-painting and the other twd for portfaits but of many flemist mafters and thofe not inconfidera- ble though for defign not equal to the ira- lians and of thefe latter atfo we are not unfurnished with fome pieces of rapbael — gie michael angelo and others tian correg but to return to my own undertaking of this tranflation freely own that thought myfelf uncapable of performing it either to their satisfaction or my own credit not but that underffoed the original larin and the french furbor perhaps as well as moft englissmen but was not fufficiently verfed in the terms of and therefore thought that many of thofe perfons who put this honourable talk on me were more able to perform it themfelves as undeubtedly they were but they affuring me of their affift- ance in correcting my faules where spoke improperly was encouraged to attempt it that might not be wanting in whati could to fatisfy the defires of fo many gentlemen who were willing to give the world this ufe- ful work they have effectually performed their promife to me and have been as careful on my side to take their advice in all things to that the reader may affure himself himfelf of tolerable tranflation not ele- gant for proposed not that to myself but familiar clear and infiructive in any of which parts if have failed the fault lies wholly at my door in this one particular only muft beg the reader pardon the prose translation of the poem is not free from poerical expresfions and dare not promife that tome of them are not fuffian or at leaft highly metaphorical but this being fault in the firft digeftion that is the original latin was not to be remedied in the fe- cond vix the tranflation and may confidently fay that whoever had attempted it muft have fallen into the same inconve- nience or much greater that of falfe verfion when undertook this work was already engaged in the tranflation of virgil from whom have borrowed only two months and am now returning to that which ought to underffand better in the mean time beg the reader pardon for entertaining him to long with myself it is an ufual part of ill manners in all aulbers and almoft in all mankind to trouble others with their bufiness and was fo fenfible of it beforehand that had not now committed it unless fome concernments of the readers had been interwoven with my own but know not while am atoning for one er- for if am not falling into another for have been importuned to fay fomething far- ther of this and to make fome obfer- vations in it in relation to the

can not be unpleating at leaft to fuch who are converfant in the philofophy of plaro and to avoid tedioufnets will not tranflate the whole difcourfe but take and leave as find occafion god almighty in the fabric of the universe first contemplated himself and reffected on his own excellencies from which be drew and constituted those first forms which are called ideas so that every species which was after- wards expressed was produced fr that first idea forming that wonderful centexture of all created beings but the celeftial bodies above the moon being incorruptible and not subject to change remained for evar fair and in per- petual order on the centrary all things which are sublunary are subject to change to defor- mily and to decay and though nature al aways intends confummate baauty in her pro- dubtions yet through the inequality of the mat- ler the ferms are altered and in particular human beauty suffers alteration for the werse as we see to our mertification in the deformi- ries and disproportions which ars in us for which reason the artful painter and the sculp- fer imitating the divine maker form to them- selves as well as they are able model of the superier beauties and reflecting on them endeavour to correct and amend the common na- ture and to represent it as it was first created without fault eirber in cowur or in linea- mcht this idea which ave mey call the goddess of painting and of sculpture defiends on the marble and the cloth and becomes the origi nal of these arrs and being measured by the compass of the intellect is irself the measure of of the performing hand and being animated by the imagination infuses life into the image the idea of the painter and the sculptor is un- doubtedly that perfect and excellent example of the mind by imitation of which imagined form all things are represented which fall under bu- man sight such is the defimtion which is made by cicero in his bock of the orator to brutus co as therefore in forms and figures is somewhat which is excellent and to wbich imagined species all are referred by imitation wbich ars objects of sight in like manner we be- the species of eloquence in our minds effigies or actual

ef- fect of art the work of nature will at co ways appear the less beautiful because are is more accurate than nature '' butlcuxis who from the choice which be made of frve virgins dreaw that wenderful picture of he- lena awhich cicero in his orater before-men- tioned sets before us as the mest perfect exam- ple of beauty at the same time admonisbes painter to contemplate the ideas of the most na- tural forms and to make judicious cbeice of several bodies all of them the most elegant which be can find by avbich ave may plainly understand that he thought it imposfible to find in any one body all those perfections awbich be fought for the accomplishment of hiclena because nature in any individual person makes notbing that is perfect in all its parts for this reason maximus tyrius alfo jays that the the image which is taken by painter from se- veral bodies produces brauty which it is impossible to find in any single natural body ap- proaching to the perfection of the faireft sta-

of june another hercules and cupid are perfect beau- ties though of different kinds for beauty is only that which makes all things as they are in their proper and perfect nature which the best painters always choose by contemplating the forms of each we ought famber to consider that pitture being the representation of bu- man action the painter ought to retain in his mind the examples of all affections and pas- sions as poet preserves the idea of an angry man of one who is fearful fad or merry and so of all the rest for it is impossible to express that with the hand which never entered into the imagination in this manner as bave rudely and briefty shewn you painters and scuiptors choofing the most elegant natural beauties perfectionate the idea and advance their art even

words is to the sight must here break off abruptly and having con- ducted the reader as it were to fecret walk there leave him in the midft of silence to con template these ideas which have only sketched and which every man must finish for himself in thefe pompous expreffions or fuch as thefe the iralian has given you his idea of painter and though can not much com- mend the stile muit needs

painters by the virtue of their outlines coleurs lights and sbadows re- present the same things ann persons in their pictures thus xxv kxvi thus as convey ships either accompany or should accompany their merchants till they may prosecute the reft of their voyage without danger fo phileffrarus has brought me thus far on my way and can now lail on without him he has begun to peak of the great

might be faid on the paraitel of thefe two siffer-arts will take my rife from belfori before pro- ceed to the aurbor of this book the bufiness of his preface is to prove that learned painter should form to himself an idea of perfect narure this imags he is to fet before his mind in all his undertak- ings and to draw from thence as from storchoufe the beauries which are to enter into his work thereby correcting wature from what actually the is in individuale to what the ought to be and what the was created now as this idea of peefection is of little fe in pertrairs or the refemblances of particular perfons fo neither is it in the charatters of comedy and tragedy which are never to be made perfect but always to be drawn with some specks of frailty and de- ficience fuch as they have been deferihed to us in hiffory if they were real characters or fuch as the poer began to thew them at their firtt appearance if they were only fic- citious titious or imaginary the perfection of fuch stage-characters confifts chiefly in their likenels to the deficient faulty nature which is their original only as it is obferved more at large hereafter in fuch cafes there will always be found better likeness and worte and the better is conflantly to be chosen mean in tragedy which reprefents the figures of the higheff form among man- kind thus in pertrairs the painter wilt not take that side of the face which has some notorious blemish in it but either draw it in profile as apelles did astrgonuss who had loft one of his eyes or elfe shadow the more imperfect side for an ingenious flattery is to be allowed to the profeffors of both arts fo long as the likenels is not de- rroyed it is true that all manner of im- pertections muft not be taken away from the characters and the reafon is that there may be left fome grounds of pity for their misfortunes we can never be grieved for their miferies who are thoroughly wicked and have thereby juftly called their calami= ties on themfelves such men are the na- tural objects of our hatred not of our com- miferation if on the other side their characters were wholly perfect fuch as for example the character saint or mar- yr in play his or her misfortunes would produce impious thoughts in the beholders they would accufe the meavens of injuftice and think of leaving religien where piety was to ill requited ifay the greater part would be tempted to to do fay not that they ought and the confequence is too dangerous for the practice in this have accufed myfelf for my own st. carbarine but but let truth prevail sopbockes has taken the juft medium in his oedipus he is fome- what arrogant at his firft entrance and is inquifitive through the whole tragedy yet thefe imperfections being balanced by great virtues they hinder not our compat- hon for his miferies neither yet can they deftroy that horror which the nature of his crimes have excited in us such in paint- ing are the warrs and moles which adding likeness to the face are not therefore to he omitted but thefe produce no loathing in us but how far to proceed and where to ftop is left to the judgment of the poer and the painter in comedy there is fome- what more of the worfe likeness to be taken becaufe that is often to produce laughter which is occafioned by the sight of some de- formity but for this refer the reader to arifforce it is sharp manner of instruction for the vulgar who are never well amended till they are more than fufficiently exposed that may return to the beginning of this remark concerning perfect ideas have only this to fay that the parallel is often true in epic poetry the heroes of the poers are to be drawn according to this rule there is fcarce frailty to be left in the beft of them any more than is to be found in divine narure and if reneas fomerimes weeps it is not in bemoaning his own miferies but thofe which his people undergo if this be an imperfec sion the son of god when he was incarnate shed tears of compaffion over terufalem and lenrulus defcribes him often weeping but never laughing to that virgil is jufti- fied even from the boly scriptures have but but one word more which for once will anticipate from the aurbor of this book though it muft be an idea of perfec- tion from which both the epic poer and the hiffory painter draws yet all perfections are not fuitable to all subjects but every one muff be defigned according to that per- feet beauty which is proper to him an apollo muft be diftinguished from tupiter pallas from venus and to in peetry an eneas from any other hero for piety is his chief perfection homer ’ achilles is kind of exception to this rule but then he is not perfect here nor fo intended by the poer all his geds had fomewhat of human imperfection for which he has been taxed by plate as an imitator of what was bad but virgil obferved his fault and mended it vet acbilles was perfect in the strength of his body and the vigour of his mind had he been less paffionate or lets revenge= ful the poet well forefaw that hecfor had been killed and troy taken at the firff af- fault which had defroyed the beautiful contrivance of his riad and the moral of preventing difcord amongt confederate princes which was his principal intention for the moral as bofs observes is the firft bufiness of the poer as being the ground- work of his instruction this being formed he contrives fuch defign or fable as may be moft fuitable to the moral after this he begins to think of the perfons whom he is to employ in carrying on his design and gives them the manners which are moft pro= perto their feveral cbaracters the thoughts and words are the laft parts which give beauty and colouring to the piece when itay fay rthat the manners of the here ought to be good in perfection contradict not the marquis of nermanty opinion in that ad- mirable verfe where fpeaking of perfect character he calls it ataukless monster which the world ne er knew for that excellent critic intended only to speak of dramatic characters and not of epic thus at leafl have thewn that in the moft perfect porm which is that of vir- fil perfect idea was required and followed and confequently that all fucceeding poers ought rather to imitate him than even ho- mer will now proceed as promifed to the author of this book he tells you al- moft in the firft lines of it that the chief end of painting is to please the exesz and it is one great end of pectry to please the mind thus far the paraltel of the aris holds true with this difference that the principal end of painting is to please and the chief defign of pceiry is to inffracl in this the latter teems to have the advantage of the former but if we confider the rriffs themfelves on both sides certainly their aims are the very same they would both make fure of pleafing and that in preference to instruction next the means of this pleafure is by deceit one impofes on the sight and the other on the inderftanding fretion is of the effence of peetry as well as of painting there is re- femblance in one of human bodies things and actions which are not real and in the other of true story by fiction and as all stories are not proper subjects for an epic peem or tragedy to neither are they for for neble picrurs the subjects both of the one and of the other ought to have no- thing of immoral low or filthy in them but this being treated at large in the book itfelf wave it to avoid repetition only muft add that though catallus ovid and others were of another opinion that the subject of poets and even their thoughts and exprestions might be loofe provided their lives were chaffe and holy yet there are no fuch licences permitted in that frr any more than in painting to defign and co- four obicene nudities vita proba off is no excute for it will fcarcely be admitted that either poer or painter can be chaite who give us the contrary examples in their writings and their pictures we fee nothing of this kind in firgil that which comes the nearckt to it the adventure of the cave where dide and eneas were driven by the storm yet even there the poer pre- tends marriage before the confummation and june herfelf was prefent at it neither is there any expreffion in that story which roman marron tnight not read without bluth befides the poer paffes it over as hatily as he can as if he were afraid of ray- ing in the cave ith the two levers and of being witness to their actions now suppofe that parnrer would not be much commended who should pick out this ca- vern from the whole eners when there is not another in the work he had better leave them in their obfcurity than let in flath of lightning to clear the natural darkness of the place by which he muft dif cover himself as much as them the attarn piecrs and holy decorations of painting thew that firr may be applied to better ufes as well as peerry and amongft many other inftances the farnese gallery painted by hannibal car- racci is fufficient witness yet remaining the whole work being morally infiructive and particularly the herculis bivinm which i perfect triumph of virtue over vice as it is wonderfully well defcribed by the inge- nious bellori hitherto have only told the reader what ought not to be the subject of picture or of poem what it ought to be on either side our urbor tells us it muff in general be great and noble and in this the paralle is exactly true the subject of poer either in tragedy or in an epic peem is great action of some illuftrious ifero it is the same in painting not every ction nor every perfon is confiderable enough to enter into the cloth it muft be the anger of an acbilles the piety of an eneas the sacrifice of an ipbigenia for heroines as well as heroes are comprehended in the rule but the pa- rallel is more complete in tragedy than in an epic poem for as tragedy may be made out of many particular esijodes of ho- mer or of virgil to may noble picture be defigned out of this or that particular story in either fathor hiffery is alfo fruitful of defigns both for the painter and the tragic peet curtins throwing himself into gulph and the two recis facrificing themfelves for the safety of their country are subjects for tragedy and picture such is scipie refor- ing the spaniss bride whom he either loved or may be tuppofed to love by which he gained the hearts of great nation to in- tereff themfelves for rome against carthape these are all but particular pieces in lizy' hiflory and yet are full cemplete subjects for the pen and pencil now the reafon of this is evident tragedy and picture are more narrowly circumfcribed by the mecha- nic rules of time and place than the epic poom the time of this laft is left indefi- nite it is true homer took up only the space of eight and forty days for his thiad but whether virgils action was compre- hended in vear or fomewhat more is not determined by bofn homer made the place of his action trey and the grecian camp befieging it virgil introduces his eneds cometimes in sicily fometimes in carthage and other times at cume before he brings him to laurentum and even after that he wanders again to the kingdom of evander and fome parts of tuscany before he returns to finith the war by the death of turnus but tragedy according to the practice of the ancients was always confined within the compafs of twenty four hours and feldom takes up to much time as for the place of it it was always one and that not in larger scnfe as for example whole city or two or three feveral houfes in it but the market or some other public place com- mon to the choras and all the actors which eftabliffed law of theirs have not an opportunity to examine in this place becaute can not do it without digreffion from my subject though it feems too drict at the firtt appearance becaufe it excludes all secret intrigues which are the bcauries of the modern stage for nothing can be car- ried on with privacy when the choras is tup- suppoted to be always prefent but to pro- ceed muft fay this to the advantage of painting even above tragedy that what this laftreprefents in the space of many hours the former shews us in one moment the action the paffion and the manners of to many per fons as are contained in picture are to be difcerned at once in the twinkling of an exe at leaft they would be fo if the sight could fravel over to many different objects all at once or the mind could digeft them all at the same instant or point of time thus in the famous picture of poufin which re- prefents the iaffitution of the bleffed sacrament you fee our saviour and his tavelve disciples all concurring in the fame action after dif- ferent manners and in different poftures only the manners of judas are diffirguithed from the reft here is but one indivifibe point of time obferved but one acdion per- formed by fo many perfons in one room and at the fan table yet the eye can not comprehend at once the whole object nor the mind follow it fo faft it is contidered at leifure and feen by intervals such are the subjects of noble pictures and fuch are only to be undertaken by noble hands there are other parts of nature which are meaner and yet are the subjects both of painters and of piets for to proceed in the parallel as comedy is reprefentation of human life in infe- rior pertons and low subjects and by that means creeps into the nature of poerry and is kind of taiper shrub belonging to the species of cedar to is the painting of clowns the reprefentation of durch kermis the bru- sal sport of snick or snee and thouland other other things of this mean invention kind of picture which belongs to nature but of the loweft form such is lazar in com- parifon to venus both are drawn in human figures they have faces alike though not like faces there is yet lower sort of pee- try and painting which is out of nature for farce is that in poelry which grotesque is in picture the perfons and action of farce are all unnatural and the manners falfe that is inconfifting with the charac- ters of mankind grotesque painting is the juit refemblance of this and borace begins his art of pectry by defcribing fuch figure with man ’ head horfe neck the wings of bird and fith tail parts of different species jumbled together accord- ing to the mad imagination of the dauber and the end of all this as he tells you after- ward is to caufe laughter very mon- fer in barthelomeru-fair for the mob to gape at for their two-pence laughter is in- deed the propriety of man but juft enough to diffinguith him from his elder brother with four legs it is kind of baftard-pleafure taken in at the ryes of the vulgar ga- zers and at the ears of the beafly audience church-painters ufe it to divert the honeit countryman at public prayers and keep his ryes open at heavy sermon and farce- scribblers make ufe of the fame noble inven- tion to entertain citixens country gentlemen and covent-garden fops if they are merry all goes well on the poer ’ side the better sort go thither too but in defpair of senfe and the juft images of nature which are the adequate pleafures of the mind but the can give the stage no better than what was given him by nature and the agers muff reprefent fuch things as they are capa- ble to perform and by which both they and the scribbter may get their living.after all it is good thing to laugh at any rate and if straw can tickle man it is an inftru= ment of happineis beafts can weep when they fuffer but they can not laugh and as sir william davenant outerves in his preface to gondiberr so it is the wifdom of go- ss vernment to permit plays he might have added farces is as it is the prudence cs of carter to put bell upon his horfes is to make them carry their burdens chear- fully have already shewn that one main end of poetry and painting is to pleafe and have said fomething of the kinds of both and of their subjects in which they hear greatre- temblance to each other muft now confider them as they are great and noble arrs and as they are arrs they muft have rules which may direct them to their common end to all arrs and sciences but more particu- larly to thefe may be applied what hip ocrates fays of phyfic as find him cited by an emi- nent french critic medicine has long subfitied in the world the principles of is it are certain and it has certain way is by both which there has been found in the co courfe of many ages an infinite number se of things the experience of which has of confirmed its ofefulness and goodness all that is wanting to the perfection of so this art will undoubtedly be found if of able men and fuch as are inftructed in of the ancient rules will make farther in= of quiry into it and endeavour to arrive at of that that which is hitherto unknown by that is which is already known but all who having rejected the ancient rules and it taken the oppofite ways yet boaft them- of felves to be mafters of this art do but is deceive others and are themfelves de- of ceived for that is absolutely impoffible this is notorioully true in thefe two arts for the way to pleafe being to imitate na- ture both the poets and the painters in an- cient times and in the beft ages have stu- died her and from the practice of both these ares the rules have been drawn by which we are instructed how to pleafe and to com- pass that end which they obtained by fol- lowing their example for nature is hill the same in all ages and can never be contrary to herfelf thus from the pratice of schy- lus sopbecles and enripides ariffotle dre his rules for tragedy and pbiloffratus for painting thus amongtt the moterns the italian and french crities by rudying the precepts of arifforle and horace and having the example of the grecian poers before their eyes have given us the rules of modern tragedy and thus the crities of the fame countries in the art of painting have given the precepts of perfecting that it is true that poerry has one advantage over painting in thefe laft ages that we have sill the remaining examples both of the greet and latin pocts whereas the painters have nothing left them from apelles protegenes parrbasius leaxis and the reit but only the teffimonies which are given of their in- comparable works but intlead of this they have fome of their best starnes bafo-relievos columns abelifes which were faved out of xxxvil xxkvili of the common ruin and are still preserved in iraly and by well diftinguithing what is proper to sculfrure and what to painting and what is common to them both they have judicieutly repaired that lofs and the great genrus of raphael and others having fuc- ceeded to the limes of barbarifm and igno- rance the knowledge of printing is now ar- rived to fupreme perfection though the performance of it is much declined in the prefent age the greatet age for poerry amongit the romans was certainly that of rn gufus cirfar and yet we are told that paint ing was then at its lower ebb and perhaps sculpeare was alto reclining at the fame time in the reign of damirian and fome who succeeded him poerry was but meanly cul rivated but painting eminently fourithed am not here to give the hiffery of the t how they were both in manner ex- tinguithed by the irreption of the barbarcus nations and both reffored about the times of lco the tenth charkes the fitth and francis the firtt though might obterve that neither frieffe nor any of his cotempo- rary poets ever arrived at the excellency of raphael tirian and the reft in painting but in revenge at this time or lately in many countries poerry is better pradifed than her siffer- to whatfleight the mag- nificence and encouragement of the prefent king of france may carry paiting and sculp- fure is uncertain but by what he has done before the war in which he is engaged we may expect what he will do after the happy conclufion of peace which is the prayer and with of all thofe who have not an inte- rest to prolong the miferies of enrege for it it is meft certain as our husbor amongit others has obferved that reward is the spur of virtue as well in all good arts as in all laudable attempts and emulation which is the other spur will never be wanting either amongtt poets or painters when particular rewards and prizes are proposed to the best defervers but to return from this digref- fion though it was almoff neceffary all the rules of painting are methodically concife- and yet clearly delivered in this present treatife which have tranflated beffis has not given more exalt rules for the exic poem nor dacier for tragedy in his late excellent tranflation of ariffotle and his notes upon him than our frefney has made for painting with the parallet of which muft refume my discourfe followingmy furbor ’ stert though with more brevity than intended becaufe virgit calls me cs the principal and moft ct important part of painting is to know io aubat is moft beautiful in nature and moft proper for that arr that which is the molt beautiful is the moft noble subject fo in poetry travedy is more beautiful than comedy becaute as faid the perfons are greater whom the poer instructs and confe- quently the instructions of more benefit to mankind the action is likewife greater and more noble and thence is derived the greater and more noble pleafure to imilate watare well in whatfoever sub- jett is the perfection of borh arts and that picture and that porm which comes neareft the refemblance of narure is the best but it follows not that what pleafes moft in ei- ther kind is therefore good but what ought to pleafe our depraved appetites and nofance of the arts miflead our judgments and caufe us often to take that for true imi- tion of narure which has no refemblance of natare in it to inform our judgments and to reform our taffes rnles were invented that by them we might difcern when narare was imitated and how nearly have been forced to recapitulate thefe things becaufe mankind is not more liable to deceit than it is willing to continue in pleafing error rrengthened by long habitude the imi- tation of narare is therefore juftly conftituted as the general and indeed the only rule of avi- pleating both in poefry and painting fforte tells us that imiration pleafes becaufe affords matter for reafoner to inquire into the truth or falthood of imitation by comparing its likeness or unlikeness with the original but by this rule every spe- culation in nature whofe truth falls under the inquiry of philesopher muft produce the fame delight which is not true should rather affign another reafon truth is the object of our underflanding as good is of our will and the underftanding can no more be delighted with lie than the will can choofe an apparent evil as truth is the end of all our speculations to the difcovery of it is the pleafure of them and fince true knowledge of narare gives us pleafure lively imitation of it either in peetry or painting mult of neceffity produce much greater for borb thefe arrs as said before are not only true imitations of narure but of the beft narure of that which is wrought up to nobler pitch they pre- sent as with images more perfect than the life in any individual and we have the pleafure pleafure to fee all the fcattered beauties of nature united by happy chemiffry without its deformities or faults they areimitations of the paffions which always move and there- fore confequently pleafe for without mo- tion there can be no delight which can not be confidered but as an active paffion when we view thefe elevated ideds of natare the refult of that view is admiration which is always the caufe of pleafure this foregoing remark which gives the reafon why imitation pleafes was fent me by mr. walter moyle moft ingenious young gentleman converfant in all the studies of humanity much above his years he had alfo furnished me according to my request with all the particular paftages in arifforte and horace which are ufed by them to explain the arr of pestry by that of paintings which if ever have time to retouch this esay shall be inferted in their places having thus shewn that imitation pleafes and why it pleafes in both these arts it follows that fome rules of imitation are neceffary to obtain the end for without rales there can be no arr any more than there can be house without door to conduct you into it the principal parts of painting and peetry next follow invention is the firft part and abfolutely neceffary to them both yet no rule ever was or ever can be given how to compats it happy gearas is the gift of nature it depends on the influence of the stars fay the affrologers on the organs of the body fay the naturaliffs it is the particu- lar gift of heaven lay the divines both ctriffians and heathens how to improve it many books can teach us how to ob- tain li xlii tain it none that nothing can be done with- out it all agree tu mbil irvitd dices faciefos minerva without invention painter is but copier and poet but plagiary of others both are allowed fometimes to copy and transtate but as our furbor tells you that is not the beft part of their reputation imitators are but servile kind of cattle fays the poet or at beft the keepers of cattle for other men have nothing which is properly their wivn that is fufficient mortification for me while am tranflating virgil but to copy the beft author is kind of praife if per- form it as ought as copy after rapbed is more to be commended than an orsginal of any indifferent painter under this head of investion is placod its dispesition of the work to put all things in beautiful order and harmony that theawhole may be of fiece the composisions of the painter should be conformabte to the fras of andient hurbors to the cuttoms and the times and this is exactly the hame in poeiny homer and vingilare twhe our guides in the epic sepbocles and eurtpides mcfra pedy in all things we are to imitate the culloms and the times of those persons and things which we reprefent not to make new rule of the drama as lopex de vega has attempted unfuccessfully to do but to be content to follow our mafters who un derffood natare better than we but if the story which we treat be modern we are to vary the cultoms according to the time and the country where the scene of action lids for this is hill to imitate nature which is al- ways the fame though in different dress as in the composition of picture the painter is to take care that nothing enter into it which is not proper or convenient to the subject to likewife is the poes to reject all incidents which are foreign to his poem and are naturally no parts of it they are wens and other excrescences which belong not to the body but deform it no per- fon no incident in the piece or in the play but muft be of ufe to carry on the main de- fign all things elfe are like fix fingers to the hand when natare which is fuperffuous in nothing can do her work with five painter muft reject all triffing ornaments to muft poer refufe all tedious and unnecer- sary defcriptions robe which is too heavy is less an ornament than burden in poetry horace calls thefe things verjus inopes verum ugaque canorx thefe are alfo the lacus ara diane which he mentions in the same arr of poetry but fince there muft be ornaments both in paint- ing and poerry if they are not neceffary they muft at leaft be decent that is in their due place and but moderately ufed the painter is not to take to much pains about the dra- pery as about the face where the principal refemblance lies neither is the poer who is working up paffion to make similes which will certainly make it languith my monrexuma dies with fine one in his mouth but it is out of seafon when there are more figures in picture than are neceffary or at leaft ornamental our author calls them figires klirs xliv figures to be lert becaufe the picture has no ole of them so have feen in some modern plays above twenty acfors when the action has not required half the number in the principal figures of picture the painter is to employ the sinews of his art for in them confifts the principal beauty of his work our furbor faves me the compariion with tragedy for he fays that herein he is to imitate the tragicpoet who employs his ut- moft force in thofe places wherein confifts the height and beauty of the action du frefney whom follow makes design or drawing the fecond part of painting but the rules which he gives concerning the pof= ture of the figures are almoft wholly proper to that art and admit not any comparifen that know with poerry the polture of figure is as conceive the descrip- sion of his heroes in the performance of fuch or fuch an action as of acbilks juft in the act of killing hecfor or of eneas who has turnus under him both the poct and the painter vary the pokures according to the action or paffion which they reprefent of the fame perfon but all muft be great and praceful in them the fame eneas muft be drawn suppliant to dide with respect in his geffures and humilicy in his ryes but when he is forced in his own defence to kill laujus the poor thews him compaffionate and tempering the severicy of his looks with rcluctance to the action which he is go ing to perform he has pity on his beauty and his vouth and is loth to deftroy fuch mafter-piece of nature he confiders lausus refcuing his father at the hazard of his own life as an image of himself when he took anchifes nchifes on his shoulders and bore him fafe through the rage of the fire and the op- pofition of his enemies and therefore in the pofture of retiring man who avoids the combat he tretches out his arm in sign of peace with his right foot drawn little back and his breaft bending inward more like an orator than soldier and feems to diffuade the young man from pulling on his deftiny by attempting more than he was able to perform take the pafiage as have thus tranflated it sbouts of pplause van ringing thro the field to see the

knew poet whom out of respect will not name who being too witty himself could draw nothing but wits in comedy of his even his fools were infeeted with the difeafe of their autbor they overflowed with fmart repartees and were only diftinguished from the intended wits by being called coxcombs though they deferved not to fcandalous name another who had great genius for tragedy follow- ing the fury of his natural temper made every man and woman too in his plays stark raging mad there was not fober per- fon to be had for love or money all was tempeftuous and bluftering heaven and earth were coming

withered hand to young face so in the perfons of play whatlsever is faid or done by any of them muft be confiftent with the mannerswhich the poer has given them distinctly and even the habits muft be proper to the degrees and hu- mours of the perfons as well as in picture he who entered in the firtt act young man like pericles prince of tyre must not be in danger in the fifth act of committing

paragraph is altogether fo juft as it might have been but am fure of this which follows the principal figure of the subject must ap- ear in the midft of the picture under the prin- fifal light to diftinguish it from the reft which lare only its attendants thus in tragedy or an epic peem the here of the piece mutt be ladvanced foremoft to the view of the reader or spectator he muft outthine the reft of all the characters he mult appear the prince of them like the sun in the copernican syftem encompaffed with the lets noble planets be- caute the hero is the center of the main ac- tion all the lines from the circumference tend to him alone he is the chief object of pity in the dramo and of admiration in the epic peem as in picture befides the principal fis gures which compofe it and are placed in the midft of it there are less grouges or knots of figures difpofed at proper diftances which are parts of the piece and feem to carry on the fame defign in more inferior manner so in epic poetry there are efisodes and cborus in tragedy which are members of the action as growing out of it not inferted into it such in the ninth book of the encis is the epifode of nisus and euryalus the adventure belongs to them alone they alone are the objects of compaffion and ad- miration but their bufiness which they carry on is the general concernment of the tro- jun camp then beleaguered by turnus and the latines as the christians were lately by the turks they were to advertife the chief hero of the diftrefies of his subjects occa- fioned by his abfence to crave his succour and folicit him to haften his return the grecian tragedy was at firtt nothing but charus of singers aftexwards one affor in was introduced which was the poer himfelf whe entertained the people with discourte in verfe betwixt the paufes of the singing this fucceeding with the people more added to make the variety the greater and in process of time the cboras only fung betwixt the acts and the corypbons or chief of them fpoke for the reft as an afor con- cerned in the bufinets of the play thus tragedy was perfected by degrees and being arrived at that perfction the painters might probably take the hint from thence of adding groupes to their pictures but as good picture may be without groupe to good tragedy may fubfift with out chorus notwithflanding any reafons which have been given by dacier to the contrary monfieur racine has indeed ufed it in his epber but not that he found any neceffiy of it as the french critic would infinuate the chorus at st. cyr was only to give the young ladies an occafion of entertaining the king with vocal mufic and of commending their own voices the play itfelf was ne- ver intended for the public stage nor with out any disparagement to the learned could poffibly have fucceeded there and much less in the tranflation of it here mr. wycberley when we read it together was of my opinion in this or rather of his for it becomes me to to speak of to excellent peet and fo great judgs but fince am in this place as virgil jays spaties excly sus iniquis that is shortened in my time will give no other reafon than that it is impracticable on our stage

bound behind me as now they are should not defpair of making fuch ta tragedy as might be both instructive and delightful according to the manner of the crecians to make sketch or more perfect mo- del

difficult to retain to avoid abfurdities and incongruities tis the fame law eftablifhed for both arts the painter is not to paint cloud at the bottom of pilture but in the uppermoft parts nor the poet

precept in too literal senfe have fallen thereby into great incon veniencies it therefore becomes the painters to make ufe of thofe ancient patterns with difcretion and to accommodate the nature of them in fuch manner that their figures which muft feem to live may rather appear to be models for the antique than the antigue model for their figures it appears that raphael made perfect ufe of this conduct and that the lombard scheol have not precifely fearched into this precept any farther than to learn from thence how to make good choice of the nature and to give certain grace and nobleness to all their works by the general and confuted idea which they had of what is beautiful as for the reft they are fufficiently licentious excepting ari of painting excepting only titian who of all the

the desicn drawinc and the colourinc which in fome places he alfocalls the cromatic many authors who have written of painting muliply the parts according to their plea fure and without giving you or myfelf the trouble of difcuffing this matter will onl tell you that all the parts of painting which others have named are reducible into thef three which are mentioned by our author for which reafon elleem this divifiol so be the juileft and as thefe tbree partl of painting are effential to painting to no wan can be truly called painter who does not poffefs them all together in the fame manner that we can not give the name of man to any creature which is not compofed of body coul and reason which are the three parts neceffarily confirtuent of man how there- uality of fore can they pretend to the painters who can only copy and purloin the works of others who therein employ their whole indufiry and with that only talent would pass for able painters and do not tell me that many great artifts have done this for can cafily anfwer you that it had been their better courfe have abdained from to doing that they have not thereby done themfelves much he- nour and that copying was not the beft part of their reputation let us then con- ciude that all painters ought to acquire this part of excellence not to do it is to want courage and not dare to thew them- selves it is to creep and grovel on the ground it is to deferve this juft reproach onnia.ores servum pecus it is with painters in reference to their productions as it is with orators good beginning is always coftly to both much sweat and labour is required but it is better to expofe our works and leave them liable to cenfure for fifteen vears than to bluth for them at the end of fifty on this account it is neceffary for painter begin early to do fomewhat of his own and to accullom himfelf to it by continual exercife for fo long as endeavouring to raile himfelf he fears falling he shall be alwys on the ground see the following observation invention on the invention is kind of muse which bin peffefed of the other advantages common to be siffers the attributes of the muser in often taken for the muses themfelves andi is in this senfe that invention is here cald muse authors ascribe to each of themin particular the scrences which they have by they invented and in general the bellesls fres becaute they contain almoft all the other thefe sciences are thofe advantages of which our author peaks and with which he would have painter furnish himself fufficienty and in truth there is no man though his underffanding be very mean who know not and who finds not of himself how mad learning is neceffary to animate his gening and to complete it and the reafon of thi is that they who have fiudied have not onl feen and learned many excellent things in their courfe of studies but alfo they hant acquired by that exercife great faciliyf themfelves by reading good ar profiting they who will make profeffion of thors painting muff heap up treafures out of thei reading and there they will find may wonderful means of raifing themfelves abou others who can only creep upon the ground or if they elevate themfelves it is only to fall from higher place becaufe they serve them felves of other mens wings neither under randing their ufe nor their virtue kisf crue that it is not the prefent mode forsf painter to be fo knowing and if any of them in thefe times be found to have eithel great wit or much learning the muli cude would not fail to fay that it was gread pity and that the vouth might have come to fomewhat in the practical part of the law of art of painting of it may be in the treafury or in the fami- lies of some noblemen so wretched is the dektiny of painting in thefe latter ages by learning it is not fo much the knowledoe of the greek and larin tongue which is here to be underttood as the reading of good au- thers and underftanding thote things of which they treat for tranflations being made of the beff aurbors there is not awy painter who is not capable in fome fort of underftanding thofe books of humanity which are comprehended under the name of the belleslertres in my opinion the books which are of the moft advantage to thofe of the profeffion are thefe which follow the bible the hifory of tesepbns the reman fliffory of geefercan for thofe who underfland the french and that of titns livins in latin homer whom pling calls the fountain-head of invention and noble thoughts virgil and in him particularly his eneis the ecclefiatical hirory of gedean or the

belongs properly to painter alontl and all the reft are borrowed either foal learning or from peyfic or from the matel maries or in thort from other arts fordl of painting is sufficient to have

knowledge in the matbematres and other arts will bring in their quera ’ to furnish out the matter of good picture but for the oeconoimy or ordering of the whole together none but only the painter can un- dertland it becaufe the end of the artiff is pleafingly to deceive the eyes which he can never accomplish if this part be wanting to him picture may have an ill effect though the invention of it be truly underftood the design of it correct and the colours of it the moft beautiful and fine that can be em- ployed in it and on the contrary we may behold other pictures ill invented ill defigned

ended leaves them but anxiey for all their pains it feems to me that thet forts of pictures remind us of thofe old co thie caftles made at feveral times and which hold together only as it were by rags and parches it may be inferred from that which hav faid that the inventien and the disposition an two feveral and diftinct parts in effed though the laft of them depends upon the firft and is commonly

dispesstion dittributes thot things which are thus found each to its pro per place and accommodates the figures and the groupes in particular and the teur en semble or hole together of the picture in ggeneral so that this occonomy produces the same effect in relation to the eyes ss cot fort of musie to the ears there is one thing of great confequenc to be obferved in the occenomy of the whel work which is that at the firft sight wt may be given to underttand the quality of the subject and that the picture at the firt glance of the eyes may inspire us with the principal paftion of it for example if the subject which you have undertaken to treat be of joy it is neceffary that every thing which of painting which enters into your picture should contri- bure to that paffion fo that the beholders shall immediately be moved with it if the subject be mournful let every thing in it have stroke of sadness and fo of the other paftions and qualities of the subjects there be genuine and lively expression of the subject conformable to the text of an- cient duthers take care that the li- cences of painters be rather to adorn the hif tory than to corrupt it and though ho- arr of race gives permiffion to painters and poets to pcerry dare every thing yet he encourages neither of them to make things out of nature or verifimility for he adds immediately after but let the bounds of

painters who preceded them at length in the fourteenth century fome there were who began to fet it again on foot and ii may truly he faid that about the end of the fifteenth age and the beginning of our lixteenth it appeared in much splendor by means of many knowing men in all parts of naly who were in perfect poffestion of it since thofe happy times which were to fruit- ful of the noble arts we

muft be drawn with flowing gliding ourlines cc the reafon of this pro- ceeds from the acsen of the mufcles which are as to many well-buckets when one of them acts and draws it is neceffary that the

general but that actions may be found where the maffes of the mufcles are fituate one over againlt another but that is not very com- mon the outlines which are in waves give not only grace to the parts but alfo to the whole body when it is only fupported on one leg as we fee in the figures of an- incus meleager the venus of medices that of on the the varican the two others of borghese and that of flera of the goddets veftd the to bacchus of borgbefe and that of ludovifsy and in fine of the greateft number of the ancient figures which are ftanding and which always reft more upon one foot

us that he learned from the artiffs themselves becaufe in the preface to his seventh book he makes his boaft to have had them from others and particularly from architeets and painters the measures of human bedy the ancients have commonly allowed eight heads to their figures though some of them have but feven but we ordinarily divide the figures into ten faces that fay from the crown of the head to

up the chief place and make themfel moft remarkable either by the beauty of their colours or by the splendor of the light which rrikes upon them they will carch itf sight they will stop it shore and not futit it to go farther than themfelves till affd some confiderable space of time to find of thatwhich was not difcerned at firtt the prin cipal figure in picture is like king amorg his courtiers

engage them- selves fo foolifhly in long digreffions that they are forced to conclude quite another way than they began let the parts be brought together and the figures disposed in groupes ec can not better compare groupe of figures than to concert of voices which tupporting them- selves all together by their different parts make harmony which pleafingly fills the ears and flatters them but if you come to teparate them and that all the parts are equally heard as loud as one another they will fun you to that degree that you would fancy your ears were torn in pieces it is the fame of figures if you fo affemble them that fome of them fuftain the others and make them appear and that all together they mane but one entire whole then your eyes will be fully fatisfied but if on the contrary you divide them your eyes will fuffer by feeing them all rogether disperted for each of them in particular all fogetber becaufe the vifual rays are multiplied by the muluplicity of objects each of them in par- ticular becaufe if you fix your sight on one those which are about it will arike you and attract your eyes to them which extremely pains them in this sort of separation and diverfity of objects the eye for exam- ple is fatisfed with the sight of one fingle grape and is diffracted if it carries itfelf at one view to look upon many several grapes which hie fcattered on table we muft have the same regard for the memberss they aggroupe and contraft each other in the jame manneras the figures do few painters have observed this precept as they ought hi which on the which is moft folid foundation for the hss mony of picture the figures in the groupes ought not to hav the same inflections of the body ec tae heed in this contraft to do nothing thats extravagant and let your poftures be alwap natural the draperies and all things the accompany the figures may enter into the contraff with the members and with the figures themfelves and this is what on poet means in thefe words of his verles cxtera frangant one side of the picture must not be voil while the orber is silled cc this sort of sym metry when it appears not affected fills the picture pleafingly keeps it in kind of lance and infinitely delights the eyes which thereby contemplate the work with mor repofe as play is seldom good in wbich there or too many actors annibal caracci did wr believe that picture could be good in which there were above twelve figures it was who told our hutbor this and from hi mouth had it the reafons which he gaw were firlt that he believed there ought nd to be above three great groupes of figat in any picture and secondly that silens and majetly were of neceffity to be there wh render it beautiful and neither the one not the other could poffibly be in multindl and crowd of figures but nevertheless if you are conftrained by the subject as fa example if you painted the day of julf ment the mafacre of the innecents baille sc on fuch occafions you are to dispett things by

adding or re trenching any thing though never fo litle either for the nudities or for the drape ries and secondly againft thofe who paint every thing by practice without being able to subjsct themfelves to retouch any thing of to examine by the nature thefe lat properly peaking are the libertines of paint ing as there are liberfines of religion who have no other law but the vehemence of their inclinations which they are refolved not to overcome and in the jame manner the libertines of painting have no other me del but rhodomontade genias and very it regular which violently hurries them awap though thefe two sorts of painters an both of them in vicious extremes yet ne verthelefs the former sort feems to be the more tupportable becaufe though they do not imitate nature as she is accompt nied by all her beauties and her gracts yet at leal they imitate that nature which we know and daily fee instead of which the others shew us wild or favage sure which is not of our acquaintanc of painting and which feems to be of quite new creation whom you must bave always present as witness to the trutb cc this paltage feems to be wonderfully well faid the nearer picture approaches to the truth the better it is and though the painter who is its author be the firtt judge of the beauties which are in it he is neverthelefs obliged not to pronounce it till he has firft confulred nature who is an irreproachable evidence and who will frankly but withal truly tell you its defects and beauties if you compare with her work nd of all other things which difcever to us the thoughts and inventions of the grecians gc as good books fuch as are homer and paufanias the prints which we fee of the antiquities may alfo extremely contribute to form our genius and to give us great ideas in the fame manner as the writings of good authors are capable of forming good stile in thofe who are defirous of writing well if you bave but one single figure to work yjos the reafon of this that there being nothing to attract the sight but this only firure the vifual rays will not be too much divided by the diverfity of colours and draperies but only take ffeed to put in nothing which shall appear too sharp or too hard and be mindful of the precept which fays that two extremities are never to touch each other either in colour or in light but that there muft be mean par- taking of the one and of the other lot the draperies be nobly spread upon the body let the folds be large as raphacl practifed after he had forfaken the manner of h on the of pietro perugine and principally in his lat cer works and let them follow the order of the parts as the farreft pieces of antiquity will thew us and take heed that the folds de not only follow the order of the parts but that they alfo mark the moff confiderable mufcles becaufe that thofe figures where the drapery and the naked part are seen both together are much more graceful than the other without sitting too frait upon them painters ought not to imitate the ancients in this circumftance the ancient statuaries made their draperies of wet linen on pur- pofe to make them fit clofe and frait to the parts of their figures for doing which they had great reafon and in following which the painters would be much in the wrongs and you shall fee upon what grounds thofe great geniufes of antiquity finding that it was impoffible to imitate with marble the finenets of stuffs or garments which it not to be difcerned but by the colours the reffexes and more especially by the lightt and shadows finding it fay out of their power to difpofe of thofe things thought they could not do better nor more pruden tially than to make ife of such draperies ai hindered not from feeing through their folds the delicacy of the fleth and the purity of the outlines things which truly speaking they poffeffed in the laft perfection and which in all appearance were the subject of their chief study but painters on the contrarys who are to deceive the sight quite otherwife than statuaries are bound to imitate the dif ferent sorts of garments fuch as they nath fally art of painting rally feem and fuch as colours reffexes lights and shadows of all which they have thus we mafters can make them appear fee that thofe who have made the neareft imitations of nature have made ofe of fuch stuffs or garments which are familiar to our sight and thefe they have imitated with to much art that in beholding them we are pleafed that they deceive us fuch were paul veronese tintoret rubens vandyke and the reft of the good colouriffs who have come neareff to the truth of nature in- read of which others who have fcrupuloufly fied themfelves to the practice of the an- cients in their draperies have made their works crude and dry and by this means have found out the lamentable secret how to make their figures harder than even the marble itfeif as andrea mantegna and pie- tre perngino have done and raphael alto had much of that way in his firft works in which we behold many small foldings often repleated which look like fo many whip- cords it is true thefe reperitions are feen in the ancient starses and they are very pro- per there becaufe they who made ule of wetlinen and clofe draperies to make their figures look more tender reafonably forefaw that the members would be too naked if they left not more than two or three folds tuch as thofe sorts of draperies afford them and therefore have ufed thofe repetitions of many folds yet in fuch manner that the figures are always foft and tender and there- by teem oppofite to the hardness of marble add to this that in scalprure it is almoft impoffible that figure cloathed with coarfe draperies can make good effect on all the on the sides and that in painting the draperts of what kind foever they be are of fres advantage either to unite the colours and the groupes or to give fuch ground is one would with to unite or to feparate of farther to produce fuch reffectrons as fr off or for filling void spaces or in shot for many other advantagess which help to deceive the sight and which are no ways eceffary to sculgrers fince their work is al ways of relievo three things may be inferred from whail have faid concerning the rule of draperies firtt that the ancient sculprors had reafon to cloath their figures as we fee them second ly that painters ought to imitate them in the order of their folds but not in their ous lity nor in their number thirdly thai seulprors are obliged to follow them as much as they can without defiring to imitate un profitably or improperly the manner of the painters by making many ample fold which are infufferable hardneffes and look more like rock than atural gor ment see the remart about the middle of it and if the parts be teo much diffant from each orber it is with intent to hinds as we have said in the rule of groupes the vifual rays from being too much divided and that the eyes may not fuffer by look ing on to many objects which are feparated guide was very exact in this observation sd in the text the end of the rule which relats to draperies and as these limbs and members which on expressed by few and large muscles rr phaes in the beginning of his painting ha so of painting somewhat too much multiplied the foldsz becaufe being with reafon charmed with the graces of the ancients he imitated their beauties fomewhat too regularly but hav- ing afterwards found that this quantity of folds glittered too much upon the limbs and took off that repofe and silence which in painting are fo friendly to the eyes he made fe of contrary conduct in the works which he painted afterwards which was at that time when he began to underftand the effect of lights of groupes and the oppositions of the lights and shadows fo that he wholly changed his manner this was about eight years before his death and tho' he always gave grace to whatfoever he painted yer he made appear in his latter works greatness majesty and har- mony quite other than what we fee in his firt manner and this he did by leffening the number of his folds making them more large and more opposing them and by making the maffes of the lights and shadows greater and more difentangled take the pains to examine thefe his different manners in the prints which we fee of that great man as supposing them to be magiffrates their draperies ought to be large cc vet make not your draperies fo large that they may be big enough to cloath four or five figures as some there are who follow that method and take fleed that the foldings be natural and to difpoted that the eye

subject to be ruffied by the winds which can bear many folds yet so that they may be freed from any hardneffes it is eafy for every one to judge that betwint the draperies of magiffrates and those of young mards there muft be fome mediocrity of folds fuch as are moff commonly feen and obferved as in the draperies of cbrif of madonna of king queen or duches and of other perfons of confideration and majefty and thofe alfo who are of middle age with this dilinction that the habies muft be made more or lets rich according to the dignity of the perfons and that closh garments may be diftinguished from thofe of silk sattin from felvers brocade from em broidery and that in one word the eye may be deceived by the truth and the dif ference of the stufts take notice if you pleafe that the light and tender draperies having been only given to the female sex the ancient scaptors have avoided as much as they could to cloath the figures of men becaufe they thought as we have formerly faid that in sculpture-garments could not be well imitated and that great folds made very bad effeel there are almoff examples of this truth as amongt of painting the ancients there are statues of naked wen will name only that of laocoon which ac- cording to all probability ought to have been cloathed and in effect what likelj- hood can there be that the son of king and the prieft of apollo should appear naked in the actual ceremony of sacrifice for the serpents paffed from the ile of tenedos to the trogan shore and furprized ldocoon and his sons while they were facrificing to neptune on the sea-sbore

prodigally rrewed over the ha- bits are destructive to each other becaute they draw the sight to feveral places at the same time and hinder round bodies from turning and making their due effect it is

as well upon the ancient beauties and noble pic tures as upon nature itfelf and fecondly becaufe that part depends entirely on the genilis art of painting cinins and feems to be purely the gift of

neverthelets ir is needful in my opinion that both the one and the other should perfectly learn the character of every paffion all the ctions of the sensstive appetite are in painting called passions becaute the soul is agitated by them and becaufe the body fuffers through them and is fenfibly altered they are thofe divers agitations and different motions of the body in gene- fal and of every one of its parts in parti- cular that our excellent painter ought to underftand on which he ought to make his study and to form to himself perfect idea of them but it will be proper for us t know in the firft place that the phile- cophers admit eleven love hatred defire shunning toy sadness hope despair bold- ness fear and anger the painters have multiplied them not only by their different digrees

other things like these theie pasions as have faid ought to be learnt from the life itfelf or to be rudied on the ancient statues and excellem pictures we ought to fee for exampie all things which belong to sadness or ferve to exprets it to defign them carefully and to imprint them in our memories after fuch manner as we may diftinctly underland seven or eight kinds of them more or less and immediately after draw them upon paper without any other original than the image which we have concerved of them we muft be perfect mafters of them but above all we muft make fure of poffefting them thoroughly we are to know that it is fuch or fuch stroke or fuch sha dow fronger or weaker which make fuch or fuch pasion in this or that degrec and thus if any one should afk you what makes in painting the majeffy of king the gravity of hero the love of chrif the art of painting the grief of madonna the hope of the good thief the despair of the bad one the grace and beauty of venus and in fine the character of any paffion whatfoever you may answer pofitively on the spot and with affurance that it is such pasture or sucb lines in the parts of the face formed of such or juch fasbion or even the one and the other both together for the parts of the body feparately make known the passions of the sonl or elfe conjointly one with the other but of all the parts the head is that which gives the moft of life and the moft of grace to the passion and which alone contributes more to it than all the reft together the orbers separately can only exprets fome certain passions but the head exprefies all of them neverthelets there are some which are more particular to it for example humility which it ex- preffes by the stooping or bending of the head arragance when it is litted or as we

in reality before our eyes and he who conceives these images with the greateft strength of imagination shall pos- fess that part of the passions with the most advantage and the greateff ease but we mutt take care as have already faid that in thefe vifions the motions may be natu- ral for there are fome who imagine they have given abundance of light to their fi- gures when they have made them do violent and extravagant actions which we may more realonably call the convulsions or contersions of the body than the paffions of the mind and by this means they often put themfelves to much pains to find hrong paffion where no paftion is required add to all that have faid concerning the paffions that we are to have very ferious regard to the qua- lity of the perfons who are to be expreffed in pasions the joy of king ought not to re- temble that of serving-man and the fierce- ness of private soldier mutt not be like that of an officer in thefe differences confitts all the fineness and

is natural to them we may add to what phileffratas has faid that with two colours only the light and of painting the dark there is no sort of stuff or ha- bit but may be imitated we fay then that the colouring makes its observations on the maffes or bodies of the colours ac- companied with lights and shadows more or less evident by degrees of diminution according to the accidents firft of lu- minous body as for example the sun or orch secondly of diaphanous or trant- parent body which is betwixt us and the object as the air either pure or thick of ared glafs sc thirdly of folid body il-

siffer cc that is to fay the de- pon or drawing which is the second part painting which confifting only of lines flands altogether in need of the colouring to ppear it is for this reafon that our au- ther calls this part her sitter ’ procurer that bs the colouring shews us the defign and makes as fall in love with it the light produces all kinds of colours cc here are three theorems fucceffively follow- ng which our auchor propofes to us that from on the from thence we may draw some conclutions you may likewife find others which are in the nature of to many propositions to which we ought to agree that from thence we may draw the preceprs contained in the following part of this trearife they are all founded the senfe of secing which should be the most see the re mark of number light bodies may bave sufficient mass or breadth of stadow to justain them that is properly to fay that after the great lights there muft be great shadows which we call repofes becaufe in reality the sight would be tired if it were attrat ed by continuity of glittering objects the lights may ferve for repofe to the darks and the darks to the lights have faid in another place that groupe of ri fures ought to be confidered as choir of musie in which the bases fupport the tn bles and make them to be heard with greater pleafure thefe repofes are made two fe veral ways one of which is natural the other artificial the natural is made by an extent of lights or of shadows which na turally and necefiarily follow folid bodies or the maffes of folid bodies aggroupedf when the light trikes upon them and the artifcial counfts in the bodies of coloury which the painter gives to certain things such as pleafes him and compofes them inf such manner that they do no injury to ids objects which are near them drapery for example which is made yellow or red on fome certain place in another place mis he brown and will be more fuitable toth to produce the effeet required we are twl of painting take occafion as much as poffibly we can to make ife of the firft manner and to find the repofe of which we speak by the light and by the shadow which naturally accom- pany folid bodies but fince the subjects on which we work are not always favourable to difpote the bodies as we defire painter in fuch cafe may take his advantage by the bodies of colours and put into fuch places as ought to be darkened draperies or other things which we may fuppofe to be naturally brown and fullied which will produce the fame effect and give him the same repofes as the shadows would do which could not be cauted by the dispolition of the objects thus an underftanding painter will make his advantages both of the one manner and the other and if he makes defign to be graved he is to remember that the gravers dispofe not their colours as the painters do and that by confequence he muft take oc- cation to find the reafon of his design in the natural shadows of the figures which the has dispoted to caufe the effect rubens thas given us full information of this in thofe prints of his which he caufed to be engraved and believe that nothing was terer seen more beautiful in that kind the whole knowledge of groupes of the lights and shadows and of thoie maffes which wilian calls bunch of grapes is there ex- poted to clearly to the sight that the view of thofe prims and the careful obfervation of them might very much contribute to the forming of an able painter the bett hnd fairell of them are graven by vafterman pintins and bolfvert all of them admira- ble on the ble gravers whofe works rubens himfel took care to overfee and which without doubt you will find to be excellent if you examine them but expect not there the elegance of defign nor the correctness of the outlines it is not but the gravers can and ought to imitate the bodies of the colours by the degrees of the lights and shadows as much as they shall judge that this imitation may produce good effect on the contrary it impoffible in my opinion to give mach strength to what they grave after the works of the school of venice and of all thofe who have had the knowledge of colours and of the contraff of the lights and shadows without imitating in fome fort the colourof the objects according to the relation which they have to the degrees of whice and black we fee certain prints of good gravers dif- ferent in their kinds where thefe things are obferved and which have wonderful strength and there appears in public of late years gallery of archduke leopold which tho very ill graven yet shews fomb part of the beauty of its originals becaute the gravers who have executed it though otherwife they were fufficiently ignoranl have obferved in almoft the greateff parts of their prints the bodies of colours in the relation which they have to the degrees of the lights and shadows could with the gravers would make fome reffection upou this avbole remark it is of wonderful cord fequence to them for when they have atf tained to the knowledge of thefe reposes thef will eafily refolve thofe difficulties whith many times perplex them and then chiclff whet art of painting when they are to engrave after picture where neither the lights and shadows nor the bodies of the colours are kilfully ob- terved tho in its other parts the picture may be well performed as in consex mirror the collected rays frike fronger cc convex mirror alters the objects which are in the middle to that it feems to make them come out from the snpersicies the painter mult do in the same manner in respect of the lights and shadows of his figures to give them more relievo and more strength while the goings off are more and more broken and faint as they approach to the ex- tremities cc it is the duty of painter even in this alfo to imitate the convex mir- rer and to place nothing which glares ei- ther in colour or in light at the borders of his picture for which there are two rea- sons the firtt is that the eye at the firft view directs isfelf to the midft of the object which is prefented to it and by confequence mull there neceffarily find the principal ob- sell in order to its satisfaction and the other reafon is that the sides or borders being overcharged with ffrong and glitter- ing work attract the eyes thither which are in kind of pain not to behold con- linuity of that work which is on the fudden interrupted by the borders of the picture intead of which the borders being ligh- tened and cafed of to much work the eye continues fixed on the center of the pic- ture and beholds it with greater pleafure is for the same reafon that in great composition of figures thofe which com- ing moft forward are cut off by the bot- tom on the tom of the picture will always make an ill effect bunch of grapes cc it is fufficienty pranifeft that tiran by this judicious and familiar comparifon means that painter ought to collect the objects and to dispole them in fuch manner as to compofe one wholes the feveral contiguous parts of which may be enliohtened many fhadowed and others of broken colours to be in the tum- ings as on bunch of grapes many grapes which are the parts of it are in the light many in the shadow and the reft faintly co. loured to make them go farther back once told tintoret that in his greatef works bunch of grapes had been his princ- pal rule and his sureft guide pure or unmixed white either draws an ob jeet nearer or carries it off to farther diffanct it draws it nearer with black and throws it backward vitheut it ec all agree that white can fubfiff on the fore-ground of the picture and there be ufed without mixture the queftion therefore is to know if it can equally fubfiff and be placed in the same manner upon that which is backward the light being univerfal and the figures fup- pofed in campaign and open field our aurbor concludes affirmatively and the reafon on which he eftabliffies his rule is this that there being nothing which partakes more of the light than whiteness and the light being capable of fubfiffing well in remoteness or at long dillance as we daily fee in the rifing and setting of the sun it follows that white may fubfiff in the same manner in painting the light and colour are but one and the fame thing aod art of painting that we have no colour which add to this more refembles the air than white and by confequence no colour which is lighter from whence it comes that we commonly fay the air is heavy when we fee the hea- vins covered with black clouds or when thick fog takes from us that clearness which makes the lightness or serenity of the air titian tintoret paul veronese and all thofe who beft underftood lights have obferved it in this mianner and no man can go againft this precept at leaft without renouncing any skill in landicape which is an undoubted confirmation of this truth and we fee that all the great maffers of landscape have fol- lowed trian in this who has always em- ployed brown and earthly colours upon the fore part and has referved his greatest lights for remoteneffes and the back parts of his landscapes it may be objected againft this opinion that white can not maintain itfelf in remote- neffes becaufe it is ordinarily ufed to bring the objects nearer on the advanced part it is true that fo it is ufed and that to very good purpofe to render the objects more tentible by the opposition of the dark which mult accompany and which retains it as it were by force whether the dark ferves it for ground or whether it be combined t it for example if you would make white horse on the fore-ground of your pic- ture it is of abfolute neceffity thatthe ground muft be of mixed brown and large enough or that the furniture muft be of very fenfible colours or laftly that fome figure muft be fet upon it whofe shadows and the colour may bring it forward but on the but it feems fay you that efue is the moft fying or tranfient colour becaufe the heavens and mountains which are at the greateff diftance are of that colour iis very true that blue is one of the lightef and sweefeff colours but it is alfo true that it poffeffes thefe qualities to much the more becaufe the white is mingled in it as the example of the diftances demon rrate to us but if the light of your pic tare be not univerfal and that you fuppose your figures in chamber then recal to your memory that theerem which tells you that the nearer body is to the light and the more directly it is opposed to us fo much the more it is enlightened becaufe the light grows languifhing the farther it removes from its original you may alfo extinguith your white if you suppofe the air to be fomewhat thicken and if you forefee that this supposicion wil make good effect in the oeconomy of the whole work but let not this proceed to fat as to make your figures fo brown that they may feem as it were in filthy fog or tha they may appear to be part of the ground see the following remark but as for pure black there is nothing that brings the object nearer to the sight cc bc caute black is the heavieft of all colours the moft earthy and the moft fentible this is clearly underffood by the qualities of white which is oppoted to it and which is as wt have faid the lighteft of all colours then are few who are not of this opinion and vl have known some who have told me the the black being on the advanced part makes nothing but holes to this there is hill elle art of painting elfe to be anfwered but that black always makes good effect being fet forward pro- vided it be placed there with prudence vou fare therefore fo to dispofe the bodies of your pillures which you intend to be on the fore- ground that thofe forts of holes may not be perceived and that the blacks may be there by maffes and infenfibly confufed see the rule that which gives the relievo to borwl may fome fay to me is the quick light or the white which appears to be on the side which is neareft to us and the black by confequence diftances the object we fere here to beware not to confound the furnings with the diftances the question sonly in respect of bodies which are fe- parated by fome diftance of backward po- fition and not of round bodies which are of the fame continuity the brown which ts mingled in the turnings of the borvl makes them go off rather in confounding hem as we may fay than in blackening them and do you not fee that the reflects he an artifice of the painter to make the turnings feem more light and that by this means the greateff blackness remains to- wards the middle of the bowl to fuftain the white and make it deceive us with more leature rule of whire and black is of to filat confequence that unless it be ex- aly practifed it is impoffible for picture make any great effect that the maffes an be difentangled and the different dif- haces may be observed at the firft glance the eye without trouble on the it may be inferred from this precept that the maffes of other colours will be fo muck the more fenfible and approach to much the nearer to the sight the more brown they hear provided this be amongft other co lours which are of the fame species for example yellow brown shall draw neares to the sight than another which is less yel low laid provided it be amongtt other colours which are of the fame species be caufe there are fimple colours which naid rally are ftrong and fenfible though they are clear as vermilion there are others alld which notwithlflanding that they are brown yet ceafe not to be foft and faint as the blue of uhramarine the effect of picture comes not only therefore from the lights and sha dows but alfo from the nature of the co. lours thought it was not from the purpote in this place to give you the qualities of thofe colours which are moft in ofe and which are called capiral becaufe they ferve to make the compofition of all the rel whofe number is almoff infinite red oker is one of the moft heavy co jours fellow oker is not fo heavy becaute it is clearer and the mafficor is very light becaut it is very clear vellow and very near to white uhramarine or azure is very light and very sweet colour vermilion is wholly oppofite to whrams vitle late is middle colour betwixt ulrs marine and vermition yet it is rather more sweet than harth bron art of painting brown red is one of the moft earthy and moft fenfible colours pint is in its nature an indifferent colour that is very fufceptible of the other colours by the nixture if you mix brown red with it you will make it very earthy colour but on the contrary if you join it with white or blse you shall have one of the moft faint and tender colours terre verte or green earth is light it is nican betwixt yellow oker and ultrama- vire umbre is very fenfible and earthy there is nothing but pure black which can difpute with it of all blacks that is the moft earthy which is mott remote from blue according to the principle which we have eftablifhed of whire and black you will make every one of thefe colours before-named more earthy and more heavy the more black you mingle with them and they will be lighter the more white you join with them for what concerns broken or compound colours we are to make judgment of their strength by the force of thofe co- lours which compofe them all who have thoroughly underffood the agreement of colours have not employed them wholly pure and fimple in their draperies un less in fome figure upon the fore-ground of the picture but they have ufed broken and compound colours of which they made ffarmony for the eyes by mixing thofe which have fome kind of sympathy with each other to make whole which has an union with the colours which are neigh- bouring to it the painter who perfectly underftands on the underffands the force and power of his co. lours will afe them moft fuitably to his pre= fent purpofe and according to his own dif cretion but let this be done relatively ecc one body muft make another body fly off in fuck manner that itfelf may be chafed by those bodies which are advanced before it we are to take care and use great attention eays quintilian not only of one separate thing but of many which follow each otber and by certain relation which they have with each other are as it avere continued in the same manner as if in firait street ave caft our eyes from one end of it to the otber we discover at once those different things which are presented to the sight so that ave not enly see the laft but awbarfoever is relating to the two contrary extremities never teuch each orber the senfe of seeing has this in common with all the reft of the senfes thit abhors the contrary extremities and in the same manner as our llands when they are very cold feel grievous pain when on the fudden we hold them near the fire fo the eyes which find an extreme white nexx to an extreme black or fair cool azure next to hot vermilion can not behold thete extremities without pain though they are always attracted by the glaring of two conn iraries this rule obliges us to know thofe co. lours which have friendship with each other and thofe which are incompatible which we may eafily difcover in mixing to- gether thofe colours of which we would make trial and art of painting and if by this mixture they make gra- cious and fweet colour which is pleafing to the sight it is sign that there is an usion and sympathy betwixt them but if on the contrary that colour which is produced by the mixture of the two be harth to the sight we are to conclude that there is contrariety and antipathy betwixt thefe two colours green for example is colour which may come from blue and fellow mixed together and by confequence blue and fellow are two co- lours which fimparbixe nd on the con- hary the misture of blue with vermilion produces sherj harfh and unpleafant co- lour conclude an that elae and vermilion are of contrar nature and the same may be said of other colours of which you may make the experiment and clear the matter once for all see the conclufion of the remark where have taken occafion to speak of the force and quality of every capital colour vet you may neglect this precept when your piece confifts but of one or two figures and when amongtt great number you would make fome one figure more remarkable than the reft one fay which is one of the moft confiderable of the subject and which otherwife you can not diltinguith from the reft titran in his tri- umph of bacchus having placed friadne on one of the borders of the picture and not being able for that reafon to make her re- markable by the brightness of light which he was to keep in the middle of his picture gave her scarf of vermition colour upon the drapery as well to loofen her from his ground which was ghee sea as becaufe the on the is one of the principal figures of his subjed upon which he defired to attract the eye paul veronese in his marriage of cana be caufe chriff who is the principal figure of the subject is carried fomewhat into the depth of the picture and that he could not make him diftinguithable by the strength of the lights and shadows has cloathed him with vermilion and blue thereby to conduct the sight to that figure the beffile colears may be to much the more allied to each other the more you mis them with other colours which mutually fympathize and which agree with thofe co. lours which you defire to reconcile it is labour in vain to per it high noon he faid in another ace endeavour after that which aids your art and is fair able to and fhun whatfoever is repugnant it is the goth precept if the painter would arrive to the end he has proposed which is to deceive the sight he muft make choice of fuch nature as agrees with the weak nets of his colours becaufe his colours can not accommodate themfelves to every fort of nature this rule is particularly to be obferved and well confidered by thofe who paint landscapes let the field or ground of the picture the reafon of it is that we are to avoid the meeting of thofe colours which have an annis parky to each other becaufe they offend the sight to that this rule is proved fufficiently by the which tells us that two contrary extremities are never to touch each other whether it be in colour or in light but that there ought to be mean betwixt them which partakes of both of painting let your colours be licvely and yet not look according to the painter ’ proverb as if they had been rubbed or sprinkled with meal denner dans la farine is phrafe amongit painters which perfectly exprefies what it which is to paint with clear or bright means colours and dull colours together for being tomingled they give no more life to the figures than if they had been rubbed with meal they who make their fleth colours very white and their shadows grey or in- clining to green fall into this inconvenience red colours in the shadows of the moft de- licate or fineft flefh contribute wonderfully to make them lively shining and natural but they are to be ufed with the fame dif- exetion that titian paul veronese rubens and vandyke have taught us by their ex- ample to preserve the colours fresh we muft paint by putting in more colours and not by rubbing them in after they are once laid and if it could be done they should be laid jut in their proper places and not be any more touched when they are once to placed becaufe the freshness of the colours is tar- nithed and loft by vexing them with the con- finual drudgery of daubing all they who have coloures well have had yet another maarm to maintain their colours freth and flourithing which was to make ufe of wbite grounds upon which they painted and oftentimes at the firft stroke without re- touching any thing and without employing new colours rubens always ufed this way and have feen pictures from the hand of that great perfon painted up at once which wire of wonderful vivacity the on the the reafon why they made fe of these kinds of grounds is becaufe white as well preserves brightness under the trantps rency of colours which hinders the air from altering the whireness of the ground as that it likewife repairs the injuries which they receive from the air to that the ground and the colours affift and preferve each other it is for this reafon that glazed co. lours have vivacity which can never be imi- tated by the moff lively and most brilliant colours becaufe according to the common way the different tints are fimply laid on each in its place one after another s true it is that white with other frong colours with which we paint at once that which we intend to glaze are as it were the life the spirit and the luffre of it the ancients moft certainly have found thatwhite grounds were much the beft becaufe notwithfland ing that inconvenience which their eyes re- ceived from that colour yet they did not forbear the ufe of it as gaten terifies in his tenth book of the uuse of the parts painters lays he wben they avork upon their white grounds place before them dark co lours and ofbers mixed with blne and green to recreate their eyes because white is glaring colour wbich avearies and pains the sight more than any ofher know not the reafon why the fe of it is left off at pre- fent if it be not that in our days there are few painters who are curious in their colour ing or that the firft strokes which are begun upon white are not feen foon enough and that more than french pacience is required to wait till it be accomplithed and the ground which by its whiteness tarniffes the art of painting the luftre of the other colours muft be en- hirely covered to make the whole work ap- pear pleafingly let the parts wbich are neareft to us and most raifed ec the reafon of this is that upon flat superficies and as much united as cloth can be when it is strained the leaft body is very appearing and gives heightening to the place which it poffeffes do not therefore load thofe places with co- lours which you would make to turn but flet thofe be well loaded which you would have come out of the canvas let there be so much harmony or consent in the mafes of the piefure that all the shadow- tings may appear as if they avere but one ec he has faid in another place that after great lights great shadows are neceffary which he calls resefes what he means by the pre- hent rule is this that whatfoever is found in those great shadows should partake of the colours of one another to that the different colours which are well diffinguifhed in the hights seem to be but one in the shadows by their great union let the whole picture be of one piece exc that is to fav of one and the same conti- uity of work and as if the picture had been painted up all at once the latin fays all of whe pallet the looking-glass avill insiruct you ec the painter muft have principal respect to the maffes and to the effect of the whole together the looking-glass dittances the objects and by confequence gives us only to fee the maffes in which all the little parts hre confounded the evening when the night approaches will make you better un derltand on the dertland this obfervation but not fo coam modioutly for the proper time to make lafts but quarter of an hour and the locking-gless may be ufeful all the day since the rirror is the rule and male of all painters as thewing them their faull by diftancing the objects we may conclude that the picture which makes not goodlf feet at ditance can not be well done and painter muft never finith his picture befor he has examined it at fome reafonable dif tance or with looking-gloss whether th maffes of the lights and shadows and the bodies of the colours be well diftributed giergione and correggio have made ufe this method as for portrait or picture by the lif the end of porrraits is not fo precifelf as tome have imagined to give fmiling and pleafing air together with the refemblance this is indeed fomewhat but not enough it confifts in expreffing the trus temperd thofe perfons which it reprefents and make known their phyfiognomy if the fee fon whom you draw for example be naw rally fad you are to beware of giving his any graiety which would always be thing which is foreign to his

orlaughing which is too fenfible wit take off from that majeity and make it look childifh and undecent in short the painef who has good genins muft make difcernment of all thefe things and underflands physsognomy it will be more caf of painting to him and he will facceed better than an- oiner pliny rells us that apelles made his pidures so very like that certain phyfiagno- ais and fortsne-teller as

are to take the atmost care that broad hights may be joined cc this muft be done tenderly yet not to as to make your colours fhie by force of formenting them but that you should mix them as haffily as you can and not retouch the fame place if conveni- eatly you can avoid it bread ligbts cc it is in vain to take fains if you can not preferve large lights becaufe withour them your work will never make good effect at distance and alfo becaufe little lights are confufed and ef- faced proportionably as you are at distance fim the picture this was the perpetual maxim of correggio ought to have somewhat of greatness in them and their ourlines to be noble as the fieces of anriquity will evidently shew us there is nothing more pernicions to touth it is common to place ourfeives under he

this happens oftentimes to that tegrec and makes to great an impreffion in mind of the scholar that he can not give approbation to any other manner what- toever on the foever and believes there is no man under the cope of heaven who is to knowing as his master but what is moft remarkable in this point is that nature appears to us always like that manner which we love and in which we have been

it this is an adis rable rule painter ought to have it per petually prefent in his mind and memoryil it refolves thofe difficulties which the ratt beget it loofens his hands and affifts his underttanding in short this is the rutt which fets the painter at liberty becautl it teaches him that he ought not to fubjedt himself servilely and be bound like an apf prentice to the ruter of his art but that the ryles of his art ought to be fubjed and not hinder him from following th didae art of painting dillates of his genins which is fuperior to them bodies of diverse natures which are ag-

ancient sacri- fies and many other pleafing diverfities which may prefent themielves to the painter' magination it is moft certain that the diverfity of objects recreates the sight when tthey are without confulion and when they diminith nothing of the subject on which we work experience teaches us that the eye grows weary with poring perpetually on the ame thing not only on pictures but even on nature iffelf for who is he who would not be tired in the walks of long foreft or twith beholding large plain which is naked of trees or in the sight of ridge of mountains which inftead of pleafure give is only the view of heights and bottoms to content and fill the eye of the un- dertanding the beft authors have had the address to fprinkle their works with plea- ing digreffions with which they recreate the minds of readers discretion in this as in all other things is the fareff guide and as tedious digreffions which wander from tbeir subject are impertinent to the painter who under pretence of diverting the eyes would fill his picture with fuch varicties as falter the truth of the hiffory would make pidiculous piece of painting and mere callimaufry of his work as also those things which seem to be flightly moucbed and performed with ease ec this eafe on the eafe attracts our eyes and spirits to mad the more becaufe it is to be prefumed thit noble work which appears fo eaty to us is

almoft fay to make an end of finithing his piece and it was on this account he plainly faid thit nothing was more prejudicial to painters that too much exactness and that the greateft fad of them knew not awben they bad done enough as we have likewife proverb which faps an englishman never knows when he is wlll it is true that the word enough is very of ficult to understand what you have to dif is

that to change it by the rules is to take hsit were their pencils out of their hands and to put them out of condition of do- ing any thing in the jame manner as we make countryman dumb whom we will not allow to speak but by the rules of ctanar obferve on the obferve if you pleafe that the facilityand diligence of which fpoke confitts not is that which we call bold strokes and feef handling of the pencil if it makes not rreat effect at diftance that fort of free dom belongs rather to wricing-mafter than painter fay yet farther that it is almolf impostible that things which are painted should appear true and natural where we obf ferve thefe sorts of hold strokes and all thots who have come neareft to narure have neve ufed that manner of painting thofe tended hairs and thofe hatching strokes of the pen cil which make kind of minced meat in painting are very fine muft confess bu they are never able to deceive the sight nor till you barve present in your mind fre fect idea of your

this art becaufe it is to be prefumed that all thele ingredients of good painter are pot ordinarily on the ordinarily found in men of vulgar birth and in all appearance we may hope that tho there be

fuch who being endued with all the good qualities and the talents which are re quired for painting thofe endowments may be to them inflead of an honourable birth it is certain that which debafes painting and makes it defcend to the vileff and mot despicable kind of trade is the great mut titude of painters who have nerther noble souls nor any talent for the art nor eren to much as common senfe the origin of this great evil is that there have always been admitted into the schools of painting all sorts of children promifcuoully without examination of them and without obferving for some convenient space of time if they were conducted to this art by their inward difpofition and all neceffary talents rather than by foolith inclination of their own or by the avarice of their relations

acquir- ing number of friends with whofe af fiftance he hoped to pass through life comfortably but his marrying terma- gant difturbed his repofe and made home to masters fo difagreeable as to feek refuge in ta vern this libertine kind of life drew him into many scrapes though the day after his franks he constantly promifed amendment and to be more on his guard he took his paller and fet to work

married to his laft wife fix years anno riley born in the city of lon don anno was instructed in the firft rudiments of painting by mr. eouff and mr. fuller but left them whiltt he was very young and began to practife after the lifes yet acquired no great reputation till upon the death of sir peter lep his friends being defirous that he should fucceed that excellent maller in the favour of king charles masters charles ii engaged mr. cbifincb to fit to him for his pictare which he performed to well that the king upon sight of it fent for him and having employed him in drawing the duke of grafton ’ portrait and soon after his own took him into his ser- vice honoured him with feveral obliging testimonies of his elleem and withal gave this character of his works that he painted both inside and ourfide upon the ccettion of king william and queen mary to the crown he was fworn their majefties prin¬ cipal painter which place he had not en- joyed in the preceding reign though king james and his queen were both pleafed to be drawn by his hand he was very dili- gent in the imitation of nature and by rudying the life rather than following any particular manner arrived to pleafant and moft agreeable stile of painting but that which eminently diffinguithed him from all his cotemporaries was his peculiar excel lence in head and especially in the colour- ing part wherein some of his pieces were to very extraordinary that mr. riley him- felf was the only perfon who was not charf ed with them he was gentleman er- tremely courteous in his bchaviour engag- ing in his converfation and prudent in all his actions he was dutiful son an af= feltionate brother kind mafter and faithful friend he never was guilty of piece of vanity too common amongst artiffe of faying mighty things on his own behalf but contented himself with letting his works speak for him which being plentifully dif- perfed over other nations as well as our own were indeed every where very eloquent in modern masters in his commendation he had for feveral years been violently perfecuted by the gout which after many terrible affaults flying up at latt into his head brought him to his grave anno exceedingly

sophy and unknown to his father de- figned fo judiciouly in chiaro-feuro that his performances furprized all that law them it was with fome difficulty that cardinal orfini at vifit could gain leave of the father to let his son follow the bent of his inclination he having originaily de- figned him for the siudy of the law two years he ftudied under his father when he vifited naples and put himself under the direction of francefcr maria his mafter pointing out to many difficulties in the art to much difcouraged and difgalled so- timene that he quitted him in few days to follow his own inclination he guided himself by the works of lanfranc and ca- labrose in rudying composition and chioro- scuro thofe of pictro cortond and luca for- dano were the compass by which he flcered to arrive at his tone of colouring and mar- lastly he confulted guido and carle raltis a masters ratti for their beautiful manner of dra- pery by well-managed study of thefe mafters solimene formed himfelf fure gout every subject of hiffory that rofe in his ima- gination he immediately committed to pa- per and often coloured his designs while he was at the fcademy but after some time he very confiderably improved himself and was much admired for his great tafte in painting his glouds sty ground and trees for the admirable freshness of his tints the hermony of the whole and the tender union and great force of his colouring thefe excellencies gained him very con- fiderable reputation which was now raifed to great height the mott eminent men in irab and feveral crowned heads ho-

orl and frisce in hiffory portrait landscape ani- mals flowers fruit perspective and archi- seclure his extenfive talents prevented his ever being under neceffity of calling in the affittance of

on what he obferved which turned greatly to his advantage he was much emplryed in painting portraits of the size of thofe of nerfchar and had painted his own wife and family as big as the life but this manner difgufting him he en- tirely attached himself to the painting of hiftory in miniature his pictures are fi- nithed to furprizing height his pencil is tender his figures have an admirable roundness and relief his defign fuf- ficiently correct but the carnations of his figures are not lively they refemble ivory and have too yellow caft the time he was about his works took off their spirit and the scarcity of them raifed their value to an extravagant price the elector pa- latine pafting by rotferdam was to pleafed with his works that he took him under his protection and conferred on him riches and honours and whofe friendship he enjoyed till death called him hence in the year james thornhill the son of gentleman of an ancient family and eltate in derseishire was born dune his

turned out of his public employ- ments in company with the great sir cbriffepber wren which ill treatment was fupposed to have fo impaired his health that modern masters that after vear ’ sickness he died in the country in the year van huysum born at amfter- dam anno arrived to to great per- feetion in reprefenting the beauty of the flowers and the down and bloom on the frait he painted that no man ever at- tained fo great perfection in that branch he had great freedom and tenderness with mellownets and vigour of colouring the superiority of his touch the delicacy of his pencil his furprizing exactness his bigh finishing has traced nature through all her refinements and shewn that it was poffible to exceed all that went before him in the manner of exprefting thofe beauti- ful productions of the earth his father who was middling painter taught him to paint screens figures and vases on wood landicape and fometimes flowers but his experience teaching him that to work in every branch was to excel in none he con- fined himfelf to flowers fruit and land- sirpe which lat after fome time he likewife declined he was fo jealous of his art that he did not even permit his brothers to fee him work nor would he in- rruct any diiciple his great genius raifed hs reputation to fuch height that all the curious in painting fought his works with great eagerness which encouraged him to advance his prices to much that his pictures at laft grew out of the reach of any but princes and men of the greatelt fortune vet it is furprizing the trifling fortune he left when he died which happened at aen- rerdam in the year masters anthony watteav born at valen- ciennes in flanders anne his fa- ther put him to forry painter in that town but the son foon finding his maf ters deficiency left him to fudy under another who had talent for theatrical decorations with whom he went to paris but his mafter having call to work at the opera returned home and left him be- hind his being in ftrange place with- out friends drove him to many shifts for subfiffence but fortunately meeting with one gillor who delighted to find young painter that trod in the fame steps with himself lodged him in his houfe and gave him all the instructions in his power by which means he foon equalled his mafter gillot fenfible of this to improve him placed him under claude audran famous painter of ornaments wattean employed in paint- ing the figares in his works received new lights from the good tafle of his mafter and at the fame time tudied the colour- ing and rich composition of the gallery of ru- bens which was to near him fter fome time he gave up the manner of gillor which dropped infenfibly better tone of colour- ing finer more correct and hudied man- ner of defign had taken its place he was emboldened to paint for the prise at the hcademy which he carried and shewed in his picture sparks of that beautiful fire which never after decayed his great ap- plication rendered him melancholy though dees not appear in his pictures in them you find deal of gaiety lively and pe- netrating spirit natural judgment corrccincts modern mafters correctness of defign truth of colour- ing flowing pencil and the fineff and lighteff touch imaginable nothing can ex- ceed the firs of his heads for true cha- racter of nature to all thefe excellencies he jorned beautiful landscape and back grounds that deferved to be admired for the beauty of their colours he not only excelied in rural and gallant subjects but allo in marches and halrs of armies it is perhaps loss to the public that he neg- lected hiffory of which he feems to have been very capable the tafte he has fol- lowed is rather in the droll stile and does not agree with ferious subjects he died anno godrrey kneller was born at in- beck anno of father no ways wanting in care or expence to finifh his education he fent him to the univerfity at leyden to rudy the languages and mathematies but his genius leading him rrongly to drawing figures after the bifferical manner he foon made great improvements in it fo as to be much taken notice of and encouraged from this city he was removed to amffer- dam and placed for his better instruction under the care of rembrandt but not content with that gufto of painting where exacl design and frue proportion were want- ing his father fent him into trap at the age of feventeen and committed him to the care of near relation he fudied at rome under the favourable inffuence of carlo maratii and the chevalier bernini and began to acquire fame in hisfory- painting having firtt rudied arcbitecdure and mafters and anatomy the latter aptly difpoting him to relith the anrique starues and to improve daily by them by the importunity of fome friends he was prevailed on to come into england where his skill and merit foon made him known and gained him the friendship of king charles ii who after sitting for his own picture fent him to draw that of the french king where he had likewife the honour of drawing moft of the royal family for which he received some confiderable prefents but this success did not influence him to hay long in that kingdom at his return king charles dying in his abfence he was well received by king james ii and his qucen at the revolution he was appointed principal painter to king william who conferred on him the honour of knightbood the great elleem his merit gained him can not be more confpicuous than by obferving that no lets than ten growned heads did him the honour of fitting in perfon to him befides divers elecfors and princes from feeing and rudying many noble works of ru- bens ’ he began to change his stile and manner of colouring imitating that great matter whom he judged to have come neareft to narare of any other his draught is moff exact no painter ever excelled him in fure outline and graceful dispofition of his figures nor took better refem- blance of face which he feldom failed to express in the moft handfome or agreeable turn of it he always lived in the greatest efteem and reputation abounding no less in wealth than splendor in both furpaf- sing any of his predeceffors he spent the latter modern masters part of his life at whitton and died et hocarth was born in the parith of st. bartholomew london in the and was put apprentice to an engraver in sitver-plare after the death of his father perfon of good learning though fmall fortune the son probably chofe this occupation as it required fome skill in drawing to which his genins was particularly turned accordingly having made fome progrefs in the art during his apprenticeship he profecuted it with inde- fatigable diligence till at length he ac- quired complete miaftership therein and that without any foreign affiftance his uncommon tafents brought him into the notice of sir james tbornbill whofe daugh- ter he married litile before her father' death in the mean time not content with mere drawing he proceeded to finifh his defigns with colouring in which he like- wife fucceeded to admiration he had oc- cafionally been benefactor to his parish and prefented that hospital with capital piece the pool of bethefda in when he was chofen governor of it the de- pon of this piece furnifhed him with an op- portunity of difplaying his particular ta- lent in expresion the difeafes of the af- flicted attending that pool are marked in the rronged manner nor is the figure of chrill less dillinguished by the son of man when the foundling-hespital was finithed our painter enriched it with another piece upon like religious subject moses brought masters to pharacb ’ daughter hitherto he was feen in grave hiffory-paintings walk in which he had many competitors but in the mean time he launched out into an unbeaten track in which he became inimitable it is faid that the firff inlet to his excellence in burlesque was the being employed to draw defigns for new edition of huditras however that be it is certain that in co- mic life-painting he exceeded all that went before him though it is unjuft to give his life-pictures of this kind the character of fince both the one burlefque or grotesque to as departure and the other convey hogarth almoft al- from nature to which the ingenious ab- ways arictly adhered bot dn bes has often complained that no hiffory-painter of his time went through the series of actions and misfortunes of an hero from his cradle to his grave what du bos withed to fee done hogarth per- formed that work in this tafle which firff appeared was his harlor ’ progress where he launches out his young adven- turer fimple girl upon the town and conducts her through all the viciffitudes of wretchedness to premature death this was painting to the reafon and to the heart none had ever before made the frr fubler- vient to the purpofes of morality and inffruc sion book like this is fitted to every soil and every obferver and be that runs may read the rake progress fucceeded the for- mer which though not equal to it yet came thort only of that fingl excellence no other could come near him in that way his great excellence confifted in what we may term the furnisure of his pieces for masters in subjects and hiffory pieces the fewer little circumftances there are to divide the spec- tator ’ ttention from the principal figures is reckoned merit to in life-painting the greater variety there is of thofe little do- meftic lmages it gives the whole greater degree of force and refemblance thus in the harlor ’ progress we are not difpleated with james dalson ’ wig-bex on the bed-teafter in her lodgings in drury-lane particularly too if it be remembered that this james dakon was anoted highwayman of that time in the fieces of marriage -- lamode what can be more finely or faturically conceived than his introducing goary lord who car- ries his pride even in his infirmities and has his very grutches marked with coronet soon after the peace of hix-la-chapelle he went to paris the confequence of which was his humorous print of the reaft beef of old england carried into calais by jolly friar while our painter was sketching for this purpofe one of the gates of the town here introduced he had like to have been taken into cuffody as spy in re- membrance of which he has inferted his own face in corner of the print with serjeant clapping him on the shoulder about the veari he publifhed his analysis of beauty in gyarre which though rongly attacked in regard to fome of his notions yet is re- plete with thofe strokes that ever characterize the works of genins in his brother in-law refigned the place of king seryeant- painter in his favour he had fome time before bought houfe at chifwick near london where having now facrificed enough to his fame and fortune he ufually pafied the mlasters the greatell part of the summer seafon yet not without vifiting occafionally his houfe in leiceffer-fields about the year he complained of an inward pain in some of his vitals which continuing brought on ge- neral decay that proved incurable on october he was brought from chij- wick to leiceffer-fields in very weak con- dition yet was remarkably chearful and receiving an agreeable letter from friend in pensylvania he drew up the rough draught of an answer to it but going to eed he was feized with vomiting upon which he rung his bell and was found in fuch condition that he expired two hours after in the vear of his age his corple was afterwards conveyed to chifwick and interred there he left very confider- able fortune behind him which is come into the poffeffion of his truly mournfal wi- dow who had during their marriage lived with him in the utmoft harmony and hap- piness and rendered excellent by peculiar chearful dispofition fweet temper and
