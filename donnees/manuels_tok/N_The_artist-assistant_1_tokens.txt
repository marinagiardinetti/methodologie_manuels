the assistant artists drawing the great advantages derived from knowledge of the- art of drawing are universally known and acknowledged it being not only useful but absolutely necessary to those artists concerned in designing drawing is the basis of painting sculpture architecture engraving modelling chasing carving -- it offers so elegant and agreeable an amusement for the leisure hours of the man of business or the gentleman that every one who has neglected it has felt and confessed its loss to enable those who may not have the assistance of skilful instructor to become masters of this desirable accom¬ plishiment we shall give plain and concise directions and point out such mode of study as we trust will render the task of acquiring it pleafant and remove many impedi¬ ments which without such assistance would retard their the materials necessary for drawing are -- black lead peneils camel hair pencils crow quill pens red white original trom the black lead peneil should not be held so near the point as the pen in writing the use of it being for the sketch or first outline of the piece which should be drawn with freedom as any erroneous stroke or line may be erased by rubbing the work gently with indian rubber or crumb of stale bread as the subjects first proposed to the student ’ attention will be found to influence his future practice more than may be easily imagined great care should be taken that none but the works of the most eminent masters be put into his hands lest the ill habits he may acquire by contrary mode of conduct should be found difficult to be removed by the strongest exertions of mature judgment every figure nay every stroke given him as pattern should be excellent in its kind that he may be early familiarized to beauty taste and symmetry fortunately for the student such examples are at prefent by no means difficult to be procured the works of bartolozzi afford us the most compleat specimens of correctnefs of drawing and elegance of form after having for short time accustomed himself to the use of the pencil he would do well to study with the most scrupulous attention the rudiments of drawing engraved by that accomplissied artist from the designs of cipriani aster having prepared himself by acquiring the habit of copying correctly the best prints he may proceed to siudy from plaister casts from which he will derive more real improvement than from copying drawings since he will by this method become acquainted with the principles of the chiaroscuro or light and shade by the magie sorce of which the paintings of parrhasius were termed realities and the fingers of alexander in the character of jupiter the thunderer painted by the samed apelles seemed to fhoot forward while the lightning appeared to flaffi from them in the formation of painter genius is the first and most indispensable requisite for the absence of which no human acquirements can compensate picture like poem would afford little pleasure though formed according to the strictest rules of art and finished with the most inde- fatigable attention were genius wanting to compleat the design- design which may be said to be like the celebrated statue fafhioned by prometheus lovely but lifeless unless genius like the fire which he is fabled to have stolen from heaven darts its invigorating ray and gives soul to the finished piece but though genius be absolutely necessary since nothing can be done without it yet it will not alone suffice like rich but uncultivated soil it will be fruitsul only in weeds were not its exuberances corrected by the rules of art by reflection and strict attention to nature which is the grand object of painter ’ meditation it ought never to be out of his sight it is the only source of beauty since nothing can be pleasing that is not natural an intimate knowledge of the beauties of the ancients will he of the greatest advantage they made nature their peculiar study and transmitted to us examples in sculpture which have triumphed equally over the rage of time and barbarians examples which have ever been considered as forming perfect rule of beauty close and servile imitation however is not what we would wishi to recommend man may find his account in attending to the manner and storing up the observations of well-bred and intelligent acquaintance without ridi¬ culoussy affecting his gait or copying his phraseology in order to acquire knowledge of the face begin with drawing the features separate placing the copy at such distance as the eye may measure both it and the drawing without moving the head sketch in the sirst outline very light and in rubbing out leave faint traces of the first sketch by proceeding in this manner without the assistance of rule or compasses the outline should be brought to the greatest exactness and in placing the features à perfect oval should be formed through which perpendicular line is drawn in the middle and across the centre of this diameter line from one side of the oval to the other on these all the features of the face are to be drawn according to the following rules for drawing head the perpendicular must be divided into four equal parts one from the crown of the head to the top of the forehead two from the top of the forehead to the eye-brows three from the eye-brows to the bottom of the nose four from thence to the bottom of the chin the diameter line divide into five parts the breadth of the face being supposed the length of five eyes this is to be understood in full front face only and these proportions are rather inconstant in different men as to length and shape but in well proportioned face are nearly right and should be strictly observed when the face turns to either side then the distances are to be lessened on that side from you more or less in proportion to its turning most artists begin the drawing with the nose that being the centre and then proceed to the other features observing that the top of the ear is to rise parallel to the eye-brows the eye to be placed so as to leave exuctly the length of one eye betwixt them the nostrils should not project farther than the corner of the eye and the middle of the mouth snould be on the per¬ pendicular line in order to understand better the different turnings of the face it may be very advantageous to procure piece of wood made in the shape and size of an egg draw line down the middle as before directed divide this in two equal parts and draw another across the centre let the features be made as accurate as possible from the fore- going directions by turning this oval great variety of faces will appear according as it is inelined or turned but care must be taken to observe in what manner the nose projects beyond the round of the oval persect know- ledge of this may enable the student to form an idea of the face better than merely copying prints or pictures without it but after this acquisition let the best drawings or pictures be studied that can be procured previous to which those paffions in manner of le brun may meritimitation the positions and actions of the hands are so various no perfect rule or method can be given sor drawing tem time and pains should be employed in bestowing care on those members for it is very necessary not only to avoid all lameness and imperfection but also to make them appear with lise and spirit the attainment of which must be acquired by application and practice carefully imitating such postures both in hands and feet as can be procured in good prints or drawings lines and meafures and such mechanical rules are not only perplexing but rejected in the practice of the best masters the properest method is to lightly fketch the whole shape of the hand or foot with its position or action and examine carefully that it is correct rubbing out and altering it till it is so when the bending of the knuckles the veins joints and tendons may be drawn with much ease after the shape and propor- tion is made perfect in size and attitude after proper study of the legs arms hands feet and the student has reason to deem himself sufficiently practised in drawing features the human figure entire shiould be his next attempt to measure which according to fresnoy es the antients have commonly allowed eight heads though some of them have but seven but we ordinarily divide the figures into ten faces that is to the artist ’ assistant fay from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot in the following manner from the crown of the head to the forehead is the third part of face the face begins at the root of the lowest hairs which are upon the forehead and ends at the bottom of the chin the face is divided into three proportional parts ¬ the first contains the forehead the second the nose and the third the mouth and chin from the chin to the pit betwixt the collar bones are two lengths of nose from the pit betwixt the collar bones to the bottom of the breast one face from the bottom of the breast to the navel one face from the navel to the genitors one face from the genitors to the upper part of the knees two faces the knee contains half face from the lower part of the knee to the ancle two faces from the ancle to the sole of the foot half face man when his arms are stretched out is from tho longest finger of his right hand to the longest of his left as broad as he is long from one side of the breast to the other two faces the bone of the arm called humerus is the length of two faces from the shoulder to the elbow from the end of the elbow to the root of the little finger the bone called cubitus with part of the hand contains two faces from the box of the shoulder blade to the pit betwixt the collar-bones one face if vou would be satisfied in the measures of breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other so that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body you must observe that the boxes of the elbows with the humerus and of the humerus with the shoulder-blade bear the proportion of half face when the arms are stretched out the sole of the foot is the sixth part of figure the hand is the length of the face the thumb contains nose the inside of the arm from the place where the muscle disappears which makes the breast called the pectoral muscle to the middle of the arm four nofes from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand five noses the longest toe is nose long to the utmost parts of the teats and the pit betwixt the collar-bones of woman are an equilateral triangle for the breadth of the limbs no precise measure can be because the meafures themselves are changeable according to the quality of the persons and according to the movement of the muscles in drawing figure there should be slight sketch made of the whole not beginning with the head and finishing it then proceeding to the other parts method customary to many in consequence of which the head is often dispro¬ portioned or some part void of drawing skesch in the whole outline of the figure lightly and measure with the eye or draw the pencil or finger over any way to determine exactness without the rule or compasses in beginning the sketch the head is the first object then the shoulders in exact breadth the trunk of the body next observing with accuracy the breadth of the waist next the legs and lastly the arms and hands the principal difficulty is overcome when perfect outline is procured after which the shadows claim the attention of the student every appearance of bodies represented animate or inanimate in distance shape substance and distinction are perfected by this let them be first made broad and massy without attending to the many little distracted parts which sall under second consideration in drawing after plaister figure the eye will easily discover the general light and shade-the mafs of light should be kept broad and be well attended to before the smaller parts are divided the outline should be exceedingly faint in such parts as receive the light the rising of muscle may by its appearance prove deceiving and seem darker than it really is but by casting the eye to the other darker shadows true degree of its tint may be afcertained and sometimes the light may catch on the projection of bone near the mass of shadow which must be scuibled very tenderly or it will have harsh unpleasing effect this may also be regulated by comparing it with the stronger lights observ- ing this rule with care and exactness is the only true means of preserving the consistency of the whole together the instruction given above respecting the mafs of light upon the figure will regulate the student in managing the solds of the drapery which should never have the light parts cut by dark solds as the effect of the whole is thereby injured but this subject will be treated under the article of painting above all the young student must apply to his task with pleasure as well as with perseverance for improvement can not reasonably be expected if the mind instead of being fired with emulation gloomily contemplates the employ¬ ment as penance nor must the patient artist be too easily satissied with his own performance he must review it and re-touch it again and again he must search for its blemishes with the most rigid scrutiny till by repeated efforts he brings it as near to perfection as possible in word diligence in the beginning of any study will render the progress of it easy and the end delightful of the expression of the passions hrat language which above all others painter should carefully endeavour to learn and from nature herself is the language of the paffions without it the finest appear lifeless and inanimate it is not painter to be able to delineate the most exqu give them the most graceful attitudes and composecem well together it is not enough to dress them nut with propriety and in the most beautiful colours ft is nôt enough in fine by the powersul magie of light and inade to make the canvass vanish no he must likewise know how to cloath his figures with grief with joy with sear with anger he must in some sort write on their faces what they think and what they seel he must give them life and speech it is indeed in this branch that painting truly soars and in manner rises superior to herself it is in this branch she makes the spectator apprehend much more than what she expresses the means employed in imitating her by painting are the contours or outlines chiaroscuro and colours which appear solely calculated to strike the visual faculty painting also contrives to represent hard and soft rough and smooth surfaces which are objects of touch and this by means of certain tints and certain chiaroscuro which has disserent look in marble in the bark of trees in downy and delicate fubstances nay sne contrives to express sound and motion by means of light and shade and certain particular configurations in some landscapes of diderich ’ we almost hear the water murmur and see it tremble along the sides of the river and of the boats upon it in the battle of burgogne we are really apt to fancy that the trumpet sounds and we see the horse who has thrown his rider scamper along the plain but what is still more wondersul painting in virtue of her various colours and certain particular gestures expresses even the sentiments and most hidden affections of the soul and renders her visible so as to make the eye not only touch and hear but even kindle into paffion and reason many have written and amongst the rest the famous lavater on the various changes that according to various pafsions happen in the muscles of the face which is as it were the dumb tongue of the soul they observe for example that in fits of anger the face reddens the muscles of the lips puff out the eyes sparkle and that on the contrary in fits of melancholy the eyes grow motionless and dead the face pale and the lips sink in it is necessary principal part of his profeffion should study with care the le brun written for the pupils of the french academy charles le brun celebrated french painter born at paris about the vear he was the son of sculptor of small celebrity at very early age he had the good fortune to gain the patronage of the chancellor seguir wno after placing him for some time under the care of vouet who at that period was accounted the raphael of france sent him to italy for three years where he allowed him large pension after his return having by several considerable works established his reputation louis xiv ennobled him honoured him with the order of st. michael and made him his principal painter through the efforts of le of painting will be more intelligible but it will be of infinitely more service to study them in nature itself from which they have been borrowed and which exhibits them in that lively manner which neither tongue nor pen can express but if painter is to have immediate recourse to nature in any thing it is particularly in treating those very minute and almost imperceptible differences by which however things very different from each other are often expressed this is particularly the case with regard to the paffions of laughing and erying as in these however contrary the muscles of the face operate nearly in the same manner brun the revenues of the academy of painting were enlarged and the institution placed upon permanent foundation he also drew up project for an academy at rome to be founded by the king for the use of the french students who travel there when the kinz appointed le brun his principal painter he gave him also the direction of the manufacture of the gobelins which he attended with such affiduity that he made the designs for every thing that was done there he died in the year most considerable of his works are his pictures containing the history of alexander the great in the ceiling of the gallery of versailles and the great stair-case there as the famous pietro de cortona was one day finishing the face of crying child in representation of the iron age with which he was adorning the floor called the hot bath in the royal palace of pitti ferdinand il who happened to be looking over him for his amusement could not sorbear expressing his approbation by erying out oh how well that child cries to whom the able artist said has your majesty mind to see how easy it is to make children laught behold will prove it in an instant and taking up his pencil by giving the contour of the mouth concave turn upwards instead of the convex downwards which it before had and with little or no alteration in any other part of the face he made the child who little before seemed ready to burst his heart with crying appear in equal danger of bursting its sides with immoderate laughter and then by restoring the altered features to their former position he soon set the child erying again lectures of philip baldinucci in the academy of la crasca illustrat according to lionardo du vinci the best masters that painters can have recourse to in this branch are those dumb men who have found out the method of expressing their sentiments by the motion of their hands eyes eye-brows and in short every other part of the body this advice no doubt is very good but then such gestures must be imitated with great sobriety and moderation least they should appear too strong and exaggerated and the piece should shew nothing but pantomimes when speaking figures alone are to be exhibited and so become theatrical and second-hand or at least look like the copy of theatri- cal and second-hand nature we are told strange things of the antient painters of greece in regard to exprefsion especially of aristides who in picture of his representing woman wounded to death at à siege with child crawling to her breast makes her appear afraid least the child when sne was dead should for want of milk suck her blood medea murdering her children by timomachus was likewise much praised plionardo du vinci had perhaps one of the greatest minds the art of painting ever possessed he was mathematician an engineer poet and philosopher he wrote on his art with the same spirit and talent with which he exercised it during his residence at milan he painted an exquisite picture of the last supper for the refectory of the dominicans not being able to find fuitable model he left the head of christ unfinished for some time as was the head of judas for the same reason till the prior of the convent impatient to see the work compleated pressed him in so troublesome manner that he drew the head of the importunate sriar and placed it upon the shoulders of judas he resided the latter part of hiis life in france where he ably supported the high reputation he had acquired by his former works the king francis visiting him during his last illness in the year he rose in his bed to shew his sense of the honour conferred upon him and his respect for his royal patron the exertion caused him to faint and whilst the king was supporting him in his arms he expired in the zith year of his age as the ingenious artist contrived to express at once in her countenance both the fury that hurried her on to the commission of so great crime and the tenderness of mother that seemed to withhold her from it rubens attempted to express such double effect in the face of mary of medciis still in pain from her past labour and at the same time full of joy at the birth of dauphin and in the countenance of sancta polonia painted by tiepolo for st. anthony ’ church at padua one may think clearly read mixture of pain from the wound given her by the executioner and of pleasure from the prospect of paradise opened to her by it few to say the truth are the examples of strong expression afforded by the venetian flemissi or lombard schools deprived of that great happiness the happiness of being able to contemplate at leisure the works of the antients the purest fources of perfection in point of design expression and character and having nothing but nature constautly before their eyes they made strength of colour- ing blooming complexions and the grand effects of the chiaroscuro their principal study they aimed more at charming the senses than at captivating the under- standing the venetians in particular seem to have placed their whole glory in setting off their pieces with all that rich variety of personages and dress which their capital is continually receiving by means of its extensive commerce and which attracts so much the eyes of all those who visit it doubt much is in all the pictures of paolo veronese paolo cagliari veronese was born at verona in he resided chiessy at venice he was not famous for composition nor were his designs correct but his draperies have peculiar richness and are admirable imitations of the different stuffs of wnich they are composed he delighted to copy the rich habits of his countrymen and of the inhabitants of tne east there is to be found bold and judicious exprefsion or one of those attitudes which as petrarch expresses it speak without words unless perhaps it be that remarkable one in his marriage-feast at cana of galilee at one end of the table and directly opposite to the bridegroom whose eyes are fixed upon her there appears woman in red holding up to him the skirt of her garment as much as to say suppose that the wine miraculoussy produced was exactly of the colour with the stuff on her back and in fact it is red wine we see in the cup and pitchers but all this while the faces and attitudes of most of the company betray not the least sign of wonder at so extraordinary miracle they all in manner appear intent upon nothing but eating drinking and making merry such in general is the stile of the venetian school the florentine over which michael angelot presided above all things curious of design was most minutely and scrupu¬ lously exact in point of anatomy on this she set her heart and took singular pleasure in displaying it not only elegance of form and nobleness of invention but which he often introduced into his pictures sacrificing propriety and truth to brilliancy he had many faults but his colouring and whatever depends on it is so charming that it makes us forget those qualities in which he failed he died of fever in his tomb and statue in brafs are in tue church of st. sebastian michael angelo from his infancy snewed strong inclination for painting and made so rapid progress in it that he is said at the age of to have been able to correct the drawings of his master dominico grillandai his quicknefs of eye was wonderful he used to say that à sculptor should carry his compass in his eye « the hands indeed said he ne do the work but the eye judges he was extremely disinterested for his immortal design of st. peter ’ church at rome he received onsy roman crowns it was sinisned in fortnight likewise strength of expression triumph in the roman school nursed as it were amongst the works of the greeks and in the bosom of city which had once been the seminary of learning and politenefs here it was that domenichinor and poussin both great masters of expreffion refined themselves as appears more particularly by the st. jerome of the one and the death of germanicus or the slaughter of the innocents by the other here it was that raphaelf arose the sovereign master of them all one would imagine that pictures which are generally con- sidered as the books of the ignorant and of the ignorant only he had undertaken to make the instructors even of the learned one would imagine that he intended in some measure to justify quintilian who affirms that painting has more power over us than all the arts of rhetorick there is not indeed single picture of raphael ’ from the study of which those who are curious in point of exprefsion may not reap great benefit particularly his martyrdom of st. felicitas his magdalen in the house of the pharisee his transfiguration his joseph explaining this painter when young made but very slow progrefs in his profession he took so much pains and studied so closely while in the school of the carracchis that his sellow-students called him the ox sayins he toiled as if at plow but annibal carracchi who knew him better told them that this ox by dint of labour would make the ground so fruitful that painting itself would be sed by what it produced ’ ’ prophecy which has been accomplisnied since many things may be learned from his works nicholas poussin commonly called the french raphael stands at the head of the french school of painters he studied in italy and spent the greatest part of his lise there his pictures possess more grandeur and classic simplicity than those of any other french painter raphael sanzio ’ urbino boin on good friday he is the moft celebrated of the modern painters and the sounder of the roman school he died on goed-friday in the year further account of this great man will be given in the article painting to pharaoh his dream piece so highly rated by poussin his school of athens in the vatican is to all intents and purposes à school of expression among the many miracles of art with which this piece abounds shall single out that of the four boys attending on mathematician who stooping to the ground his compasses in his hand is giving them the demonstration of theorem one of the boys recollected within himself keeps back with all the appear¬ ance of profound attention to the reasoning of the master another by the brifkness of his attitude discovers greater quicknefs of apprehension while the third who has already seized the conclusion is endeavouring to explain it to the fourth who standing motionless with open arms staring countenance and an unspeakable air of stupidity in his looks will never perhaps be able to make any thing of the matter and it is probably from this very groupe that albani who studied raphael so closely drew the following precept of his that it behoves painter to express more circumstances than one by every attitude and so to employ his figures that by barely seeing what they are actually about one may be able to guefs both what they have been already doing and are next going to do this is difficult precept but it is only by due observance of it the eye and the mind can be made to hang in suspense on painted piece of canvas it is exprefsion that painter ambitious to soar in his profession must above all things labour to perfect himself in it is the last goal of his art as socrates proves to parrhasius it is in expression that dumb poetry consists and what the prince of our poets calls visible language albani ’ success in painting children and handsome females stands unrivalled he was remarkably placid and lived to very great age perspective perspective is the art of delineating visible objects on plain surface such as they appear at given distance or height upon transparent plane placed perpendicularly to the horizon between the eye and the object there are three forts of perspective viz linear ærial and specular perspective linear perspective to which most properly belongs our definition and which is branch of the mathematics regards the position magnitude form of the several lines or contours of objects and expresses their diminution erial perspective which makes part of the art of painting regards the colour lustre strength boldness of distant objects considered as seen through column of air and expresses the diminutions thereof specular perspective represents the objects in conical spherical or other mirrours erect and clear whereas on lawn and other planes they appear confused and irregular these three sorts of perspective have each its particular doctrine but before we proceed in the explanation of the doctrine we must teach our pupils what are planes in perspective of which there are five forts viz perspective geometrical horizontal vertical and objective plane perspective plane is plain pellucid surface ordinarily erpendicular to the horizon and placed between the spectator ’ eye and the object he views through which the optick rays emitted from the several points of the objects are supposed to pafs to the eye and in their passage to leave marks that represent them on the said plane geometrical plane is plane parallel to the horizon whereon the object to be delineated is supposed to be placed this plane is usually at right angles with the perspective plane -- horizontal plane is plane passing through the spectator ’ eye parallel to the horizon cutting the perspective plane when that is perpendicular to the geometrical one at right angles.- vertical plane is plane passing through the spectator ’ eye perpendicular to the geometrical one and usually parallel to the perspective lane-an objective plane is any plane situate in the horizontal plane whose representation is required in perspective there are likewise several disserent lines in perspective viz terrestrial line geometrical line line of the front vertical line visual line line of station objective line and line of distanee -- geometrical line in perspective is right line drawn in any manner on the geometrical plane—¬ terrestrial line or fundamental line is right line wherein the geometrical plane and that of the picture or draught interfect one another such is the line formed by the intersection of the geometrical plane and the perspective plane- line of the front is any right line parallel to the terrestrial line- vertical line is the common section of the vertical and of the draught.- visual line is tlie line or ray imagined to pafs from the oliject to the eye.— an objective line is any line drawn on the geometrical plane whose representation is sought sor in draughts or picturesa line of station according to some writers is the common section of the geometrical and vertical planes others mean by it the perpendicular height of the eye above the geometrical plane whose representation is sought for in draughts or pictures.- line of distance is à right line drawn from the eye to the principal point this as it is perpendicular to the perpendiculars of the plane or table can only be the distance of the eye from the table—the point of the distance in perspective is point in the horizontal line at such distance from the principal point as is that of the eye from the same there are other points befides this point of distance in perspective viz the point of fight the third point the objective point the accidental point and the visual oint which term point is used for various parts or places with regard to the perspective plane-the point of sight or of the eye is point on the plane marked out by à right line drawn from the eye perpendicular to the plane this is also called the principal point this point is in the intersection of the horizontal and vertical planes some authors call it the principal point and give the name point of sight or vifion to the point wherein the eye is actually placed and where all the rays terminate the third point is point taken at discretion in the line of distance wherein all the diagonals drawn from the divisions of the geometrical plane whose representation is required on the perspective plane-an accidental point is point in the horizontal lines where lines parallel to one another though not perpendicular to the picture or representation meet- visual point is point in the horizontal line wherein all the ocular rays unite thus person standing in strait long gallery and looking forwards the side the floor and ceiling seem to meet and touch one another in point or common centre these things being previousty considered we shall next pass to the explanation of the different forts of perspective from point in given line to raise perpendicular see fig ii draw with the ruler the given line then set one foot of your compasses in and extending them to rather more than half the length of the line sweep the arch cd and with the same extent of compasses set one point in and sweep the arch ef then without altering the compasses set one foot in and describe the arch hi next rule through the points cg to intersect the arch hi in and draw the line from to which is the perpendicular required another way see fig iii from the point take the equal distances and on each side of it then stretch the compasses to any distance greater than or and with one foot of them in sweep the arch then with the same extent of compasses set one point in sweep the arch fg and these two arches will intersect each other in the point from which line drawn to the point is the perpendicular required te draw one line parallel or equi-distant to another given line see fig iv extend your compasses to the distance of the parallel you require then with one soot in any point of the given line as in describe the arch again without altering the compasses six one foot in any other point as in and sweep the arch gh then rule the line ik touching the outward parts of the two arches and that will be the parallel to the given line to bisect or divide given line ab into two equal parts see fig take with your compasses any distance greater than half the given line then with one soot of them in sweep the arch cc and with the fame distance setting one foot in sweep the arch and these arches will intersect each other in the points gh which joined by perpendi¬ cular will intersect in the middle point upon the end ofa given line ab to raise perpendicular see fig vi place one foot of the compasses in and extend them to any point without the given line then set one foot of them in cand turn the circle and and through draw the diameter ce meeting the circle in join and that right line is the perpendicular required to turn the circle through any three given points not in right line see fig vii fix three points at any distance you think proper as at and and join them by the right lines and bc then by fig biseet the line with the line de which done biseet the line bc with the line fe and from the center where these lines meet extend your compasses to and describe the circle bcg to draw an oval see fig viii draw given line which divide into four equal parts set one foot of the compasses at and from that center describe circle with the same extent of com¬ passes place one foot in the center and turn the circle ff then with one foot still in extend your compasses and turn the arch gg and with the same extent placing one foot in describe the arch hh join the intersections with perpendicular from to next place one foot of the compasses in sweep the arch ll and without altering them set one foot in and describe the arch mm another method for an oval see fig ix draw given line and with the compasses extended placing one foot in with the other turn the circle then without altering your compasses on the line in the supposed point sweep the circle ff and through the points gg where the two circles intersect draw the perpendicular hi then six your compasses with one foot in and extend them so as to describe the arch kk to the lower extremities of the circles then with the same extent with one foot in sweep the arch il to join the upper extremities by these examples it will appear that an oval of any form or size may be constructed at pleasure only taking care always to fix the compasses equi-distant from the given line in the perpendicular hi practical examples in perspective to draw square pavement in perspective see fig suppose your piece of pavement to consist of sixty-four pieces of marble each foot square your first business is to draw an ichnographical plan or ground plot of it which is thus performed having made an exact square of the size you intend your plan divide the base and horizon into eight equal parts and from every division in the base to its opposite point in the horizon rule perpendicular lines then divide the sides into the same number ruling parallel lines acrofs from point to point so will your pavement be divided into sixty-four square feet because the eight feet in length multiplied by the same in breadth give the number of square feet or pieces of marble contained in the whole then rule diagonals from corner to corner and thus will your ground plot appear as in fig now to lay this in perspective draw another square to your intended size and divide the base line into eight equal parts as before then fix your point of sight in the middle of the horizon de and from the same point rule lines to every division in the base after which rule diagonal lines from to and from to answerable to those in the ground plot and your square will be reduced to the triangle bc then from the point where the diagonal db intersects the line ac to the opposite intersection where the diagonal crosses the line cb rule parallel line which is the abridgment of the square then through the points where the diagonals crofs the rest of the lines which go from the base to the point of sight rule parallel lines and your square pavement will be laid in perspective as in fig xi to find the height and proportion of any objects as they appear above the horizon on supposed plane seec fig xii first rule your horizontal line no and fix your point of sight as at then mark the place of your nearest pillar by making dot for the base or bottom as at the artist ’ assistant another for the summit or top as at rule line from to the point of sight and another from bto and these two lines will give the height of any number of pillars as for example suppose you would have pillar at six your dot for the base and rule from thence parallel line to meet the diagonal mat then rule the perpendicular de to the diagonal bm which perpendi¬ cular is the height of your figure required at or if vou would place pillars at and observe the same method ruling the parallelsfg and and the perpen¬ diculars gh and kl will give their heights at the distances required to find the diameter or thicknefs of pillars at any parti- cular distances you are also to be guided by that nearest the base for instance suppose your nearest pillar to be ten feet high and one foot in diameter divide it from top to bottom into ten equal parts and set off one of them upon the base of the pillar then

perspective is either employed in representing the ichnographies and ground-plots of objects as projective planes or in scenographies and representations of the bodies themselves schnography in perspective is the view of any thing cut off by plain parallel to the horizon just at the base or bottom of it so that ichnograpliy is the same with what is otherwise called the plan geometrical plan or ground¬ plot of any thing scenography in perspective is representation of body on perspective plane or à description thereof in all its dimensions such as it appears to the eye the ichno¬ graphy of building reprefents the plan or ground- work of the building the orthography the front or one of the sides and the scenography the whole building front sides height and all raised on the geometrical plan projection in perspective denotes the appearance or re- presentation of an object on the perspective plane the projection gr of point is point through which the optick ray passes from the objective point through the plane to the eye or it is the point wherein the plane cuts the optick ray and hence is easily conceived what is meant by the projection of line plane or à solid the projection of the sphere in plane is à representation of several points or places of the surface of the sphere and of the circles described thereon or of any assigned parts thereof such as they appear to the eye situate at any given distance upon transparent plane placed between the eye and the sphere the principal use of the projection of the sphere is in the construction of planispheres and particu- larly maps and charts which are said to be of this or that projection according to the several situations of the eye and the perspective plane with regard to the meridians parallels and other points and places to be represented the projection of the sphere is usually divided into ortho¬ graphic and stereographic orthographic projection is that wherein the superfices of the sphere is drawn on plane cutting it in the middle the eye being placed at an infinite distance vertically to one of the hemispheres the laws of this sort of projec tion are thefe the rays by which the eye at an infinite distance perceives any object are paralled right line perpendicular to the plane of the projection is projected into point where that right line cuts the plane of the projection right line not perpendicular but either parallel or oblique to the plane of the projection is projec— ted into à right line and is always comprehended between the extreme perpendiculars the projection of the right line is the greatest when that line is parallel to the plane of the projection hence it is evident that line parallel to the plane of the projection is projected into right line equal to itself but if it be oblique to the plane of the projection it is projected into one which is less plane furface at right angles to the plane of the projection is projected into that right line in which it cuts the plane of the projection hence it is evident that circle standing at right angles to the plane of the projec¬ tion which passes through its centre is projected into that diameter in which it cuts the plane of the projection circle parallel to the plane of the projection is pro- jected into circle equal to itself and circle oblique to the plane of the projection is projected into an ellipsis stereographic projection is that wherein the surface and circles of the sphere are drawn upon the plane of great circle the eye being in the pole of that circle as to the properties of this fort of projection in this projection right circle is projected into line of half tangents reprensentation of right circle perpendicularly opposed to the eye will be circle in the plane of the pro- jection the representatien of circle placed obliquely to the eye will be circle in the plane of projection if great circle is to be projected on the plane of another great eircle its centre will lie in the line of meafures distant from the centre of the primitive by the tangent of its elevation above the plane of the primitive if lesser circle whose poles lie in the plane of the projection were to be projected the center of its reprefentation would lie in the line of meafures distant from the centre of the primitive by the secant of the lesser circle ’ distance from its pole and its femi-diameter or radius be equal to the tangent of that distance if à lesser circle were to be projected whose poles lie not in the plane of the projection its diameter in the projection if it falls on each side of the pole of the primitive will be equal to the sum of the half tangents of its greatest and nearest distance from the pole of the primitive set each way from the centre of the pri¬ mitive in the line of meafures if the lesser circle to be projected falls entirely on one side of the pole of projection and does not encompass it then will all its diameter be equal to the difference of the half tangents of its greatest and nearest distance from the pole of the primitive set off from the centre of the primitive one and the same way in the line of measures in the stereographic projection the angles made by the circles of the surface of the sphere are equal to the angles made by their representation in the plane of their projection — of colours the method of preparing the various kinds used in painting it will now be proper to explain in an easy manner the method of preparing the various bodies employed by painters for produeing the difference of light and shade which may be termed either pigments or fluids as they are solid or aqueous and are distinguisnied in their several kinds according to the manner of working them as oil- colours water-colours enamel-colours but their variety are too numerous to be in general use most pain- ters therefore felect set out of them and become very unjustly prejudiced against those they reject it is no little impediment to their improvement in the profeffion that they are not more extensively acquainted with all the ingredients fit for their purposes oa gem those colours which become transparent in oil such as lake prussian blue and brown pink are frequently used without the admixture of white or any other opake pig- ment by which means the tint of the ground on which they are laid retains in soie degree its force and the real colour produced in painting is the combined effect of both this is called glazing and the pigments endued with the property of becoming transparent in oil are called glazing colours as colours are obtained from various substances the means of preparing them are consequently various some being of fimple nature and requiring only to be purified and reduced to proper consistence or texture and others being compounds of different bodies to be formed only by complex processes it is therefore very difficult to give such general directions for the making every sort of colour as may be intelligible to all the utensils to be employed as well as the methods to be pursued being such as belong to different arts and trades where nevertheless simple means and the use of such utensils as are generally known may be sufficient to per- form what is wanting it is best to avoid all technical terms and more complex methods of operation adopting such mode of instruction as may be universally intelligible we now proceed to the nature and preparation of the dif- ferent colours as they follow in their classes classl red colours vermillion is one of the most useful colours in every kind of painting except enamel or on glass as it is of moderate price spends to great advantage in any kind of work and stands or holds its colour extremely well it may be prepared in great perfection by the following pro¬ cess take of quicksilver eighteen pounds of flowers of sulphur six pounds melt the sulphur in an earthen pot and pour in the quicksilver gradually being also gently warmed and stir them well together with the small end of tobaccopipe but if from the effervescence on adding the latter quantities of the quicksilver they take fire extinguish it by throwing wet cloth which should be had ready over the vessel when the mafs is cold powder it so that the several parts may be well mixed together but it is not necessary to reduce it by nicer levigation to an impalpable state having then repared an oblong glass body or sublimer by coating it well with fire-lute over the whole surface of the glafs and working proper rim of the same round it by class red scarlet or tending to the orange crimson or tending to the purple vermillion carmine native cinnaber lake red lead rose pink red oker- scarlet oker common indian red venetian red spanis brown terra di sienna burnie which it may be hung in the furnace in such manner that one half of it may be exposed to the fire fix it in proper furnance and let the powdered mass be put into it so as to nearly fill the part that is within the furnace piece of broken tile being laid over the mouth of the glass sublime then the contents with as strong heat as may be used without blowing the fumes of the vermillion out of the mouth of the sublimer when the sublimation is over which may be perceived by the abatement of the heat towards the top of the body discontinue the fire and after the body is cold take it out of the furnace and break it collect then together all the parts of the sublimed cake separating carefully from them any dross that may have been left at the bottom of the body as also any lighter substance that may have formed in the neck and appears to be dis- similar to the rest levigate the more perfect part and when reduced to fine powder it will be vermillion proper for use but on the perfectnefs of levigation depends in great degree the brightnefs and goodness of the vermillion in order therefore to perform this it is necessary that two or three mills of different closeness should be employed and the last should be of steel and set as finely as possible it is common perhaps general for dealers to sophisticate vermillion with red lead but to detect with certainty the fraud both with respect to the general fact tand the pro- ortion use the following means take small but known quantity of vermillion suspected to be adulterated and put it into crucible having first mixed with it about the same quantity in bulk of charcoal dust put the crucible into common fire having first covered it with lesser crucible inverted into it and give heat sufficient to fuse lead when the crucible being taken ’ out of the fire should be well fhaken by striking it against the ground if the suspect- ed adulteration has been practised the lead will be found reduced to its metalline state in the bottom of the cruciblé and being weighed and compared with the quantity of cinnabar that was put into the crucible the proportion of the adulteration may be thence certainly known but if no lead be found in the crucible it may be safely inferred that no red lead had been commixt with the vermillion native cinnabar is found naturally formed in the earth though seldom so pure as to be fit for the uses of painting at least without being purified by sublimation the mistaken notion that it would stand better than vermillion because it was na- tural production has made it to be coveted by painters who are curious in colours it is however not worth their while to be solicitous about it as it never excelled the beft vermillion in brightness and what is generally sold for it is pigment compounded of quicksilver and sulphur red lead ot minum the goodness of red lead may be seen by its brightnefs and mixture of any kind will make it of dull appear- ance it is on this account not so liable to be sophisticated as white lead or vermillion it is lead caleined till it ac- quires proper degree of colour by exposing it with large surface to the fire scarlet oker is an ochrous earthy or rather irony substance and is the basis of green vitriol separated from the acid of the vitriol by calcination it is kind of orange scarlet colour and rivals any of the native okers from its certainty of standing and extreme strength and warmth either as ground or in the shade of carnations it is useful as colour in any kind of painting the manner of its prepara¬ tion is as follows take of green vitriol or copperas any quantity and being put into crucible of which it will sill two thirds set it on common fire to boil taking care that it do not boil over till the matter be nearly dry when it will be greatly diminished in quantity fill then the crucible to the same height again and repeat the boiling and replenishing till the crucible be sfilled with dry matter take it then from this fire and put it into wind-furnace or if the quantity be small it may be continued in the same fire the coals being heaped up round it let the contents be calcined there till they become of red colour when cold which must be exa¬ mined by taking à little of the matter out of the middle and suffering it to cool for so long as it remains hot the red colour will not appear though it be sufficiently caleined when duly calcined take the oker out of the crucible while hot and put it into water in which the parts of the broken crucible may be soaked likewise to obtain more easily what shall adhere to them and stir oker well about in the water that all the remaining vitriol may be melted out of it let it then settle and when the water appears clear pour it off and add fresni quantity taking out all the broken pieces of the crucible and proceed as before repeating several times this treat- ment with fresh quantities of water then purify the oker from any remaining foulness by washing over and having brought it to proper state of dryness by drain- ing off the fluid by filter in which the paper must be covered with linen cloth lay it to dry on boards indian red is substituted in place of the real kind brought from the east-indies serving equally well for common purposes giving tint verging to scarlet varying from the true indian red which is greatly inelined to the purple and on account of its warm though not bright colour it is much used as well in finer as coarser paintings in oil it is af¬ forded cheap and may be thus managed take of the caput mortuum or oker left in the iron pots after the distillation of aquafortis from nitre and vitriol two parts and of the caput mortuum or colco- thar left in the long necks after the distillation of oil of vitriol one part break the lumps found among them and put them into tubs with good quantity of water and having let them stand for day or two frequently stirring them well about lade off as much water as can be got clear from them and add fresni quantity repeat- ing the same treatment till all the salts be washied out and the water come off nearly insipid the red powder which remains must then be wassied over and being freed from the water laid out to dry when this is designed for nicer purposes it should be washed over again in basons the grofs manner of lading it out of one tub into another not sitting it always com¬ pletely to such ends venetian red useful to house-painters in imitating mahogany and is native red oker inclining to scarlet and easily prepared by mixing it with the colcothar or caput mortuum taken out of the aquafortis pots and wassied over it requires no other preparation for use than to be well ground with oil unless when it is used in miniature painting -- when it should be wasnied over with the utmost care spanish brown resembles the venetian red very much in colour but is fouler it is native pigment and is used much in the same state nature produces it being dug up in several parts of england no other preparation is needful than freeing it well from stones and filth and grinding it with oil to ren¬ der it fit for colourmen in the preparation of cloths for pictures and other coarse work calcined or burnt terra di sienna is originally yellow but when moderately caleined be- comes an orange red though not very bright it is à na- tive oker brought hither from italy in the state in which it is naturally found it is calcined by putting lumps of it either in crucible or naked in common fire and conti¬ nuing it there till the colour be changed from yellow to red it is exceedingly useful in oil-painting and admits of no adulteration it may be distinguishied from other ochrous earths by its semi-transparency carmine is bright crimson colour of great advantage in paint ing as well in water as varnish the preparation of it is kept à secret by those who prepare it in perfection and the superiority of the french carmine shews that the pro¬ per method is wanting in england -- though some wrongly attribute the excellence to qualities in the air and water of france there are several recipes for this colour but rather than insert imperfect instructions for an article of great consequence we choose to be silent lake the best of what is commonly sold is made from the eo- lour extracted from scarlet rags and deposited on the cuttle- bone which may be done in the following manner take pound of the best pearl-ashies and having dissolved them in two quarts of water purify them by filtering through paper add then to this solution two more quarts of water and having put in pound of carlet shreds procured of the taylors which must be entirely clean boil them in pewter boiler till the shreds appear to have wholly lost their scarlet colour take them out of the solution and press them well dip- ping them after in water and pressing them again that all the sluid they had imbibed may be got from them in order to be put back to the rest take then another pound of the scarlet snreds and repeat the like treat- ment of them in the same solution as also third and fourth pound while this is doing dissolve pound and half of cuttle-fishi-bone in pound of strong aquafortis in glafs receiver adding more of the bone if it appear to produce any ebullition in the aquafortis and having strained off this solution through flannel pour it into the other by degrees observing whether it produce any esservescence on putting in the last quantity which ifit do in any great degree more of the cuttle-fish-bone must be dissolved in aquafortis and the solution very gradu- ally added till no ebullition appear to be raised by it in the mixture if this be properly managed the fluid will soon become clear and colourless and the tinging parti- cles extracted from the shreds together with the cuttle- fishi-bone will subside to the bottom and form crimson sediment which is the lake the water must then be poured off and two gallons of hard spring water must be put to the lake and well stirred about to mix them this being likewise poured off after the lake has again settled to the bottom must be replaced by another two gallons and the same method must be repeated four or five times but ifhard water can not be procured or the lake appear too purple half an ounce of alum should be added to each quantity of water before itbe used when the lake is thus sufficiently freed from the salts it must have the water drained from it in filter covered with linen cloth which has been so worn as to have no nap or down remaining on its furface after the lake has been drained to proper dryness it must be dropped on clean boards by means of proper funnel through which the drops being suffered to pafs and rest on the board at proper distances they will become small cones or pyramids in which forin the lake must be suffered to dry and the preparation is then completed rose pink the basis of this pigment is principally chalk and the tinging substance extracted from brasil or campeachy wood it will not stand with oil or water and is seldom employed but for the coarse work of house painters or for paper hanging unless secured from slying with varnisn when if good it may be substituted for lake it is pre- pared as follows take brasil wood six pounds or three pounds of brasil and three of peachy wood boil them an hour with three gallons of water in which quarter of pound of alum is dissolved purisy then the fluid by straining through flannel and put back the wood into the boiler with the same quantity of alum and proceed as before repeating this third time mix then the three quan¬ tities of tincture together and evaporate them till only two quarts of fluid remain which evaporation must be performed first in the pewter boiler and afterwards in balneo mariæe prepare in the mean time eight pounds of chalk by washiing over pound of alum being put into the water used for that purpose which after the chalk is washied must be poured off and supplied by fresn quantity till the chalk be freed from the salt form¬ by the alum after which it must be dried to the con¬ sistence of stiff clay the chalk and tincture as above prepared must be then well mixed together by grinding and afterwards laid out to dry where neither the sun or cold air can reach it though if it can be conveniently done gentle heat may be used red oker is native earth brought chieslsy from oxsordshire and burnt afterwards by those who prepare it in large ovens till by caleination it becomes red it is very useful as well in the more delicate as coarser paintings in oil for it stands infallibly for nicer purposes it should be washied over but for others it may be used in the state in which it is found in the shops class ii of blue colours ultramarine is bright blue colour of the highest value in every kind of painting being equally serviceable in all even in enamel it has transparent effect in oil and in some degree in water and will stand without the least hazard of flying by reason of its high price prussian blue has been much introduced to the prejudice of paint- ing in general as the skies of landfkapes and many other parts of modern pictures shew the loss of ultramarine by their changing from warm or clear blue to faint green or olive tint the methods have been continually varied by those who have attempted to prepare this pigment the following is the best of the more modern take the lapis lazuli and break it into very small pieces or rather grofs powder put it into crucible and cover it securely to prevent the coals from falling amongst it calcine it then with strong fire for an hour if there be any large quantity or less time in pro¬ portion quench it when taken out of the fire in vinegar stirring them well together and suffer it to re- class ii blue uitramarine indigo uitramarine affies smalt prussian blue verditer litmus or latmus cendre blue or sanders blue main in that state for day or two pour off then the vinegar except what may be necessary for moistening the caleined lapis lazuli in grinding which operation it must then undergo in mortar of flint or glass till reduced to the greatest degree of finenefs those means may effect but if it appear yet too hard to be easily ground give it another short calcination and quench it second time in vinegar the vinegar must then be washed off from the powder by the putting to it several successive quanti¬ ties of clean water each of which must be poured off when the lapis lazuli has been well stirred about in them and is again settled to the bottom it must then be ground on porphyry stone with mullar till it be perfectly impalpable and then dried in which state it is duly prepared to mix with the following cement take of burgundy pitch nine ouncesof white resin and venice turpentine six ounces-of virgin wax one ounce and halfand of linseed oil one ounce and quarter mix them together by melting in pipkin over the fire and suffer them to boil till they acquire so stiff con- sistence that being dropt into water while of this boiling heat they will not spread on the surface of it but form roundishi mass or lump the cement being thus formed may be poured out of the pipkin in the water and made into cakes or rolls for use of this cement take an equal weight with that of the calcined lapis lazuli and melt it in glazed earthen pipkin but not so as to ren¬ der it too fluid then add to it the calcined matter by very slow degrees stirring them together with an ivory spatula till the whole appear perfectly mixed being thus mixed heat the composition to something greater degree and cast it into large bason full of cold water when it has cooled to consistence to bear such treat- ment knead it well like tlie dough of bread with the hands rubbed over with linseed oil till all the parts be thoroughly incorporated with each other then make the mafs into cake which may be either kept till some other convenient time in cold water or immediately pro¬ ceeded with in the following manner put the cake into an earthen disni or bason the bottom of which should be rubbed with linseed oil and pour on it water of the warmth of blood let it stand quarter of an hour and as the water softens the cake it will let loose the finest part of the calcined matter which on gently stir- ring the water but without breaking the cake or sepa¬ rating it into lesser parts will be suspended in the water and must be poured off with it into another vessel the quantity of water must be then renewed and the same operation repeated second or third time and as the mass appears slack in affording the colour it must be moved and stirred in the manner of kneading with the ivory spatula but not broken into fragments or small parts and when so much of the colour is extracted as to render it necessary for the obtaining more the heat of the water must be increased to the greatest degree the quantities of the calcined matter which is now the ultra- marine that were first washed off and appear of the same degree of deepness and brightness may be put to- gether and the same of those of the second degree the last washiings making third the water being then poured off from each of these parcels put on lixivium formed of two ounces of salt of tartar or pearl-ashies dissolved in pint of water and filtered through paper ce after the solution is cold this lixiviui must be put on boiling hot and the ultramarine stirred well about in it and then the mixture set to cool the powder being subsided the clear lixivium must be poured off and clean water put in its place which must be repeated till the whole of the salts of the lixivium are washied away the ultramarine must afterwards be dried and will be then duly prepared for use uitramarine is subject to be adulterated on account of its great price this is frequently done by precipitation of copper made by alkaline salt and is very injurious be- cause the magistery of copper if the ultramarine sophisticat- ed with it be used in painting either with oil or water will change its hue and turn black and in enamel paint- ing as soon as fluxed it will become green and conse- quently make the effect of the ultramarine vary from what is intended this fraud may be easily detected by pouring some diluted spirit of nitre on small quantity which if there be any copper will soon dissolve and form greenisn blue solution ultramarine ashes after the ultramarine has been extracted from the lapis lazuli the residuum or remains form this pigment and when the operation of extracting the colour has not succeed- ed well considerable share of the ultramarine is left behind with the recrement and greatly enhances the worth of the ashies for of course the value of the latter is inferior to the former but it is still subject to adulteration which may be discovered by putting some of it into small quantity of spirit of nitre and if there be any copper in it it will be tinged green it is prepared as follows take the cement of the ultramarine which remains after the colour is extracted and mix it with four times its weight of linseed oil let the mixture be set in glazed pipkin over the fire and when it is thus boiled te fhort time put it into glass vessel sufficiently large to contain it of cylindrical figure of which vessel the diameter must be small in proportion to the length but care must be taken that the matter when put into this glass be cool enough not to endanger the breaking it this glass must then be put into balneum mariae which must be made as hot as possible without boiling and kept there till the colour appears to be all subsided to the bottom the oil must then be poured off till the colour appears to rise with it and the remainder with the colour in it must be put into another glass of the same kind with as much fresn oil as will rise sive or six inches above the colour this glass must be treated in the same manner as the first observing when the colour has subsided the oil must be poured off and fresni quantity put in its place this having been like- wise poured off the colour must then be well wasnied to free it from the remaining oil first in boiling water and afterwards in some of the lixivium abovementioned made boiling hot also as much of the lixivium being poured off when the colour has subsided as can be se- parated from it that way the colour must be thoroughly freed from the remainder by frequent ablutions with clean water after which the water must be taken off by the means above directed for the ultramarine till the matter be ofa proper degree of moisture for grinding it must then be thoroughly well ground on porphyry and washied over that all the harder and insufficiently cal- cined parts may be reduced to an impalpable powder in order to which the remaining grosser parts after the finer have been separated by the washing over must be again ground till the whole be perfectly fine the same means must be afterwards used to bring the afhies to dry powder that were before directed for the ultra- marine prussian blue is the earth of alum combined with the sixed sulphur of animal or vegetable coal and may be made from almost any animal substance but it is generally made of the coal of blood only it is useful in all kinds of painting save enamel and prepared to different degrees of brightness and strength the common kind found in the shops and sold at very low prices can be little depended upon in paintings of consequence therefore it should be prepared perfect and in the true manner and then considering the high price of ultramarine and the soulness of the indigo it may be truly deemed very valuable acquisition to the art of painting take of blood any quantity and evaporate it to per- fect drynefs of this dry blood powdered take six pounds and of the best pearl-ashies two pounds mix them well together in glass or stone mortar and then put the mixt matter into large crucibles or earthern pots and calcine it in furnace the top of the crucible or pot being covered with tile or other such con- venient thing but not luted the calcination should be continued so long as any flame appears to issue from the matter or rather till the flame become slender and blue for if the fire be very strong small slame would arise for very long time and great part of the tinging matter would be dissipated and lost when the matter has been sufficiently calcined take the vessels which con¬ tain it out of the fire and as quickly as possible throw it into two or three gallons of water and as it soaks there break it with wooden spatula that no lumps may remain put it then into propertin vessel and boil it for the space of three quarters of an hour or more filter it while hot through paper in tin cullenders and pafs some water through the filter when it is run dry to washi out the remainder of the lixivium of the blood and pearl-ashies the earth remaining in the silter may be then thrown away in the mean time dissolve of clean alum four pounds and of green vitriol or cop¬ peras two pounds in three gallons of water add this solution gradually to the siltered lixivium so long as any effervescence appears to arise on the mixture but when no ebullition or ferment follows the admixture cease to put in more let the mixture then stand at rest and green powder will be precipitated from which when has thoroughly subsided the clear part of the fluid must be poured off and fresh water put in its place and stirred well about with the green powder and after proper time of settling this water must be poured off like the first take then of spirit of salt double the weight of the green vitriol which was contained in the quantity of solution of vitriol and alum added to the lixivium which will soon turn the green matter to blue colour and after some time add proper quantity of water and wasn the colour in the same manner as has been directed for lake and when properly washed proceed in the same manner to dry it in lumps of con¬ venient size the brightness deepness and coolness of prussian blue are proofs of its goodness for with these qualities it may be depended upon in standing well sophistication or any thing amiss in the process may be seen by its heing more foul and purple verditer is formed by adding due proportion of chalk to solu- tion of copper made by refiners in precipitating the silver from the aquafortis in the operation called parting ver- diter is to be had at cheap rate from the refiners who are at no expence in making it but that of the chalk and labour the manner in which it may be best done by them is as follows take any quantity of chalk and having rendered it sufficiently sine by washiing over carefully add it gra- dually to the solution of copper so long as any change appears to be produced by it from the ebullition excited or the due proportion may be perceived by the fluid losing its green tinge and becoming colourless let it then stand at rest till the sediment be subsided and pour off the clear part of the fluid from the powder adding in it its place clean water which must be several times renewed till the salts be entirely washed out the sediment which is the verditer must be afterwards freed from the sluid by siltering through paper covered with cloth and laid out in lumps of middling size to dry those who desire to make verditer themselves may prepare the solution of copper by adding copper filings gradually to aquafortis of any kind or putting plates of copper in it and then proceeding as is above directed for the refiner ’ solution bleu de cendres or sanders blue lf enquiry is made at the colour shops for this article nothing is to be found under the name but common ver- diter or à species of it where the precipitation of the copper appears to be made in part upon starch as well as chalk it may be prepared as sollows take of the refiners solution of copper made in the precipitation of silver from the spirit of nitre or dissolve copper in spirit of nitre or aquafortis by throwing in filings or putting in slips of copper gradually till all effervescence cease add to it of strach finely powdered the proportion of one fifth or sixth of the weight of the copper dissolved make then solution of pearl afhies and filter it and put gradually to the solution of copper as

manner directed for lake and when it is so well drained of water by means of filter as to be of proper consistence grind the whole well together and lay it out to dry indigo this was formerly almost the only blue colour used in painting it is made in the spanishi west-indies by means of putrefaction from certain plants and coagulation by the air it can not as far as is hitherto known be prepared in these colder climatés on account of the tender nature of the lants which produce it the indigo brought from the french or our own plantations is foul and greatly inferior in brightnefs to that formerly imported hither from the spaniards it being equal to the prussian blue sor some pur- poses and there is no other preparation necessary to using it in painting except perfect levigation smalt smalt is made from glafs ground to powder and colour- ed with zaffer or prepared from fluxing to the proportion of glass one seventh part of zaffer or more or lefs accord¬ ing to the degree of deepnefs required it will not work with either brushi or pencil but by strewing it upon any ground of oil-paint while wet it makes bright blue shining furface proper for large sun-dials and other such applica- tions in enamel-painting and in painting on glafs it is of great use bice at present several compositions of indigo and verditer with chalk and other cheap substances are sold in this name but the true kind is smalt reduced to fine powder by levigation from its unfuitable texture it is now greatly disused or it makes light warm blue colour and was formerly used in oil but more frequently in water- colours litmus or latmus water painting is the only kind in which this can be used and as it is brought from holland at very cheap rate it were almost needless to give the preparation but if any are desirous for curiosity to know the process it is formed from archal species of mofs brought from the canary and cape de verd islands and prepared as follows add quick line and putrified urine or spirit of urine distilled from lime to the archal previoussy bruised by grinding this mixture must be susfered to stand till it acquires very blue colour after which the fluid must be suffered to evaporate and the remaining mafs when it is of the consistence of paste must be laid on boards to dry in square lumps if it is used in miniature paintings care must be taken of the approach of acid sor that changes it instantly from blue to red though it will stand if no such accident in¬ tervene class iil of yellow colours king ’ yellow when prepared well which must be done by mixing sulphur and arsenic by sublimation is an extremely bright colour and true yellow but when mixed with white lead and several other pigments its colour flies or changes this defect joined to its nauseous smell and the notion of its being strong poison renders it unpleasing and causes it to be rejected by many never- thelefs it may be used on many occasions with great ad- vantage not only as yellow but by mixing it with blue pigments and forming green king ’ yellow is prepared as follows ei take of arsenic powdered and flowers of sulphur in the proportion of twenty of the first to one of the yellow class iii common orpiment king ’ yellow gall stones naples yellow terra di sienna unburnt yellow oker turpeth mieral dutch pink yellow berry wasni english pink light pink turmeric washi

which must be carefully separated from any caput mortuum or foul parts that may be found in the glafs with it it must be afterwards reduced to an equal powder by levigation yellow the neighbourhood of naples is said to produce this pigment naturally of the truth of this we are dubious but certain that it is brought from abroad it is yellow rather inelining to the orange seldom used but in oil painting where it is generally found to stand well it is brighter than other yellows at present in use except the king ’ yellow but if it touch iron along with the least watry moisture it will be changed by it for which reason care should be taken to employ an ivory spatula instead of pallet knife during the grinding of it with oil which is the only preparation practised on it as it does not well bear levigation with water yellow oker the substance of this is mineral earth sound in dif- ferent places of various degrees of purity there is no other preparation necessary but levigation and freeing it properly from dirt and other matter it is valuable colour being true yellow that will not sly in the least and its texture fuits it for all kinds of painting notwitli- standing its utility it ought to he of low price dutch pink as this colour will not bear well to be worked in oil nor can be depended upon with regard to its standing it is used principally for coarser purposes in water and is some- times prepared in the same manner with starch and white lead but the following preparation is very cheap and easy and makes it to perfection take of french berries one pound and of turmeric root powdered four ounces boil them in gallon of water two hours and then strain off the tincture through flannel and boil it again with an ounce of alum till it be evaporated to one quart prepare in the mean time four pounds of chalk by washiing it over and afterwards drying it and mix the chalk with the tincture by grind- ing them together and then lay out the dutch pink thus made to dry on boards as it should be full gold coloured yellow and very bright any adulteration may be discovered by the eyer english pink prepare this in the same manner and with the same in¬ gredients as the dutch only increasing the quantity of chalk to render it of an inferior quality it being the same only lighter and coarser light pink the only kind fit for use in oil painting is prepared in the following manner take of french berries one pound boil them with gallon of water for an hour and having strained off acid of sugar poured on dissolution of martial vitriol produces yellow precipitate superior to dutch pink the fluid add to it two pounds of pearl affies dissolved and purified by filtering through paper precipitate with alum dissolved in waten by adding the solution gradually so long as any ebullition shall appear to be raised in the mixture when the sediment has thorough- ly subsided pour off the water from it and wash it with several renewed quantities of water proceeding as has been before directed in the case of the lake drain off « the remaining fluid in filter with paper covered with linen cloth and lastly dry it on boards in small square pieces gamboge no yellow is of greater service in water colours eafily dissolving to milky consistence from the state in which it arrives it is gum produced in the east indies and nothing but the addition of water is wanting to prepare it for use masticot as this is not very bright colour it is little used or it will stand persectly in oil or in water it works with the pencil better than most other pigments and certainly might be made very useful by putting slake white or white lead on an earthen or stone dissi before à strong fire and con¬ tinuing it there till the colour be sufficiently yellow the calcination being finished the parts which are of the desired tint must be picked out from the rest and put together for with the greatest care it is difficult to caleine the whole equally grinding with oil is the only preparation ne- cessary to the using of it common orpiment it is generally disagreeable to meddle with this on account of its nauseous smell and poisonous quality being fossil body composed of arsenic and sulphur with mix¬ ture frequently of lead and sometimes other metals in its unrefined state it is only useful to colour the matted bot- toms of chairs or other coarse work but if purified by sublimation it becomes king ’ yellow gall stones the real kind are found in the gall bladder or like ducts of beasts and require nothing more than rubbing with water as gamboge to dissolve them to dark warm yellow but as these are not always to be procured fictitious kind of equal service may be made as follows take quart of the bile of oxen as freshi as possible put it into properpewter vessel and set it to boil in balneo mariæ having added to it quarter of an ounce of clear gum arabic evaporate the whole to about an eighth and then remove it into china cup or bason of proper size and evaporate it to dryness collecting it into mass as it becomes of stiff consistence ’ terra di sienna unburnt mention has been made of this pigment being native ochrous earth brought from italy that calcination changes it from yellow to red therefore those that choose to use it as yellow should take care to have it extremely well levigated as it will serve for deeper shade by many de- grees than any of the other okers and of superior bright- ness turpeth mineral this for use is much such another colour in yellow as vermillion in red and will stand equally well with that oil of vitriol and is much brighter than any other yellow used in oil except king ’ yellow the preparation take of pure quicksilver and oil of vitriol each six pounds put them into à retort to which being placed in fand bath fit on receiver and distil them with strong fire while any fumes appear to rise into the ce receiver urging it at last with as great heat as the furnace will bear when the retort is again cold re- move it out of the sand bathi and having broken it take the white mafs which will be found at the bottom of it and break it to grofs powder and having put it in glass mortar pour water on it which will immediately convert it to yellow colour let it next be thoroughly ground in this mortar with water and afterwards washed with several successive quantities it must then be thoroughly well levigated on stone and dried the yellow wash from the french berries take pound of the french berries and put to them gallon of water with half an ounce of alum boil them an hour in pewter vessel and then filter off the sluid through paper if it be designed for nicer purposes or flannel for more ordinary put them again into the boiler and evaporate the fluid till the colour appears of the strength desired or part may be taken out while less strong and the rest evaporated to proper body it may be used in water as washing colour and is ap- plicable to many material purposes as it may be made of al- most any degree of deepness turmeric wash the gum made from the turmeric-root dissolved in water serves for the same purposes of the yellow-berry-wasn but to procure bright tincture it must be dissolved in spirit of wine instead of water by the following method take two ounces of proof spirit and add to it one ounce of water being put into proper phial add two drams of turmeric root in powder shake them well to- gether and then let them stand three or four days re- eating the shaking as often as convenient and strong tincture will be thus obtained tincture of saffron it makes good shade for gamboge or other light bright yellows by pouring hot water on the best englisn saffron in proper phial or other vessel which should be placed for some time in heat next to that which would make water boil and the tincture should then be siltered from the dregs through piece of linen cloth zedoary wash. take an ounce of zedoary-root and boil it in quart of water till the water appears sufficiently tinged to yellow strain it through linen and it will be à stronger colour than can be made of turmeric without spirits of wine and is va- luable for many purposes in painting with water colours as flowers yellow draperies class iv of green colours verdigrise let the pulp of grapes or any such acid remain upon cop¬ per and the rust formed by its corro sive action is verdi- grise it is brought from france and italy hither and makes blue-green colour in paint but will not stand in oil it should have small admixture of yellow to render it true green chrystals of verdigrise called distilled verdigrise take of the best verdigrise four ounces and of dis- tilled vinegar two quarts the verdigrise being well pounded let them be put into circulating vessel that may be formed of mattrafs which is round bodied glass with long straight neck and florence flafk which must have its neck inverted into the mattrafs the thick end being broken off this circulating vessel must be placed in gentle sand-heat or other warm situation where it must continue being frequently shaken till the vinegar has dissolved as much as it can of the verdigrise remove the verdigrise and vinegar

only not so bright nor will it stand so well yet it might be of advantage in many kinds of paint- ing to make it proceed in all points as in the process given for the prussian blue till the solution of alum and vitriol be¬ mixed with that of the pearl-ashies and sulphur of the coal and the green precipitation made then instead of adding the spirit of salt omit any further mixture and go on to

into water in the proportion of two pounds to gallon and boil them half an hour then after the fluid has stood some little time to settle but while yet hot pour off the clearer part from the earthy sediment at the bottom and if on standing longer it form another earthy sediment repeat the same method but this should be done only while the fluid remains hot evaporate then the sluid to dryness and what remains will be good bistre if the foot was of proper kind brown oker after procuring this substance of fossil earth from the co¬ lourmen which may be done at very low price care should be taken

occasions it to be much used in making drying oils japanner ’ gold size and the black oil lacker in painting some sew use it with wa¬ ter but before it is fit for that purpose it should be burnt

as the fraud will appear by the difference of the weight but to prove it more exactly use the following means take an ounce of the white lead suspected and mix it well with about half an ounce of pearl affies or of any fixed alkaline salt and about quarter of an ounce of charcoal dust and having put them into crucible give them strong heat the lead will by this means be re- duced to its metallic state and being weighed will shew by what it may fall short of the weight of an ounce the proportion of the adulteration about à tenth part being allowed for the corroding acid which formed

persons who are accustomed to paint in oils generally purchase their colours ready prepared in bladders compleat set of which with pallette and requisites for painting may be procured at the colour-shops compleat sets of water-colours are also sold in boxes with peneils for miniature painting drawing the price from eight shillings to three guineas as the oil colours prepared in bladders if they are kept long become useless and as those who are not professed artists seldom paint so much as to use them without great waste it became à desideratum that some method should be found to render them more durable -this mr. blackmen has accomplished and at the same time has made them portable that they can be used with equal ease with the common water-colour cakes we give the method of preparing them from vol xii of the transactions of the society for the encouragement of arts manufactures and commerce method of preparing blackmans oil-colour cakes take of the clearest gum mastick reduced to fine powder four ounces of spirit of turpentine one pint mix them together in bottle stirring them frequently till the mastick is dissolved if it is wanted in haste some heat may be applied but the solution is best when made cold let the colours to be made use of be the best that can be procured taking care that by washing they are brought to the greatest degree of finenefs possible when the colours are dry grind them on hard close stone porphyry is the best in spirit of turpentine adding small quantity of the mastick varnissi let the colours so ground become again dry then prepare the composition for forming them into cakes in the following manner procure some of the purest and whitest spermaceti you can obtain melt it over gentle fire in clean earthen vessel when fluid add to it one third of its weight of pure poppy oil and stir the whole well together these things being in readiness place the stone on which your colours were ground on frame or support and by means of charcoal fire under it make the stone warin next grind your colour sine with muller then adding à sufficient quan¬ tity of the mixture of poppy oil and spermaceti work the whole together with the muller to proper consistence take then piece of fit size for the cake you intend to make roll it into ball putit into mould press it and it will be complete when these cakes are to be used they must be rubbed down in poppy or other oil or in mixture of spirit of turpentine and oil as may best suit the convenience or intention of the artist of painting painting is the art of representing to the eyes by means of figures and colours every object in nature that is discernable by the sight and of expressing the various emotions of the mind by an admirable effort of human genius it offers to our vision every thing which is most valuable in the universe its empire extends over every age and country it presents to us the heroic deeds of ancient times as well as those with which we are more conversant and distant objects equally with those we daily see in this respect it may be considered as supplement to nature which gives us only view of present objects the painter who is distinguished for noble and profound concentions who conveys to the spectators the sentiments with which he is himself inspired who animates them with his genius and makes lasting impression on their minds this artist is poet and worthy to share in the glories of homer but if he seek only to please or astonisn by the illusion of colours he must rest contented with the secondary merit of flattering the eye with variety of tints or making an industrious assemblage of multiplicity of objects the poet or the painter who excel in their profefsions deserve all the respect due to genius they are of the number of those men whom nature sparing of her best gifts grants but occasionally to the inhabitants of the earth if they are sublime they elevate the human race if tney are agreeable only they excite those sweet sensations necessary to our happiness of the schools school in the sine arts denominates class of artists who have learned their art from certain master either by receiving his instructions or studying his works all the painters which europe has produced since the renovation of the arts are classed under the following schools the school of florence of rome of venice the lombard french german flemisn dutch and englisn schools the school of florence is remarkable for greatnefs for attitudes seemingly in motion for à certain dark severity for an expression of strength by which grace is perhaps excluded and for character of design approaching to the gigantic it can not be denied that the productions of this school although overcharged possess an ideal majesty which elevates human nature above mortality the tuscan artists satisfied with commanding admiration seem to have considered the art of pleasing as beneath their notice cimabue noble florentine born in the year the first who after the destruction of the roman empire practised the art of painting which he learned from some greek workmen who were employed by the tuscan government his pictures were as may be ima¬ gined in an ordinary stile but they received the applause of his countrymen so little practised was he in his art that in his pictures to prevent the possibility of mistake in the judgment of the spectator respecting the subject inscriptions were added with sentences coming out of the mouths of the persons represented in them to cimabue succeeded giotto his disciple who when shepherd ’ boy was found by him drawing the figure of shieep upon stone he soon become more celebrated than his master and is accounted one of the founders of the florentine school from this time the number of artists encreased so rapidly that in they established society under the protection of st. luke towards the commencement of the sisteenth century the works of the florentines possessed something of gran- deur life and expression and massacio is mentioned as the first who gave force and relief to his pictures but michael angelo and leonardo de vinci were the glory of the school of florence the former superior in grandeur in boldness of conception and knowledge of design the latter in all the amiable parts of the art leonardo pos¬ sessed of fine imagination and full of sensibility devoted himself in painting to express the affections of the soul and if in this sublime branch of the art he was afterwards surpassed by raphael he had at least the glory not only of surpassing all the painters who went before him but of pursuing path which none of them had attempted mi- chael angelo lefs formed to experience sweet affections than violent pafsions sought in nature what the strength of man might accomplisn not that which constitutes beauty better acquainted with anatomy than any other artist he seems too eager to display his knowledge of it and to have forgotten that the muscles are less visible in children females and young men than in confirmed and vigorous manhood you never perceive says mengs muscle at rest and although he knew admirably well how to place them their action is very frequently inconsistent with their situation he never says sir joshua reynolds attempted the lesser elegances and graces of the art and if any man had right to look down upon the lower accom- plishiments as beneath his attention it was certainly michael angelo artist ’ assistant roman school has exceeded every other in beauty of form grandeur stile and just exprefsion this is to be attributed to the superior advantages they enjoyed in having access to those precious remains of ancient art which rome in its prosperity drew from declining greece or which were executed in its own bosom by grecian artists this school was altogether devoted to the principal parts of the art to those which require genius and vast conceptions and was no farther occupied with colours than was necessary to establisn difference between painting and sculpture or rather between painting varied with colours and claro obscuro at the head of this school is placed raphael sanzio born at urbino in the early part of his lise he had accustomed hiinself to copy nature with great exactness but without being solicit- ous about the choice or perhaps ignorant that any choice was necessary when he saw the works of leonardo de vinci and michael angelo they gave to his genius new direction he perceived that there was something more in the art of painting than simple imitation of truth but the works of those masters were not sufficient to enable him to make the best choice and he continued in uncertainty till he saw at rome the works of the ancients then he perceived that in imitating them he had only to follow the natural impulse of his genius his design is admirable-he excelled in representing the character of philosophers apostles and other figures of that kind the greeks were superior to him in ideal figures but if he did not succeed in embellishing nature in the same high degree he saw at least and imitated her in whatever was expressive and beautiful the greeks says mengs sailed with majesty between earth and heaven raphael walked with propriety on the earth composition is in general says the same authorl of two kinds raphael ’ is the expressive kind the other the- atrical or picturesque which consists of an agreeable dispo- sition of the figures lanfranc was the inventor of the last and after him pietro de cortona the preference is given to raphael because reason presides over all his works or at least the greatest part of them he never allowed himself in common ideas nor ever sussered his accessary figures to turn the attention from the principal object of the piece the excellency of raphael says sir oshua reynolds lay in the propriety beauty and majesty of his characters his judicious contrivance of composition correctness of drawing purity of taste and the skilful accommodation of other men ’ conceptions to his own purpose the school of venice is the child of nature the venetian painters not having under their eyes like the romans the remains of antiquity were destitute of the means of forming just idea of the beauty of forms and of expression they copied without choice the forms of nature but were chiefly delighted with the beauties which presented themselves in the mixture and variety of colours colouring was their chief object and they endeavoured by the agreement and opposition of colours and by the contrast of light and shade to produce à vigor- ous effect to demand and fix the attention in this they succeeded dominico who was the second italian artist who painted in oil had educated before he quitted venice giacomo bellino who had two sons gentile and giovanni both of whom were painters the latter contributed much to the progress of his art in painting constantly in oil and after nature giorgione and titian his scholars are considered as the founders of the venetian school giorgione distinguished himself by better taste in de- signing than his master but he chiessy surpassed hiin in colouring he died in his zad year tiziano vecelli better known by the name of titian was instructed in the school of bellino to copy nature in the most servile manner but when he had seen the works of giorgione he began to study the ideal in colouring the truth of history is not to be expected in hipniings or in those of the artists of the same school he paig little attention to the consistance of scene to the costume to expression adapted to the subject or finally to the accom¬ modation of parts which characterise the works of those who have studied the ancients the artists of the florentine and roman schools painted most commonly in water-colours or in fresco and instead of nature they finished their work from their sirst sketches titian painted in oil and finisned from the objects in nature and this practice joined to his exquisite talents gave the greatest truth to his colours his being portrait painter was also of advantage to him as colourist in this department he was accustomed to the colours of nature in carnations and draperies he was landfkape painter and here he also took the colours from nature titian has in general little expression in his pictures and he sometimes introduces figures which augment the coldness of the piece for if it be true that heads even in historical painting ought to be studied from nature it is true also that individual nature should not be presented but one general and ideal the painter fails in the effect which he ought to produce if when he represents achilles hector and cæsar his personages are familiar to our obser- vation the distinguishing characteristies of the lombard school are grace an agreeable taste for design without great cor- rection mellowness of pencil and beautisul mixture of colours antonio allegri called corregio was the father and greatest ornament of this school he began by imitating nature alone but as he was chiefly delighted with the graceful he was careful to purisy his design -he made his figures elegant and large and varied his outlines by fre- quent undulations but he was not always pure and correct corregio painted in oil kind of painting susceptible of the greatest delicacy and sweetnefs and as his character led him to cultivate the agreeable he gave pleasing cap- tivating tone to all his pictures he sought transparent colours to represent shades conformable to nature and adopted manner of glazing which actually rendered his shadows more obscure it is chiesly in this that he deserves to be imitated for his lights are too clear and somewhat heavy and his fleshy parts are not sufficiently transparent harmony and grace are connected together and on this account corregio is excellent also in harmony as the delicacy of his taste suffered him not to employ strong oppositions he naturally became great master in this part which chiesly consists of easy gradations from one extreme to another delicate taste in colours perfect knowledge of the claro obscuro the art of uniting light to light and shade to snade together with that of de- taching objects from the ground inimitable grave and perfect harmony were the qualities which distinguished corregio from all painters and placed him near the head of his profefsion the carracci lewis augustin and hannibal formed what is called the second lombard school which is fre- quently distinguished by the name of the school of bologna lewis was the master of the other two he had studied the works of titian and paolo veronese of andrea del sarto of corregio and of julio romano but he chiesly endea voured to imitate the manner of corregio hannibal sluctuated between corregio and titian augustin their rival in painting had his mind cultivated by learning and devoted part of his time to poetry music and other many exercises these three painters often employed their talents upon the same work and their united labours seemed to be animated with the same spirit they established an academy at bologna called ’ academia degli desiderosi but it was afterwards known by the name of the academy of the carracci in this school was taught the art of constructing models perspective and anatomy lessons were given on the beautiful proportions of nature on the best manner of using colours and on the principles of light and snade the academy separated on hannibal ’ going to rome to adorn the gallery of the cardinal farnese the works of the carraci are often from the resemblance of their manner confounded together nevertheless each of them has decided character distinct from the other two lewis had less fire but more grace and grandeur augustin had more spirit in his conception and more pleasantness in his execution hannibal is characterized by boldness by design more profound by an exprefsion more lucky and by an execution more solid lodovico carracci says sir joshina reynolds appears to me to approach nearest to perfection his unaffected breadth of light and shadow the simplicity of colouring which holding its proper rank does not draw aside the least part of the attention from the subject and the solemn essect of that twilight which seems diffused over hie pictures appears to me to correspond with grave and dignified subjects better than the more artificial brilliancy of sunshine which en¬ lightens the pictures of titian hannibal is esteemed by the best judges as model for beauty and design those who blame him for becoming less colourist at rome than he was at bologna ought to recollect that it is his performances at rome which have chiefly secured his reputation severe critics have maintained that his design is too little vaired in the figures that he excels only in male beauty and that in imitating ancient statues he excites some resemblance but without arriving at that sublimity of ideas and of stile which cha¬ racterise the ancients the success of hannibal and the reputation which he acquired have been pernicious to the art his successors deluded by these considerations have made him the object of their imitation without ascending to the sources from which he derived his knowledge and which they never could equal the result has been that instead of be¬ coming equal to hannibal they have often copied his imperfections the french school has varied so much under different masters that it is difficult to characterise it some of its artists have been formed on the florentine and lombard manner others on the roman others on the venetian and few have distinguisned themselves by manner which may be called their own in speaking in general terms of this school it appears to have no peculiar character and it can only be distinguishied by its aptitude to imitate easily any impression and it may be added speaking still in general terms that it unites in moderate degree the different parts of the art without excelling in any one of them it is equally dissicult to determine the progress of painting in france miniature painting and painting on glafs were early cultivated in that country and in these two kinds the italians had often recourse to french artists cousin painter on glafs and portrait painter was the first who establishied any kind of reputation in france he was correct but possessed very little elegance of design painting for some time encouraged by francis the first fell into state of languor from which it was not recovered till the reign of louis xiii jaques blanchard formed in the venetian school and called the french titian flourissi- ed about this period but as he left no pupils to perpetuate his manner he must be regarded as à single good artist and not as à founder of the french school in the same manner poussin whom they call the raphael of france educated no pupils and formed no school his stile and manner of painting are described by sir joshua reynolds as simple careful pure and correct no works of any modern have so much the air of antique painting as those of poussin his best performances have certain dryness of manner which seems perfectly correspondent to that ancient simplicity which distinguisn his stile in the latter part of his lise he changed from this manner into one much soster and richer where there is greater union between the figures and the ground his favorite subjects were ancient fables and no painter was ever better quali¬ fied to paint such subjects as he was eminenily fkilled in the knowledge of the ceremonies customs and habits of the ancients and well acquainted with the different cha¬ racters which those who invented them gave their allegorical figures poussin more admired than imitated had no manner of insluence in forming the french school simon vouet had this honour because his pupils in the happy age of the arts in france conferred on it the greatest splendour vouet was man of distinguished abilities but the school which he erected would have had no continuance if his scholars had pursued his manner of painting he had kind of grandeur and facility but his design was false with regard to colours and without any idea of exprefsion he had the merit of destroying the insipid taste which reigned in france and pointing the way to better if vouet laid the foundation of the french school le brun finishied the edifice he had noble conception and fruitful imagination on no occasion was he inferior to the vast compositions he undertook few painters have united greater number of essential qualities and access- ories of the art —-he drew well but his design was far from being so elegant as that of raphael or so pure as that of domenichino and it was less lively than that of hannibal carracci whom he had taken as model in drapery he followed the roman school but in this part he was not equal to the painter of urbino he had studied the expression of the affections of the soul but after observing the general characters and establishing the prin- cipal traits of expression he thought he had reached the whole extent of this subject which is so infinitely extended he was delighted with great compositions and he gave them life animation and variety but he wanted the vigour and inspiration of raphael his compositions are founded on philosophical principles but those of raphael are created le brun thought well raphael poussin and le sueur thought most profoundly le brun had eleva- tion but he was not elevated like raphael to the sublime in colouring le brun did not follow the painters of the venetian school the sweet attractions and strong and solid colours of the schools of rome and lombardy seem rather to have been the object of his imitation and from them also he learned an easy agreeable and bold manage¬ ment of the pencil eustach le sueur was the cotemporary and rival of le brun and no painter approached nearer to raphael in the art of drapery or in disposing the solds in the most artful and the noblest manner his design was in general more slender than that of raphael but like his it was form- ed on the model of the ancients like raphael he re- presented with art and precision the affections of the soul like him he varied the air of the head according to the condition the age and the character of his personages and like him he made the different parts of every figure contribute to the general effect his intention in compos¬ ing was to express his subject not to make shining con¬ trasts or beautiful groups of figures not to astonish and bewitch the spectator by the deceitsul pomp of theatrical scene or the splendour of the great machine his tones are delicate his tints harmonious and his colours though not so attractive as those of the schools of venice and flanders are yet engaging they steal peaceably on the soul and fix it without distraction on the parts of the art superior to that of colouring if le sueur had lived longer or if like le brun he had been employed under court fond of the arts and of learning to execute the great works of the age the french school would have adopted à disserent and better manner the noble heauty of his heads the simple majesty of his draperies the lightness of his design the propriety of his expreffion and attitudes and the simplicity of his general disposition would have formed the character of this school the deceitful pomp of theatrical decoration would have been more lately introduced or perhaps would never have appeared and paris might have been the counter part to rome but as le brun by an accidental concurrence of favour- able circumstances was the faffiionable painter to be em¬ ployed or rewarded it was necessary to imitate his manner and as his imitators possessed not his genius his faults be¬ came not only current but more deformed the french school not long ago changed its principles and if they follow the road which they have marked out for themselves they have the chance of becoming the most riged observers of the laws imposed on the greek artists the count de caylus pupil of buchardon who by his rank and fortune had the means of encouraging the imitators of the ancients and of the masters of the i century first sormed the design of restoring pure taste to the art of painting he was seconded by the talents of vien an artist who had only occaston to have his lessons and his example laid before him in this manner commenced revolution so much the more wonderful as it was scarcely ever known that any nation substituted system of simple and rigid excellence in place of à salse and glittering taste the history of all nations on the contrary discovers à gradual progrefs froin à rude beginning to perfection and afterwards to an ir- remediable decay the french have the prospect of stopping short in this ordinary course they have begun in manner which promises success and the best consequences may be expected from the study of those master pieces of ancient art with which the capital the of french republic is ornamented and which to the honour of the government are open to the inspection of every one it is almost need- less to mention that these invaluable works are the most capital productions of art which were formerly at florence rome turin naples and the cities in the austrian netherlands in germany there can hardly he said to be school as it is continuation of single artists who derived their manner from different sources of originality and imitation there were some german painters of eminence when the art emerging from its barbarous state first began to be cultivated in europe as they were totally unacquainted with the ancients and had scarcely access to the works of their contemporaries in italy they copied nature alone with the exception of somewhat of that stisfness which forms the gothic manner but this is by no means the case with their successors part of whom were educated in flanders and part in italy for if mengst or deitrich were com- prehended in this school there would be nothing peculiar to its manner discovered in their works it is therefore necessary to confine our observations to the more ancient german painters in whom the gothic stile is conspicuous albert durer was the first german who corrected the bad taste of his countrymen he excelled in engraving as well as painting his genius was fertile his compositions varied his thoughts ingenious and his colours brilliant his works though numerous were finished with great exact- ness but as he owed every thing to his genius and as works of inferior merit were by the salse taste of the times preferred to his it was impossible for him altogether to avoid antonio raphael mengs was born at ausig in bohemia his first patron was augustus id king of poland and his last and most generous was charles king of spain his grand work was the apotheosis of st. eusebius at rome andhis most beautiful picture that of the nativity at madrid there was à great rivalsnip existing between reynolds and mengs who possessed little original genius and was scrupuluus if not servile copyist he was coldly correct and the greater plagiary in the chamber of painters at florence are the portraits of mengs and reynolds by themselves strongly characterised by the dignified but sullen air of the one and the universal in telligence and liberality of the other the faults of his predecessors he is blamed for stiffnefs and aridity in his outlines sor little taste or grandeur in his expression for ignorance of the costume of ærial per- spective and of gradation of colours but he had studied lineal perspective architecture and fortification john holbein nearly cotemporary with albert durer painted in oil and water-colours he excelled chiesly in history and in portrait painting his colours are fresni and brilliant and his works highly finishied but in his historical subjects his draperies are not in so good taste as those of albert durer the flemish school is recommended to the lovers of the art by the discovery or at least the first practice of oil painting it has been generally attributed to john van eyck who was accustomed to varnisn his distemper pictures with composition of oils which was pleasing on account of the lustre it gave them in the course of his practice he came to mix his colours with oil instead of water which he found rendered them brilliant without the trouble of varnishing from this and subsequent experiments arose the art of painting in oils of which wonderful dis- covery van mandes gives à very particular account but the truth of it is now very much questioned and it is even proved that this method of painting was discovered long besore the time of jolin van eyck it is admitted that joln and his brother eubert were the sirst who brought it into general practice by shewing the excellence of which it was susceptible their own paintings having acquired all over europe great reputation for the softnefs and delicaey of their colours the attention of the italian painters was soon excited and antonio de massina persormed à journey into flanders sor the express purpose of acquiring the con¬ sidence of john van eyck and of discovering the secret john of bruges was the sounder of painting as profeffion in flanders peter paul rubens was the founder of the art this extraordinary person produced an im- mense number of works he excelled equally in historical ortrait and landskape painting in fruits flowers and in animals he invented and executed with the greatest facility the works of rubens were destitute of that soft inspiration productive of sweet and pleasant effects so con¬ spicuous in the works of raphael but he possessed that prightlinefs of genius and strength of mind which are ever ready to burst forth in wonderful and astonishing effects his figures appear to be the exact counterpart of his conceptions and their creation nothing more than simple act of the will his chief merit consists in colour- ing though in this branch of the art he has not equalled titian he is the first among painters eminent for pomp and majesty the first among those who spedk to the eye and the power of the art is often by him carried almost to enchantment rubens says sir joshiua reynolds is remarkable in¬ stance of the same mind being seen in all the various parts of the art the whole is so much of piece that one can fcarce be brought to believe but that if any one of them had been more correct and perfect his works would not be so compleat as they appear if we should allow greater urity and correctuess of drawing his want of simplicity in composition colouring and drapery would appear more grofs the flemisn school of which rubens is the greatest master is remarkable for great brilliancy of colours and the magie of the claro obscuro to these may be joined prosound design which is yet not founded on the most beautiful forms composition possessed of grandeur certain air of noblenefs in the figures strong and natural exprefsions in short kind of national beauty which is neither copied from the ancients nor from the roman or lombard schools but which deserves to please and is capable of pleasing to speak in general terms and without regarding great number of exceptions the dutch school carries none of the above qualities to great perfection except that of colouring far from excelling in the beauty of heads and forms they seem to delight in the exact imitation of the lowest and most ignoble their subjects are derived from the tavern the smith ’ shop and from the vulgar amusements of the rudest peasants the exprefsions are sufficiently marked but it is the expression of passions which debase instead of ennobling human nature it must be acknowledged at the same time that the dutch painters have succeeded in several branches of the art if they have chosen low objects of imitation they have represented them with great exactness and truth must always please if they have not succeeded in the most difficult parts of the claro obscuro they at least excel in the most striking such as is in light confined in narrow space night illuminated by the moon or by torches and the light of smith ’ sorge the dutch understand the gradations of colours they have no rivals in landskape painting considered as the faithful representation of particular scene but they are far from equalling titian poussin claude lorrain who have carried to the greatest perfection the ideal landskape and whose pictures instead of being the topographical representation of certain places are the combined result of every thing beautiful in their imagination or in nature the dutch distinguisn in so great estimation are some of the landskapes by this master that two pictures known by the name of the altiere claudes from their having been long in the altiere palace at rome were lately purchased by mr. beckford for the almost incredible sum of zooo guineas themselves by their perspective by their clouds sea scenes animals fruits slowers and infects and they excel in miniature painting in short every thing which requires faithful imitation colour and à nice pencil is well exe- cuted by the dutch painters holland has also produced history painters as octavius van been and vander hilst the rival of vandyke but it is not in the works of these artists that we find the character of the dutch school neither is the origin of their style to be derived from the the works of lucas of leyden though from the time he flourished viz about the end of the fifteenth century he may be considered as the patriarch of the dutch school lucas painted in oil in water-colours and on glass and the kinds of his painting were history landfkape and portrait if miniature painting be considered as character of the dutch school cornelius polembourg may be regarded as the father of it he possessed the colour delicacy of touch and disposition of the claro obscuro which chiesly distin- guish this school and if any thing is to be added it is want of correctness in his design but if the choice of low figures is its chief characteristic this is to be found in the greatest perfection in the works of the celebrated rembrandt vanryn and it is the more offensive in this artist as his compositions frequently re- quired an opposite choice of figures as his father was miller near leyden his education must altogether have depended on the exertion of great talents and the study of nature he studied the grotesque figure of dutch peasant or the servant of an inn with as much application as the greatest masters of italy would have studied the apollo of belvidere or the venus de medicis this was not the manner of elevating himself to the noble conceptions of raphael but it was acquiring the imitation of truth in vulgar painting rembrandt says mr. descamps may be compared to the great artists for colour delicacy of touch and claro obscuro he delighted in great oppositions of light and shade and he seems to be chiesly attentive to this branch of the art his workshop was occasionally made dark and he received the light by hole which fell as he chose to direct it on the place which he desired to be enlightened his painting is à kind of magie no artist knew better the effects of different colours mingled together nor could better distin- guisn those which did not agree from those which did he placed every tone in its situation with so much exactness and harmony that he needed not to mix them and so destroy what may be called the slower and fresnness of the colours such is the power of genius that rembrandt with all his faults and they are enormous is placed among the greatest artists by mr. descamps who had attentively exa- mined his works and was himself an artist john de laer miniature painter and who made choice of his subjects from common life deserves à distin- guished place in the dutch school he painted hunting- scenes the attacks of robbers public festivals landikapes and sea views he had correct design and employed vigorous and lively colouring van-ostade although born at lubeck gerrard dow metzu miris wouvermans berghem and the celebrated painter of slowers van huysum belong to the dutch school the greater part of the schools of which we have treated have no longer any existence italy alone had four schools and there only remain at present à very sew italian artists known to foreigners the school of rubens is in vain sought for in flanders if the dutch school still exists it is not known beyond the precincts of holland mengs german artist has rendered himself famous in our days but it was in italy that he chiefly improved his talents and exercised his art dietrich another german has made himself known to strangers but two solitary artists do not form school the englisn school has been formed in our own times it is connected with the royal academy in london insti- tuted in but although as school it did not exist before that time yet ever since the revival of the arts and the consequent encouragement given to them by the fovereigns of europe england has possessed portrait painters of ability and perhaps it has been owing only to the re- markable partiality of the nation for this branch of the art that the more noble one of history painting has been neglected hans holbein is ranked by du piles among the german painters yet he painted his most celebrated works in england he was the first painter of eminence encouraged by henry the eighth who excited by the fame which his cotemporaries francis and charles had gained as pa¬ trons of the arts employed him and invited titian to eng- land but merely as portrait painter -- whether the reward offered was not thought adequate to his merit or for some other cause perhaps the knowledge that his talents for historical design would be depreciated he firmly re- jected the overture the public works of holbein in england are four only as enumerated by mr. walpole which are rather groups of portraits than history nothing could be more unsavourable to female beauty than the dress of those times holbein ’ men are there- fore much more characteristic than his ladies even his anna bulleyne is deficient in loveliness as he pourtrayed her in his likeness of anne of cleves he is said to have sacrificed truth to slattery yet the original which is in the possession of mr. barret of lee in kent is below mediocrity there are in his majesty ’ collection feries of portraits of persons of quality in the reign of henry the eighth sketched upon paper with crayons probably taken al single sitting they have lately been engraved by bartolozzi with all the strength and spirit of the originals holbein was as celebrated in miniature as in oil colours he made great number of designs for engravers sculp- tors and jewellers he died at his residence at white- hall in those lodgings which were afterwards the paper- offices the fame of lsaac oliver who flourished about the latter end of the reign of elizabeth as miniature painter is well known he received some instructions from fre- derico zucchero who was in england at that time where among other portraits he painted that of the unfortunate mary queen of scots oliver drew well and made some admirable copies from the italian masters greatly as lsaac was celebrated he was afterwards exceeded by his son peter who drew portraits of king james the first prince henry prince charles and most of the court about this period cornelius janson fkilful portrait painter came to england from amsterdam and painted the king and many of the nobility but his merits being eclipsed by vandyke of whom he was jealous and the civil war breaking out he fled from england cornelius janson was remarkable for high finisning in his draperies many of which are black which seems to add roundness relief and spirit to his figures and carnations he is said to have used ultra marine in the black colours as well as in the carnations to which may be attributed their lustre even at this day the duke of beaufort has capital portrait of janson by himself but one of his best perform- ances is the rushiout family at northwick in worcester- shire daniel mytens was popular painter in the reign of james and charles —he had studied under rubens and was for some time principal painter to chadles but was deprived of his place when vandyke arrived in england charles however continued his pension during lise vandyke had his first instructions from vaubalen of antwerp but he soon found in rubens master every way more suited to direct his genius and to ma¬ ture that consummate taste which he very early showed marks of possessing under the instructions of rubens he acquired such sxill in his art that the portrait of his master ’ wife which he painted whilst he was yet his disciple is esteemed one of the best pictures in the low countries he painted for his master two admirable pieces one repre- senting christ seized in the garden and the other the crowning him with thorns when he left rubens he travelled into italy and on his return having established his reputation as one of the first painters of the age he was invited to england where he was knighted by charles and married one of the handsomest ladies of the court the daughter of lord ruthven earl of gowry towards the latter end of his lise he went to france in hopes of being employed in the great gallery of the louvre but not succeeding he returned to england and proposed to the king to make cartoons for the banqueting-house at whitehall but his demand of so ooo being judged unreasonable whilst the king was treating with him for less sum the gout and other distempers put an end to his lise dobson had merited from charles the title of the english tintoret besore his premature death in at the age of only thirty-six years he was the father of the english school of portrait painting and though sometimes unequal had much the manner of his master vandyke he resided much at oxford and left there the portraits of himself and wife and of sir tradescant and his friend zythepsa the quaker in the staircase of the ashmolean museum dobson sometimes painted history his decolla- tion of st. john at wilton and the astronomer and his family at blenheim are amongst those which are most known and admired lely was in the former part of his life à landskape painter but was induced to practice portrait painting perhaps from the reputation and emolument which its pro¬ fessors obtained in england lely was chiefly celebrated for painting females and it is sometimes objected to him that his faces have too great à fimilarity of expreffion the languishing air the drowsy sweetness peculiar to him- self and the sleepy eye that spoke the melting soul is found in nearly all the pictures of females by this painter his crayon drawings are admirable he drew the por- trait of charles when prisoner at hampton-court charles i knighted him and made him his principal kneller was the fafhiionable artist in the reigns of james ii and william among an infinity of portraits there are some which bear the marks of excellence dr. wallis the mathematician and lord crew both for colouring and exprefsion are in great style the latter was admired by sir joshiua reynolds sor the air of nobility it possesses kneller is said to have drawn ten crowned heads viz four kings of england and three queens the czar of muscovy the emperor charles and louis xiv notwithstanding the negligence which is manisest in most of his works which arose from the desire of gain his genius is very apparent in his lise-time he received the praise of his contemporaries but the connoisseurs of the prefent age by no means allow that the praises of pope were merited speaking of kneller he says- ee whose art was nature and whose pictures thought but hoiv sew of them deserve the compliment thornhill painted several great works his fresco paint- ings in the dome of st. paul ’ and the painted hall at greenwich are too well known to need deseribing his copies of the cartoons of raphael which were purchased in for guineas have been presented to the royal academy by the duke of bedford richardson was portrait painter of eminence to his treatise on painting we are indebted for the greatest ornament to the art sir joshua reynolds sixed the destination of his mind on the prosession occasioned by the accidental reading of that work pope praised jervais but without discernment those beauties which were to ee bloom in his colours for thousand years ’ are now faded and unnoticed hudson was the best pupil of richardson the merit of sir joshiua rey- nolds as portrait painter can not be attributed to hudson ’ instructions since his manner seems entirely his own sir joshiua was born at plimpton in devonshire in the year his relations still preserve some frontispieces to the lives of plutarch as specimens of his early predilection for his art and tlie promise he gave of becoming eminent in it he became pupil to hudson about who amonstg other advice he gave him recommended him to copy guerchino ’ drawings which he did with such still that many of them are preserved in the cabinets of collectors as the original of that master about the year he went to rome to prosecute his studies where he remained nearly two years and employed himself rather in making studies from than copying the works of the great painters he amused himself with painting caricatures particularly one of all the englisn then at rome in the disserent attitudes of raphael ’ celebrated school of athens on his return he resided in newport-street but shortly after re- moved to leicester-fields where he continued till the time of his death an ingenious critic thus delineates sir joshua ’ professional character sir joshua reynolds was most assuredly the best portrait painter that this age has pro- duced he possessed something original in his manner which distinguished him from those painters who preceded him his colouring was excellent and his distribution of light and shadow so generally judicious and varied that it most clearly shewed that it was not mere trick of practice but the result of principle in history painting his abilities were very respectable and his invention and judgment were sufficient to have enabled him to have made à very distinguished figure in that very arduous branch of his profession if the exclusive taste of his country for portraits had not discouraged him from cultivating à talent so very unproductive and neglected his drawing though incor- rect had always something of grandeur in it his own pictures might well be applied what he used to say respecting those of rubens ee they resemble said he et well-chosen nosegay in which though the coloure are splendid and vivid they are never glaring or oppressive to the eye sir joshua was great experiment- alist with respect to the composition of his colours at first he used preparations from vegetables which he relin- quissied for minerals he is known to have purchased pictures by titian or his scholars and to have scraped off the several layers of colouring in order to ascertain it and discover his secret the englisn school of painting must acknowledge sir joshiua reynolds as its great founder under royal auspices in the establishment of the academy the pure precepts which he laid down in his annual orations were exempli¬ fied in his own works his most favourite paintings are garrick between tragedy and comedy the ugolino in prison in which he has imitated michael angelo in his te terribil via as it is called by augustino caracei in his fonnet on painting it is sir joshua ’ triumph in the art the nativity the infant hercules the death of cardinal beaufort in which are united the local colouring of titian with the chiaro feuro of rembrandt mrs. siddons mrs. billington robin goodfellow cimon and iphigene holy family which displays norel and beautiful manner of treating that very frequent sulject to speak generally of the englisn school their colouring is less glaring than that of the flemisn or venetian masters their talents are more admirable in portrait than history particularly in those of females examine says french writer picture of french woman painted by an artist of that nation and you will generally find in place of ex- pression foreed grin in which the eyes and forehead do not partake and which indicates no affection of the soul ex- amine the picture of an english woman done by one of their painters and you observe an elegant and simple expression which makes you at once acquainted with the person re- presented perhaps it might be difficult to assign to the english school as exhibited in the royal academy any perfect discrimination as each painter either implicitly follows his own genius or attaches himself to that particular manner of the foreign schools which approaches nearest to his own ideas of excellence but there are other exhibitions in which the best painters of the age have exerted fuccess- ful

nearest to their own of living artists we decline speaking with the exception of those whose eminence as men of genius has placed them beyond competition in the works of northcote opie and lawrencer

painting good taste and correctness of design are so necessary that painter who wants them must not hope to attract esteem design being the foundation of all the other parts its elegance and correctness are no less neces- sary in painting than purity of language is in eloquence we are told by pliny that all the statues before the time of daedalus were represented stiff and motionless with the feet closed and arms hanging in right lines to their sides or they had only the head finished the body arms and legs not being expressed these were the rude essays of design in the progrefs of the art and in abler hands motion was fashiioned into grace and life was heightened into character beauty of form was no longer confined to mere imitation which always falls short of the object imitated to make the copy equal in its effect it was necessary to give it an advantage over its model the artists therefore observing that nature was sparing of her perfections and that her efforts were limited to parts availed themselves of her inequalities and drawing those scattered beauties inte more happy and compleat union rose from an im¬ perfect imitation to perfect ideal beauty we are in- formed that the painters of greece pressed in crowds to design the bosom and breast of thais nor were the elegant proportions of phryne less the object of their study by this constant contemplation of the beautisul they enriched their imagination and confirmed their taste from this fund they drew their systems of beauty and though we should consider them but as imitators of the parts we must allow them to have been the inventors in the compositions should we doubt the justice of the preference given to invented beauty over the real we need only contemplate the fine proportions and the style of drawing in the laocoon and gladiator and mark the expressive energy of apollo and the elegant beauties of the venus de medicis these are the utmost efforts of design it can reach no farther than full exertion of grace beauty and character the design of the ancients is distinguishied by an union of proportions fimplicity of contour and excellence of character there is no one excellence of design from which we derive such immediate pleasure as from gracefulness of action if we observe the attitudes and movements of the greek statues we shall mark that careless decency and unassected grace which ever attend the motions of men unconscious of observation raphael has been wonderfully happy in imitating this simple elegance of the antique the most courtly imagin- ation can not represent to itself an image of more winning grace than is to be seen in his sancta cæcilia indeed an elegant simplicity is the characteristie of his design we no where meet in him the affected contrasts of michael angelo or the studied attitudes of guido the design of raphael was in its beginning dry but correct he enlarged it much on seeing the drawings of michael angelo of too just an eye to give intirely into the excesses of his model he struck out middle style which however was not so happily blended as quite to throw off the inssuence of the extremes hence in the great he is apt to swell into the charged in the delicate to drop into the little his design notwithstanding is beautisul but never arrived to that persection which we discover in the greek statues he is excellent in the characters of philosopliers apostles and the like but the figures of his women have not that elegance which is distinguisned in the venus di medicis of the daughter of niobe in these his convex contours have à certain heaviness by which in seeking to avoid he falls into dryness still less pardonable his proportions are esteemed excellent yet not having formed his manner on the most beautiful antique we do not see in him that elegant symmetry that freedom in the joints which lend all their motion to the laocoon and gladiatorl instead of these the figures of michael angelo were his models in the great style whence having quitted the lines of nature and not having substituted ideal beauty he became too like his original as may be seen in his incendio di borgo would we therefore place raphael in his true point of view we must observe him in the middle age in old men or in the nervous nature in his madonna ’ he knew how to choose as likewise how to vary the most beautiful parts of nature but he knew not how to express beauty superior to the natural thus in his galatea where he has attempted cha- racter of perfect beauty he has fallen short of the beauty of his madonna ’ the cause of this seems to be that he drew the former after his own ideas which were im perfect in the latter he copied beautiful nature which was almost perfect à second observation will confirm this opinion of all the objects of painting angels call moft for ideal beauty and those of raphael are by no meant distinguished in this particular one of the greatest excellences of design is grace cor- regio in this is inimitable his constant aim was grace and happy effect of light and shade waving and varied contour was necessary to this end hence he studi oussy avoided right lines and acute angles as too simple in their effects thus the habit and necessity of continually varying his outline threw him into little errors in draw- ing which spring not from an ignorance of this branch of his art but from predilection for another and there are few who would wishi those inadvertences away accom- panied with the charms which gave occasion to them we may affirm of hiis design where it is not sacrificed to his more favorite aims that it is often masterly and always pleasing quality rarely to be met with in those servile painters who think they have attained every persection if they keep within the rules of drawing such painters says quintilian while they think it sufficient to be free from faults fall into that capital fault the want of beauties we shall close this article with an account of the apollo belvidere and the celebrated groupe of laocoon so long the pride of rome but removed to paris during its ravages by the french republicans as described by the late abbe winckleman the apollo belvidere et of all the productions of art which have escaped the ravages of time the statue of apollo belvedere is unques- tionably the most sublime the artist founded this work upon imagination and has only employed substance for the purpose of realizing his ideas as much as the descriptions which homer has given of apollo are superior to those given of him by other poets in the same degree is this statue superior to any other statues of that deity its stature is above that of man and its attitude breathes majesty an eternal spring such as reigns in the delightful fields of elysium clothes with youth the manly charms of his body and gives brilliancy to the animated structure of his limbs endeavour to penetrate into the regions of incorporeal beauty try to become the creator of celestial nature in order to elevate your soul to the contemplation of super- natural beauties for here there is nothing mortal neither thie veins nor sinews are too conspicuous kind of celestiai spirit animates the whole figure the god has pursued python against whom he has for the first time bent his dreadful bow in his rapid course he has overtaken him and given him mortal blow in the height of his joy his august features denote more than victory disdain is seated on his lips and the indignation which he breathes distends his nostrils and affects his eye-brows but still his forehead expresses serenity and he is all full of sweet- ness as if he were surrounded by the muses eager to caress him among all the figures of jupiter which we possess you will not see one in which the father of the gods displays so much of that majesty described by the poets as does this statue of his son the peculiar beauties of all the other gods are united in this figure in the same manner as in the divine pandora the forehead is the forehead of jupiter impregnated with the goddess of wisdom his eye-brows by their movement declare their wishies his eyes in their celestial orbits are the eyes of the queen of the goddesses and the mouth is that which inspired the beautiful bacchus with voluptuousness like the tender branches of the vine his sine hairs play about as if they were slightly ruffled by the breath of zephyrs they seemed erfumed with celestial essence and negligently tied by the hands of the graces on seeing this prodogy of art forgot the whole uni¬ verse placed myself in more noble attitude to contem plate it with dignity from admiration passed to extacy silled with respect felt my breast agitated like those who are inspired with the spirit of prophecy et felt myself transported to delas and the sacred woods of lycia places which apollo honoured with his presence for the beauty which was before my eyes appeared to be animated as was formerly the beautiful statue produced by the chizel of pygmalion how can describe you oh inimitable chef ’ auvrel art itself must inspire me and guide my pen ee the outlines which have traced lay at your seet so those who can not reach to the head of the deity they adore place at his feet the garlands with which they wishi to crown him the groupe of laocoon ee laocoon prefents to us picture of the deepest distrefs under the representation of man contending with all his powers in his own defence while his muscles and sinews are dilated and contracted by agony vou may still perceive the vigour of his mind expressed on his wrinkled forehead his breast oppressed with restrained respiration seems to contend against the pain with which it is agitated ee the groans which he restrains and his breath which he holds in seei to exhaust the lower part of his body and the loins by being drawn in seem to discover his very entrails nevertheless his own sufferings seem to affect him less than those of his children who look up to him as if imploring his succour compassion like dark vapour overshadows his eyes his physiognomy denotes complaint his eyes are directed towards heaven imploring assistance his mouth bespeaks languor and his lower lip is fallen agony mixed with indignation at his unjust punishment is displayed in all his features the contest between pain and resistance is displayed with the greatest sxill for while the former draws up the eye-brows the latter compresses the flesn over the eyes and makes it descend over the upper eye-lids the subject not allowing the artist to embellisn nature he has exerted himself to display contention and vigour in those places where there is the greatest agony there is also great beauty the left side on which the furious serpent makes its attack seems to be in the greatest pain from its proximity to the heart this part of the body may be called prodigy of art laocoon wishies to raise his legs in order to escape no part of the figure is in repose the very flesn by the skill of the artist has the appearance of being benumbed of colouring colouring though subject greatly inferior to many others which the painter must study is yet of sufficient importance to employ considerable share of his attention and to excel in it he must be well acquainted with that part of optics which has the nature of light and colours for its object light however simple and uncompounded it may appéar is nevertheless made up as it were of several distinct substances and the number and even dose of these ingredients has been happily discovered by the moderns every undivided ray let it be ever so fine is little bundle of red orange yellow green azure indigo and violet rays which while combined are not to be distinguished one from another and form that kind of light called white so that white is not colour perse as the learned de vinci so far it feems the precursor of newton expressly affirms but an assemblage of colours now these colours which compose light although immu¬ table in themselves and endued with various qualities are continually however separating from each other in their reflection from and passage through other substances and thus become manifest to the eye grafs for example reflects only green rays or rather reflects green rays in greater number than it does those of any other colour one kind of wine transmits red rays and another yellowish rays and from this kind of separation arises that variety of colours with which nature has diversified her various pro- ductions.. man too has contrived to separate the rays of light by making portion of the sun ’ beams pafs through glass prism for after passing through it they appear divided into seven pure and primitive colours placed in succession one by the other like so many colours on painter ’ pallet now though titian corregio and vandyke have been excellent colourists without knowing any thing of tliese phyfical subtleties that is no reason why others should neglect them for it can not but be of great service to painter to be well acquainted with the nature of what he is to imitate and of those colours with which he is to give life and perfection to his designs not to speak of the plea¬ sure there is in being able to account truly and solidly for the various effects and appearances of light from due tempering for example and graduating of the tints in picture from making colours partake of each other ac- cording to the reflection of light from one object to ano¬ ther there arises in some measure that sublime harmony which may be considered as the true music of the eye and this harmony has its foundation in the genuine prin- ciples of opties now this could not happen in the system os those philosophers who held that colours did not ori- ginally exist in light but were on the contrary nothing else than so many modifications which it underwent in being reflected from other substances or in passing through them thus subject to alterations without end and every moment liable to perish were that the case bodies could no more receive any hues one from another nor this body partake of the colour of that than scarlet for example because it has the power of changing into red all the rays of the sun or sky which immediately sall upon it has the power of changing into red all the other rays reflected to it from blue or any other colour in its neighbourhood whereas allowing that colours are in their own nature imiutable one into another and that every body reflects more or less every sort of coloured rays though those rays in the greatest number which are of the colour it exhibits there must necessarily arise in colours placed near one another certain particular hues or temperaments of colour nay this influence of one colour upon another may be so far traced that three or you bodies of different colours and likewise the intenseness of the light falling upon each being assigned we may easily determine in what situations and how much they would tinge each other we may thus too by the same principle of optics account for several other things practised by painters inso- much that person who has carefully observed natural effects with an eye directed by solid learning shall be able to form general rules where another can only distinguish particular cases but after all the pictures of the best colourists are it is universally allowed the books in which young painter must chiefly look for the rules of colouring that is of that branch of painting which contributes so much to express the beauty of objects and is so requisite to represent them as what they really are giorgio and titian seem to have discovered circumstances in nature which others have entirely overlooked and the last in particular has been happy enough to express them with pencil as delicate as his eye was quick and piercing in his works we behold that sweetnefs of colouring which is produced by union that beauty which is consistent with truth and all the in- sensible transmutations all the soft transitions in word all the pleasing modulations of tints and colours when young painter has by close application acquired from titian whom he can never sufficiently dwell upon that art which of all painters he has best contrived to hide he would do well to turn to bassano and paolo on account of the beauty boldnefs and elegance of their touches that richnefs softness and freshness of colouring for which the lombard school is so justly cried up may like- wise be of great service to him nor will he reap less benefit by studying the principles and practice of the fle- missi school which chiesly by means of her varnishes has contrived to give most enchanting lustre and transparency to her colours but whatever pictures young painter may choose to study the art of colouring upon he must take great care that they are well preserved there are very sew pieces which have not suffered more or less by the length not to say the injuries of time and perhaps that precious patina which years alone can impart to paintings is in some mea- fure akin to that other kind which ages alone impart to medals inasmuch as by giving testimony to their anti¬ quity it renders them proportionably beautisul in the super- stitious eyes of the learned it must indeed be allowed that if on the one band this patina bestows as it really does an extraordinary degree of harmony upon the colours of picture and destroys or at least greatly lessens their original rawness it on the other hand equally impairs the freshiness and lise of them piece seen many years aster it has been painted appears much as it would do imme¬ diately after painting behind dull glass it is no idle opinion that paolo veronese attentive above all things to the beauty of his colours and what is called strepiro left entirely to time the care of harmonizing them perfectly and as we may say mellowing them but most of the old masters took that task upon themselves and never exposed their works to the eyes of the public until they had ripened and finished them with their own hands and who can say whether the christ of moneta or the nativity of bassano have been more improved or injured if we may so speak by the touchings and re-touchings of time in the course of more than two centuries it is indeed impossible to be determined but the studious pupil may make himself ample amends for any injuries which his originals may have received from the hands of time by turning to truth and to nature which never grows old but constantly retains its primitive slower of youth and was itself the model of the models before him as soon therefore as young painter has laid proper foundation for good colouring by study- ing the best masters he should turn all his thoughts to truth and nature and it would perhaps be well worth while to have in the academies of painting models for colouring as well as designing that as from the one the pupils learn to give their due proportion to the several members and mus¬ cles they may learn from the other to make their carnations rich and warm and faithfully copy the different local hues which appear quite distinct in the different parts of fine bodv to illustrate still farther the use of such model let us suppose it placed in different lights now in that of the sun now in that of the sky and now again in that of lamp or candle one time placed in the shade and another in reflected light hence the pupil may learn all the disserent efsects of the complection in different circumstances whe- ther the livid the lucid or transparent and above all that variety of tints and half tints occasioned in the colour of the skin by the epidermis having the bones immediately under it in some places and in others greater or less number of blood-vessels or quantity of fat an artist who had long studied such model would run no risk of de¬ grading the beauties of nature by any particularity of stile or of giving into that preposterous fulness and floridness of colour which is at present so much the taste he would not feed his figures with roses as an ancient painter of greece shrewdly expressed it but with good beef differ- ence which the learned eye of modern writer could per- ceive between the colouring of barocci and that of titian to practise in that manner is according to great master no better than inuring one ’ self to the commission of blunders what statues are in design nature is in colour ing the fountain head of that perfection to which every artist ambitious to excel should constantly aspire an accordingly the flemish painters in consequence of their aiming solely to copy nature are in colouring as excellent as they are wont to be aukward in designing the best model for the tone of colours and the degradation of shades is furnishied by means of the cumera-obscura we may form general idea of the various effects of reflections from the following examples if blue be reflected on yellow the latter becomes greenish if on red the red becomes purple and so on through variety of combi- nations and as the white is of nature to receive all the colours and to be tinged with that of each reflection the painter must he caresul how his carnations may be affected by the several reflections of composition composition which may be considered as branch of invention consists in the proper stationing of what the inventive faculty has imagined so as to exprefs the subject in the most lively manner the chief merit of compo¬ sition may be said to consist in that disorder which wear- ing the appearance of mere chance is in fact the most studied effect of art painter therefore is equally to avoid the drynefs of those ancients who always planted their figures like so many couples in procefsion and the affectation of those moderns who jumble them together as if they were met merely to fight and squabble in this branch raphael was happy enough to choose the just medium and attain perfection the disposition of his figures is always exactly such as the subject requires in the battle of con- stantine they are confusedly clustered with as much art as they are regularly marshalled in christ ’ commitment of the keys to st. peter and constituting him prince of the apostles let the inferior figures of piece be placed as they will the principal figure should strike the eye most and stand out as it were from among the rest this may be effected various ways as by placing it on the foremost lines or in some other-conspicuous part of the piece by exhibiting it in manner by itself by making the principal light fall upon it by giving it the most resplendent drapery or in- deed by several of these methods nay by all of them toge¬ ther for beins the hero of the picturesque fable it is hut just thatit should draw the eye to itself and lord it as it were over al the other objects according to leon batista alberti painters should follow the example of comic writers who compose their fable of as few persons as possible for in fact crowded picture is apt to give as much pain to the spectator as crowded road to the traveller some subjects it must be granted require à number nay nation as it were of figures on these occasions it depends entirely on the skill of the painter to dispose of them in such manner that the principal ones may always make the principal appearance and contrive mat- ters so that the piece be not over-crowded or want conve- nient rests and pauses he must in word take care that his piece be full but not charged in this respect the battles of alexander by le brun are master-pieces which can never be sufficiently studied whereas nothing on the other hand can be more unhappy than the famous paradise of tintoret which covers one entire side of the great council¬ chamber at venice it appears no bêtter than confused heap of figures swarm cloud chaos which pains and fatigues the eye what pity it is that he did not dispose this subject aster à model of his own now in the gallery of bevilacqua at verona in this last the several choirs of martyrs virgins bishops and other saints are judicioussy thrown into so many clusters parted here and there by à fine sleece of clouds so as to exhibit the innu¬ merable host of heaven drawn up in way that makes most agreeable and glorious appearance there goes story to our purpose of celebrated master who in drawing of the universal deluge the better to express the immensity of the waters that covered the earth left corner of his paper without figures being afked if he did not intend to sill it up no said he do not you see that my leaving it empty is what precisely constitutes the picture the reason for breaking composition into several groups is that the eye passing freely from one object to another may the better comprehend the whole but the painter is not to stop here for these groups are besides to be so artsully put together as to form rich clusters give the whole composition singular air of grandeur and afford the spectator an opportunity of discerning the piece at distance and taking the whole in as it were at single glance these effects are greatly promoted by due regard to the nature of colours so as not to place together those which are apt to pain by their opposition or distract by their variety they should be so judicioussy disposed as to temper and qualify each other proper use of the chiaro-scuro is likewise of great ser- vice on this occasion the groups are easily parted and the whole picture acquires grand effect by introducing some strong falls of snade and above all one principal beam of light this method has been followed with great success by rembrandt in famous picture of his represent- ing the virgin at the foot of the crofs on mount calvary the principal light darting upon her through break of the clouds while the rest of the figures about her stand more or less in the shade tintoret too acquired great repu¬ tation as well by that brifkness with which he enlivened bis figures as by his masterly manner of shading them and polidoro de caravaggio though he scarce painted any thing but basso-relievos was particularly famous for intro- ducing with great skill the effects of the chiaro-scuro thing first attempted by mantegna in his triumph of julius cæsar it is by this means that his compositions appear so strikingly divided into different groups and among their other perfections afford so much delight through the beau- tiful disposition that reigns in them in like manner painter by the help of perspective especially that called ærial the opposition of local colours and other contrivances which he may expect to hit upon by studying nature and those who have best studied her before him will be able not only to part his groups hut make them appear at disserent distances so as to leave sufficient passages between them but the greatest caution is to be used in the purfuit of the methods here laid down especially in the management of the chiaro-scuro that the effects attributed to light and shade and to their various concomitants may not run counter to truth and experience this is capital point for this purpose painter would do well to make in little figures as tintoret and poussin used to do model of the subject that he intends to represent and then illuminate it by lamp er candle-light by this means he may come to know with certainty if the chiaro-scuro which he has formed in his mind does not clasti with the reason of things by varying the height and direction of his light he may easily discover such accidental effects as are most likely to recommend his performance and so establisn proper system for the illuminating it nor will he after- wards find it difficult matter to modisy the quality of his shades by softening or strengthening them according to the situation of his scene and the quality of the light falling upon it ifit should happen to be candle or lamp¬ light scene he would then have nothing to do but consider his model well and faithfully copy it in the next place to turn groupe elegantly the best pattern is that of bunch of grapes adopted by titian as of the many grains that compose bunch of grapes someare struck directly by the light and those opposite to them are in the shade whilst the intermediate ones partake of botli ight and shade in greater or less degree so according to titian the figures of groupe should be so disposed that by the union of the chiaro-scuro several things may appear as it were but one thing and in fact it is only from his having pursued this method that we can account for the very grand effect of his pieces this way in which it is impossible to study him too much the mannerists who do not follow nature in the track of the masters just mentioned are apt to commit many faults the reason of their figures casting their snades in this or that manner seldom appears in the picture or at least does not appear sufficiently probable they are besides wont to trespass all bounds in splafhiing their pieces with light that is enlivening those parts which we usually term the deafs of picture this method no doubt has sometimes very sine effect but it is however to be used with no small discretion as otherwise the whole loses that union that pause that majestic silence as caracci used to call it which affords so much pleasure the eye is not less hurt by many lights scattered here and there over picture than the ear is by the confused noise of different persons speaking all together in an asfembly guido reni who has imparted to his paintings that gaiety and splendour in which he lived seems enamoured with bright and open light whereas michael angelo de caravagio who was of sullen and savage disposition appears sondest of gloomy and clouded sky so that neither of them were qualified to handle indifferently all objects the chiaro-scuro may likewise prove of great service to painter in giving his composition grand effect but never- thelefs the light he chooses must be adapted to the situation of the scene where the action is laid nor would he be less faulty who in grottoor cavern where the light entered by chink snould make his shades soft and tender than he wlio should represent them strong and bold in an open sky-light but this is by no means the only fault which mannerists are apt to be guilty of in historical pieces and particularly in the disposition of their figures to say nothing of their favourite groupe of woman lying on the ground with one child at her breast and another playing about her and the like which they generally place on the first lines of their pieces nor of those half-figures in the back ground peep¬ ing out from the hollows contrived for them they make à common practice of mixing naked with clothed figures old men with young placing one figure with its face towards you and another with its back they contrast violent motions with languid attitudes and seem to aim at opposition in every thing whereas oppositions never please but when they arise naturally from the sulject like anti¬ theses in discourse as to foreshortened sigures too mucl assectation in using or avoiding them is equally blamable the attitudes had better be composed than otherwise it very seldom happens that there is any occasion for making them so impetuous as to be in danger of losing their equilibrium thing too much practised by some painters in regard to drapery equal care should be taken to avoid that poverty which makes some masters look as if through mere penury they grudged clothes to their figures and that profusion which albani imputed to guido saying that he was rather à tailor than painter the ornaments of dress should be used with great sobriety and it will not be amiss to remember what was once said to an ancient painter pity you greatly unable to make helen handsome you liave taken care to make her sine let the whole in word and all the different parts of the composition possess probability grace costume and the particular character of what is to be represented let nothing look like unisormity of manner which does not appear less in the composition than it does in colouring drapery and design and is as it were that kind of accent by which painters may be as readily distinguished as foreigners are by pronouneing in the same manner all the different languages they happen to be acquainted with crayon painting whether the painter works with oil colours water colours or crayons the grand olject of his purfuit is still the same à just imitation of nature but each species has its peculiar rules and methods painting with crayons re- quires in many respects treatment different from painting in oil colours because all colours used dry are in their nature of much warmer complexion than when wet with oils or any other binding fluid let this be proved by matter of fact -mr. cotes painted portrait of sir william chambers which is in lord besborough ’ collection an ingenious foreigner had discovered method of fixing crayon pictures so that iliey would not rub or receive an injury if auy accident happened to the glass the society for the encouragement of arts had before offered premium to any one who should discover so valuable secret for which premium he made application mr. cotes being eminent in his prosession was desired to lend picture for the trial and give his judgment which was made on this portrait of sir william chambers tlie crayons he indeed so persect- ly fixed as so resist any ruh or brush without the leust injury which before would have entirely defaced or spoiled it but the picture which before had particularly warm brilliant and agreeable effect in comparison became cold and purple and though in one sense the attempt succeeded to the de- signed intention of sixing the colours yet the binding quali¬ ty of whatever sluid was made use of in the process chang- ed the complexion of the colours rendering the cold teints too predominant for this reason in order to produce rich picture much greater portion of what painters term cooling tints must be applied in crayon painting than would be judicious to use in oils without any danger of mistake it is to be supposed the not being acquainted with this observation is one great cause why so many oil painters have no better success when they attempt crayon painting on the contrary crayon painters being so much used to those tints which are of cold nature when used wet are apt to introduce them too much when they paint with oils which is seldom productive of good effect another observation would make which requires par- ticular notice from the student who has been conversant with oil painting prior to his attempts with crayons oil painters begin their pictures much lighter and fainter than they intend to finish them which presents the future co¬ louring clear and brilliant the light underneath greatly assisting the transparent glazing and scumbling colours which if they were laid over any part already too dark would but increase its heavy effect on the contrary cray- ons being made of dry colours are difficult to procure fuffi- ciently dark the crayon painter therefore will find an ab- solute necessity to begin his picture in dark and rich as pos¬ sible except in the strongest lights for if once the grey and light tints become predominant it will be next to im¬ ossible for him in the deep shadows especially to restore depth and brilliancy having no opportunity of glazing or scumbling to give the effect as the grey tints being mix- tures with whiting underneath will continually work up and render the attempt abortive shall now endeavour to give the student some directions towards the attainment of excellence in this art the student must provide himself with some strong blue paper the thicker the better if the grain is not too coarse and knotty though it is almost impossible to get any intire- free from knots the knots should be levelled with penknise or razor otherwise they will prove exceedingly troublesome after this is done the paper must be pasted very smooth on linen cloth previoussy strained on deal frame the size according to the artist ’ pleafure on this the picture is to be executed but it is most eligible not to paste the paper on till the whole subject is first dead-co¬ loured the method of doing this is very easy by laying the paper with the dead-colour on its face upon fmooth board or table when by means of brush the backside of the paper must be covered with paste the frame with the strained cloth must then be laid on the pasted side of the paper after which turn the painted side uppermost and lay piece of clean paper upon it to prevent fmearing this being done it may be stroked gently over with the hand by which means all the air between the cloth and the paper will be forced out when the paste is persectly dry the student may proceed with the painting the advantages arising from pasting the paper in the frame according to this method after that side of the paper should be pasted which has the strokes from the wires most evident that the painting may be on the smoothest side otherwise the lines which these wires have left in the paper will prove troublesome and look unpleasant some crayon pictures are painted on vellum but the animal salts in the skin very often cause them to mildew it must be confessed the vellum gives tne picture à foft effect but its use can not be recommended in our unsavour- able climate others make use of smalt grounds le tour lately painter the picture is begun are very great as the crayons will adhere much better than any other way which will enable the student to finish the picture with firmer body of co¬ lour and greater lustre the late mr. cotes discovered this method by accident and esteemed it valuable acquisi¬ tion and remember on particular occasion he re- moved sine crayon picture of rozalba ’ and placed it on another strained cloth without the least injury by soak ing the canvas with wet sponge till the pafte between the cloth and paper was sufficiently wet to admit of separation when painters want to make very correct copy of picture they generally make use of tiffany or black gauze strained tight on frame which they lay flat on the subject to be imitated and with piece of sketching chalk trace all the outlines on the tiffany they then lay the canvas to be painted on flat upon the sloor placing the tiffany with the chalked lines upon it and with an hand¬ kerchief brush the whole over this prefents the exact out¬ lines of the pictureon the canvas the crayon painter may also make use of this method when the subject of his imi¬ tation is in oils but in copying crayon picture he must have recourse to the following method on account of the glass the picture being placed upon the esel let the outlines be drawn on the glass with small camel ’ hair peneil dip¬ ped in lake ground thin with oils which must be done with great exactness after this is accomplishied take à sheet of paper of the same size and place it on the glass stroking of note in paris often used them with great fuccess the method to prepare them is to brush over the paper with gum water which directmy strew with smalt moderately fine the superfluous part of which should be swept off with painter ’ brussi when the gum water is perfectly dry on this the picture is to be painted but we have paper now in england to be procured of so ex- cellent texture as to render this preparation perhaps unnecessary over all the lines with the hand by which means the co¬ lours will adhere to the paper which must be pierced with pin holes pretty close to each other the paper intended to be used for the painting must next be laid upon table and the pierced paper placed upon it then with some fine pounded charcoal tied up in piece of lawn rub over the perforated strokes which will give an exact outline great care must be taken not to brushi this off till the whole is drawn over with sketching chalk which is composition made of whiting and tobaccopipe clay rolled like crayons and pointed at each end when the student paints immediately from the life it will be most prudent to make correct drawing of the out- lines on another paper the size of the picture he is going to paint which he may trace by the preceding method be¬ cause erroneous strokes of the sketching chalk which are not to be avoided without great expertness will prevent the crayons from adhering to the paper owing to certain greasy quality in the composition the student will find the sitting posture with the box of crayons on his lap the most convenient method for him to paint the part of the picture he is immediately painting should be rather below his face for if it is placed too high the arm will be fatigued let the windows of the room where he paints he darkened at least to the height of six feet from the ground and the subject to be painted should be situated in such manner that the light may fall with every advantage on the face avoiding too much shadow which seldom has good effect in portrait painting especi- ally if the face he paints has any degree of delicacy before he begins to paint let him be attentive to his subject and appropriate the action or attitude proper to the age of the subject if child let it be childishi if young lady ex- press more vivacity than in the majestie beauty of middle aged woman who also should not be expressed with the same gravity as person far advanced in years let the embel¬ lishments of the picture and introduction of birds animals be regulated by the rules of propriety and consistency the features of the face being carefully drawn with chalk let the student take crayon of pure carmine and carefully draw the nostril and edge of the nose next the shadow then with the faintest carmine tint lay in the strongest light upon the nose and forehead which must be executed broad he is then to proceed gradually with the second tint and the suc- ceeding ones till he arrives at the shadows which must be covered brilliant enriched with much lake carmine little broken with brilliant green this method will at first offensively strike the eye from its crude appearance but in finishing it will be good foundation to produce plea- sing effect colours being much more easily sullied when too bright than when the first colouring is dull to raise the picture into brilliant state the several pearly tints discernable in sine complexions must be imitated with blue verditer and white which answers to the ultramarine tints used in oils but if the parts of the face where these tints appear are in shadow the crayons composed of black and white must be substituted in their place though all the face when first coloured should be laid in as brilliant as possible yet each part should be kept in its proper tone by which means the rotundity of the face will be preserved let the student be caresul when he begins the eyes to draw them with crayon inelined to the carmine tint of whatever colour the iris are of he must lay them in brilliant and at first not loaded with colour but executed lightly no notice is to be taken of the pupil yet the stu- dent must let the light of the eye incline very much to the blue cast cautioussy avoiding à staring white appear- ance which when once introduced is seldom overcome preserving broad shadow thrown on its upper part by the eye-lashi black and heavy tint is also to be avoid- ed in the eye-brows it is therefore best to execute them like broad glowing shadow at first on which in the finishing the hairs of the brow are to be painted by which method of proceeding the former tints will shew themselves through and produce the most pleasing effect the student should begin the lips with pure carmine and lake and in the shadow use some carmine and black the strong vermillion tints should be laid on afterwards he must beware of executing them with stiff harsh lines gently intermixing each with the neigbouring colours making the shadow beneath broad and enriched with brilliant crayons he must form the corner of the mouth with carmine brown oker and greens varioussy intermixed if the hair is dark he should preserve much of the lake and deep carmine tints therein this may be easily overpowered by the warmer hair tints which as observed in painting the eye-brows will produce richer effect when the picture it finished on the contrary if this method is unknown or neglected poverty of colouring will be discernable after the student has covered over or as artists term it has dead-coloured the head he is to sweeten the whole to- gether by rubbing it over with his finger beginning at the strongest light upon the forehead passing his singervery light- ly and uniting it with the next tint which he must continue till the whole is sweetened together often wiping his finger on towel to prevent the colours being sullied he must be cautious not to smooth or sweeten his picture too often because it will give rise to thin and scanty effect and have more the appearance of drawing than solid painting as nothing but body of rich colours can constitute à rich effect to avoid this as the student finds it necessary to sweeten with the singer he must continually replenisn the picture with more crayon when the head is brought to some degree of forwardnefs let the back ground be laid in which must be treated in different covering it as thin as possible and rubbing it into the paper with leather stump near the face the paper should be almost free from colour for this will do great service to the head and by its thinnefs give both soft and solid appearance in the back ground also crayons which have whiting in their composition should be used but seldom or never without caution but chiessy such as are the most brilliant and the least adulterated the ground being painted thin next the hair will give the student an opportunity of painting the edges of the hair over in light and free manner when he gives the finishing touches the student having proceeded thus far the face hair and back ground being entirely covered he must carefully view the whole at some distance remarking in what respect it is out of keeping that is what parts are too light and what too dark being particularly attentive to the white or chalky appearances which must be subdued with lake and carmine the above method being properly put into execution will produce the appearance of painting prin¬ cipally composed of three colours viz carmine black and white which is the best preparation painter can make for producing sine crayon picture the next step is to compleat the back ground and the hair as the dust in painting these will sall on the face and would much injure it if that was compleated first from thence proceed to the forehead finishing downward till the whole picture is compleated back grounds may be of various colours but it requires great taste and judgment to fuit them properly to different complexions in general strong coloured head should have weak and tender tinted ground and on the contrary à delicate complexion should be opposed with strong and powersul tints by which proper contrast between the sigure and the back ground the picture will receive great force and strike the spectator much more than it could possibly do was this circumstance of contrast not attend¬ ed to young painters often treat the back grounds of pictures as à matter of very little or no consequence when it is most certain great part of the beauty and brilliancy of the picture especially the face depends upon the tints being well suited the darks kept in their proper places and the whole being perfectly in subordination to the face thus à simple back ground requires attention but the difficulty is still greater when variety of objects are introduced such as hills trees buildings in these cases one rule must be strictly attended to that each grand object be disposed so as to contrast each other this is not meant merely respecting their forms but their colour their light shade for instance we will suppose the figure receiving the strongest light behind the figure and very near at hand are the stems of some large trees these must have shade thrown over them either from driving cloud or some other inter- posing circumstance behind these stems of trees and at distance are seen trees on à rising ground these should re- ceive the light as contrast to the former lf an ar- chitectural back ground be chosen the same rule must be applied suppose building at moderate distance is placed behind the figure receiving the light column or some other object in shadow should intervene to preserve proper decorum in the piece or what will have the same effect shadow must be thrown over the lower part of the building which will give equal fatisfaction or repose to the eye it must be remembered the light must be always placed against the dark and the weak against the strong in order to pro- duce force and essect and vice versa in painting over the forehead the last time begin the highest light with the most faint vermillion tint in the same place where the faint carmine was first laid keeping it broad in the same manner in the next shade succeeding the lightest the student must work in some light blue tints composed of verditer and white intermixing with them some of the deeper vermillion tints sweetening them to- gether with great caution insensibly melting them into one another increasing the proportion of each colour as his ugdment shall direct some brilliant yellows may also be used but sparingly and towards the roots of the hair strong verditer tints intermixed with greens will be of singular service cooling crayons composed of black and white should succeed these and melt into the hair be¬ neath the eyes the pleasing pearly tints are to be preserved composed of verditer and white and under the nose and on the temples the same may be used beneath the lips tints of this kind also are proper mixing them with the light greens and some vermillion the introduction of greens and blues into the face in painting has often given surprize to those who are unac- quainted with the art but there is reason sufficient for their introduction though it may appear strange at first in order to break and correct the other colours the carmine predominating in the dead colour is as has been observed the best preparation for the succeeding tints the crudeness of this preparation must be corrected hy varioussy intermixing greens blues and yellows which of these are to be used is to be determined by the degree this direction is sor the finest complexions but the student must vary nis colouring accordin to his subject of carmine in the dead colour and the complexion intended the blue and yellow are of nature diametrically opposite and serve to correct the reds and oppose one another the greens being compounded of both these colours is of pecu- liar use in many cases were the transition is not to be so violent the student attentively considering nature will discover pleasing variety of colours on the furface and discernible through clear and transparent skin this variety will be still increased by the effect of light and shade he will per¬ ceive one part inclining to the vermillion red another to the carmine or lake one to the blue this to the green and that to the yellow in order to produce these different effects he will apply those colours to which the tints are most inclined yet in crayon painting it is often best to compound the mixed colours upon the picture such as blue and yellow instead of green blue and carmine instead of purple red and yellow instead of orange in other circum- stances the compounds already mixed should be used but in this case there can be no absolute rule given it must be left to the experience and discretion of the painter though the student may be greatly assisted in the commencement of his studies by an able master to direct and point out the best method to treat circumstances of this nature as they occur in practice which may at first appear obscure and mysterious but will soon to good capacity become de- monstrably clear upon certain and sure principles the cir- cumstances that require different treatment are so various and so many as to render it impossible here to descend to every particular in finishing the cheeks let the pure lake clear them froin any dust contracted from the other crayons then with the lake may be intermixed the bright vermillion and last of all if the subject should requre it few touches of the orange coloured crayon but with extreme caution after this sweeten that part with the finger as little as possible for sear of producing hieavy disagreeable essect on the cheeks as the beauty of crayon picture consists in one colour shiewing itself throughi or rather between another this the student can not too often remark it being the only method of imitating beautiful complexions the eye is the most difficult fcature to execute in crayons as every part must be expressed with the utmost nicety to appear finishied at the same time that the painter must pre- serve its breadth and solidity while he is particularizing the parts to accomplishi this it will be good general rule sfor the student to use his crayon in sweetening as much and his singer as liitle as possible when he wants point to touch small part with he may break off little of his crayon against the box which will produce corner fit to work with in the minutest parts if the eye-lashies are dark he must use some of the carmine and brown oker and the crayon of carmine and black and with these he may also touch the iris of the eye if brown or hazel making broad shadow caused by the eye-lasni red tints of vermillion carmine and lake will execute the corners of the eye properly but if the eye-lids are too red they will have disagrecable sore appearance the pupil of the eye must be made of pure lamp-black between this and the lower part of the iris the light will catch very strong but it must not be made too sudden but be gently diffused round the pupil tiil it is lost in shade when the eye-balls are sufficiently prepared the shining speck must be made with pure white erayon which should be first broken to point and then laid on firm but as it is possible they may be desective in neatness they should be corrected with pin taking off the redundant parts by which means they may be formed as neat as can be required the difficulty with respect to the nose is to preserve the lines properly determined and at the same time so artfully blended into the check as to express its projection and yet no real line to be perceptible upon close examin- ation in some circumstances it should be quite blendid with the check which appears behind it and determined entirely with slight touch of red chalk the shadow caused by the nose is generally the darkest in the whole face partaking of no reflection from its furrounding parts carmine and brown oker carmine and black and such brilliant crayons will compose it best the student having before prepared the lips with the strongest lake and carmine must with these colours make them compleatly correct and when finishing intro¬ duce the strong vermillions but with great caution as they are extremely predominant this if properly touched will give the lips an appearance equal if not superior to those executed in oils notwithstanding the seeming supe¬ riority the latter has by means of glazing of which the former is entirely destitute when the student paints the neck he should avoid ex- pressing the muscles too strong in the stem nor should the bones appear too evident on the chest as both have an un¬ pleasing effect denoting violent agitation of the body circumstance seldom necessary to express in portrait painting the most necessary part to be expressed and which should ever be observed even in the most delicate subjects is strong marking just above the place where the collar bones unite and if the head is much thrown over the shoulders some notice should be taken of the large muscle that rises the method with which painters in oil express transparency in the lips is by painting them first with light vermillion tints and when dry touchint them over with pure lake from behind the ear and is inserted into the pit between the collar bones all inferior muscles should be in general quite avoided the student will sind this caution neces- sary as most subjects especially thin persons have the muscles of the neck much more evident than would be judicious to imitate as sew necks are too long it may be necessary to give some addition to the stem fault on the other side being quite unpardonable nothing being more ungraceful than short neck in colouring the neck let the student preserve the stem of pearly hue and the light not so strong as on the chest if any part of the breast appears its transparency must also be expressed by pearly tints but the upper part of the chest should be cosoured with heautiful vermillions delicately blendid with the other of the materials hhe perfection of the crayons consists in great meafure in their softnefs for it is impossible to execute brilliant picture with them if they are otherwise on which account great care should be observed in the preparing them fo pre- vent their being hard-in all compositions slake white and white lead should be wholly rejected because the slightest touch with either of these will unavoidably turn black the usual objection to crayon paintings is that they are subject to change but whenever this happens it is entirely owing to an injudicious use of the above-mentioned whites which will stand only in oils to obviate the bad effects arising from the use of such crayons let the student make use of common whiting prepared in the following manner take large vessel of water put the whiting into it and mix them well together let this stand about half minute then pour off the top into another vessel and throw the gritty sediment away let what is prepared rest about minute and then pour it off as before which will purisy the whiting and render it free from all dirt and grittiness when this is done let the whiting settle and then pour the water from it after which lay it on the chalk to dry and keep it for use either for white crayons or the purpose of preparing tints with other colours for with this all other tints may be safely prepared the student must be provided with large slexible pallet- knife large stone and muller to levigate the colours two or three large pieces of chalk to absorb the moisture from the colours aster they are levigated piece of flat glafs to prevent the moisture from being absorbed too much till the colours are rolled into form and vessels for water spirits as necessity and convenience snall direct reds carmine and lake it is rather difficult to procure either good carmine or good lake good cermine is inclined to the vermillion tint and should be an impalpable powder and good lake to the carmine tint the carmine crayons are prepared in the sollowing manner as their texture is inclinable to hardness instead of grinding and rolling them take à sufficient quantity of carmine lay it upon the grinding-stone mix it with levigating knife with spirits of wine till it becomes smooth and even yet the less friction produced by the knife the better the chalk-stone being ready lay the colour upon it to absorb the spirit but be careful that it is laid on in proper shape for painting the simple colour being prepared the next step is to compose the disserent tints by mixture with whiting the proportion to be observed consisting of twenty gradations to one which may be clearly understood by the following directions take some of the simple colour and levigate it with spirits of wine adding about one part of wasnied whiting to three parts of carmine of which when properly incorporated make two parcels the next gradation should be composed of equal quantities of carmine and whiting of which sour crayons may be made the third composition should have one fourth carmine and three fourths whiting of this make six crayons which will be good proportion with the rest the last tint should be made of whiting very faintly tinged with carmine of which make about eight crayons which will compleat the abovementioned proportion though these tints made with whiting may be rolled yet the pure carmine will not bear it but must he lest on the chalk-stone till persectly dry lake ls colour very apt to be hard to prevent which the student must observe the following particulars take about half the quantity of lake intended for the crayons and grind it very sine with spirits of wine let it dry and then pulverize it which is easily done if the lake is good then take the other half and grind it with spirits after which mix it with the pulverized lake and lay it out directly in crayons on the chalk the colour will not bear rolling the simple colour being thus prepared proceed with the compound crayons as directed before and in the same degrees of gradation as the carmine tints vermillion or native cinnabar the best is inclined to the carmine tint to prepare this colour mix it on the stone with soft water or spirits aster which it may be rolled into crayons blues prussian blue is colour very apt to bind and is rendered soft with more difficulty than carmine and lake the same method of preparation is to be followed with this as directed with respect to lake only it is necessary to grind à larger quan¬ tity of the pure colour as it is chiefly used for painting draperies blue verditer is colour naturally gritty and therefore it is necessary to wasni it well its particles are so coarse as to require some binding matter to unite them otherwise the crayons will never adhere together to accomplish this take quantity sufficient to form two or three crayons to which add piece of slacked plaister of paris about the size of pea mix these well together and form the crayons upon the chalk this blue is extremely brilliant and will be of great use in heightening draperies brilliant greens are produced with great difficulty which may be procured of those who make it their business to prepare them yet the following compositions will be found useful take yellow oker and after grinding it with spirits mix it with the powder of prussian blue then temper it with knife and lay the crayons on the chalk without rolling them besides this use king ’ yellow mixed with prussian blue brown oker and prussian blue the crayons made of these last may be rolled yellows king ’ yellow is the most useful and the most brilliant levigated with spirits of wine and compose the different tints as before directed yellow oker and naples yellow ground with spirits will make useful crayons orange is produced with king ’ yellow and vermillion ground together with spirits and the tints formed as in other cases but no great quantity of them is required browns cullens earth is sine dark brown after six or eight of the simple crayons are prepared several rich compound tints may be roman oker and prussian blue mixed in difserent proportions will be useful produced from it by mixture with carmine in various degrees black carmine and this colour mixed toget ier make useful tints for painting hair several gradations may be produced from each of these by mixture with whiting umber may be treated in just the same manner only it is necessary to levigate it with spirits of wine purples prussian blue ground with spirits and mixed with pulve¬ rized lake will produce good purple carmine thus mixed with prussian blue will produce purple something different from the former various tints may be made from either of these compounds by mixture with whiting black lamp-black is the only full black that can be used with safety as all others are subject to mildew cinnabar mixed with carmine-this is composition of great use and tints made from this with whiting will be found very serviceable carmine and black is another good compound of which five or six gradations should be made some partaking more of the black and others having the carmine most predomi¬ nant besides several tints by mixture with whiting cinnabar and black is also very useful compound from which several different tints should be made prussian blue and black is another good compound and will be sound of singular service in painting draperies it is impossible to lay down rules for forming every tint necessary composition set of crayons there being many accidental compositions entirely dependent on fancy and opinion the student should make it à rule to save the leavings of his colours for of these he may form various tints which will occasionally be useful rolling the crayons and disposing them for painting the different compositions of colours must be cut into proper magnitude after they are prepared in order to be rolled into pastils for the convenience of using them each crayon should be formed in the left hand with the ball of the right first formed cylindrically and then tapered at each end if the composition is too dry dip the finger in water if too wet the composition must be laid upon the chalk again to absorb more of the moisture the crayons should be rolled as quick as possible and when finished must be laid upon the chalk again to absorb all remaining moisture after the gradation of tints from one colour is formed the chalk and the grinding-stone should be well scraped and cleansed with water before it is used sor another colour when the set of crayons is compleated according to the rules prescribed they should be arranged in classes for the convenience of painting with them some thin drawers divided into number of partitions is the most convenient method of disposing them properly the crayons should be deposited according to the several gradations of light the bottom of the partitions must be covered with bran as bed for the colours because it not only preserves them clean but prevents their breaking the box made use of when the student paints should be about foot square with nine partitions in the upper corner on the left hand supposing the box to be in the lap when he paints let him place the black and grey crayons those being the most seldom used in the second partition the blues in the third the greens and browns in the first partition on the left hand of the second row the carmines lakes vermillions and all deep reds the yellows and orange in the middle and the pearly tints next and as these last are of very delicate nature they must be kept very clean that the gradations of colour may be eafily distinguished in the lowest row let the first partition con¬ tain piece of fine linen rag to wipe the crayons with while they are using the second all the pure lake and vermillion tints and the other partitions may contain those tints which from their complex nature can not be classed with any of the former encaustic painting tiis method of painting has been little practised in england for the information of the curious we give the following directions which will enable them to produce with ease picture in this very curious manner the first method is described in letter from mr. febroni the inventor published in maty review for mr. lewis of gottenbrun has lately executed picture according to my manner it is done upon wood prepared with wax and is remarkable for the vivacity and splendour of its colours believe have already mentioned to you in what this new manner consists you melt or rather dissolve some good white wax in naptha petrolei without colour till such time as the mixture has acquired by cool¬ ing the appearance of an oil beginning to freeze mix your colours in this and then keep them in small tin boxes ou dilute them more or less with the same naptha ac- cording as they dry or as you wisn to use them this painting allows time enough to give all the finishing you desire and if you wisfi to work in haste you may dry as fast as you please by exposing it to the heat when the picture is finished it is of that fine tone which is preferable to any varnish but if you choose varnisn only warm the picture and the naptha will evaporate when this is done you must wait till the picture cools when you must polishi it by rubbing it over neatly with cloth if vou wishi to have it still brighter you must melt white wax on the fire without suffering it to boil mix little naptha with this and draw layer of it over the picture already heated by means of brazier which you hold under if the picture is small or before it if it is large the colours at first appear spoiled but you restore them to their first beauty if when the layer of wax is cooled you polisn it by rubbing with cloth it is then that the colours take the high tone of oil lf vou fear the effect of fire for your picture you are to make soap of wax which is to be done by boiling white wax in water in which you have dissolved twentieth part naptha petrolei is bituminous kind of oil issuing out of certain rocks in the territory of modena there are three forts more or less pure and colourless of the weight of the wax of marine alkali or sel de sourde very pure rub your picture with this soap and when it is dry polish it as before-mentioned if you do not choose either of these methods give your painting its usual var- nisn of sandarac and spirit of turpentinc this method has been found preferable to all those that have been tried and superior to oil for the beauty of their colours there are many fine colours which can not be used in oil which may be made use of with great success in this method as the naptha entirely evaporates one may be asfured that this is the true method or painting in wax there is likewise much to hope for the duration of the pictures painted in this manner as wax is much less liable to altera¬ tion than oil and does not so easily part with its phlogiston the ancient grecian method of painting by emma jane greenland take an ounce of white wax and the same weight of gum mastick in lachrymae that is as it comes from the tree which must be reduced to coarse powder put the wax in glazed earthen vessel over very slow fire and when it is quite dissolved strew in the mastick little at time stirring the wax continually until the whole quantity gold pallet was on this occasion voted to emma jane greenland november by the society at london for the encouragement of arts manufactures and commerce of gum is persectly melted and incorporated then throw the paste into cold water and when it is hard take it out of the water wipe it dry and beat it in one of mr. wedgwood ’ mortars observing to pound it at first in linen cloth to absorb some drops of water that will remain in the paste and would prevent the possibility of reducing it to powder which must be so sine as to pafs through thick gauze it should be pounded in cold place and little while at à time as after long beating the friction will in degree soften the wax and gum and instead of their becoming powder they will return to paste make some strong gum arabick water and when you paint take little of the powder some colour and mix them together with the gui-water light colours require but à small quantity of the powder but more of it must be put in proportion to the body and darkness of the colours and to black there should be almost as much of the powder as colour having mixed the colours and no more than can be used before they grow dry paint with fair water as is practised in painting with water colours ground on the wood being first painted of some proper colour prepared in the same manner as is described for the picture walnut-tree and oak are the forts of wood commonly made use of in italy for this purpose the painting should be very highly finished otherwise when varnisned the tints will not appear united when the painting is quite dry with rather hard brush passing it one way varnisn it with white wax which is put into an earthen vessel and kept melted over very slow fire till the picture is varnissied taking great care the wax does not boil afterwards hold the picture before fire near enough to melt the wax but not make it run and when the varnissi is entirely cold and hard rub it gently with linen cloth should the varnisn blister warin the picture again very slowly and the bubbles will subside when the picture is dirty it need only be washied with cold water the venetian method of colouring by timothy sheldrake efa the method of painting practised in the venetian school ee the cloth was primed with colours in distember of brownisn hue such as would properly enter into the darkest parts of the picture the most transparent colours are the properest believe umber was most generally used broken with red vellow or blue according to the tint intended to be produced and diluted with chalk or whiting to the proper degree of strength upon the ground so prepared the subject was correcty drawn with umber pure or mixed with lake blue or black and with the same colours those shadows that were darker than the ground were then painted in the artist then painted the lights with pure white in solid body where the light was brightest or where the full effect of colour was to be produced and where the demi-tints were afterwards to be scumbling it thinner by degrees till it united with the shadows in this manner the chiaro-oscuro was finished as much as possible and the local colour of every object in the picture the greater silver pallet was voted to mr. sheldrake sor this disser- tation on painting in oil in by tne society instituted at london for the encouragement of arts manusactures and commerce glazed over it all the colours used in this part of the work were ground in oil which was absorbed into the ground the picture remaining flat something like picture in water-colours or crayons it was then varnissied till saturated with varniss and the full of every colour brought out the picture was then complete upon the most superficial view of this process it will be evident that picture painted by it is as to all visible pro¬ perties varnish picture for the small quantity of oil that had been used sunk into the ground and never could rise again to be hurtsul while the varnisn being laid on after the colours gave them all the brilliancy and durability they could derive from that vehicle without being liable to the objections that are made to painting in varnissi supposing it to be used in the same manner as oil is in painting with oil it is true that this mode of painting is itself liable to some objections these have endeavoured to obviate and shall therefore mention hereafter here it may be observed that as any varnisn may be used it is to this circuistance we must attribute the different degrees of durability in pictures of the venetian school have seen some that would resist the most powerful solvents while others were destroyed by the weakest though all possessed the apparent properties that distinguish the venetian pictures from all others as do not pretend to degrade painting to the rank of mechanical art that may be infallibly practised by receipt shall be permitted to observe that this was the general system of the venetian school wlich have seen variously modified in the works of different artists of that as well as of the flemissi which is derived froi it it is susceptible of an almost infinite number of modifications in proportion to the talents the judgment of and the objects to be painted by the artists who may adopt it this being the case if it is proved by experiment that effects similar to those of the venetian pictures may be produced by this method and that the system has strong tendency to produce that bril- liancy and harmony of colouring as is so much admired with more certainty and facility than those qualities can be obtained by any other mode of painting once afked sir joshua reynolds by what circumstances in the management of picture he thought the harmony of colouring was to be producedp he replied an unity of light and an unity of shadow should pervade the whole he explained to me the difficulty of reducing the various colours of all the objects that may be included in picture and the various modifications of those colours to the simple harmo- nious state he described and illustrated what he had said by this simile picture to possess harmony of colouring should look as if it was painted with one colour suppose umber and white and when the chiaro-oscuro was com¬ plete the colour of each object should be glazed over it observation from such authority was impressed with peculiar force on my mind and if can retrace its perations on fubject which has so long engaged my atten¬ tion should say sir joshua ’ observation was the clue that guided me through all my experiments and hope will enable me to prove that the beautiful and simple practice which he suggested as à simile was literally the practice of that school upon whose works his ideas of colouring were founded at the same time may observe that the fact seems to have eluded his observation or he would not have used it as comparison to simplisy his description of practice which he thought both difficult and complex in the newfonian doctrine of light and colours it is believed that all colours are inherent in light and are ren- dered visible by the action of various bodies which reflect particular rays and absorb the rest without disputing the truth of this doctrine it is to be obserred that painter must consider the objects he represents as being analogous to the materials he uses to represent them and in this view of the subject colour is to be considered as property inherent in bodies which is rendered visible by the contact of light colourless or at least mono- coloured substance and shadow the mere privation light picture may reprefent either groupe of figures or other objects in room or any objects in the open air whatever the situation may be it reprefents certain objects in given space possessing individually their peculiar colours and generally exposed to the operations of light the quantity of light each can receive must depend upon its form and its position respecting that part whence the light comes for in proportion as other parts recede fromn the light the shadow becomes visible but shadow is no¬ thing but privation of light and privation of colour in pro- portion as the light is diminished some attention to these circumstances will perhaps enable us to demonstrate the truth of sir joshiua ’ position if globe of one colour be exposed in painter ’ room properly darkened that part which is nearest the light will partake of its colour the next part will shew the true colour of the object that which first recedes from the light will be à little obscured the next little more and so on progressively till that part which is farthest from the light will lose its colour and appear equally dark with the shadiest part of the room now we know this globe is of one unifori colour the variations we see in disserent parts of it are only deceptions occasioned by the accession of light in some parts and the privation of it in others what is true of this one object and its parts would be equally true of any number of objects whatever their colours or relative situations might be if they were placed together in the same room each would possess its own indvidual colour each would partake of the general light in proportion to its situation and of the general darkness in proportion as it recedes from the light all this may be easily conceived but the difficulty and in the ordinary modes of painting ferious one it is is to represent such objects with the appearance of trutà and preserve the har- mony necessary to constitute whole the venetian painters however by whatever means they obtained their knowledge discovered method so simple that perhaps no other can produce such brilliant effects and undoubtedly not with facility and certainty at all comparable with their ’ the artist will remark that in describing the whole of the venetian method of painting have said nothing of the manner of producing those demi-tints which conduce so much to the brilliancy of picture which are so difficult to execute and in which he most frequently fails those tints are in the ordinary modes of painting produced by the mixture of black grey blue or brown according to the judgment of the artist with the local colours of the objects it is these tints which from their being made with such colours it is difficult to get clear and which never are so clear in any other as in the venetian and in some of the flemisn pictures which are painted upon ana- logous principles the fact is that those painters pro- duced all such tints without the admixture of any colour to represent them and by method so like that by which they are produced in nature that this circumstance alone ensures degree of brightness to their colours and of harmony to their shadows that it is perhaps impossible to produce in an equal degree by any other mode of painting it is à singular fact which have not skill in physies to be able to account for though by numerous experiments have ascertained beyond contradiction that if upon any degree of brown between the deepest and the lightest brown yellow we paint pure white in gradations from the solid body to the lightest tint that can be laid on all the tints between the solid white and the ground will appear to be grey intense in proportion to the depth of the ground and the thinnefs of the white laid upon it but in every case all the tints laid upon one ground will harmonize with each other and form one connected chain if may use the expression which will persectly unite the highest light with the darkest shade if then we examine the component substances of venetian picture we shall sind the lighter parts consist only of white to represent the light and of the local colours of the objects it represenis the demi-tints are imitated by an appearance almost as deceptive as the similar appearances in nature but in every other method of painting these demi-tints are produced by mixing some dusky colour with the local colours and the light the comparison of these inethods will afford demonstrative reason why the vene- tian must be brighter than any other mode of painting having shewn as near to à demonstration as the nature of the subject will perhaps admit why those parts of venetian picture that are connected with light and colours are brighter than the corresponding parts of any other pictures it remains to explain the cause of similar superi- ority in the darker parts of the same pictures it has been said with much confidence that as wlite represents light so black is the representative of darkness but though this may be true in physies it certainly is not so in painting for the painter ’ art is to represent objects as they appear in point of colour to be not as they really are thus if know an object is perfectly black and am to reprefent it as it appears to be at the distance of fisty feet black from the pallet will not produce good imitation of it because the interposition of sisty feet of the atmosphere will cause it to appear of colour disserent froi what it really is and vice versa if we go into cavern cellar or room so darkened that the colour of no object can be distinctly seen and if we there hold any solid black sub- stance near to the eye the disference will be visible at once the black object will be immdiately distinguished by its solidity and colour from the surrounding space and such remote objects as may be obscurely visible through it these objects actually possess their individual colours and only appear indistinctly from the absence of light the black object may appear solid and of that colour from its proximity to the eye but the circumjacent ones will appear of colour perfectly distinct from it more or less transparent in proportion to their distance from the eye and shewing portion of their individual colours according to the quantity of ill-defined light that may be admitted thus we see if may venture to mention so notorious à truism that shadows are nothing real they only seem to exist in the absence of light and give to objects an ill-defined appearance distinct from though in some instances mixed with light and colours in disserent degrees but as the painter must represent this appearance by something real he chooses the colours most analogous viz browns and the most transparent of their class to represent this transparent but imperfectly defined appear- ance in nature it has been supposed that the venetian painters had some peculiarly rich and transparent brown colour which is seen to pervade all the works of that school the effect of which no modern artist has been able to imitate and which therefore is supposed to have been lost is it not very probable that colour so common as to pervade the works of the worst as well as of the best artists of that school should be so unaccountably lost and as the effect attributed to it may be easily produced by the mode of painting have described it is not unreasonable to conclude that this much-lamented colour has never existed it is well known that chalk and other earths of the same kind lose when wetter much of their whitenefs and become semi-transparent it is equally certain that if umber or other earths are mixed with chalk and saturated with varnisn after they are laid on the cloth they in like manner become diaphanous and are infinisely more bril- liant than the same colours can be when mixed with white lead and oil this seems on good grounds to have been the basis of the venetian method of painting and all its peculiar efsects at least if may draw any conclusion srom the numerous experiments have made but if artists whose talents will enable them to repeat those experiments to the hest advantage should be induced to do so the fact will be determined in the most satisfactory manner may now be permitted to say it is difficult if not impossible to conceive à theory more simple more beauti- ful or more true than that of sir joshua reynolds it is certainly impossible to form practice more simple or more conformable to that theory than the one have described as will be evident on recapitulating the particulars the artist having determined what hue should pervade his picture formed his ground with that colour prepared in distemper upon this the subject was drawn and the darker shades painted in with transparent colours which sunk into the ground with pure white he then painted in all the lights and demi-tints and lastly glazed in the colours each in its place upon applying the varnisn the darker shades were as to body incorporated with the ground and thus though different in colour appeared thinner and more transparent than any colours could be when laid upon any ground the sull effect of every colour was brought out and the picture was complete whoever has been accustomed to paint or to mark the progrefs of painting in the common way and will reslect on the practice of the method have described by artisis who had been brought up to it must see that such artists would paint with degree of facility expedition and certainty as to effect that could never be equalled in the ordinary way of painting in oil besides it will be evident that an artist would not onsy paint picture himself with more facility but if he had occasion could employ number of subordinate artists upon large works and put those works out of hand with more uniformity as to merit and effect than if he were to employ such affistants in similar works if they were to be painted in the common way am sensible how litile attention will and perhaps ought to be paid to observations on painting if made by those who are not professionally artists for practical men acquire kind of knowledge that can never be obtained in any other way but at the same time they contract preju- dices that often prevent them from sully investigating any novelty in practice that may be offered to their notice the speculative man on the contrary who investigates the properties of matter unshackled by practical preju dices and with ideas purely chemical or philosophical will be more likely to ascertain all the facts relative to any theory that may become the object of enquiry in this way hope have proceeded in this investigation have endeavoured to consider pictures as masses of matter pos¬ sessing the properties but differing from each other in degree of brilliancy transparency and duration ought perhaps here to take leave of the subject but it may be expected that should give an account of the manner in which the pictures were painted have already mentioned that there are some difficulties in the method of painting have described as being that of the old artists and which would form objections of considerable force to the practice of it by artists who are well acquainted with the usual modes of painting these difficulties are first the ground absorbs the oil from the colours so fast that they are not so manageable as in oil- painting secondly the effect of the picture is not seen till the finishing varnish is laid on and thirdly as the effect is not seen till the picture is finished it will some¬ times disappoint the artist and in that case it will be dif- ficult if at all practicable to alter it as believe the process have described in the beginning of this paper is similar to that of miss provis the artists who are acquainted with her recipe can afcertain whether my conjectures on this subject are right or not am certain at least that these difficulties occurred in my attempts to paint and to obviate them adopted the sol¬ lowing process prepared the ground in distemper and painted the dark parts in the way have described then varnisned the ground with the copal oil-varnissi till it was fully saturated and by this means the full effect of that part of the picture was seen upon this painted the lighter parts with white using much of the vehicle where the colour was thin and little in the folid parts leaving the white in them dead by this means understood the effect of my chiaro oscuro as saw the effect of the demi-tints nearly as well as when the picture was finished upon this glazed the colours in the way have described in the beginning of this and finished the picture often found probably from want of practice that the effect was different from what intended as the effect of the colours added to that of the chiaro ofcuro produced an essential alteration in the whole as took care in general that the defect did not arise from too much white added more where it was deficient and glazed freshn colours over it which united perfectly with what had been done before and did not give the appearance of mended picture if the defect was from too much white glazed on it colour similar to that of the ground painted with fresn white upon that and glazed the proper colours over it in this way sound could alter the picture but not so well as in the former case found could when necessary increase the effect of the picture by painting on the principal mass or maffes of light with the local colours only mixed with white as this practice brought those parts more forward by making them appear solid and thus contrasting them with the transparency of the rest of the picture in this way could use the colours tempered with copal varnissi without difficulty and believe that if had been accustomed to paint large pictures could have painted one as large as lise with the same ease method and process or transferring paintings by mr. robert salmon. the first thing to be attended to either for paintings on plaster walls or ceilings or from boards is that the place in which they are be secure from wet or damp if the paintings are on old walls in large buildings and places where this can not be aftained by art then the summer season should be taken for the purpose as the picture would rarely escape damage if the wet or damp gets at it while under the process at the same time caution should be taken that the room or place be not over-heated which would also produce equally bad effects these precautions taken the next thing is to examine the face of the paint- ing if there are any holes in the same they must be carefully filled up with paste or putty of glue and whiting this if the holes are large should be twice or thrice done so as to entirely fill up and leave the face even and smooth but if there are any bruised places with paint still remaining the great silver pallet was voted to mr. robert salmon sor this discovery by the society sor the encouragement of arts manufactures and commerce dec. the face of the bruised parts then this stopping must not be applied but the securing canvass hereaster described be pressed down into these places in the places that are stopped there will of course appear blemishies when the picture is transferred but the process is rendered much more certain and sure by being so done attention must next be paid to lay down any blisters or places where the paint is leaving the ground this is done by introdueing between the paint and the ground some very strong paste of slour and water and the face of the blistered paint being damped with wet sponge or pencil it may then be pressed with the hand home to the ground to which it will then adhere all the unsound places being thus secured care must be taken to clear the face of any grease or dirt as also of any particles of the paste that may happen to be left on the surface the next thing is to determine the size of the painting meant to be taken off and if on plain surface board of the size of the picture must be procured of not less than an inch in thickness and framed together with well-seasoned wood in small pannels smooth and flushi on one side this done piece of fine open canvass must be provided such as the finest sort used for hanging paper on this canvass to be made somewhat larger than the picture and so sewed together and the seam pressed that it be persectly smooth and even this is what call the securing-canvass which being so prepared is then stuck on the face of the picture with paste made of strong beer boiled till it is half reduced and then mixed with sufficient quantity of flour to give it very strong consist- ence to large pictures on walls or ceilings the canvass must for some time be pressed and rubbed with the hand as smooth as possible working it from the middle to the out- side so as to make it tolerably tight and observing as it dries to press it with the hand or cloth into any hollow or bruised places so that it may adhere to every part of the painting this done it is left to dry which it will mostly do in day or two when dry second canvass of stronger and closer sort and of the same size as the other is in like manner to be attached on the top of the first this last will want very little attention as it will readily adhere to the first and being dry attention must be paid to the face thereof to take off any small knots or uneven¬ nefs thereon which done the whole should be again covered with thin paste of size and whiting when dry to be pumiced over so as to make the whole perfectly smooth and even the painting being thus secured the board already prepared to the size of the picture is to be put with the smooth side against the face thereof so as exactly to cover as much as is-intended to be transferred the edges of the canvass which as before directed are left larger than the painting are then to be pulled tight over and closely nailed to the edge of the board if the painting be large either on ceiling or walls the board must by proper supports be firmly fixed against the picture so that it can readily be lowered down when the plaster and painting is detached the canvass and board being fixed the paintings from walls or ceilings are to be freed together with certain portion of the plastering this with proper care and atten¬ tion may be readily done if on ceiling the first thing is to make some holes through the plastering round the outside of the board and painting and with small saw to saw the plastering from one hole to another till the whole is disunited from the other parts of the ceiling this done the workman must get at the upper side of the ceiling where he must free the plastering from the laths by break- ing off the keys thereof and with chissel cut out the laths whereby the plastering together with the picture will be left resting on the board and supports if there be apartments over the ceiling the readiest way will be to take up sew of the floor boards above if next the roof means may always be found to get into the fame and although at first this operation may appear difficult vet it is presumed no difficulty will be found by any ingenious workman if the painting is on brick or stone wall the same must be cut away at top and down the sides of the painting and then by means of chissels or saws in wood handles of different lengths the wall must be cut away quite behind the painting leaving the same together with the plaf¬ tering resting on the board this operation may sometimes be done with saw or if the wall be not thick nor the other side of much consequence the bricks or stones may be taken out from that side leaving the plastering and painting as before this last method have not practised the other of cutting away some part of the wall have and see no difficulty or very great labour in the operation but that of course must be various according to the texture of the wall and mortar if paintings are on curved furfaces such as the coves of ceilings then the only difference of operation is that some ribs of wood must be cut out and boarded smooth to the eurve of the surface of the painting and then fixed up thereto in place of the before described bearing board the painting is then to be freed and left with the plastering resting on the bearers for paintings painted on wainscot or boards the same securing and process is exactly followed only that as the wainscot or board can always be cut to the size wanted or laid horizontal the securing canvass is stretched thereon and turned over the edges of the same till it is dry after which the edges are again turned up and nailed to the board in the same manner as those from walls having as before described in any of the aforementioned cuses freed the paintings from their original places you have then got them secured to two thicknesses of canvass with their faces next and on to the board prepared for that purpose which being the case they can readily be re- moved to any room or shop to be finishied as sollows having got the painting into the shop or room which should be moderately warm and dry but by no means over¬ heated laying the board on bench or tressels the back of the picture will be uppermost and the plastering or wood as may happen is then to be cleared away leaving nothing but the body of paint which will be firmly attached to the securing canvass to perform this large rasp narrow plane and chissels will he requisite this operation is dif- ficult to describe but would soon be learnt by any one who makes the attempt nor is it very tedious and being per- formed the picture is ready to be attached to its new can¬ vass as follows the painting being cleared and laying on the board the back thereof is to be painted successively three or four times over with any good strong-bodied paint leaving each coat to dry before the other comes on day or two between each will generally be found sufficient each of these coats and particularly the first should be laid on with great care taking but small quantity in the brushi at time and laying it very thin this precaution is necessary to prevent any of the oil or paint from searching through any small cracks or holes that may happen to be in the face of the picture which would run into the paste and so attach the securing canvass to the picture as to prevent its being afterwards got off if any of these holes or cracks are observed they should be stopped up with the glue and whiting paste and the painting then repeated till com¬ plete coat is formed on the back of the picture and it is then ready for attaching to its canvass which is done by spreading all over the picture à paste made of copal varnissi mixed with stiff white lead and small quantity of any other old fat paint all which being spread equally over with pallet knife such canvass as the first securing- canvass is laid thereon and strained and nailed round the edges of the board in which state it is left till it becomes tolerably dry and then second canvass of stronger fort must be in like manner attached on the first and left till it is perfectly dry and hard this mostly takes about two months and the louger it is left the more secure the painting will be attached to its canvass and less liable to crack or sly therefrom when sufficiently dry all the four canvasses are to be unnailed from the board and the edges turned up the reverse way and nailed to proper stretching frame this is done by unnailing from the board part on each side at à time and immediately nailing it to the stretching frame so as never to leave the canvass to rack or partially stretch which would damage the picture in this manner by degrees the cloths are entirely detached from the board and firmly fixed on the stretching frame the superfluous left larger than the frame may then be cut off and the wedges put in the frame and moderately tightened up there remains then only to clear the face of the painting from the securing canvass which is done by repeatedly washing the face with sponge and moderately warm water in doing this no force or violence must be used with frequent and gentle wasnings the paste will all worked out with the sponge the edges of the outer canvass is then to be cut round and stripped off and the other next the face of the picture is to be done in like manner which done there only remains to clear the paste clean off and repair any desects and the picture will be as strong as if painted on the canvass for taking pictures off walls without taking the walls down or cutting away more thereof than the plastering the following process is proposed the face of the picture to be first secured in every respect in the manner before described instead of the plain board bearer should be prepared with convex surface composed of ribs hoarded over so as to form part of cylinder of not less than five seet radius and as long as the height of the picture this bearer being prepared in order to apply it floor or platform should be erected and placed horizontally with its surface level and its edge immediately in contact with thie bottoin of the picture meant to be transferred the use of this platformn is for the above-described bearer to rest and move upon which bearer should be set on its end with one edge in contact with the wall at one side of the picture consequently the other edge will be at some distance from the wall according to the size of the picture and convexity of the bearer being thus placed the super- fluous edge of the securing-canvass should be turned over and nailed to that edge of the bearer that is next the wall this done the operation of cutting away the plastering should be begun which may be done with the corner and end of fhort saw by sawing between the brick-work and plastering leaving the thick ness or part of the thicknefs of the plastering on to the painting fastened to the bearer and when this edge of the picture is fieed the whole height for nine or ten inches under the edge of the bearer that is furthest from the wall must then be gently forced nearer consequently the other edge together with the painting and plaster that is freed will leave the wall and give an opportunity of introdueing the saw behind and cutting away the same to certain distance further under and by repeating this the whole of the picture will at last be freed and left on the bearer each time the bearer is removed and as it is were rolled on the vertical surface of the wall care must be taken to turn and nail the securing- canvass on the top and bottom edges of the bearer so as to secure the freed plastering and picture from moving about and lastly before the bearer and painting be moved to nail the other edge of the picture in the same way which will secure the whole to the bearer this done the picture and bearer are at liberty to be moved to proper place in order to be freed from the remaining plaster the edges may then be unnailed and the painting and canvass slipped from this bearer on to plain board and the new canvass then put on and remain till dry as in other cases it may appear that the bending of the canvass and plaster- ing to the convex bearer will crack the plaster and damage the painting but from experience have observed that to curve of such or even less radius plastering will bend without any visible crack even on the exterior part thereof and that part next the bearer not having occasion in bend¬ ing to extend its parts will confequently be much less liable to be disturbed by such bending
