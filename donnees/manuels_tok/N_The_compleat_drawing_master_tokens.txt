useful art may be attained in short time without master tained in short time without master london printed for henry parker opposite birchin-lane cornhill mdcc.lxiii the compleat drawing-master the principles or drawing or drawing in general drawing is the art of representing the ap pearances of objects by imitation or expressing by lines and shades the form or appearance of any thing in nature or art the copying of another draught or any design conceived in the mind and all this without the assistance of ma thematical rules the art of drawing being an accomplishment not more ele gant agreeable and ornamental than useful is therefore by no means to be neglected in the education of youth wherein any genius or inclination that way is discovered besides its being of all other arts the most universally admired and esteemed there are few other arts or professions to which it is not assisting its great use is not confincd to painters engravers gardeners embroiderers ers weavers and many others concerned in designing but the mathematician engineer architect and navigator daily practise it all designs and models are executed in it its use appears in every station of life and it is equally admired by children and by adults to be able on the spot to take the sketch of fine building or beautiful prospect of any curious production of art or uncom mon appearance in nature is not only very desirable accomplish ment but very agreeable amusement rocks mountains fields woods rivers cataracts cities towns castles houses fortifi cations ruins or whatever else may present itfelf to view on our journies or travels in our own or in foreign countries may be thus brought home and preserved for our future ufe either in bu finess or conversation this art transmits to our view things that are long since past or would otherwise perish represents to us the deeds of people and nations for many ages dead and pre serves the features and resemblances of ancestors or other valu able perfons for many generations it is therefore no wonder that an attainment so universally useful and admired should be dis tinguished as one of the highest embellishments of human life and be patronized and cultivated by all the denerous and ingenious part of mankind chap ii general rules for drawing begin with plain gcometrical figures as lines angles tri angles polygons arches circles ovals cones cylinders and the like being the fundations of all other proportions the circle is of use in the several orbicular forms as the sun moon globes che oval in giving just-proportion to the face and mouth and the square confines picture you are to copy the triangle is of use in drawing side or half face angles and arches in perspective and the polygon in ground-plats fortifica tions the cone in spires steeples tops of towers the cylinder in columns pillars having brought your hand to be fit and ready in general propor tions accumstom yourself to give every object its due shades ac cording to its concavity or convexity and to elevate or depress the same as the object appears either nearer or farther off the light before you begin to work view your original with close attention divide it in your mind into several parts observe the length the breadth and the similitude of cach part consider their proportion to each other and to the whole the distances from one part to the other and what parts lie opposite to each other after you have done your copy view it afresh by comparing it with the original for the discovering and amending of faults as it will not only serve to perfect you in that particular draught but will improve your knowledge of lines and proportions in general and in time enable you for the nearest imitations the out-lines must be drawn in gliding manner large and smooth which will give them the resemblance of life and motion you muft preferve in your draught strong refemblance between the parts and the whole every member ought to be made to agree strong limbs have no relation to consumptive body or decayed old age and the eyes legs hands and feet should be exactly paired having good copies to draw after learn to reduce them to other proportions either larger or smaller and this by frequent practice in drawing fruits as apples pears cherries with their leaves herbs trees of different kinds as also in the imi tation of beasts fowls fishes it is requisite not only to be per fect in laying down the exact proportions but before you procced to the shadowing and trimming your work to be well acquainted in the general or outward lines and this is still more necessary in imi tating the body of man with all its lineaments as head nose eyes ears cheeks arms and shadows as also in the drapery and imitation of the clothing and the artificial setting off ihe outward coverings habit or ornaments of the body in their natural and pro per folds chap iii particular directions for drawing in drawing after picture or print you must take care to place it in such light that the gloss of the colours may not interrupt your view but so that the light and your eye may fall equally and obliquely upon the piece to this end you are to consider from what point and in whar direction the light false upon the objects according to which direction let all your lights and shades be piaced throughout the work that part of the object must be lightest which has the light most directly opposite to it if the light fall sideways on pour picture you must make that side wlich is opposite to it lightest and on the contrary that side which is farthest from ir darkest let the piece be placed ar such distance that upon opening your eyes you may view it all at once and the larger the picture is it should be so much the more placed off at the greater distance but right before you and little reclined draw all your out-lines at firit very faint with coal which may easily be rubbed out again with the feathers of duck wing or crumb of bread and these out-lines should be drawn true and agreeable to the pattern before you begin to shadow any part of the object the out-lines next the light should be drawn more faint and when you have drawn one feature it should be direction for you in some measure to draw another by observing with your eye the distance from that to the next feature making full mark at the place with your coal then draw it and so to the next 'till you have drawn the whole figure then observe the middle of the picture you would copy and touch upon the paper with the point of your coal afterwards ob serve the more conspicuous and uppermost figures if there are more than one which you are to touch lightly in their proper places thus running over the whole drught you will fee as it were the skeleton of the piece to draw having made out these sketches view them diligently to see if they answer your pattern or not for the gestures of the life ought to shew themselves eminently in the first and rudest draught of the piece correct and amend whatever you perceive amiss add ing and diminishing as it varies from the pattern by which means it will be brought nearer and nearer to the life observe the distance of one limb joint or musele from ano ther and the fame in all other accidents of the figure their length breadth turnings shadow next to the light very faintly and where you see bold and free touches be not timo rous in expressing the same in drawing head after the life or otherwise take care to place the features exactly right upon the cross-lines whether it be full face or three-quarter face in shortening you must make the cross-lines to fly upwards but where the aspect is downwards they must be made downwards in circular manner having drawn the out-lines true with coal yon are to proceed to trace the fame lines again with pen indian-ink drawing them with more exactness and by imitating all the hatches with their exact distances one from another their crossings turnings and windings with more boldness and freedom perfect your de sign in drawing after naked body all the muscles are not to be so plainly expressed as in anatomical figures but that side whose parts are most apparent and of signification in the performance of any action must be made to appear more or less according to the force of that action in drawing young persons the muscles must not appear mani festly so hard as in elder and full grown persons the lame thing is to be observed as to fat and fleshy persons and such as are very deli cate and beautiful and in women scarce any muscles at all are to be expressed or but very little unless it be in some very forcible action and then too they are to be represented very faintly tlic like is also to be observed as to children the motion of the whole body must be confsdered in drawing of the muscles as in the rising and falling of the arms the muscles of the breast appear either more or less the hips do the like according as they are bent out ward or inward and it is the same chiefly in the shouldlers sides and neck according to the several actions of the body the breadth and largeness of picture is also to be considered it should be larger about the legs and garments shewing itself flender above by discovering one shoulder and hiding the other which is shortened by turning the body but sometimes the fi gure is to be represented biggest in the upper parts by representing either or both the shoulders or both the arms shewing the one leg and hiding the other or both of them after one manner at discretion neither ought this to be observed only in the whole body but even in every part so that in the legs when muscle is raised outwards on the one side that which is directly on the con trary side must be drawn in and hid as it appears in the life the proportion of the figure ought to be multiplied by degrees in proportion of one to two three four for herein the chief skill consists the diameter of the biggest place between the knee and the foot is double the least and the largest part of the thigh tripple â€” chap iv of the proper materials for drawing the materials required in drawing are black lead pencils crayons of black white or red chalk crow-quill pens rule and compasses camel hair-pencils and indian-ink accus tom yourself to hold your pencil further from the point than you do in writing which will give you better command of it and con contribute to render your strokes more free and bold the use of your pencil is to draw the first sketches or out-lines of your piece as any stroke or tine that is amiss may by this means be more easilly rubbed out than in any other thing and when you have made your sketch as correct as you can with the pencil you may then draw carefully the best out-line you have got wich your crow-quili pen and ink the ink made use of for this purpose must not be the common but indian-ink being much softer than the other and not running and by mixing it with water it may be made to any degree of strength and may be used in pen like common ink after using the ink you may wipe out the pencil-lines by rub bing the piece gently with che crumb of stale bread having thus got your out-line discharged your next work is to shade your piece properly as you shall be directed below either by drawing fine strokes wich your pen where it requires to be shaded or by wash ing it wich the hair-pencil and the indian-ink as tothe rule and compasses they are never or rarely to be used except in measu ring the proportions of your figures after you have drawn them to prove whether they are right or not or in houses fortifications and other pieces of architecture red lead and red or black chalk are used in the fame manner as black lead white chalk and tobacco-pipe clay are used in heightening or giving strong lights and in drawing on coloured pa per pastils or crayons or any other colours mixed with tobac co-pipe clay which while soft and in the consistency of paste is rolled up in pieces about the thickness of quill and two or three inches in length and then dried are generally used on coÂ¬ loured paper and the colours are so rubbed aud wrought one into another in such manner that no strokes appear but the whole looks as if it was done with brush chap or light and shade it is the artful management of light and shade that gives the appearance of subsitance roundness and distance to whatever bodies are represented by drawing draw circle on piece of paper fill it up with any even colour and it will appear to be body with round circumference and flat sides but by colouring it stronger in the middle and causing it gradually to weaken towards the circumference it will receive convex appearance like that of ball or globe where ever the vivacity of colour is strongest that part of ihe object catches the sight first and appears nearest to it whereas its weakness and goines off are more and more broken and faint and seem tu fly farther off from the sight in rounding the parts of any object the extremities in turning must lose themselve insensibly and confusedly without precipitating the light all of sudden into the shadows or the shadows into the light but the passage of the one into the other must be common and impercepti ble that is by degrees of light into shadow and shadow into light objects that are painted light must have sufficient breadth of shadow to sustain them and dark bodies must have sudden light behind to detach them from the ground or from those ob jects that are placed behind them otherwise they will appear con fusedly as sticking upon each other whercas the oppolition of shade to light object and of light to dark one gives pro jection and separates them from other bodies there should be ballance preserved between the lights and sha dows broad light ought not to be introduced into draught with out large shadow the nearer any object is to the eye it is seen so much the stronger and plainer the sight is weakened by distances and the mode remote any object is it is feen in more imperfect manner therefore those objects which are placed foremost to the view ought to be more finished than those that are cast behind and they should have such relative dominion over each other that as one object by its heightenings causes others to retire more back wards fo the fame object must be chased and made to appear farther from the sight than others which are more strongly illuminated it is nor sufficient that remote objects be only coloured in more faint and languid manner but according to their distance the parts must appear more or less confused the eye not being able to discover minutely what is far separated from it pure and unmix' white either draws an object nearer or carries it off ito greater distance if it be accompanied with black the opposition of light and dark renders the object more sensible and brings it nearer to the advanced part but pure white being the lightest of colours unless it be forced forwards and supported by black will fly off to the remotest view as for pure black it is the heaviest most ear thy and most sensible of all colours and brings the objects nearer to the sight it must be placed in masses be insensibly confused and have its proper reposes the representations of bodies give them always such lights are most proper and convenient to their supposed situations if the objects are in the field or open air and the sun invisible or ob scured by clouds you must then introduce almost an universal light though not warm and strong and your shades must be faint but when the sun is conspicuous and shines in it â€™ full lustre then the light must be very strong and bold and the shadows very dark if the objects you represent be supposed in room little but not very much illuminated and you survey it from without and stand on level with the light that strikes upon it the shadows of that figure must be very soft whereby the figure itself will appear beau teous to the eye and will notwithstanding the softnefs of the sha dow seem as imbossed and come boldly out small light illu minating body occasions the shadows on the dark side to be large and their extremities to be very bold on the other hand light makes the shadows on the darker side to be more distinct and more soft in the limitations reflection is to be used in delineating glittering or shining bo dics as glass pearls silver let the cause of the reflection be it more or less be seen in the thing itfelf place all your lights one way through the whole work and if the light fall sideways on the picture the other side which is the farthest from the light must be made the darkest that part of the body must be made lightest which has the light most opposite to it if the light be placed above the head then the top of the head must be made lightest the shoulder must receive the next greater degree of light and thus must you continue to shade losing the light by degrees by how much one part of the body projects more than another it must by so much be made the lighter and on the contrary thode parts that bend inward must be made fo much the darker two equal lights must never be made in one and the same picture the greater is to strike forcibly into the middle and wich greater lustre on those parts of the design where the principal figures and strength of the action seem to lie diminishing it gradually as it approaches near est the extremities of the piece chap vi of drawing faces in drawing head it is usually divided into four equal parts from the crown of the head to the top of the forchead from the top of the forchead to the eye-brows from the eye-brows to the bottom of the nose from thence to the bot tom of the chin but this proportion is not constant those fea tures in different men being often very different as to length and shape in well proportioned face however they are nearly right to direct you therefore in forming perfect face your first bu siness is to draw complete oval in thie middle of which from the top to the bottom draw perpendicular line through the center or middle of this line draw another line directly across from one side to the other of your oval on these two lines all features of the face are to be drawn as follows divide your per pendicular line into four equal parts the first must be allotted to the hair of the head the second is from the top of the foreÂ¬ head to the top of the nose between thhe eye-brows the third is from thence to the bottom of the nose and the fourth in cludes the lips and chin the line across the perpendicular one or the breadth of the face is always supposed to be the length of five eyes you must therefore divide it into five equal parts and place the eyes upon it fo as to leave exactly the length of one eye betwixt them this is to be understood only of full front face for if it turns to either side then the distances are to be lessened on that side which turns from you less or more in proportion to its turning the top of the ear is to rise parallel to the eye brows at the end of the diameter or cross line and the bottom of it must be equal to the bottom of the nose the nostrils ought not to come out farther than the corner of the eye in any face and the middle of the mouth must always be placed upon thie per pendicular line the mouth when shut is as large as an eye the following is an ingenious device which perhaps may some what assist the young practitioner in forming the face according to its different turnings and in placing the featurcs properly thereon procure piece of smooth wood turned for the purpose in the shape of an egg which is nearly the shape of the human head draw line lengthways quite round it and divide this line into two equal parts by another line drawn directly across it at right angles the features being drawn on these two lines according to the rules delivered above will produce fore-right face turn the oval small matter from the left hand to the right and the perpendicular upon which the particular features are to be drawn will appear bent like bow always observing in what manner the nose projects beyond the round of the oval the same must be observed if you turn the oval from the right hand to the left and if you incline the oval downwards and to the right or upwards reclining to the left the lines of the cross and the features drawn on them will in each case leave different appearances and great variety of faces may be shewn by this oval according as you incline recline or turn it more or less but those figures which come sideways are to be drawn by means of perpendicular upon which the forehead nose mouth and chin are to be drawn as before directed it is to be observed that if the face be fat the checks will seem to swell if lean the jaw-bones will stick out and the cheeks fall in but if it be neither too fat nor too lean it will be nearly round touch the features lightly wheere the eyes nose mouth and chin should ftand then begin to draw thein more ex actly and so procced 'till you have finished the face after which draw the hair beard and shadows about it you are to consider all those chief touches which give life to face and that discover the disposition of the mind thus the mouth extended and the cor ners turning little up shews smiling countenance you must take care that the shadows be not made too dark where they should be light because afterwards they can not be rendered more light and remember that they are to be more faint and light in fair than swarthy complexion chap vii of the measures and proportions of the several parts of the body the ancients commonly allowed eight heads to their figures though some of them had but seven however the moderns ordinarily divide their figure into ten faces that is from the crown of the head the sole of the foot in the manner follow ing from the crown of the head to the forehead is the third the face begins at the lowest hairs which are part of the face.the face begins at the lowest hairs which are upon the forehead and ends at the bottom of the chin the face is divided into three proportional parts the first contains the forehead the second the nose and the third the mouth and chin from thie chin to the pit between the collar bones are two lengths of nose from the pit betwixt the collar-bones to the bottom of the breast one face from the bottom of the breast to the navel one face from the navel to the genitals one face from the genitals to the upper part of the knee two faces the knee contains half face from the lower part of knee to the ancle two faces from the ancle to the sold of thie foot half face man when his arms are stretched out is from the longest finger of his right hand to the longest of his left as broad as he is long from one side of the breasts to the other two faces the bone of the arm called humerus is the length of two faces from the shoulder to the elbow from the end of the elbow to the root of the littie finger the bone called cubitus with part of the hand contain two faces from the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit betwixt the collar-bones one face if you will be sa tisfied in the measures of breadth from the extremity of one finger the other so that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body you must observe that the boxes of the elbows with the humerus and of the humerus with the shoulder-blade bear the proportions of half face when the arms are stretched out the tole of the foot is the fisch part of the figure the hand is the length of pace the thumb contains nole the inside of the arm from the place where the muscle disappears which makes the breast called the pectoral muscle to the middle of the arm four noses from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand five noses the longest toe is nose long the two utmost parts of the teats and the pit betwixt the collar-bones of woman make an equilateral triangle for the breadth of the limbs no precise measures can be given because the measures themselves are changeable according to the quality of the persons and according to the movement of the mus cles chap viii of drawing the body at full length first make your oval for che head and having divided it according to the instructions already given draw perpendicular line from the top of the head to the sole of the foot and measure out eight lengths of the head this line is of special use to di rect you in placing the figure upright and in the action of the posture where it falls in and where it swells out one head' length from the chin yon must draw the breasts the third mea sure reacheth to the navel the fourth to the privities the fifth to the middle of the thigh the fixth to the lower part of the knee the seventh to the lower part of the leg and the eighth to the heel and sole of the foot observe in every measure what touches there are of the mus cles draw that leg first on which the body stands then draw the other and after that the arms and hands but draw at first all the parts very lightly with coal only because there is least trouble in altering and rubbing out the coal as for the hands they are twice as long as they are broad and each of their parts has its length breadth and thickness the nail upon the finger is about half the joint it is upon the length of the foot is sixth part of the heighth of person and the length is five eights more than the breadth the length of the face and hands ought to be exactly exactly equal and makes but just the tenth part of person heighth the rules in drawing children are as follow some make child to contain five measures of the head viz from the top of the head to the privities three and in the thighs and legs two more the breadth between the shoulders the length of head and half the breadth of the body above the navel the length of one head and the breadth of the upper part of the thigh is the third part of two lengths of the head the breadth of the knee is just the measure there is betwixt the eyes and the chin the small of the leg and the brawn of the arm are of the thickness of the neck in general let it be obderved always to begin wich the right side of the piece you are copying for by so doing you will always have what is done before your eyes and the rest will follow more natu rally and with greater ease whereas if you begin with the left side your hand and arm will cover what you do first and deprive you of the sight of it by which means you will not be able to pro ceed with so much ease pleasure or certainty as to the order and manner of your procceding in drawing the human body you must first sketch the head then the shoulders in their exact breadth then draw the trunk of the body beginning wich the arm-pits leaving the arms 'till afterwards and so down to the hips on both sides being sure to observe the exact breadth offthe waist when you have done this then draw that leg which the body stands upon and afterwards the other which stands loose then draw the arms and last of all the hands take notice also of the bowings and bendings of the body making the part opposite to that which bends correspond in bending with it for instance if one side of the body bends in the other must stand out answerable to it if the back bend in the bel ly must stick out if the knee bend out the ham must fall in and so of any other joint in the body finally endea vour to form all the parts of your figure with truth and in just proportion not one arm or one leg bigger or less than the other not broad shoulders with thin flender waifs nor raw and bony arms with thick and gouty legs but let therc be kind of har mony mony and agreement amongst the members and an agreeable sym metry throughout the whole figure bur as the essence of all drawing consists in making at first good sketch you must in this particular be very careful and accu rate draw no part perfect or exact 'till you see whether the whole draught be good and when you have altered that to your mind you may then finish one part after another as curiously as you can in drawing the eyes ears legs arms hands feet great care study and pradtice arc requisite this must be learned by carefully imitating the best prints or drawings you can get of eyes ears for as to the mechanical rules of drawing them by lines and measures they are not only perplexed and difficult but also con trary to the practice of the best masters but the actions and pos tures of the hand are so many and various that no certain rules can be given for drawing them that will univerfally hold good and as the hands and feet are difficult members to draw it is necessary and well worth while to bestow some time and pains about them carefully imitating their various postures and actions so as not only to avoid all lameness and imperfection but also to give them life and spirit in drawing labouring man you must represent him wich strong limbs and raised muscles swelling and standing out especially in bearing burdens drawing weights scaping walking combatting or such like violent exercises in representing persons asleep you must carefully avoid giving any such postures or actions in their lying as would not in all probability afford rest for great want of judg ment would appear in representing their limbs or bodies supported by their own force and not by the help of something else with regard to the representation of the passions mr. de piles observes that it is absurd as well as impossible to pretend giving such particular demonstrations of them as to fix their expression to certain strokes which the painter should be obliged to make use of as essential and invariable rules this fays he would be depriving the art of that excellent variety of expression which has no other principal than diversity of imagination the number of which is infinite the same passion may be expressed several ways each yielding more or less pleasure in proportion to the painter â€™ under standing and the spectator discernment though every part of the face contributes towards expressing the sentiments of the heart yet the eye-brow according to mr le brun is the principal seat of expression and where the passions makethemseles most known it is certain says he that the pupil of the eye by its fire and motion very well thows the agitatior of the soul but then it does not express the kind or nature of that agitation whereas the motion of the eye-brow differs according as the passions change their nature to express simple passion the motion is simple to express mixt passion the motion is com pound if the passion be gentle the motion is gentle if it be violent the motion is so too we may farther observe says he that there are two kinds of elevation in the eye-brows one in which the eye-brows rise up in the middle this elevation ex presses agreeable sensations and it is to be observed that then the mouth rises at the corners another in which the eye-brows rise up at the ends and fall in the middle denotes bodily pain and then the mouth falls at the corners in laughter all the parts agree for the eye-brows which fall towards the middle of the forehead make the nose the mouth and the eyes follow the same motion in weeping the motions are compound and contrary for the eye brows fall towards the nose and over the eyes and the mouth ri ses that way it is to be observed also that the mouth is the part of the face which more particularly expresses the emotions of the heart for when the heart complains the mouth falls at the cor ners when it is pleased the corners of the mouth are elevated and when it has an avertion the mouth shoots forward and rises in the middle the head fsays mr. de piles contributes more to the expression of the passions than all the other parts of the body put together those separately can only share some few passions but the head ex presses them all some however are more peculiarly expressed by it than others as humility by hanging it down arrogance by lifting it up languishment by inclining it on one side and ob stinacy with stiff and resulate air makes it stand upright fixed and stiff between the shoulders the head also best shews our sup plications threats mildness pride love hatred joy and grief the whole face and every feature contribute something but more especially the eyes yet though the passions of the soul are most visible in the lines and features of the face they often require al so the assistance of other parts of the body without the hands for instance an action is weak and imperfect their actions which arc almost infinite create numberless expressions it is by them that partly we desire hope promise call and send back they are the insruments of threatening prayer praise by them we in great measure approve condemn refuse admit fear ask express our joy and grief our doubts regrets pain and admiration but to say how these parts must be dilposed for expressing the various passions is impossible nor can any exact rules be given for it both because the task would be infinite and because every one must be guided in this by his own genius and the particular turn of his studies chap xi of drapery in the art of cloathing your figures or casting the drapery upon them with elegance and propriety many things are to be ob served however this art consists chiefly in three points viz the order of the folds or plaits the different quality of the stuffs and the variety of their colours as to the folds they ought to be so managed as that you may easily perceive what it is they cover and distinguish it from any thing else as for instance that you see it is an arm that is under the drapery and not leg or leg and not an arm again the folds ought to be large and con trast should be observed between them otherwise in the first case they break and divide the sight too much and in the next place the drapery will be too stiff as to the quality of the stuffs it should be well confidered some folds being abrupt and harsh while others flow more fsft and easy again the surface of some have lustre while others art flat and dead and some are fine and trans parent while others are firm and solid the variety of colours when well managed makes the greatest beauty in painting some are not equally agreeable wich respect to each other and some are never to be placed near certain others the drapery must never be made to adhere or flick too close to the parts of the body but it must seem to flow round and as it were embrace them yet in such manner as that the figure may be easy and have free motion great lightness and motion of the drapery are only proper figures in much agitation or exposed to wind the nudities of the figure should always be designed be fore you procced to draw the draperies draw the out-lines of the garments lightly then draw the great folds first and stroke these into lesser taking care that they do not cross one another the draperies that cover those parts which are exposed to great light must not be so deeply shaded as to seem to pierce them nor should those members be crossed by folds that are too strong left by the too great darkness of their shades the members look as if they were broken folds in general should be large and as few as possible however they must be greater or less according to the quantity and quality of the stuffs of which the drapery is sup- posed to be made suit the garments to the body and make them bend with the body according as it itands in or out straight or crooked or as it bends one way or another and the closer the garment fits to the body the narrower and smaller must be the folds the quality of the person is asfo to be confidered in the drapery for instance if they are magistrates their draperies onght to be large fine and flowing if country-clowns they ought to be coarse and short and if ladies and nymphs light and soft folds well imagined give much spirit to any kind of action be cause their motion implies the like in the acting member which seems to draw them forcibly and make them more or less stirring as the action is more or less violent an artful complication of folds in circular manner greatly helps the effect of fore-short enings all folds consist of two shades and no more which you may turn with the garment at pleasure shadowing the inner side more deeply the shades in silks and fine linnen are very thick and small requiring little folds and light shadow observe the motion of the air or wind in order to draw the loose apparel alf flying one way and draw that part of the garment that adheres closest to the body before you draw the looser part that flies off from it left by drawing the loose part of the garment first you should mistake the position of your figure and place it awry rich ornaments when judiciously and sparingly used may some times contribute to the beauty of draperies but such ornaments are far below the dignity of angels or heavenly figures the gran deur of whofe draperies ought rather to consist in the boldness and nobleness of the folds than in the quality of the stuff or the glitter of ornaments light and flying draperies are proper only to figures in great motion or in the wind but when in calm place and free from violent action their draperies should be large and flowing that by their contrast and the fall of the folds they may appear with grace and dignity chap or drawing mixed figures in order to draw the form of any beast begin at the forehead with the lead or coal drawing downward the nose mouth upper and neither chap ending the line at the throat then view ing it again from the part where you formerly begun continue it over the head ears and neck till you have given the full com pass of the buttock afterwards mark out the legs and touching out the breast with the eminency thereof finish the tail paws tongue teeth beard and the several shadows in drawing beasts you must be well acquainted with their shape and action without which you will never perform any thing excel lent in this way and whatever beast you draw you must be sure to give sketch of the landskip of the country natural to that beast in drawing birds you are to begin also at the head continuing the breast-line from under the throat down to the legs then begin at the pinion for making the wing this being joined to the back line the figure will be presently finished the eyes legs and tail are to be drawn last the feathers beginning at the head very small must fall backwards one way in five ranks still inceasing till finished instects as flies bees wasps grasshoppers worms and such like are drawn wich great ease providing you for the first time have the original before your eyes in drawing flower begin from the rose-tust or wart in the middle as in rose or marigold with the yellow tust which be ing made draw lines equally divided from thence to the greatest compass or extent of the flower they may be drawn either fully open or in the bud the leaves may first be drawn rudely after wards giving them their veins or jaggedness chap xi or drawing landskips buildings all drawing consists in nicely measuring the distances of each part of your piece by the eye in order to facilitate this you are to imagine in your own mind that the piece you copy is divided into squares as for example suppose or imagine perpendicular and an horizontal line crossing each other in the center of the pic ture you are to copy then suppose also two such lines crossing your own copy observe in the original what parts of the design those lines intersect and let them fall on the fame parts of the sup posed lines in your copy if you are to draw landskip from na ture take your station on rising ground where you may have large horizon and mark your tablet into three divitions down wards from the top to the bottom and divide in you own mind the landskip you are to take into three divisions also then turn your face directly opposite to the midst of the horizon keeping your body fixed and draw what is directly before your eyes up on thie middle division of your tablet then turn your head but not your body to the left hand and delineate what you view there joining it properly to whiat you had done before lastly do the same by what be seen on your right-hand laying down every thing exactly both with respect to distance and proportion make the nearest objects in your piece the hightest and those that are further off to shoot away lower till they come almost level with the line of the horizon lessening every thing propor tionably to its distance and observing also to make your object fainter and less distinct the farther they are removed from your eye make all your light and shades fall one way and let every thing have its proper motion as trees shaken by the wind the small boughs bending more and the large one less water agitated by the wind and dashing against ships or boats or falling from pre cipice upon rocks and stones and spurting up again into the air and sprinkling all about clouds also in the air now gathered with the winds now violently condensed into hail rain and the like always remembering that whatevers motions are caused by the wind must all be made to move the same way let the work imitate the season it is intended to represent as if you intend it for winter piece represent the selling of woods sliding upon the ice fowling hunting making the trees every where naked or laden with snow or hoar frost the earth bare the air thick or heavy the water froze with carts passing over it let every scite have uts propoer adjuncts or additional graces as the farm-house wind-mill water-mill woods flocks or sheep herds of cattle pilgrims ruins of temples castles and monu ments with thousand other things propoer to particular sub jects s
