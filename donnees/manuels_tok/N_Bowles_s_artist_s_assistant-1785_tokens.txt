if not with the theory at leatt with the practical part of what they underrook to teach others and thar the instructions they have given were founded father upon bare fuppofition of their efficacy

be laft attempted of drapery rapery is the art of cloathing your figures as with elegance and propriety when your naked figure is outlined firtt draw the outlines of the drapery lightly then the greater folds and afterwards the leffer obferving never to let them crots each other particular regard is to be had to the quality of the drapery as the folds of fluff or woolen cloth are more drupt and harth and thofe of filk more flowing and caly linen cambrick gauze as their fubllance is lighter than either require ftill greater delicacy in exprefting the waving of the folds by the faimtnets of their chadows the drapery should not ftick too clofe to the body but muft feem to flow round it as it were yet in fuch manner that the motion of the figure may be free and eafj great lightness and motion of the drapery should only be ufed when the figures are fuppoted to be in much agitation or expoted to the wind but in calm place and free from violent action their dra- pery should be large and flowing in order to give them more graceful appearance ler the loofe parts of the drapery blown by the wind all flow one way and draw that part which lies clofelt to the body before you draw thofe which by off suit your garments to the body and make them bend with it the clofer the garment flicks to the body the narrower and fmaller mutt be the folds and if it fits quite clofe there will be no folds at all but muft only have faint fhadow to reprefent the part of the body which lies under it by obferving diligently in what manner the drapery lows upon any perfon ftanding or fitting before

be taken to preferve fuch an analogy or connection between the figures that not one may feem to be introduced but for tome end or purpofe and as in dramatic writing it is effential to make every perfon peak confifient with the part he reprefents to here it will be equally ne- ceffary to obferve the same propriety of character and make every figure look the fentiment it is intended to expieis

thofe where objects end in the horizontal line but neither in the points of fight or diftance and ferve for ftreets houfes chairs roads ec which take different directions as for example suppofe fireet leading to the point of light and from it two others branch the one on the right hand the other on the left and take dit- ferent direction thefe two laft firects make what we call accidental points terminating in fome part of the horizontal line on each fide of the point of fight see fis xvi the same is to be ob- served in grove park cc where the walk you are in directs immediately to the point of fight and the avenues branching out on either fide terminate alfo in different parts of the horizon ichnegraphy is the plan or ground plot of any object that is to be raifed in perspective scenograpby is the art of bringing any thing raifed in perspective from an ichnographic plan to iis due proportion according to the diftance in which it is placed that all objects may be dimi- nithed according to their diftance in picture in the fame degree as they are diminithed by diftance in nnatural prospect fcenographic view may be either direcl as in fig xiv or oblique as fig the art of perspective is conftructed upon geo £ metrical principles it will be neceffary previous to the rules themfelves to learn the following intro- ductory operations from point in given line re to raife perpen- dicular see fig ii draw with the ruler the given line then fet one foot of your compaffes in and extending them to rather more than half the length of the line weep the arch ed and with the fame extent of com- paffes fet one point in and fweep the arch then without altering the compaffes fet one foot in and defcribe the arch br next rule through the points cs to interfect the arch b in and draw the line from to which is the perpendicular required another way see fig iii from the point take the equal diftances and on each fide of it then ftretch the compaffes to any diftance greater than or ac and with one foot of them in fweep the arch then with the same extent of the compaftes fet ane point in iweep the arch fg and thefe two arches will interfecd each other in the point from which line drawn to the point is the perpendicular required to drow one line paralled or equidiffant to another given ab see fig iv extend your compaffes to the diftance of the pa- fallel you require then with one foot in any point of the given line as in defcribe the arch de again without altering the compalfes fix one foot in any other point as in and fweep the arch gb then rule the fine touching the outward parts of the two arches and that will be the parallel to the given line to to bifect or divide given line ab into tue equal parts see fig tak with your compaffes any diftance greater than half the given line then with one foor of them in sweep the arch cc and with the same diftance fetting one foot in tweep the arch dd and thefe arches will interfect each other in the point gb which jorned by perpendicular will interfect ab in the middle point upon the end of given line re to raife per- pendicular see fis vi place one foot of the compaffes in and extend them to any point without the given line then fer one foot of them in and turn the circle de and and through dc draw the diameter dce meeting the circle in join ae and that right line is the perpen- dicular required to turn the circle through any three gruen paints not right line see fiz vil fix three points at any diftance you think proper at ab and and jon them by the right lines ab and bc then by fig bifect the line ab with the line de which done bifect the line bc with the line fe and from the centere where thefe lines meet extend your compaffes to and defcribe the circle abcg to draw ah oval see fig vill draw given line ab which divide into four equal parts fet one foor of the compaffesat and from that center deferiks circle ec with the fame extent of com- place one foot in the center and furn the cucle ff then with one foor still in extend your compalfes and turn the arch gg and with the fame extent placing one foot in defcribe the arch the interfections with perpendicular from toik next place one foor of the compaffes in fveep the arch and without altering them fet one foot in and defcribe the arch mm anrther methed for an oval see fiz ix draw given line ad and with the compaffes ex tended placing one foot in with the other turn the circle ec then without altering your compaffes on the line add in the fuppofed point fveep the circle and through the points gg where the two circles inter= feet draw the perpendicular bi then fix your com palfes with one foor in and extend them to as to describe the arch ff to the lower extremities of the cir- cle then with the same extent with one foot in fveep the arch to join the upper extremities by thefe examples it will appear that an oval of any form or fize may be conttructed at pleature only taking care always to fix the compaffes equidiftant from the given line in the perpendicular bs practical ekamples in perspective to draw square pavement in perspective see fiz and xi ippose your piece of parement to confift of of marble each foot quarc your firtt bufinets is to draw an icknographical plan or ground plot of it which is thus performed having made an exact quare of the fize you incend your plan divide bafe and horizon into eight equal parts and from every divition in the bafe to its oppolite point in the horizon rule perpendicular lines then divide the fides into the same number ruling parallel lines acrols from point to point to will your pavement be divided into quare feet becaule the eight feet in length mul- tiplied by the came in breadth give the number of quare feet or pieces of marble contained in the whole then rule diagonals from corner to corner and thus will your ground-plot appear as in fig now to lay this in perspective draw another fquare to your intended fize and divide the bafe line binto eight equal parts as before then fix your point of fight in the middle of the horizon de and from the same point rule lines to every divition in the bafe after which rule diagonal lines from to and from to antwerable to thofe in the ground-plot and your quare will be reduced to the triangle abc then from the point where the diagonal db interfects the line ac to the oppofite interfection where the dia- gonal ea croffes the line rule parallel line which is the abridgement of the quare then through the points where the diagonals crots the reft of the lines which go from the bafe to the point of fight rule parallel lines and your quare pavement will be laid in perspective as in fig xl to find the height and proportion of any objects as they appear above the herizon on supposed plane see fig xii firftrule your horizontalline no and fix your point of fight as at ml then mark the place of your neareft pillar by making dot for the bafe or bottom as at and another for the fummit or top as at rule line from to the point of fight mi and another from to and thefe two lines will give the height of any number of pillars as for example suppofe you would have pillar at fix your dot for the bafe and rule from thence parallel line to meet the diago- nal am at then rule the perpendicular de to the diagonal bni which perpendicular is the height of your figure required at or if you would place pillars at and obferve the same method ruling the parallels f and and the perpendiculars and kl will give their heights at the diftances required to find the diameter or thickness of pillars at any particular diftances you are alfo to be guided by that nearell the bafe for inftance suppole your nearelt pillar ab to be ten feet high and one foot in diameter divide it from top to bottom into ten equal parts and fet off one of them upon the bafe of the pillar then rule line from the point of light to the diameter and you will have the thick- nets of all your pillars on their respective parallels of bafes the same rule exemplified in objects below the be- rizm see fig kill if you would know the heights of number of figures below the horizon rule your horizontal fine or fix your puint of light as at then place your neareit figure or mark the dots for the head and feet by the points and which an- fivers the same purpofe and rule from thefe dots to the point of fight the lines pand ep and if you would find the height of figure to be drawn at rule from thence the parallel cd to the diago- nal bp and the perpendicular de will give the height required the fame directions will thew the height of figure at any other dittance you have mind to place it as at and by ruling the pa- rallels it and mn and from each of thefe their respective perpendiculars gb and which perpendiculars will thew the heights of the figures at and to draw direct view see fig xiv to illuftrate this example fuppofe you were to draw the infide of church as reprefented in this figure firtt take your flation at the point in the centre of the bafe line from which you have front view of the whole body of the church with all the pillars coc on each fide then fix your horizon at any height you think proper as at de bifect it by the perpendicular and where thefe two lines interfect is the point of fight this perpendicular will pass through the centres of all the arches in the dome or cupola which centers may be found by any three given points as in frg vil next divide year bafe line into any given number of feet and the vifual lines ruled from thefe divifions to the point of light will reduce all your objects to their jult proportion by fetting off their height upon perpendicular raifed at their respective diftances the bafe in the example here given is divided into twelve equal parts of fire feet each from which fup- poting your front column to be feet high take feven divitions from the bafe line of your drawing and fet them off upon the perpendicuar ght then jup- prting this column to be five feet thick at the bafe iet off one of thofe divifions upon the parellel ix which is the breadth required so that by propor- tioning the fcale to any dittance by the foregoing dis reclions you may not only find the dimentions of all your columns but alfo of every diffinct part of them as well as of all the doors windows and other objects that occur for inftance having found the height and breadth of your firft or nearelt column draw from the top and bottom of the faid column to the point of fight the lines hi and after which rule the line from the bafe of the column to the point of fight and you have the height and breadth of all the reft of the columns as has been already shewn in fis xii by ruling lines from the points to the point of fight you will fee that ail the fum- mits and bafes of your columns doors windows e muft tend immediately to that point and by lines drawn from the points on each fide to the correfpondent points on the oppo- fite fide may be feen all the parts of your building lying upon the same parallel to draw an oblique view see fis xv fult draw your hornzental line then if your favourite object be on the left hand as at place yourfelf on the right hand upon the bafe line as at then from that ffation erect perpendicu- lar de which will pats through the horizon at the point of fight to which rule the diagonals and hf which will thew the roof and bafe of your principal building and will alfo as before directed ferve as flandard for all the reft obferve allo either in direct of oblique views whether the profpect before you make curve for if it does you muft be careful to make the fame curve in your drawing to draw perspective view wherein are accidental points see fiz xvi rule your horizontal line and on one part of it fix your point of fight as at from which rule the diagonals cd and ce on one fide and of and cg on the other which will thew the roofs and bafes of all the houfes in the firect directly facing you suppoting yourfelf placed at in the centre of the bale line then fix your accidental points and upon the horizontal line and rule from them to the angles and where the ftrects on each fide take different direction towards the accidental points and and the lines gr and gk give the roofs and bafes of all the buildings on one fide as and mb do on the other accidental points feldom intervene where the dif- tance mall as in noblemens feats groves canals oc which may be drawn by the firict rules of perspective but where the prospect is extenfive and yaried including mountains bridges cafiles rivers precipices woods cities it will require fuch an infinite number of accidental points that it will be better to do them as nature shall dictate and your
