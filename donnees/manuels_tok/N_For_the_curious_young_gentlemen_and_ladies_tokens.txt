extracts from du fresnoy salmon london printed for carington bowles next che chapter-house in st. paul ’ church-yard mdcclxvi the introduction none of the arts which have been invented for the use or amusement of mankind can boast so great number of admirers as that of drawing and very justly for it gives such an agreeable representation of things that we are apt to fancy we see objects which have no real existence and that the imagery before us which is no more than painted cloth actu ally breathes the whole creation wich all its works and wonders comes within the power of its imitation it lets before us things long since buried in oblivion exhibits to perfect view the most noted actions of people who have been long in their graves and shews us our ancestors in per fect resemblance of their features thro ’ several successive generations there is scare any art or profession which receives not some assistante from draw ing without her help no designs or models can be well executed to her the mathematician architect and navigator is continually indebted no station of life is exempted from the practice of it from ihe general at the hend of an army to the mechanic who subsists by his handicraft this excellent art seems inculcated by nature herself for we see it not only practised by grown proficients but even children frequently drawing various figures and that fo curiously as even to astonish us wich their produc tions that therefore youth may be instructed how to attain to good degree of perfection in the art we shall prescribe the best rules we are able at least such as we apprehend are ablolutely necessary for their information after which we shall give them fome very ufeful and pertinent instructions for their better understanding of this art ruurs for the direction of the young practitioner in the art of drawing darawing may be defined representation by lines and shades of any object in nature or art the imitation of another draught or the expressing the likeness of something conceived in our own mind in imita tions of nature or copying from any draught the form and shape of the figures is the first thing that makes an impression on the mind which is after wards reduced into form by manual operation which draws the liges hence appears the necessity of frequently employing the mind in curioudy observing whatever objects are proposed to it by which means it will be more capabie of conceiving truly and exactly of objects and the hand will more easily and justly delineate that which is so strongly fixed in the memory it is highly necessary for him who would draw well to understand what is truly good and beautiful in draught in order to which the most expedi tious method will be to compare prints and draughts together many painters have grievously miscarried by satisfying themlelves only wich imitat ing bad pieces without giving any scope to their own genius or improving their knowledge in judging of the brauties and defects of picture the ideas in our minds may in great measure serve us for model and to im prove these we should frequently examine the performances of others and our observations on pieces that are esteemed correctly done qhould be nice and critical we should attentively consider every print and draught we see and every beauty we find in it endeavour to fix on our memory particularly the freedom and boldness of the out-lines and the proportion of the several parts above all things it is necessary thart the judgment be rightly informed for then the young practitioner will make the greater and quicker progress in his improvement than if he goes on in practice without encreasing his knowledge for his success will be more owing-to his genius than his hand the labour of the hand must indeed aid and assist that of the brain for whoever would be an able artist must by continual practice make the art habitual the rules of all arts are soon learned bur to attain perfection in any of them long practice and strict attention are ablolutely requisite it is true maxim that laziness was never the parent of any thing excellent drawing is not attainable but by length of time nor perfection in it ac quirable unless the hand be frequently employed in the pradtice and the mind in judging every day should produce something and the hand give frequent proofs of the speculations of the head as some part of every day should be spent in the practice of this art we would recommend the morning as fittest for that purpofe which therefore should be employed in perfecting yourfelves both in judgment and practice he who proposes to gain an entrance into minerva ’ cabinet must make his approaches gradually thus in the art of drawing tho ’ the represen tation of the human figure or many figures in piece be the principal object which every practitioner has chiefly in view yet he must not make this his first essay but proceed to that by proper and regular steps let the first part of his study be to draw streight and curved lines square round regular irregular and inanimate figures also parts of human fi gures as the eye the ear the hand feet this will be good foun dation whereon to erect his future structure for by this means he will acquire readiness of hand freedom and exactness in drawing lines and accus tom himself to the exercise of his patience qualifiications absolutely neces sary for one who would be esteemed an exact copier of nature especially in pieces thait require length of time and more than ordinary skill in the per formance he who begins well has more than half perform ’ his work the out-lines are the circumferent strokes of figure the perfection of good out-line consists in the freedom and boldness of the stroke and the due proportion of all its parts to attain which the scholar is admonished to reject all mean and trifling practices such as tracing che originals thro' oil paper or making use of the paper for the same purpose or taking advantage of an artificial light the use of such deceptions will certainly prevent all progress and improvements in drawing neither should the rule and compasses be used except in architecture or to raise perpendi cular in order to form square or some oher figure to draw in or when an artist has finished his draught he takes this method to compare it with the original to see whether there is an agreement between them however the bare eye if used to it will be suficient for such discernment for some time at first be satisfied wich practising upon good out-line without aiming at finished piece nor is it necessary that you should as yet hatch or shade your own draught your out-line at first must be sketch' wich flight and faint touches that you may have an opportunity to amend it where proper which so will have the leis appearance of being retouched in every stroke endeavour an exact imitation and whenever you mend the out-line either by taking away little of its parts or by swelling the others be sure to lose nothing of the freedom and boldness of it mind frequently to compare your copy wich the original take particular notice of what is amiss and let not the least fault escape uncorrected that so in the draught which you may afterwards make of the same original those errors may be avoided for you must not pass from one original to another 'till you are in good degree master of the first the bess and surest method of prac rice is to make great number of sketches of the fame figure in each of which endeavour to excel what you did in the former in your first operations proceed slowly for hasty productions are seldom beautiful or correct and design is often thus spoiled in the first attempt it is no easy matter to amend bad habits expedition in performance is acquired by constancy in practice as the young beginner will have fre quent occasion for the exercise of his patience he must be careful to subdue his passions in his first attempts he must procced deliberately and slowly and use his urmoft endeavours to perform well secure every stroke and try all his skill to make one good draught rather than to hurry over in negli gent manner great number of bad ones when you fit down to work and all the time you are at it take strict and close view of your original and in your mind divide it into several parts take due notice of the length breadth and similitude of each part ob serve the proportion of each to the ocher and to the whole the distances between the parts and the parts that lie parallel or are exactly opposite to each other when you have finished your copy and laid aside both the example and draught let your mind be employ for some time on other affairs then return to it again and view your work afresh and very probably you vill discover faults which did not appear to you before 't is easy to imagine that when the eyes have been engaged considerable time on the same ob ject the form and shape of it become familiar to him and that on revi sal his mind may entertain different notions of it than in the light it appeard before and assure yourself whatever pains you bestow in reviewing and com paring your copy wich the original draught in order to discover and amend your faults will not be useless but you will find this advantage in it that ir will be means of perfecting you in that particular draught and improve you in the knowledge of lines draughts and proportions and by continu ing to practise this method you will in little time find yourself qualified for the exactest imitations let your out-lines be large and smooth and drawn in flowing gliding manner for if they are too streight they will carry disagreable stiffness but if drawn according to this direction they will have the resemblance of life and motion and appear wich an easy grace in all your draughts let there be perfect relation between the parts and the whole and uniformity run thro ’ the whole piece that is let every member be made for its own head and agree with it you must not put strong limbs to body that is consumptive or to old age in its decay nor mult you be less exact in pairing the eyes hands legs and feet for the least disproportion will be blemish or when any of the limbs are not proportionate to the rest in the instructions which we shall presently give the learner will find directions to avoid any such mistakes and solecism when yon draw the muscles take care to insert them according to the rules of anatomy they must not be crouded into small sections but kept as entire as possible and only the principal musces expressed in member which is to express any particular force they must be shewn large as in the leg when it supports the body or in the arm when it lifts weight and be more swell than in any other members thus when the limbs and members are drawn wich few and large muscles they shew themselves wich majesty and beauty so in draperies the beauty of which consists not in multiplicity of folds but in their plain simplicity and natural order the drapery must seem to cover the part loosely for if it be too close and streight the piece will appear too stiff the plasts must be large folding naturally over the parts which are to be seen underneath which is done by placing properly the lights and shades in covering both the extremities of the joints such as che shoulders elbows knees care must be taken to mark them in such manner as to distinguilh their shape and in fact drapery is no tristing or insignificant part of this art for if well done it adds new grace to the picture gives an enlivening air to its other beauties and never fails of pleasing the eyes of the spectator the materials proper for drawing the materials necessary for this purpose are either pencils of black lead or black lead lead in porcrayon charcoal chalk black red and white pastils or crayons pens hair-pencils and indian ink nothing is more proper for beginners to practise with than black lead in drawing plain lines especially as this makes smoother stroke than can be done by charcoal or crayons cut your lead with penknife ’ till you have brought it to fine point that it may give neat small stroke or you may fix piece of the same lead in porcrayon but whatever it is you sketch with use yourself to hold it long-ways in your hand and let your fingers be much farther from the point than the nip of pen is when you write and let your strokes be formes with light gentle touches thus will you gradually acquire ready command of hand and you will with ease make yout out-line free and bold in practising after limbs and figuresi wil be proper at first to draw the rough sketch wich charcoal which is mere easily discharged from paper than black lead slit pour charcoal in small slender pieces one of which fix in porcrayon the better to hold it then sharpen it to point and lightly but correctly sketch out pour original when vou have so done if there is any thing you mislike in che performance you may easily wipe it out by brushing ie with feather or ciean rag when vou have secured vour out lines wich charcoal proced thus take feather and wipe them slightly over wich it that they may appear faint then go over the lines wich black or red-lead and correct them wherever you can if after all this vou still see any errors to amend take bit of crumb of stale white loaf with which vou may discharge any part of it you please by rubbing it therewith yeu may use red-lead or red or black chalk in the fame manner as black-lead if in heightnings or when you would give strong lights or draw on colour ’ paper use white chalk and tobacco-pipe clay pistils and crayons are terms which perhaps the learner may not readily understand they are colours mixed up with tobacco-pipe clay which must be worked into paste and rolled up into the thickneis of quill two or three inches long and then dried when fit for use the artist works them on colour paper but not in hatchings as black and red-lead commonly are the colours are rubbed and worked together so thar there is no single stroke but the whole appears as if only brush had been used the crayons is very expeditious manner of drawing and when skilfully handled always produce delicate softness and fine expression however it must be observed that the careless or rude touch of finger may at once blot out all the beauties of this fine work to prevent which let it be pre served in bock or in frame under glass the crayons will be work' more easily if the grain of the paper be litte rough and be expressed more strongly than when the paper is quite smooth or if the paper be somewhat dark or brownich or whar they call whited-brown it will give relief to the tender parts of the work by shewing the light strokes of it in shading draughts sometimes pens are used for hatching the cross strokes however the hair pencil and indian ink serve much better for this use which are not only proper for hatching by strokes but for shading by me thol much more expeditious that is by waching which is the fame way of working as with hair pencils and water colours in hatching the shades are produced by lines not unlike ihe strokes which shade print engraved lnnt in washing no lincs appear but the shades shew themselves like those in metzotinto print of the tints of lights and shadows lights and shades when judiciously disposed give the appearance of subslance nature and distance to such bodies as the pencil represents suppose for instance circie drawn on piece of paper imagine you see it fill up with any even colour you can conceive of it no otherwise than as round flat equal body but if you put the strongest of the colour in the middle and weaken it gradually towards the extremities you will per ceive an agreeable deception and instead of flat even body it will have the resemblance of ball or globe wherever the colour appears the most lively there the object catches the eye first and seems nearest to it but where the colour weakens and goes off it grows faint and at length seems to fly off and break away from the sight thus the painter by breaking and diminishing his colours throws that behind which he has mind shall be less visible when you round the parts of an object it requires the nicest touch of the pencil to draw the extremities so as that in turning they shall lose themselves insensibly and confusedly without too sudden transition of the light into the shadows or of the shadows into the light but let the one pass into the other as it were reciprocally and imperceptibly that is by degrees of light into shadow and shadow into light when your objects are to be painted light you must allow due breadth of shadow to sustain them if dark sudden light must rise behind them to separate them from the ground or from other objects that are placed behind them or else they will appear as if they were sticking upon each other in confused manner whereas by just opposition of light to shade and shade to light projection is given which makes separation of the objects you must keep proper ballance between light and shadows and intro ducing broad light into your draught you mult give it large shadow you must make your light serve as repose to the darks and che darks the lights thus drapery which is coloured red or yellow in some place in others will take brown wich good effect the eye sees an object the more strongly and plainly the nearer it is dif tance weakens the sight the farther off an object is the more impersectly it is perceived those objects therefore which stand nearect to view should be better finish ’ than thofe which are thrown behind but obserse that the must have reciprocal dominion over each other so that as one object by it heighthtenings forces others to appear at distance so the same object must be thrown farther from the sight than others which are illuminated more strongly it should be farther observed in regard to lights and shades that it is no enough that remote objects be coloured in more faint and languid manner but the more or less distant they are the parts should appear more or less confused the eye can not minutely discriminate an object which is at dis tance from it we can see human figures at street ’ length but can not discern the features of their faces or the plasts in their cloaths so the innumerable leaves of distant grove appear to the sight but as one mass white pure and unmixed has two different properties it draws an object nearer to it and it carries it off to farther distance when it is placed wich black che opposition of light and dark brings che object more into view and renders it more sensible but pure white as it is the lightest of colours will fly off to the remotest view unless forced forwards and sup ported by black on the other hand pure black is deemed the heaviest most earthy and most sensible of all colours and presents objects nearer to the sight you must cast it into masses confuse is insensibly and give it its proper reposes in the representations of bodies you must always give them such lights as are most proper and convenient for their supposed situations suppose the objects before you be in the fields or open air and the sun obscured with clouds your business is to introduce an universal light tho not vivid or strong your shades too must be faint but when the sun appears in all its glory your lights must then be very strong and bold and the shadows exceeding dark suppole again that the object you represent is in room little though not very much illuminated and to survey it you take your station without and stand level wich the light that strikes upon ir that figure must have very soft shadows which will shew it very beautifully and tho the shadow be so soft yet the figure will seem as if it were embossed and have very bold appearance when small light illuminates body the shadows on the dark side appear large and their extremities very bold whereas large light renders the shadows on the darker side more distinct and much softer than their li mitations useful instructions for the young practitioner whoever would make any proficiency in the art of drawing must first understand geometry for it is by this and the help of lines that we are structed to take the length and largeness of bodies and know whether they be streight or curve round oval and square or any other imaginary figure but as it is not our business here to treat of geometry or give those geometrical rules which are used in the art of drawing we shall refer the learned to le clerc ’ practical geometry he that would be perfect master in the art of drawing must learn to sketch well to which therefore he ought to give the greatest attention in copying statue some persons begin wich the head which they entirely finish before they proceed any farther by which means it frequently happens that they either make the head too little or too big and the other part so disproportionate that there is but small resemblance of the original occa sioned chiefly thro ’ want of duly observing distances when therefore you have any thing to draw let your first care be to divide it into its differ ent parts then measure the distances in the original with your eye mark the distances and length of each division with faint line on your paper and make sketch of the while figure before you proceed to finish any part of it so will yon secure the proportions in the exactest manner the learner will find among these examples several draughts of the parts of the face as the eyes nose mouth viewed in different positions all which he should practise upon before he attempts whole face for which purpose we shall lay down such leffons and instrucions concerning an oval wich its several changes and variations and of the cross in the fame as will enable him to flgure all bowings and returnings reclinations and incli nations of all sorts of faces the head you are to observe has the shape and form of an egg or oval this head has eyes eye-brows nose and ears which must be placed in their proper situations by running cross thro ’ the oval by this means you will divide ihe perpendicular in the oval into four equal parts which will make the head to measure four noses in height the face three only the diameter crossing the perpendicular divide into live parts each being the breadth or wideness of one eye this diameter is called the ocular line or that whereon the eyes are to be placed you must therefore draw streight line from the top of the right ear through boch eyes to the top of the lest ear and the line drawn from the top of the head down thro' the nose mouth and chin is called the perpendicular crossing the diame ter or ocular line at right angles these lines together we call the cross of the oval upon which cross whatever situation the face is in you must place the eyes nose mouth and ears in proper places when you understand this thoroughly and hive fixed it in your mind von will soon be able to draw good faces out of your own fancy and inven tion and execute them in masterly manner but if you accustom yourself to draw only after print draught or picture without knowing the use of the cross-lines and the proportion of face wich its parts you take wrong method don know what yon are about and will never attain to any degree of perfection having thus instructed you in the several methods of drawing face we come now to give you the dimenlions and proportions of the several parts of the body it was customary wich the autients to allow eight heads to their figures though some of them have only seven the moderns usually divide figure into ten faces taking it at the crown of the head and ending at the sole of the foor thus from the crown of the head to the forehead is the third part of the face the face takes its beginning at the root of the lowest hairs on the fore head and its end is at the bottom of the chin painters divide the face into three proportional parts namely the force head the nose the mouth and chin the distance from the chin to the pit betwixt the collar-bones measures two lengths of nose from the same pit to the bottom of the breast one face from thence to the navel one face from the navel to che privities one face the distance from the genitals to the upper part of the knee two faces the knee itself measures half face meafure from the lower part of the knee to the ancle and you will find it two faces from the ancle to the sole of the foot is half face when man stretches out his arms as wide as he can line drawn from the top of the longest finger of the right hand to the top of the longest singer on the left will meafure the length of his whole body or he will find himfelf as broad as he is long thee distance from side to side of the breasts two faces the bone of the arm called humerus from the shoulder to the elbow measures twp faces the bone called cubitus wich part of the hand measuring from the tip of the elbow to the root of the little finger contains two faces from che box of the shoulder-blade to che pit betwixt che collar-bones is one face in taking the measurement of the breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other to see if it be equal to the length of the body you are to observe that the boxes of the elbows wich the humerus and of the humerus wich che shoulder-blade bear the proportion of half the face when the arms are stretched out the sole of the foot measures the sixth part of the figure the hand is the length of the face the thumb of the nose from the place where che pectoral muscle or that muscle which makes the breast disappears to the middle of the arm measures four noses carry your measure from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand you will find it five noses tour longest toe is the length of your nose the tops of the two nipples and the pit betwixt the two collar-bones make an equilateral triangle no certain measures can be given for the breadth of che limbs because even the measures are changeable according to the different quality of the persons and movement of the muscles these farther rules are to be observed in drawing head viz you must set the eyes at such distance from one another that you may place one between them the mouth when shut hasthe dimensions of an eye the ears are always on level with the eyes top and below with the nose whether it be short or long the nostril should be placed exactly against the corner ot the eye in face that is flat the cheeks swell out and one that is lean the checks fall in and the jaw-bones stand out having finished our instructions for the drawing of the face let us now proceed to draw man at full length in the first piace you must make pour oval then divide as before directed you then draw perpendicular line from the top of the head to the sole of the foot which you must divide into eight lengths this will be good direction in placing your figure upricht or in whatever action the posture requires where it either falls in or swells out you must make the length of une head between the chin and the breasts the third measure must reach to the navel the fourth from thence to the genitals the fifth to the middle of the thigh the sixth comes to the lower part of the knee the seventh to the lower part of the leg and the last reaches to the heel or sole of the foot in every measure or division you must take particular notice what touches there are of the muscles the leg must be first drawn on which the body stands then the other after which draw the arms and hands you must first draw all the parts very lightly only with coal because that will give you the least troubie in rubbing out or altering the hands you must observe are twice as long as broad and each of their parts has its particular length breadth and thickness the nail of the finger makes about half the joint it is upon the length of the foot measures sixth part or height of man or five eighths more in length than in breadth take notice that the length of the face and hands are exactly equal and is just the tenth part of person ’ height having thus instructed you to draw complete man we shall in the next place lay down some rules for the drawing of children some will have the length of child to contain five measures of the head as thus from the top of the head they make three and the thighs and legs two morc the breadth between the shouldlers is the length of head and half ihe breadth of the body above the navel the length of one head and the breadth of the thickest part of the thigh is one third of two lengths of the head the breadth of che knee measures exactly the distance between the eyes and the chin ehe brawn of che arm and small of the leg are just the thickness of the neck if you take the proportion of child standing backward you will find it of the fame meadure as the former if you are desirous of drawing piece well proportioned you must be very careful and attentive to copy all the several parts singly as the eyes ears rules for filling up empty figures thus far we have treated of colours and out-lines we come now to instruct the learner how to fill up the empty figures and to mark the hatchings to as to produce the best effect in the first place observe that your hatchings must consist but of two strokes crossing each other or at most three to make the strongest shades where the cavities are such as require the whole force of your lead or crayon you must rub it upon your paper as you see occasion for it would be needless trouble to employ more than three hatchings one upon another when with your charcoal you have drawn the out-lines you must re touch them wich your red-lead crayon and then with feather brudh away the dirtiness of the charcoal when you have done that you must retouch wich gentle hand such places as have been fouled in the rubbing as the hair eyes nose mouth fingers toes out-lines let me also caution you that in those out-lines which are open to day you make your strokes very light but stronger in those which are darkened thus will the out-lines appear in natural manner and add wonderful beauty and grace to human figures and all other objects when this is done you must begin the shades with single hatching but pretty strong yon begin it at the top proceeding insensibly to the bottom as evenly in the distances as you possibly can you then go on to the roundings which you must also ex press by single strokes with such light as the object before you requires be cautious not to make your shadows too hard or dark at first if you would present the perspective in the best manner begin the shadows lightly and faintly and heighten them afterwards and you will soon be pleased with the agreeable effect instrustions how to draw after picture model of the life having given you the neccessary instructions for drawing prints and draughts we shall in the last place direct you how to draw after picture model or the life and in what manner you are to place them when you have got picture to draw after be sure to place it in good light so that the sight of your eye and the light of the day may fall together on the picture place yourself at moderate distance according to the largeness or smallness of the picture at least no farther off than that you may with glance of your eye see the whole picture at once for the larger the picture is at the greater distance you must sit to draw it be careful likewise to place your print exactly right before you and let it not lie down flat for if it be laid flat you will quickly see the figures in it fore shorten the paper you draw upon you must lay five or six times double upon pannel board set in your lap and raised as high as yon can wich your knees or let it be rested on form or stooping desk fo that your work may stand upon one end before you thus will you be enabled to judge of the similitude between your draught and the original which it will be im possible for you to do if it lies flat before you the next thing vou have to do is to guess as near as you can at the middle of the thing you have to draw whether picture or any other matter then mark it on your paper wich the point of your coal when you have done this look for the largest figures if there happens to be more than one and touch them lightly in proper places and so all that is in the picture you will then presently discover whether your guessing and sketching be true or not but besides the before you draw stroke be sure you do it wich good reaon and observation and be very careful about the great and general parts and middle not with the small breakings 'till the next sketching and by constantly practising in this manner you will insensibly acquire facility and judgment in your work another rule you are to observe is always to begin on the right side of the figure for so you have the first strokes constantly in your eye and the rest will naturally follow and give less trouble but if you begin on the left side your hand covers the object from your sight having thus made rough sketch you should carefully review and examine it and see if it be done according to ait and if the action of the figure or figures in it be answerable to the original now as actions are the life of picture they must shew themselves in the first draught however rude it be or you can never expect it will be happily finished you must then correct your sketch and improve it in neatness and air by adding and diminishing as you see proper as you may easily do with your charcoal but in doing this be mindful that you don spoil the first good actions in it which may easily be done if you don well observe ihe movements of several parts you must be careful to admit nothing into your work that is improper or foreign to the subject of it and to let nothing trifling have the chief place in it if you can always make chooce of north light for your situation be cause it is less variable than any other should yon lit at south window yon will find it proper to place sash of oil ’ paper before ir which will break the intenseness of the sun rays and diffuse them more equally with out any sensible variation in drawing after the life you are to confider the bigness or size of the object you have vo represent and remove from it to the dislance of three times its magnitude and be seated in fuch manner as that your eye may be on level wich it and at every stroke you draw be curious to observe what parts of your object lie under the perpendicular or principal line the next thing you have to do is to put your figure whether it be the life or model in proper position the best light is that which is high and equally diffused not too strong nor glaring when objects are so disposed you see all their beauties and the minutest parts shew themselves to advan tage but this you are to observe that in drawing from the life that your light should come from such an altitude as that the shadows of bodies pro jected on the plane be equal and in proportion to their height so that ihe light does not strike upon or enlighten all the parts some of which are shel tered by the protuberance of others the eye-brows over-shade the hollow of the eye the nose hides some part of the mouth and the throat is obs cur bythe chin for this reason portrait painters blind all the windows of the room they work in except one yhe lower part whereof they clode up and let yhe light in from yhe upper only which strikes upon the object they are printng after while themselves are beneach the light particular directions for the young painter the instructions we have hitherto given the young beginner have been pretty much in the general we shall now introduce him into every part of his work by such particular directions as by strictly observing them will make him compleat draughtsman for drawing the face when you have drawn the circle of the face which you must do at first with plain circular line without making any bending or in dentures in or out make stroke from that place of the forchead which is even with the chin down the place where you intend to fix the middle of the nose and the middle of the mouth this stroke you must observe must be struck that way which the face should turn either to one side or strait down which stroke will be great help to you in placing the features rightly so that they may not stand all awry but directly one under another now if the face turn downward the stroke must be struck in such manner that the eyes may turn answerable with the face downwards when you have done that make another stroke for the length of the nose where the end of it should come and another stroke for the mouth that it be not made crooked still observing to make all che strokes to turn one way up or down according as the face turns that is if the face turns up or down the eyes nose and mouth must turn wich it when you have made these strokes exactly proveed to place the features according to the preceding rules in the face is usually observed this threefold propertion from the top of the forehead to the eye-brows from che eye-brows to the bottom of the nose from thence to the bottom of the chin this proportion however is not constantly the same for in some persons the forehead is lower than in others the nose of some longer and of some shorter than others and therefore this rule can only be observ ’ in well proportioned face the distance between the two eyes is just the length of one eye if in full face but if it turn any thing aside then that distance is lessened accordingly the nostril ought not to come out farther than the corner of the eye in any face and the mouth must be always placed between the eyes and the chin just under che nofe as the greatest difficulty and principal part of ihe art lies in the lively drawing of the facc fhall add thefe farther directions to perfect you in this particular branch of your art fins if you would draw face exactly fo as to reiemble the original you draw it from you must in the first place take notice of the physiogno my or circumference of the face whether it be long or round fat or lean big or little that so you may be sure to draw the physiognomy or bigneiss of the face right if it be fat face you will perceive the cheeks to make the side of the face swell out and so make the face look as it were square if it be lean face the jaw-bone will stick out and che cheeks fall in and the face will look long and slender if it be neither too fat nor too lean the face will for the most part be round when you draw the utmost circumference of face you must take in the head and all wich it otherwise you may be deceived in drawing the true big ness of the face secondly you must carefully and judiciously observe and discern all the master touches which give life to face or discover the grace or dispo sition of the mind in which lies the whole grace of the work and the credit of the workman thus smiling countenance is easily discern in the mouth when the corners of it are little turn up frowning coun tenance in the forehead eye-brows bending and the top of the nose be tween the eyes somewhat wrinkled sober and staid countenance is best dis cerned in the eye when the upper eye-lid comes somewhat over the ball of the eye laughing countenance is easily discerned all over the face and so is an angry wrathful countenance by extraordinary frownings there are also some touches about the eyes and mouth which give life and spirit to face which you will by degrees find out by frequently observing and imi tating the works of the best masters further rules for the young practitioner in drawing your charcoal being neatly sharpen you must in the drawing of face first lightly draw the out-stroke or circumference of the face exactly according to the bigness of the pattern making it to stand fore-right or to turn upwards or downwards according to your pattern then make some little touches where che features namely the eyes nose mouth chin should be placed not drawing them exactly at the first when you have thus lightly pointed out the features then begin to draw them more exactly and so proceed 'till che face be finished which being done then add the beard and other things about it in drawing side face you need not at first draw the nose mouth and chin that stand in ihe outmost line but only make it first but bare circumference turning this way or that way accor ding to the pattern and then make the mouth nose and chin in their places and just proportion you must be sure to place the muscles in the right and proper places by the muscles mean all the shadows that are caused by some dents or swellings in the face and be able to find out the reason of every muscle that so you may proceed to work with the more judgment the muscles will be mofs visible in an old wither face and you must first draw the most prin cipal of them and then you may draw the more ealily the lesser within be sure to be very exact in the plaring of them or you will spoil your draught be it ever so good observe to make the shadows rightly and be careful not to make them too dark where they should be faint or if you do you can never recover it to make it light again and so the whole face will be marr ’ and appear un handsome the shadows are generally sainter and lighter in fair face than in swarthy complexion when your draught is finished you will do well to give fome hard touches with your pen where the shadows are darkest which will add great life and grace to your drawing when your face is finished you come next to the ears and hair wherein you must observe this rule having drawn the out-line of it you must first draw the principal curl or master stroke in the hair which will guide you wich ease to do the lesser curls which depend on them always make your curl to bend and turn exactly according to the pattern that they may lie loose and fast and not appear stiff stubborn and unpliable when you have drawn your curls exactly you must in the last place strike in the loose hairs which hang carelessly out of the curls the face being drawn which is the principal thing in the art then proceed to the hands and arms legs and feer and so to full bodies of men and women which are the most difficult things which if you can attain to perform with well grounded celerity nothing will be difficult to you but most easy as flowers birds beasts ships or any other thing that is to be drawn by hand of drawing the hands and feet we come now to speak particularly of the ihands and feet which you oughe to spend some time about before you come to whole bodies because they will be too dilficult for you to enter upon till you have pretty well practised your hand in the drawing of other things more especially hands and feet which are the most difficult members of the body to draw except the face by learning of which you will attain the rest wich less diffi culty and greater perfection and undoubtedly it is thing highly commen dable to draw hand lively and exactly which hath such variety of pos tures and action and you will find it no easy matter to imitate it in every one of them wich spirit and life or without some lameness or imper fection the actions and postures of the hand are so various that no certain rule can be given for drawing of them only this in general when you first draw it with charcoal you are not to do it exactly that is you must not make all the joints or veins or other things to appear more than lightly or saintly and to touch out the bigness of the hand and the manner of turn ing it with saint touches and not wich hard strokes if you have done that right then you part the fingers afunder or clofe according to your pattern wich the like saint strokes then mark that place where any of the fingers stand out from the others and make faint resemblance of it having so donc if you perceive your draught to be right procecd to draw it more perfectly and make the bending of the joint the wrist-bone and other principal things somewhat exactly and lastly go over it again and draw every small bending or swelling of the fingers and make the nails knuckles and veins so many of them as appear and every thing else that you can discern the proportion of hand you have sufficiently described in the print whlich shews how many equalities or equal measures there be in it which you should endeavour to be acquainted wich that so you may know when hand is well proportionned wich just and equal distances but you are to observe this rule or exception that according as the hand turns one way or other the proportions must be shortned according as they appear to the eye as you may see by the fore-shortning of the hand in the print so much as the hand turns away from our sight lo much it loses of its ordi nary proportion and is made so shorten unto that proportion that the eye judges of it nay sometimes whole finger sometimes two or three or more are lost to our sight by the turning of the hand another way from us and so they must be wholly left out and not made as to the feet it is not so difficult to draw them as it is the hands and you must procced in the same method in the one as in the other when you can draw hands and feet pretty well then procced to arms and legs wherein is little dillicul ty after which you may procecd to whole bodies rules to be obsersed in drawing tbe whole body in the drawing of body you must begin with the head to whith you must give just proportion and bigness because all the body must be pro portioned according to the head when you have drawn the head proceed to the shoulders and go on to che trunk of the body beginning at the arm-pits leaving the arms till afterwards and so draw down to the hips on both sides and be sure you observe the exact breadth of the waist when you have done thus draw first that leg on which the body stands and afterwards that which stands loose or from the body and last of all the arms and then the hands either joined tothe body or separated from it agreable to your pattern observe in your drawing to place the parallel joints sinews and muscles directly opposite in strait even line one against the other as the shoulders arm-pits waist hips knees and so every thing else that one may nor be higher or lower than the other that the body may not seem crooked or deformed but every parallel joint bend may directly answer the other that is opposite to it to which end you may strike strait stroke directly cross the shoulders to direct you to place them even and strait onc against the other which you may likewise do in other places as the arms waist hips thighs or any orher parts that are opposite where you should place the one even with the other but you must have the fame care in all parts of the body as you have in one place where any bendings or members of the body have or do require direct opposition one to the other you make use of this help and direction observe that if the body turn one way or other then this stroke must be so struck that it may answer the bowing of the body thus if the body sloop little downwards you must strike the stroke sloping or side ways in which case you must make the shoulders and other things which should be strait against one another to be somewhat higher than one another fo that the side which the body turns upon the shoulders and other things that otherwise should be placed even against the other must be made some what lower than the other side more or less according to the stooping of the body as you are to be careful in the placing rightly all level or parallel joints bendings sinews and muscles so you must be very exact in all perpendicular joints muscles that is when you have drawn the out-iines of your piece and are come to draw che joints and muscles that are wichin the body you must be as exact in placing them that is directly one against another as you are in placing those even that are opposite to one another to the end that you may place things exactly perpendicular that is in strait line one under another you may strike strait perpendicular line from the pit of the throat down to the privities just in the middle or seam of the body where you discern the parting of the ribs and from thence strait down to the feet which line will direct you to place things perpendicularly even that the body may isand strait upright and not appear crooked or awry take notice of the bowings and bendings that are in the body to make that part which is opposite to that which bends to answer to it in bend ing with it thus if one side of the body is bent in the other side must sland out answerable to the bending in of the other sice if the back bend out the belly must bend in if the belly come in the back must stick out if the breech stick out the thigh that answers to it in opposition must come in so also in any other part of the body as when the knee bends out the hams that answer to it must come in and the same rule must strictly be ob served in all other joints of the body otherwise the body will be made grosly and absurdly and without any proportion be careful to make all things of an equal proportion and bigness that one arm or leg be not bigger than the other or one breast larger than the other or any part of the body in an unjust proportion but as every thing in face must answer to the bigness of the face so one member must answer to another in bigness that so there may be perfect harmony in all the parts of the body that it may not have broad shoulders and thin slender waist raw-bone arm and thick gouty leg or any part dilproportionable from the other unless it be so that any part of the body doth turn awry from our eye thus if one arm should be other side-ways and the other fore-right then the one arm must be made fo much less than the other by how much it turns away from our sight and appears less to our eye and if one leg be seen full or fore-right and the other leg be seen side-ways then it must be made so much lefs than the other by how much it turns away from vour sight as just proportion must be observ ’ in the bigness of your draught fo likewise in the length that one thing may not be too long for the other the body not too long for the legs nor the legs too short for the body that neither leg nor arm be disproportion in their lengths but that every thing have its due proportion both for length and bigness unless when the body shortens away in any part from your sight as thus if one leg sland behind the other it must be made so much shorter than the other according to the distance it is removed from your eye so likewise if one arm remove itself ever so little out of your sight that which comes first to the eye and stands nearest to the sight must be made longer than the other and the other be made so much the shorter by how much it turns away from your sight so again if any part of the body be fore-shortned that is if it appears fo to your eye as to hinder the full light of the latitude of that part of the body then the body or thar part of the body muft be made to shorten according to that proportion that the eye judges of it observe the due distance of one thing frem another that you may be exact in your draught and perfectly imitate your pattern observe how much one part of the body sticks out beyond the other or falls in within the other or whether it stands even with the other to which end you may strike small stroke down from the top of the shoul der along by the outside of the body strait down to the feet and this will direct you how far one part of the body should stand out beyond the other and how far other parts should come in let nothing be done without rule and judgment let nothing be done hard sharp or cutty that is let not the bend ings that are in the body or in the joints be made as if they were dents or cuts in the flesh wich sharp corner strokes but finaly round and floping like bendings and not like cuts in the body this is common fault among learners who should therefore be the more careful to avoid it by imitating their pattern exactly in the manner of making every stroke and touch that is given for nothing should be done without judgment of perspective proportion perspective proportion differs luch from that we have been hitherto describing and may be defined the judgment of the eye of the proportion of thing by its distance from it as thus if one part of the body come nearer to the eye than the other it is made so muche bigger than the other part of the body which turns away from the eye thus it one leg stand behind another the foremost leg that stand first in sight must be made somewhat bigger and longer than the other because the eye so judges of it it is the same with regard to any other part of the body the proportion must be lessen according to the distance of the object from the eye the next thing to be observ in good draughts is graceful posture and proper action that is that the true natural motion of every thing be ex pressed in the life and spirit of it that is the life mult be quicken by art as to express the majesty of king you must put him in such grace ful posture as may move the spectators with reverence to behold him so to make soldier you must draw him in such posture as may betoken courage boldness and intrepidity so to make clown he must be seen in the most detectable and clownish posture so in every other instance the inward affection and disposition of the mind must be expressed in the most lively manner in the outward action and gestures of the body now to at tain competent skill herein my advice is diligently to observe the works of our great master of those especially who delight in describing fight at handi cuffs to observe the eyes of private assassins the courage of wrest lers the actions of stage-players the enticing allurements of courtesans such as are led to execution to mark the contracting of their brows the motions of their eyes and the carriage of their whole body to the end you may express them to the life in your drawings and works another thing to be observed in good draughts is looseness or air that is that the body be not made stff in any part but that every joint may have its proper and natural bending so as it may with the greatest life express your intention that the picture may not seem lame or the joints stiff as if they were not pliable or capable of bending but every joint or limb must have its proper and natural posture according as it may best suit with and be come the posture in which the figure is set another thing to be noted in drawing is what the painters call fore-short ening which is to take things as they appear to the eye and not to draw the full length and proportion of every part but to make is shorter by reason the full length and bigness is hid from our sight so if would draw ship standing fore-right there can appear only her fore-partn the rest is hid from our side and therefore can not be express again if would draw horse standing fore-right looking full in my face must necessarily fore shorten him behind because his sides and flanks are hid from my eye observe therefore this rule that you ought rather to imitate the visible proportion of things than the proper and natural proportion of them for the eye and the understanding together being directed in the perspective art ought to be the guide measure and judge of drawing and painting the last thing to be regarded in good drawing is that every thing be done by the guidance of nature that is that nothing be express but what accords and agrees with nature in every point as thus when would make man turning his head over his shoulder must not make him turn more than nature will permit nor must any thing be forced beyond the limits of nature or be made to come short of it but tho nature must not be stretch' beyond its centre yet it must be quickened to the highest pitch of it thus if would express king must express him in the most majestick posture can invent and if would draw clown must represent him in the most clownish action can imagine yet must neither the one nor the other be drawn in such posture as will not agree wich the motion of nature that is in such posture which man can not imitate wich his natural body so in all other things nature must be the pattern of all kinds of draughts rules for drawing landskips landskip is the expressing tract of land by hills woods castles seas valleys ruins rocks in which there is not so much difficulty as in drawing figures and therefore the following rules will be sufficient the best way of making landskips is to represent them shooting away one part lower than another as hath been practised by cur best ar tists but others have run into contrary error by making the landskip mount up higher and higher till it reach to such height that it seems as if it touch the clouds as if the drawer had stood at the bottom of steeple when he took the prospect which is altogether incongruous for we can dis cern no prospect at che bottom of hill but the most proper way of mak ing landskip is to make thie nearest hill higheqt and so to make the rest that are at greater distance to shoot away under that that the landskip may appear as if taken from the top of hill be careful to lessen every thing in proportion to its distance express ing it bigger or less according to the dislance it is from the eye you must make all your lights fall one way both upon the ground and trees and all things else and all the shadows must be cast one way must give every thing its proper motion as trees when they are shaken with the wind their smaller and more pliable boughs must be shewn in such an action as if they struck one against another by yielding and de clining from that part whence the wind blows the stiffer boughs have less bending and motion you must likewise observe the bending of twig when bird fits upon it so likewise if it be forced or pressed wich any other thing clouds in the air must be shewn wich motions now gathered together with the winds now violently condenied into hail thunder-bolts lightning rain and such like finally you can make nothing but what requires motion peculiar to itfelf according to which it ought to be represented but this rule you must always observe namely thar all your motions which are caused by the wind must be feen to move one way because the wind can blow but one way at once always express fair horizon shewing the heavens cloudy or clear more or less according to the occasion and if you express the sun let it be either rising or setting and as it were behind or over fome hill or mountain the moon and stars are seldom or never depicted unless it be in repre sentation of twilight because all things are supposed to be seen by day if you express the sun make his light to reflect upon all ihe trees hills mountains rocks or buildings shading the contrary side after which manner allo shadow clouds mists and the like making the shadows to fall all one way in expressing things at large distances as ten twenty or thirty miles off where the object is hard to be discerned as whether it be temple castle house or the like shew no particular signs thereof or any eminent distinction but rather as weakly faintly and confusedly as the eye judg eth of it if landskips be laid in colours the farther you go the more you must lighten it with thin and airy blue to make it seem as if it were afar off be ginning first with dark green so driving it by degrees into blue accord ing tothe distance in rivers observe the general current and dashing of the waves against the boat sides in the sea observe the waves and other proper agitations the rowling of the billows che tumbling of vessels up and down ships floating some dipt some half drowned fome standing almost an end some hid almost wich the waves thro the uncertainty of ihe surges others striving to live in the motion of waters falling from an high place but especially when they fall upon rocks or stones you must make it leaping up in the air and sprinkling all about let your work imitate the season you intend it for thus if you intend it for winter piece represent selling of timber fleding upon the lce fowl ing by night hunting of bears or foxes in the snow making the trees every where naked or laden with hoar frost the earth bare without greenness flowers or cattle the air thick water frozen with carts pass ing over ir and boys upon it lastly let every site have its proper works adjuncts or additional graces as the farm-house windmill woods flocks of sheep herds of cattle pilgrims ruins of temples castles monuments wich thousand such other things only proper to particular subjects to take tbe perfect draught of any picture take sheet of fine venice paper wet it all over wich linseed oil on one side thereof which then wipe off as clean as you can let the paper dry and lay it to any painied or printed picture then wich black lead pencil you may draw it over with ease put this oiled paper upon sheer of clean white paper and wich little pointed stick or feather out of swallow ’ wing draw over the stroke which you draw upon the oiled paper so shall you have the exact form upon the white paper which may be set out wich colours wich pleasure or thus the picture being drawn as before in the oiled paper put it upon sheet of white paper and prick over che drawing with pen then take some small-coal powder it fine and wrap it in piece of fine linnen and bind it up therein loosely and clap it over the pricked line by little and little and then draw it over again once or twice wich pen or pencil or thus rub sheet of white paper all over on one side wich black lead or else wich vermilion mixed wich fresh butter lay the coloured side upon sheet of white paper then lay che picture you would copy out upon the other side of the coloured paper or with small pointed stick or swal low qulll go over all che strokes of your picture and it will be exact on the white paper or thus take an oiled sheet as before rub one side of it with lamb black or lake lay it upon sheet of fair paper with the coloured side downward and upon it lay the picture you would copy out and trace it over with your swallow ’ frather or thur take fine lake mixed wich linfeed oil and draw with it over all the out-strokes and other material parts of picture then wer the con trary side of the picture and press it hard upon sheet of paper and it will leave behind it all that which you drew over to take the shape of leaf herb or plant hold whole leaf or sprig as of nettle plantane in the smoak of gum sandrack rosin link or wax candle 'till it is well black which place between the leaves of sheet of white paper and carefully press upon the leaf wich fome smooth thing so shall you have in moment the print on the paper especially the backside thereof with the very ramifications of the fibres dispersed thro it this may be of good use in travelling wiien we meet wich strange plants to take the picture of an herb from an old picture take venice soap dip it in water and rub or moisten the old pic ture all over very well with it then put upon it piece of white paper wich other paper over it and rub hard thereupon or press them strongly to gether and the old picture will come off exactly upon the white paper of colours for landskips for ligte green use pink and masticot heightened with white for sad green indico and pink heightened wich masticot for some trees take lake umber and white for others charcoal and white for others black and white with some green adding some lake or vermilion with other colours for wood take lake umber and white mixing sometimes little green withal for fire lay red lead and vermilion tempered together where it is reddest where it is blue lay oil smalt and white lead wherc it is yel low take masticot and work it over in certain places where you would have it shine most with vermilion for an azure sky which seems afar off take oil smalt or bice and temper them with linseed oil but grind them not for smalt or bice utterly lose their colour in grinding for red sky take lake and white and for sun-beams or yellow clouds at sun-rising or setting take maiticot and white for night sky or clouds in storm take indico deepened with black and heightened wich white for wood colours they are compounded either of umber and white charcoal and white seacoal and white umber black and white or with some green added to which you may adjoin sometimes as in the barks of trees little lake or vermilion how to cleanse any old painting take wood ashes and scarce them or else fome smalt or powder blue and wich spunge and fair water gencty wash the picture you would cleanse taking great care of the shadows which done dry it very well wich clean cloth then varnish it over again wich good varnish but such as may be washed off again wich water if need be or take either common varnish made wich gum sandrick dissolved in linfeed oil by boiling or glair of eggs and wich your pencil go over the picture once twice or more therewith as need requires of fresco or painting of walls in painting upon walls to make it endure the weather you must grind your colours wich lime-water milk or whey mixt in size colour in pots the paste or plaister must be made of well-wash ’ lime mixt wich fine powder of old rubbilh stones the lime must be so ofren walh ’ ’ till all its salt be castrated and all your work must be dond in clear and dry wea ther to make the work endure strike into the wall stumps of headed nails about five or six inches asunder and by this means you may preserve the plaister from peeling then wich this paste plaister the wall pretty thickness letting it dry being dry plaister it over again about the thickness of half barley-corn very fine and smooth then your colours being ready prepared work this last plaistering over while it is wet so will your painting unite and join fast to the plaister and dry together as perfect compost in painting be nimble and free let your work be bold and strong but be sure to be exact for there can be no alteration of the first painting and therefore heighten your paint enough at first yon may deepen it at plea fure all earthy colours are best as the oker spanish-white spanslh-brown terrae-vert and the like mineral colours are naught lastly let your pencils and brushes be long and soft ocherwise your work will not be smooth let your colours be full and flow freely from the pen cil or brush and let your design be perfect at first for in this there is no after alteration to be made of washing and other materials thereof by washing here we intend nothing more but either to fet out maps or printed pictures in proper colours or else to varnish them the instruments and materials of washing are six viz alum-water size or gum-water liquid gold pencils colours var nish to make alum-water take alum eight ounces fair water quart boil chem till the alum is dissolved or thus take spring or well-water gallon rock alum pound beat it to powder and dissolve it in water by boiling filter it thro ’ brown paper and keep it for use wich this water wet your paper before you lay on your colours it will keep them from sinking in and withal add lustre and beauty to the coloors laid on but this you must note that if your paper is not good you must wash it over four or five times which may be done wich large pencil brush moreover alum generally raiseth staining colours and preserve them from fading to make size take glew which steep all night in water then melt it over the fire to fee that it be neicher too strong nor too weak then let little of it ccol if it be too stiff when it is cold put more water to ir if too weak more glew using it luke-warm to make gum-water take pure spring water quart put it into jar glass and hang therein sufficient quantity of pure white and clean gum arabick bruised and tied up in rag let it hang till the gum is dissolved then put your fingers into the water and if you find them stick together as if they were glewed your warer is too stiff or full of the gum which you must remedy by putting thereto more fair water and if you find it too weak you may help it by adding more gum wich this water or the former size most colours are to be tempered and with so much of ihe gum-water as being touched when dry the colour will not come off where note that if the colour glisten there is too much gum in it liquid gold and silver take five or six leaves of gold and silver which grind with stiff gum-lake water and good quantity of salt as small as yon can then put it into vial or glazed vessel add so much fair water as may dissolve the gum-water then let it stand four hours that the gold may settle decant the water and put in more till the gold is clean washed to the gold put more fair water little sal-armoniac and common salt digesting it close for four days then put all into piece of thin glovers leather whose grain is peeled off and hang it up so will the sal armoniac fret away and the gold remain behind which keep or thus grind fine leaf gold wich strong or thick gum-water very fine and as you grind add more thick gum-water being very fine wash it in great shell as you do bice then temper it wich little quantity of mercury sublimate and little dissolved gum to bind it in the shell shake it and spread the gold about the sides thereof that it may be all of one colour and fineness which use with fair water as you do other colours the same ob serve in liquid silver wich this observation that if your silver by length of time or humidity of the air become rusted then cover the place with juice of garlick before you lay on the silver which will preserve it when you use it temper it with glair of eggs and so use it with pen or pencil glair of eggs is thus made take the whites and beat them with spoon till they rise all in foam then let them stand all night and by morning they will be turned into clear water which is good glair of colours simple for washing of maps aloes ler it be dissolved in weak gum-water it makes deep or sad kind of yellow colour according to the goodness of the yel low brazil to some ground brazil put small beer and vinegar of each sufficient quantity let it boil gently good while then put therein alum in powder to heighten the colour and some gum arabick to bind it boil it till it raste strong on the tongue and make good red pink colour or light violet logwood ground logwood boiled as brazil makes very fair transparent violet or purple colour cochenel steeped as brasil was boiled makes fair transparent purple as thus fake cochencle and put it into the strongest soap-lees to steep and it will be fair purple which you may lighten and deepen at pleasure infused in srong vinegar it makes transparent purple madder take madder four drams ground brazil onceouncc rain water à quart boil away third part then add alum half an ounce boil it to pint then gum arabick one ounce which boil till it is dis solved cool it stirring it often and strain it for use it is good scarlet die for leather verdigrise take verdigrise ground finely one ounce put to it good quantity of common varnish and so much oil of turpentine as will make it thin enough to work withal it is good green fine verdigrise dissolved in rhenish wine or vinegar makes transparent green inclining to blue ground with juice of rue and gum-water it is pure green without the juice it makes glorious emerald mixed wich crystal of tartar in white wine vinegar in which gum arabick has been dissolved makes pure green and verdigrise alum of each one dram logwood three drams boiled in vinegar make good murry gambogia dissolve it in fair spring-water and it will make beautiful and transparent fellow if you would have it stronger to dissolve some alum therein it is good for silk linen white-leather parchment vellum pa per quills this colour delights in no mixture to make verdigrise and ceruse according to glauber these colours made with vinegar in earthen pots set hot into horse dung bur if you dissolve your venus and saturn with spirit of nitte and precipitate venus with lye made of the salt of tartar and your sa turn wich sale water edulcorating and drying them the venus will yield an excellent verdigrise which will not corrode other colours as the common verdigrise does and the saturn yields ceruse whiter and purer than the or dinary and is much better for painting and chirurgery yellow fustick-berry boil it in water or steep them in alum-water it makes good and transparent yellow for the same purpose turnsole put it into sharp vinegar over gentle fire till the vinegar boil and is coloured then take out the turnsole and squeeze it into the vine gar in which dissolve little gum arabick it shadows very well on car nation or yellow litmose cut it into small pieces and steep it day or two in gum-lake water and you will have transparent blue water to wash wich flory blue grind it wich glair of eggs if you then add little roffel it makes light violet blue mixed wich white and red-iead it makes crane-feather colour saffron steeped in vinegar and mixed wich gum-water is good yellow in white wine or sack it makes also good yellow but more glorious if you mix it wich equal parts of cochenele you may also steep it with glair of egg or grind it wich vermilion indian lake ground wich gum-arabick water makes glorious mur ry in grinding it add little

that keeps che colours from sinking into the paper and will add lustre unto them make them shew fairer and keep them from fading then let the paper dry of itself being washed with alom-water before vou lay on the colours or before you wet it again for some paper will necd wet ting four or five times the washing of the paper must be done with large pencil brush but if you intend to varnish your pictures after you have coloured them of wafhing rhein wich alom-water firit fize chem with new size made instead good white starch with very fine brush and this you must be sure to do all over for else the varnish will sink through having thus prepared your work go to laying on your colours according to your former directions sulting them as near as may be to the life of every thing but before you lay on your colours you must know how to temper them which you may do in this manner such colours as are ground with fair water take small quantity of them put it into horse mussle-shell putting thereto some gum-water and the colour in little time will be softened then wich your finger being very clean bruise the colour against the shell till you find no knot undissolved after wich clean pencil stroke down the colour to the bottom of the shell and it is fit for use if it be too thick add more gum-water to it such colours as are washed you must temper in shell with gum-water in the same manner as the former colours as are steeped the liquor only of them is to be used without any other preparation the picture being painted you may wich size paste your maps or pictures upon cloth thus wet the sheet or cloch therein wring it out and strain it upon frame or nail it upon wall or board and so paste your maps or pictures thereon lastly if the picture be to be varnished having thus fixed it into its proper frame then varnish it with proper varnish by the following rules and the work will be fully finished how to lay on your colours first provide yourself of pencils of several sizes and if you will be cu rious you ought to have great and small to each respective colour it not you must always have by you dish of fair water in which you must wash and cleanse your pencil wiping it wich clean linen cloth be fore you put into another colour for your pencils chuse those that are good thus see that they be fullest next the quili descending or lessening into small room or sharp point which you may fee by putting the hair into your mouth and drawing it thro your lips once or twice then you will fee what it is and if you find any straggling hairs singe them off with the flame of candle being thus provided with colours and pencils if you design to lay any colour about the edges of any map part piece or division of ground in plat as suppose you would inclose particular field or close in mea dow with yellow with your pencil take camboge or yellow-berry water very small quantity and on the inside of the black lead line draw the colour along of an equal breadth as near as you can from the line broader or narrower as your field is in bigness not daubing the field or close all over with the colour which would be but an abuls to your map or plat then having gone round the close or field in this manner with your colour wet your pencil in your mouth or have by you small quantity of water to dip it in and strike along the inside of the coloured line bring ing it more down towards the center of the field and this will sweeten your colour and make it shew as if it lost itself by degrees to the very colour of your paper or parchment this course is to be taken not only fer yellows but for all other colours lastly with pen if you can not do it hand somely with pencil take some of the colour which shadows the colour vou have already used about the field and go over your black-lead only so shall your field be finished lastly after the same manner you may adorn all the parts in your plat or map of divers colours observing this that you colour not two fields ad joining to one another both of the same colour and therefore it behoves you to know what colours do fet off one another best and as near as you can to lay closes or fields adjoining to one another of two such colours that one shadow may serve both of the making of varnishes varnish for painting in oil take mastick two ounces oil of tur pentine one ounce put the mastick in powder into oil and
