ever reward his purfuit from hence we may realonably infer that the said profeffors were focally unacquainted it not with the theory at leaft with the praltical part of whar they undertook to reach others and that the inftructions they have given were founded rather upon bare suppofition of their efficacy than upon the furer bafis of long and repeared experience which alone could have enfured their success and from which with deference to the judicious whofe all due sanction we shall at all times be ambicious to deserve we may veature to anfwer for the practicabiliy of our own to obviste

preterving their features for many generations in word it may be said to be the filent but moft expreffive language of nature which speaks to the eye is underffood by all nations and conveys an idea where even words themfelyes would prove deficient after giving some general direclions for the attain meat of this truly polite and rational amufement which is the bafis on which all the reff of the arts depend we shall confider it more particularly under the following heads and lay down the moft copious and inselligible rules for each refpellively viz copying of draughts dropery enlarging and contratting landicape imilation of lifes light and shadew rissory the implements neceffary for drawing are ruler compaffes charcoal blick lead pencil penknife perte-crayons black white and red chalk crayons indian ink crow-quill pens ca- mel hair pencils firches paper of several sorts and porte-folios general rales for drawing io he firft thing to be observed is the choice of proper originals and here we would recom- mend le chres principles of drawing as the eafieft and beft calculated for the inftruction of beginners this may be had price at the publifhers of this work having provided this begin with the ouclines of the feveral features as eyes nofe mouch ears as they occur in the book pratife thefe often over till you are quice maffer of them then proceed to profile or side-fage after they to an oval or full face always remembering that each of thefe muft be perfectly attained before you venture to proceed further when you can copy face correcily the next thing is to draw the feveral limbs or parts of the body as the hands arms feet legs e then go on to the body itfelf which having done you will be able to undertake whole figure obferving carefully the exact proportions and bearings of offe part with refied to the other the learner ought to be particularly cautious that he do not attempt whole figure before he has made himfelf mafter of the feveral parts for this is begihn- ning the work at the wrong end and is indeed the same thing as if man should astempt to climb to the top of houfe without the hels of the staits a do for bealts birds fruit plants we deem it afeless to give directions for drawing them as it is well known that he who has to far improved his ideas to be able io draw human figure correctly will find it no difficulty to perform every other branch of this art sketch or draw all your outlines faintly with piece of foff charcoal which may be known by the pich in the middle cut to point like pencil and when you fee any thing amiss whilk it out with handkerchief or feather corred your erfors with black-lead pencil and compare your work with the original till every part of them perfectly correspond this done finith your outlines with black lead of indian ink this advice properly aftended to will fave you an infinite deal of trouble in drawing over and over again to your no mall difcouragement if you prefer indian ink rub it with water upon marble and with crow-quill penperfest your out lines then rub out the marks of the pencil with bread.-keep three or four different shades of ink in the hollows of your stone to diffinguith your diffances referving one of the holes for water when you are thoroughly verfed in the outlines your next eufiness will be to learn to thadow but of this hereafter under the articles of light and pade be nottoohafly at firff fetring out which will but impede your progress and hinder your improvement wheress by beflowing litle more time you will attain perfection fooner than you can well imagine and expedition will come of itfelf as you becoms more experienced b copying of draughts you would copy print or drawing exactly of the fame ze rub the back of it with the duff of red chalk or black lead lay this upon your paper and pin if down at the four cor- ners then with blunt point trace the ouclines and breadths of the shadows which done having care- fully examined it to fee that nothing be omitted take if off and finith it with the pencil or pen another way t make an exalt copy and at the same time to preferve the original is to lay piece of tranfparent paper upon it and draw the ourlines thercon with black-lead pencil then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon place piece of thin polt-paper reddened or blackned at the back after which proceed to trace and finith it according to the foregoing rule if you would reverfe your original you need only turn the tranfparent paper with the drowing you have made upon it downwards upon the poft-paper and trace it as above direted of entarging and contratting ivide your original with pair of compaffes into any number of squares and rule them acrots with blick-lead pencil from side to side and from top to bottom then having your paper of the size you intend divide it into the same number of squares either big ger of less you would enlarge or contrall il place your original before you and draw square by square the feveral parts obferving to make the part you are drawing fall into the same part of the square as it does in your original to prevent mif- cakes drawingtlate art number the squares both of the original and copy as in fig and of the drawing-plate then outline it with indian iak rub out the marks of the pencil with bread and shade if at pleafure.. of imitation of life ef the perfon you draw after be of properti- ad onable size and well shaped place him in the cafieft and moft natural accitude then skeich faintly with your charcoal the head or any of the limbs separately which having carefully done proceed to finith with your pencil when you have fufficiently practifed the feveral parts or limbs you may draw the whole figure in whatever attitude you think proper to place it be- ginning with the eafieff and proceeding by degrees to the more difficult poftures as time and experi- ence shall enable you be fure to finith your outline fo correcdly mark- ing all the mufcles as they occur that even before you give it any shadow it may have some refem- blance of the perfon the true proportion which one part of human figure bears to another may be feen in fig iii which will ferve as standard to examine your draw- ing by except where the figure is to be fore-fhort- ened in which cafe nature will be the beft guide in drawing of likeness care muft be taken to express the paffions in the moft lively manner which is to be done by obferving the peculiar caft and dif pofition of every feature with the exacieft nicety and as this is of all the parts of drawing by far the moft difficult it will require more than ordi- nary attention and should be laft attempred b drapery rapery is the art of cleathing your figares with elegance and propriety when your naked figure is outlined firft draw the outlines of the drapery lighly then the greater folds and afterwards the leffer obferving never to let them grots each other particular regard is to be had to the quality of the drspery as the folds of sruff or woollen cloth are more abrupt and harfh and thofe of silk more flowing and eaty linen cambrick gauze ec as their sub- ftance is lighter than either require hill greater deli- cacy in expreffing the waving of the folds by the faint- nets of their shadows the drapery should not ftick too clofe to the body but muft feem to flow round as it were yet in such manner as that the motion of the figure may he free and ealy great lighiness and motion of the drspery should only be ufed when the figures are suppoted to be in much agitation or expoted to the wind but im calm place and free from violent acdion their drapery should be large and flowing in order to give them more graceful appearance let the loofe parts of the drapery blown by the wind all fow one way and draw that part which lies clofeft to the body before you draw thofe which ry off suit your garments to the body and make them bend with it the clofer the garment fticks to the body the narrower and fmaller muft be the folds and if it fits quite clofe there will be no folds at all but muft only have faint shadow to reprefent the part of the body which lies under it by obferving diligently in what manner the drapery fows upon any perfon ffanding or fitting before you for that purpofe you will fee in what manner to dif- pote your folds and shadows according to the uner- ring rule of nature of landfcape anddscape reprefents the face of the country selit appears to our view with all the various objects analogous thereto as towns caffles churches houfes trees hills cartle riners rocks ruins c careful to augment or leffen every object ac- cording to its diffance making the moff remofe ob- jelts fainter and lets diffinet as they appear to the eye and enlarging them proportionably as they ad- vance nearer shew the sky cloudy of clear as occafion re- quires and if you introduce the sun let it be rifing of fetting either of which reprefentations will give an additional grace to your picture as they repre- tent nature in its livelieff and moff agreeable ap- pearance adapt every part of your landicape to the seafon of the year and the time of the day you intend it to reprefent and difpofe your lights and shades with confiftent propriety laftly we would recommend it to practitioners in this noble art to rife early in fine morning that they may have better idea of the harmony and beauty of the works of the great creator which would wonderfully replenith their minds as to co- lour and effect o light and shade mahe true destribation of light and shade in picdure is abfolucely necelfary to be known as it not only determines the proper diftance of one object from another without which the whole would be an undiftinguithable mass of confution but it gives likewife to each refpeetive object its subffance roundnets and effect shadowing is performed with the pen or pencil in either of which great judgement is required having made your ourlines correct the firft thing is to obferve from which side of the original the light comes in which if natural is either from the right hand or left for whenever the light ap- pears in the middle of pidure and teems to glare more than ordinary is cauted by candle lamp of fome other laminous body and is called an artificial light lay on your little tints firft difpoting them as you fee they are done in the original and then proceed to the decper ones fill you come to the darkeft parts of all for you may at any time darken your shadows when you can not lighten them let all your shadows in the same piece fall on the same side that is if the rightfide of man face be dark to muft be the right-fide of his body rm leg thigh but if the light fide be darkened by the opposiion of some other body intercepting the light it muft receive contrary shadow make your shadows fainter as they grow towards the light breaking them gradually that they may not ap- pear too fadden or harth if you fhide with black-lead or with crayons you may blend your shadows and foften them one into ano- ther as you require with stump made of paper of glove- glove-leather rolled and cied hard and cut almoff to the point with which you may allo weaken your shades where they are too frong when one part of the body projets over or before another the part projecting muft receive fronger light thole parts that bend inward muft be made to much the darker and thadowed decpelt next the light two equal lights muft never be made in the fame picture the frongeff light should fall upon the mid- dle of the piece where the principal figures ought to stand diminithing gradually towards the extremities by frequently examining into nature you will have an opportunity of improving your ideas of light and shade and will be enabled to form proper judgment of the effect which the different rays or degrees of light will produce in picture for which reafon you should never let slip an opportunity of remarking the various appearances you meet with of hiftory branch of drawing prefents to our view things paft prefent and future an hifforical picture muft describe the tranfaction reprefented in manner to clear and confpicuous as to convey an idea of it to our minds as fully as could be done by verbal oefcription and care muff be taken to preserve fuch an analogy or connection be- tween the figures that not one may seem to be intro- duced but for some end or purpofe and in drs- matic wriing it is effential to make every perton peak confifient with the part he reprefents to here it will be equally neceffary to obferve the same propriety of character and make every figure foot the sentiment it is intended to express chap ii of perspec tive erspective is the art of delineating objects as they appear in nature upon plain sur- face according to their dillance and height perpendicular to the horizon between the object and the exc this art is of great confequence to thofe who would exeel in drawing erching engraving carving in bas-relief or painting for being well underftood the arriff will be enabled to know when to adhere to the firid rules and when to depart from them with propriety explanation of the ferms used in perspettive dase or fundamental line is the bottom-ling of the drawing on which the perfon is fuppoted to hand with his face towards the point of sight perpendicalar is line drawn upright with rer foed to any part of the bate parallel lines are lines cquidiftant from each as the horizon to the bafe horiam is the moft diftant part of plain where the clouds feeming to touch the earth limis the sight the horizental line gives the height of the eye for we can not fee any thing above the ho- izon which does not exceed this height vet the summit summit of mountain may be above the horizon though its foot be far beneath it point of sight is that part of the horizental line where all the vifual rays center in point visual rays are beams of light cenveying the likenets of any object to the eve or sight and the knowledge thereof to the mind or underflanding point of diffance are fuppoted points fet off on the horizontal line at equal diftances on each side the point of sight diagonol lines are thofe drawn from the points of diffance to the extremities of the bafe line fbridgment of the square is the line where the disgonals interfect or cross the vifual rays and muft always run parallel to the bafe it is only made where the sight is limised by perpendicular as the farther end of church hall room and fuppoling perfon to fland thereon parallel line drawn through the point of sight will seem to pats through the eyes and will confequently shew what fleight that perion ought to be the nine foregoing definitions are illuffrated in fis of the perspective plate point of direct view this is nothing mere than the front view of houfe church or in other words geometrical elevation raifed from plan of ground plot and comprehending an equal space on both sides of the point of sight see fie xiv point of oblique view is when we fee the ob- jet fideways of allant example suppofe perton was to draw view of canal with some remarkable building he is defirous to thew more diffinct he muff place himself on the bafe or fundamental line op- pofite to that building that the ray of light may be more oblique by which means the admired building will be less fore thortened and appear to greater advan- the points of sight being fill before him though not in the middle of the picdure see fis kv aecidental points are thote where objects end in the horizental line but neither in the points of sight of diftance and feive for streets houfes chairs roads which take different directions as for example suppofe street leading to the point of sight and from it two others branch the one on the right hand the other on the lef and take diffe- rent direction thefe two laft streets make what we call accidental points terminating in some part of the horixontal line on each side of the point of sight see fig xvl the same is to be obferved in grove park where the walk you are in directs imme- diately to the point of sight and the avenues branch- ing out on either side terminate alfo in different parts of the horizon icbnograpby is the plan or ground-plor of any object that is to be raifed in perspective scenograpby is the rt of bringing any thing railed in perspective from an ichnographick plan to its due propoition according to the diftance in which it is placed that all objects may be diminithed according to their diftance in pilture in the same degree as they are diminifhed by diftance in natural prosped scenographic view may be either dised as in fig kiv of oblique as in fig xv the art of perspetive is contiructed upon geo- £ metrical principles it will be neceitary previous to the rules themfeives to learn the following intro- dultory operations from point in given line re to raife perpendicuiar see fig ii draw with the ruler the given line then fet one foot of your compaffes in and extending them rather more than half the length of the line sweep the arch ed and with the same extent of com- paffes fef one point in and fweep the arch ef then without altering the compaffes fet one foot in ss and describe the arch by next rule through the points egs to interfect the arch bi in and draw the line from to which is the perpendicular required nother way see fiz iii from the point take the equal diftances band on each fide of it then fretch the compaffes to any diffance greater than or and with one foot of them in sweep the arch de then with the same extent of the compaffes fet one point in tweep the arch yg and thefe two arches will inter- felt each other in the point from which line drawn to the point is the perpendicular required to draw one line parallel or equidiftant to another given line see fiz iv extend your compaffes to the diftance of the paral- lel you require then with one foot in any point of the given line as in defcribe the archde again without allering the compaffes fix one foot in any other point as in and sweep the arch gh then rule the line ik rouching the ourward parts of the two arches and that will be the parallel to the given line to bisell or divide grven line rb into two equal parts see fig take with your compalfes any diltance greater than half the given line then with one foot of them in tweep the arch ec and with the fame diftance fer- ring one foor in weeg the arch dd and thefe arches will interfect each other in the points gt which joined by perpendicular will interfect ab in the middle point upon the end of given line rb to raife perpendicular sec fiz vi place one foot of the compaffes in and extend them to any point without the given line then fet one foor of them in and turn the circle de and and through de draw the dismeter acc meeting the circle in join ac and that right line is the per- pendicular required to turn the circle through any three given paimts not in right linc see fig vil fix three points at any diffance you think proper as at and and join them by the right lines ab and bt then by fig bifed the line bwish the line des which done bifell the line bc with the line fe and from the center where thefe lines meet extend your compaffes to and defcribe the cucle abcg to drow on oval see fis viii draw given line which divids into four qual parts fet one foot of the compaffes at and from that center defcribe circle ee with the same exrent of compaffes place one foot in the center and turn the circle yf then with one foot fill in extend your compaffes and turn the rch gg and with the same extent placing one foor in describe the arch join the interfections with perpendi- cular from to next place one foot of the com- paffes in fweep the arch ll and without allering them fer one foot in and defcribe the arch mat nother another melbed for an oval see fiz ix draw given line ad and with the compaffes extended placing one foot in with the other turn the circle ce then without alering your compalfes on the line ad in the fuppofed point weep the circle and through the points ggs where the two circles interfed draw the perpendicular bis then fix your compaffes with one foot in and extend them to as to describe the firch ix to the lower extremities of the citcles then with the same extent with one foot in tweep the arch to join the upper ex- fremiries by thefe examples it will appear that an oval of any form of size may be confiructed at pleature only ta- king care always to fix the compaffes equidiflant from the given line in the perpendicular examples in perfpettive to draw square pourment in perspettive see fiz and xl uppose your piece of pavement to confift of of marble each foot quare vour firff bufiness is to draw an ichnographical plan of ground plot of it which is thus performed having made an exact square of the size you intend your pian divide the bate and horizon into eight equal parts and from every divifion in the bafe to its oppo- fite point in the herisen rule perpendicular lines then divide the sides into the jame number ruling pa- rallel lines acrots from peint to point to will your pavement be divided inte square feet becaufe the eight feet in length mulciplied by the fame in breadth five the number of quare feet or pieces of marble contained in the whole then rule disgonals from corner to corner and thus will your ground plob appear as in fis now to lay this in perfpeltive draw another square to your intended size and divide the bate line ab into eight equal parts as before then fix your point of sight in the middle of the horizon de and from the same point rule lines to every divilion in the bate after which ruls disgonal lines from to and from to anfwerable to thofe in the ground-plot and your square will be reduced to the triangle bc then from the point where the disgonal db interfets the line ac to the oppos fire interfection where the disgonal croffes the line cb rule parallel line which is the abridg- ment of the square then through the points where the disgonals crofs the reft of the lines which go from the bafe to the point of sight rule parallel lines and your square pavement will be laid in perspective as in fig xi to find the height and preportion of any objects as they appear above the herizon on jupposed plane see fiz xii firff rule your horizental line no and fix your point of sight as at then mark the place of your neareff pillar by making dot for the bate or bot- rom as at and another for the summit or top as at rule line from to the point of sight and another from bro and thefe two lines will give the height of any number of pillars as for example suppose you would have pillar at fix your dot for the bafe and rule from thence pa- rallel line to meet the diagonal am at then rule the perpendicular de to the disgonal bm which perpendicular is the height of your figure fe- quired at or if you would place pillars at and obferve the same method ruling the parallets fg and ik and the perpendiculars gll and kl will give their heights at the diftances required to find the diameter of thickness of pillars at any particular diftances you are allo to be guided by that neareft the bafe for inftance suppofe your neareft pillar to be ten feet high and one foot in diameter divide it from top to bottom into ten equal parts and fet off one of them upon the bafe of the pillar then rule line from the point of sight to the diameter and you will have the thickness of all your pillars on their respective parallels of bales the same rule exemplified in objects below the herizen see fig xiii if you would know the heights of number of figures below the hofizon rule your horizental line lr and fix your point of sight as at then place your neareft figure or mark the dots for the head and feet by the points and which an fivers the same purpofe and rule from thefe dots to the point of sight the lines pand bp and if you would find the height of figure to be drawn at rule from thence the parallel ed to the diagonal bp and the perpendicular de will give the height re- quired the fame directions will thew the height of fizure at any other diffance you have mind to place it as at and by ruling the parallels and ma and from each of thefe their respective perpendiculars and no which perpendicu- lars will fhew the heights of the figures at and to draw dirett view see fig xiv to illuffrate this example fuppofe you were to draw the infide of church as reprefented in this figure firlt take your station at the point in the center of the bafe lint bc from which you have front view of the whole body of the church with all the pillars e on each side then fix your horizon at any height you think proper as at de bifed it by the perpendicular and where thefe two lines inserfed is the point of sight this perpendicular will pats through the centers of all the arches in the dome of cupola which centers may be found by any three given points as in fig vil next divide your bafe line into any given number of feet and the vifual lines ruled from thefe di- vifions to the point of sight will reduce all your objects to their juft proportion by fetting off their height upon pernendicular raifed at their respective diftances the bafe in the example here given is divided into twelve equal parts of five feet each from which luppoting your front column to be feet high take feven divifions from the bafe of your drawing and fet them off upon the perpendicular gh then suppoling this column to be five feet thick at the bafe fer off one of thote divifions upen the parallel ik which is the breadsh required so that by proportioning this scale to any diffance by the foregoing directions you may not only find the dimentions of all your columns but alfo of every ciffind part of them as well as of all the doors windows and other objects that occur for inftance having found the height and breadth of your firff or neareff column draw from the top and bortom of the faid column to the point of sight the lines hif and kf after which rule the line from the bafe of the column to the point of sight and you have the height and breadsh of all the reft of the columns as has been already thewn in fig xii by fuling lines from the points to the point of sight you will fee that all the sum- miss and bafes of your columns doors windowss c muft tend immediately to that point and by lines drawn from the points ec on each side to the correpondent points on the oppo- fire side may be feen all the parts of your building lying upon the same parallel to draw an oblique view see fis xv firft draw your horizental line then if your favourite object be on the right hand as at place yourself on the left hand upon the bafe line as af then from that station erect perpendicu lar de which will pats through the horizon at the point of sight to which rule the diagonals gf and tlf which will shew the roof and bafe of your principal building and will allo as before directed ferve as standard for all the reft obferve alfo either in direct or oblique vews whe- ther the prospect before you make curve for if it does you mult be careful to make the same curve in your drawing to draw perspective view wherein are accidental points see fiz xvi rule your horizontal line ab and on one part of it fix your point of sight as at from which rule the diagonals ed and ce on the one fide and of and cg on the other which will shew the roofs and bafes of all the houfes in the street directly facing you suppoting yourtelf placed at in the center of the bafe line then fix your accidental points and the horizontal line and rule from them to the angles if and where the streets on each side take different direction towards the accidental points and and the lines gi and gt give the roofs and bafes of all the buildings on one fide as ib and mb do on the other c points feldom intervene where the dif tance is ismall as in noblemens seats groves ca- nals coc which may be drawn by the hrid rules of perspective but where the prospect is extenfive and varied including mountains bridges caltles rivers precipices woods cities it will require fuch an infinite number of accidental points that it will be better to do them as nature shall dictate and your ripened judgment approve to find the center for the roof of house in an oblique view see plate iv suppose from the point of sight the vifual lines ba and ac be drawn bc being one perpendicular given and de the other rule the disgonals from and from to and the perpendicular fg raited through the point of their inserfection will fhew the true center of the roof as will appear by ruling the lines geand gc for want of being acquainted with this necellary rule many who have been well verfed in other parts of perfredive have spoiled the look of their picture by drawing the roofs of their houles out of their true perpendicular chap
