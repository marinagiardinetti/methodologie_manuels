great and illuftrious of all ages not folely for private amufement but for their beneficial influence in society in promoting benevolence and inspiring delicacy of feeling this will not appear paradoxical if we obferve that they are evidently contrived to afford innocent pleafures difregarding the inferior fenfes in this light they may be confidered as rational fcience and when cultivated to an eminent degree of refinement they do honour to man- kind everv attempt to encourage and improve the elegant arts deferves great commendation fince there is too much reafon for believing that the interefts of humanity are not guarded or fo firmly fecured as cafily to re- to arong linquith thofe fuccours or forego thole affiflances which they adminitter to them since since painting is an art in which truth of out-line is no less neceffary than juftness of colouring apprehend few hints relative to the former will not even at this period be deemed fuperfluous or unneceffary for should thefe

diftinguished and raifed him to the notice and efteem not only of the firft artifts in the brisish nation but to the favour of our illuftrious monarch who in the commence- ment of an aufpicious reign and even in that early period of life when pleafure generally is the fole purfuit shewed an elegant tafle for the fine arts and has fince been gra- cioufly pleafed to protect and encourage the cultivation of them by the eftablishment of royal academy which from its firft inflitution has been conducted with fuch pro- priety and unremitting attention as to do honour to its profeffors and add dignity to the character of english- nen the hopes of rendering fome service to the art of paint- ing with crayons of fuggefting some hints which may pot- fibly give rife to further inquiries respecting this pleating htudy and of explaining its principles for the benefit of fuch as in this age of diffipation may prefer the filent amufement of beautiful art to the delufive enchantments in the gay circles of unreftrained pleafure have induced me to this undertaking and should it instruet or even en- courage fingle student shall not think my labour ill beftowed but happy shall be if my observations should in the leaft degree awaken the attention of the curious to thofe new fources of beauty and elegance which may yet he concealed for if they are found to be juft thofe who are mafters of the subject may be tempted to improve and ex- tend them be this as it may my aim by this publication is to be ufeful to thofe who want experience and therefore have not doubt but shall fland excuted from any im putation of vanity with thofe who do not require fuch affift- ance to the former with fuccess and would foften the cenfures of the latter by reminding them in the words of my motto that there is labour in the most trifting things elements afe epes ae nl iv concerning tafte il of drawing section of the application of the crayons with some dispofitions iv of drapery of the materials section vi of rolling the crayons and dispoting them for painting with cray ons ce in here is no disputing about taffe becaufe its prin- ciples are not abfolute and therefore they can not be defined the opinions of men concerning beauty and elegance in any of the fine arts are as various as their faces their difpofitions or the different climates in which they live nature it is true is in every particular confiftent with herfelf we are framed with minds capable of having the higheft relifh for the elegant arts and confe- quently nature has framed us with an uniformity of tafte to furnish proper objects for that high relifh without which the the arts could never have arrived at any degree of perfection and this is fufficient to convince us that they are not yet brought to perfection fome objects indeed of the fine arts make fuch lively impreftions of beauty grandeur and harmony of proportion as to command kind of ge neral taffe but inftances of this fort are very uncommon taste depends more on experience than on nature this is point which merits peculiar attention becaufe it opens to us fure method of improving our tafte in the elegant arts and is powerful incitement toward the cul- tivation and improvement of them fiudy which can not fail to embellifh manners and fweeten society all therefore that can be faid cencerning tafte is that there are certain principles that conftitute the fenfitive part of our nature and which being common to all pre- ferve kind of uniformity with respect to the emotions and feelings of different individuals the same object making upon every one the same impreffion or atleaft the fame in kind if not in degree this is the only way of account- ing for uniformity of tafte in the polite arts and this in other words may juftly be termed the common fenfe of mankind which is the only true flandard of tafle all other being equivocal or uncertain and confequently will never be fufficiently ggeneral to become flandards of tafte but the principles that conflitute the fenfitive part of our nature painting with cray ons nature will undoubtedly lead us to methods of afcertain- ing the common fenfe of mankind or flandard of tafte with great exactnets and accuracy these will determine almoft generally what is either elegant or beautiful and hence when our ideas are regu- lated and directed by thefe principles we may be faid to have formed good tafte and be enabled to difcern what is natural and proper and what is not fo true it is that inattention the force of example pre- udice or paffion may introduce bad tafte and banith good one in painting heavy compofition incorrect drawing and bad colouring may prevail notwithftanding the influence of thofe principles that conftitute the fenfitive part of our nature inftances of to defective tafte will however be very rare and when they happen they will feldom prejudice any but the poffeffors becaufe they can carry but little authority with them to impofe on others.— after all the remedy againft forming bad tafte is to hudy the works of men of good tafte this will enlarge the mind and by obfervation eftablish student in ood tafte of his own ii wing may be juftly termed the foundation of painting this should be the firft object of the student attention the more perfectly this is attained the greater is the certainty of acquiring excellence genius is the gift of nature but genius without cultivation can never arrive at the fummit of perfection the materials neceffary for drawing are port-crayon leather stump fome ftained paper charcoal black white and red chalk with drawing-board of about two foot quare some artifts reject the ufe of drawings or prints for the it is fay they fervile method of student imitation oc proceeding becaufe it cramps the ideas and hence ge- notwithflanding of nius fuffers too great confinement this the ufual practice is to copy after prints and drawings at firft and imagine experience has determined the advan- tages accruing from this method to fet the drawings in particular of the moft eminent artifls before young be- ginner at his firft commencement muft be highly benefi- o with cr atons as it moft undoubtedly will prevent rudeness and in- accuracy againft which the moft exact can not be too much guarded how much more then ought the young student to obferve this caution some geniufes require reftric- tion and when this happens to be the cafe the placing of accurate works before them muft hold them in kind of subjection from which alone correctness is to be ex- pected exact copies are abfolutely to be required at firft this will imperceptibly produce habit of correctnefe till by degrees the student will make himself mafter of thofe grand effentials to perfection truth boldness and free- dom truth will be acquired by this accuftomed correct- nets boldness and freedom will follow after as the certain confequence and on thefe the excellence of the performance muft depend.—copying the drawings of good mafters has alfo another confiderable advantage viz teaching good method of execution by which many laborious and fruit- lets efforts will be prevented crayon painters should pay particular attention to th drawing on ftained paper with black or red and white chalks as this kind of drawing has bold effect is allied to the manner of ufing the crayons and imparts knowledge of what is ufually termed the middle teint indeed in almoft every respect this method is attended with confiderable advantages but the young student should always have it in remembrance that his chief aim ought t be the making of correct drawing and of attaining truth of outline fince this is more effentially necefiary than smartness of touch or pleafing execution.— when he has made fome confiderable progress with the chalks he may then attempt the round or plaifter figures but here as in every other cafe care should be obferved in making choice of good subject for nothing is fo preju- dicial or dangerous as to copy from imperfect fubjects on which account he should be directed in his choice by the opinion of the moft experienced artifts who all recom- mend the study of the antique and other approved plaifter figures previous to the drawing after living models which will furnith the student with great knowledge and correct- nefs as has been before obferved and without which there is great danger of acquiring extravagant and pernicious ha- bits which are eafily attained without great care but they are not to eafily difmiffed when acquired to draw from living figure without having firft faudied the antique is no less abfurd than to attempt to underfland the clafficks without previous knowledge of the rules of grammar the human figure and especially the face is the moft difficult fludy but thorough knowledge of this particular will give facility of execution in every thing elfe when the student has made himfelf mafter of good degree of exactness by copying after prints or drawings let painting with crayons him be provided with fome good head caft after the antique one in which the features are ftrongly marked and boldly determined fuch as the hercules tupiter or wiobe as he will find the frength of either of thefe more eafy of imitation than the refinement and delicacy of the apotlo antinous or venus of medicis though the latter after time will be his favourite and moft valuable study after the choice of subject the next confideration will be to place it in proper light and shadow—if the win- dow is too near the ground the effet can not be pleafing becaufe the shadow will be diftracted into too many parts in this cafe the lower part of the window should be dark- ened with fomething that will quite obstruet the light about the height of fix feet which will throw the hades into very agreeable maffes on the subject for imitation which being thus placed having the drawing-board partly refting in the lap and partly on the table the moft convenient me- thod let the student carefully obferve the particular turn and action of the head how much the forehead is inclined over the right or left shoulder and how much over the back or breaft then with the charcoal let him lightly draw the general hapes of the head after which the center-line of the face from the middle of the forchead to the middle of the chin and then the crofs lines which determine the fituation of the eyes nofe mouth and roots of the hair all this being the foundation on which the student may give the the particular fhapes to each feature and he muft remem- ber that good proportioned face is divided into three equal parts the firfl contains the forchead the second the nofe and the third the mouth and chin from the roots of the hair to the crown of the head is juft the height of the forchead the nofe being the centre moft artifts begin their par- ricular shapes with that feature and from thence proceed to the eyes and mouth but let the student ketch the out-line very light that any miftake may the more eafily be altered his greateft attention muft be paid to the pro- ducing his drawing correct and the lines of the features parallel to one another and each at proper diftance if the student fails here all his labour in the finifhing will be to no purpofe but when the lines are properly drawn the broad shadows may be laid in with foft chalk difregarding the leffer parts till afterwards fweetening with the leather stump then the demy shades and the heightening with white are added with which the whole is to be compleated preserving an intermediate space of the ftained paper which as middle teint muft be left between the white and black otherwife the ufe of drawing on teinted paper is effectually deftroyed and the production will have heavy unpleafing effeet and be entirely deftitute of that greatness and breadth which diftinguithes the productions of mafter from the efforts of inferior abilities whien painting with cratons the student has made himfelf mafter of the know- ledge of the face he may proceed to the whole figure ffu- dying with much affiduity the cafts after the antique thofe almoft perfect flandards of grace majetty and beguty rulks it is faid are the fetters of genius but great man very judicioufly obferved lately that oo they are fetters only to men of no genius which is undoubtedly true for when they are properly ufed by men of abilities they rather affift genius than impede it on this account have given the meafures of fine proportioned human fi- gure with which it is neceffary the student should make himfelf acquainted previous to his fludies after the life and for this reafon place this particular before what propofe to fay on that important part of study the beft way to meafure the human figure is by faces ten of which from the loweft flairs on the forehead to the bottom of the chin is the beft proportioned height.— the face is divided into three equal parts iff the forehead the nofe and the mouth and chin.—from the chin to the collar-bones is twice the length of the nofe.— from the collar-bones to the loweft part of the breaft the length of the whole face.—from the bottom of the breaft to the navel one face and half nofc.—from the navel to the secrets one face.—from the secrets to the knee-pan t the knee-pan to the ancle two faces two faces.— from the ancle to the sole of the foot nofe and an half —when the arms are extended horizontally their length from the extremity of the longeft finger on one hand to the other should meafure the fame as the height of the figure from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot.— from the shoulder to the elbow the length of two faces.— from the root of the little finger to the elbow two faces from the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit of the collar one face.—the foot is the fixth part of man' height and the hand should meafure as much in length as the face.—the thumb is the third part of face in length the shoulder that the face is moft turned over is raifed higher than the other.— the shoulder bearing heavy bur- then will be raifed confiderably higher than the other.— the ilip on which the body chiefly refts will be raifed higher than the other the knowledge of anatomy to far as relates to the structure of the bones and difposition of the mufcles with their origin and infertion will enable the scudent to draw the human figure in great perfection this may be acquired by rudying some good treatife on the subject and by draw- ing the bones and mufcles in different views the attend- ing fome diffections if he has an opportunity will improve the student much fooner than any other method poffibly can le bruns lectures on the paftions of the soul read before the with cr yons the academy in france will impart great knowledge in the exprestion of the mufcles of the face which should be strictly attended to and alfo the knowledge of light and shadow as this in particular will inftruct him how to preferve harmony in his pictures and proper exprestion of the different projections thefe things being acquired ge- nius will improve by study and perfection and fame re- ward the labours of clofe application when the student draws from living models great care is required to place the figure in proper action after which particular attention should be paid to its general careful to preferve what is termed the center tway being of gravity which is that line always perpendicular from the pit between the collar-bones to the foot on which the figure reftst — the firft sketch muft be touched very lightly in square manner defcribing the large forms by which the action of the figure is expreffed the second time of drawing over the out-lines notice should be taken of thofe leffer parts which in the former flight sketch were neglected in each sketch the student muft begin at the head which muft be carefully placed in its proper inclina- tion or elfe however in other respects juftly drawn the figure will have an ungraceful appearance it muft be remarked that moll graceful figures fland on one foot only the other as an auxiliary wien when the out-line is correct and in good proportion the principal difficulty is overcome the next slep is to proceed to the shadows which muft be made broad and firm and not diftracted into too many parts which would perplex the student as all the inferior diftinctions in the feveral degrees of hadow ought to be second confideration and are therefore to be avoided when the whole care should be to preferve the maffes of light and fhade broad and maf- terly care should be obferved where the principal mats of light falls as in every well-fet figure there will be prin- cipal mass of light to preferve it broad not too much divided confidering the whole together before the parts in particular ir hadow is produced by any mufcle cc near the grand body of light it will at the firft view be apt to mif- lead the student and incline him to think it much darker than it really is but if compared with the principal hadow the true degree may be afcertained sometimes on the rifing of mufcle or the projection of bone the light may catch near the mass of thadow which if not drawn ten- der will have an unpleafing harth effect which can only be regulared by comparing it with the frongeft lights this method of comparing one degree of light and fhadow with another will be the only certain rule of preferving the tone and confiftency of the whole together as the comparing of lengths painting with cr tons and breadths with each other is the only rule to produce the juft forms of figures while the figure is refting the student will have an opportunity of placing his drawing at diftance by which means the eye will more eafily difcover how much he has erred from this rule which he may foften with linen rag or rub out with bread at pleafure.—as it can not be fuppofed the figure can for any length of time have the fame mufcles of his body in continual action the opportunity should be embraced while they are moft properly exerted to draw each limb and defcribe each particular mufcle the great variety of which will give liberty to the student to exercife his genius in producing his drawing in an elegant tafle ec tion iii of the application of the crayons with some previous dispositions yhether the painter works with oil-colours wa- ter-colours or crayons the grand object of his purfuit is ftill the fame juft imitation of nature but each species has its peculiar rules and methods.—painting with crayons requires in many respects treatment diffe- rent from painting in oil-colours becaufe all colours ufed dry are in their nature of much warmer complection than when wet with oils or any other binding fluid let this be proved by matter of fact —mr cotes painted portrait of sir william chambers which is in lord besborough' collection an ingenious foreigner had difcovered me- thod of fixing crayon pictures to that they would not rub or receive an injury if any accident happened to the glats the society for the encouragement of arts had before offered premium to any one who should difcover to valuable fecret for which premium he made appli- cation mr. cotes being eminent in his profeffion was defired to lend picture for the trial and give his judg- ment which was made on this portrait of sir william chambers paintinc with cr ayons the crayons he indeed to perfectly fixed as to refift any rub or bruth without the leaft injury which before would have entirely defaced or spoiled it but the picture which before had particularly warm brilliant and agreeable effect in comparifon became cold and purple and though in one fenfe the attempt fucceeded to the defigned intention of fixing the colours yet the bind- ing quality of whatever fluid was made ufe of in the process changed the complexion of the colours rendering the cold teints too predominant for this reafon in order to produce rich picture much greater portion of what painters term cooling teints muft be applied in crayon painting than would be judicious to ufe in oils with our any danger of miftake it is to be fuppofed the not being acquainted with this observation is one great caufe why to many oil-painters have no better fuccess when they attempt crayon painting on the contrary crayon painters being to much ufed to thofe teints which are of cold nature when ufed wet are apt to introduce them too much when they paint with oils which is feldom pro- ductive of good effect another observation would make which requires particular notice from the student who has been con- verfant with oil painting prior to his attempts with crayons oil painters begin their pictures much lighter and fainter than they intend to finith them which prefents the future colouring clear and brilliant the light underneath greatly affitting the tranfparent glazing and fcumbling colours which if they were laid over any part already too dark would but increafe its heavy effect on the contrary crayons being made of dry colours are difficult to procure fufficiently dark the grayon painter therefore will find an abfolute neceffity to begin his picture as dark and rich as poftible except in the ftrongeft lights for if once the grey and light teints become predominant it will be next to impoftible for him in the deep fhadows especially to reffore depth and brilliancy having no opportunity of glaz ing or fcumbling to give the effect as the grey teints being mixtures with whiting underneath will continually work up and render the attempt abortive shall now endeavour to give the student fome direc- tions towards the attainment of excellence in this art the student muft provide himfelf with fome ftrong blue paper the thicker the better if the grain is not too courfe and knotty though it is almoft impoffible to get any intirely free from knots the knots should be levelled with penknife or razor otherwife they will prove exceedingly troublefome after this is done the paper muft be pafted very finooth on linen cloth previoutly ftrained on deal that fide of the paper should be pafted which has the rrokes from the wires moft evident that the painting may be on the fmootheft fide otherwife the lines which thefe wires have left in the paper will prove troublefome and look unpicafant franle painting with cratons the fize according to the artiff pleafure on this the picture is to be executed but it is moft eligible not to palte the paper on till the whole subject is firft dead-coloured the method of doing this is very eafy by laying the paper with the dead-colour on its face upon finooth board or table when by means of brush the backfide of the paper muft be covered with pafte the frame with the itrained cloth muft then be laid on the pafted fide of the paper after which turn the painted fide uppermoft and lay piece of clean paper upon it to prevent finearing this being done it may be ftroked gently over with the hand by which means all the air between the cloth and the paper will be forced out when the pafte is perfectly dry the student may pro- ceed with the painting the advantages arifing from pafting the paper in the frame according to this method some crayon pictures are painted on vellum but the animal falts in the ikin very often caufe them to mildew it muft be confelfed the vellum gives the picture foft effect but its ufe can not be recommended in our unfavourable climate others make ufe of finalt grounds le tour lately painter of note in paris often ufed them with great fuccels the method to prepare them is to bruth over the paper with guin water which directly drew with finalt moderately fine the luperfluous part of which should be fwept off with painter bruth when the gum water is perfectly dry on this the picture is to be painted but we have paper now in england to be procured of fo excellent lexture as to render this preparation perhaps unnecellary it may be doing the young prac- itioner pleature to inform him that mr. bishop stationer in newport-preet long acre has made it his bufincts to provide himfelf with paper made on pur poic for crayon-painting drowing where the student may be fupplied with the belt fort of paper for his purpoic after the picture is begun are very great as the crayons will adhere much better than any other way which will enable the student to finith the picture with firmer body of colour and greater luftre the late mr. cotes dif covered this method by accident and efteemed it valuable acquifition and remember on particular occafion he removed fine crayon picture of rozalba and placed it on another ftrained cloth without the leaft injury by foaking the canvas with wet spange till the pafte be- tween the cloth and paper was fufficiently wet to admit of teparation when painters want to make very correct copy of pic- ture they generally make ufe of tiffany or black gauze frained tight on frame which they lay flat on the fub- ject to be imitated and with piece of fketching chalk trace all the out-lines on the tiffany they then lay the canvas to be painted on flat upon the floor placing the tiffany with the chalked lines upon it and with an hland- kerchief bruth the whole over this prefents the exact out-lines of the picture on the canvas the crayon- painter may alfo make ufe of this method when the fub- ject of his imitation is in oils but in copying crayon picture he muft have recourfe to the following method on account of the glafs the head of califid in the collection of dr. chauncg the paintinc with cratons picture being placed upon the efel let the out-lines be drawn on the glats with small camel'-hair pencil dipped in lake ground thin with oils which muft be done with great exactness after this is accomplished take sheet of paper of the lame fize and place it on the glass roking over all the lines with the hand by which means the colours will adhere to the paper which muft be pierced with pin-holes pretty clofe to each other the paper in- tended to be ufed for the painting muft next be laid upon table and the pierced paper placed upon it then with fome fine pounded charcoal tied up in piece of lawn rub over the perforated firokes which will give an exact out- line great care muft he taken not to bruth this off till the whole is drawn over with fketching chalk which is compofition made of whiting and tobacco-pipe clay rolled like crayons and pointed at each end when the student paints immediately from the life it will be moft prudent to make correct drawing of the out-lines on another paper the fize of the picture he is going to paint which he may trace by the preceeding me- thod becaufe erroneous ftrokes of the ketching chalk which are not to be avoided without great expertnets will prevent the crayons from adhering to the paper owing to certain greaty quality in the composition the student will find the fitting pofture with the box of crayons in his lap the moft convenient method for him to paint the part of the picture he is immediately painting should be rather below his face for if it is placed too high the arm will be fatigued let the windows of the room where he paints be darkened at leaft to the height of fix feet from the ground as before directed and the subject to be painted should be fituated in fuch man ner that the light may fall with every advantage on the face avoiding too much hadow which feldom has good effect in portrait painting especially if the face he paints has any degree of delicacy before he begins to paint let him be attentive to his subject and appropriate the ac tion or attitude proper to the age of the subject if child let it be childith if young lady express more vivacity than in the majeftic beauty of middle aged woman who alfo should not be expreffed with the fame gravity as perfon far advanced in years let the embellifhments of the picture and introduction of birds animals ec be regulated by the rules of propriety and confiftency the features of the face being carefully drawn with chalk let the student take crayon of pure carmine and carefully draw the noftril and edge of the nofe next the fhadow then with the fainteft carmine teintlay in the rongeft light upon the nofe and forchead which muft be executed broad he is then to proceed gradually with painting with cr ayons the fecond teint and the fucceeding ones till he ar- rives at the fhadows which muft be covered brilliant en- riched with much lake carmine little broken with brilliant-green this method will at firft offenfively hrike the eye from its crude appearance but in finithing it will be good foundation to produce pleafing effect colours being much more eafily fullied when too bright than when the firft colouring is dull to raife the picture into brilliant flate the feveral pearly teints difcernable in fine complections muft be imitated with blue verditer and white which anfwers to the ultramarine teints ufed in oils but if the parts of the face where thefe teints appear are in fhadow the grayons compofed of black and white muft be fubfticuted in their place thovch all the face when firft coloured should be laid in as brilliant as poffible yet each part should be kept in its proper tone by which means the rotundity of the face will be preferved ler the student be careful when he begins the eyes to draw them with grayon inclined to the carmine teint of whatever colour the iris are of he muft lay them in brilliant and at firft not loaded with colour but executed lightly no notice is to be taken of the pupil yet the student muft let the light of the eye incline very much to the blue calt cautioufly avoiding ftaring white appear- ancc which when once introduced is feldom overcome preferving broad fhadow thrown on its upper part by the eyc-lath black and heavy teint is alfo to be avoided in the eyc-brows it is therefore beft to execute them like broad glowing hadow at firft on which in the finith- the hairs of the brow are to be painted by which me- inc thod of proceeding the former teints will thew themfelves through and produce the moft pleafing effect the student should begin the lips with pure carmine and lake and in the fhadow ufe fome carmine and black the ftrong vermillion teints should be laid on afterwards he muft beware of executing them with fliff harth lines gently intermixing each with the neighbouring colours making the fhadow beneath broad and enriched with bril- liant crayons he mult form the corner of the mouth with carmine brown oker and greens varioufly intermixed if the hair is dark he should preferve much of the lake and deep carmine teints therein this may be eafily over- powered by the warmer hair teints which as obferved in painting the eye-brows will produce richer effect when the picture is finithed on the contrary if this method is unknown or neglected poverty of colouring will be dit- cernable pter cratons paintinc after the student has covered over or as artifts term it has dead-coloured the head he is to fweeten the whole together by rubbing it over with his finger beginning at the strongeft light upon the forehead paffing his finger very lightly and uniting it with the next teint which he muft continue till the whole is fweetened together often wiping his finger on towel to prevent the colours being fullied he muft be cautious not to fmooth or fweeten his picture too often becaufe it will give rife to thin and fcanty effect and have more the appearance of draw- ing than folid painting as nothing but body of rich colours can conflitute rich effect to avoid this as the student finds it neceffary to fweeten with the finger he muft continually replenith the picture with more crayon when the hlead is brought to fome degree of forward- ness let the back-ground be laid in which muft be treated in different manner covering it as thin as poftible and rubbing it into the paper with leather-stump near the face the paper should be almoft free from colour for this will do great fervice to the hlead and by its thinness give both foft and folid appearance in the back-ground alfo crayons which have whiting in their compofition should be ufed but feldom or never without caution but chiefly fuch as are the moft brilliant and the leaft adultc- rated the ground being painted thin next the hlair will give the student an opportunity of painting the edges of the flair over in light and free manner when he gives the finithing touches the student having proceeded thus far the face hlair and back-ground being entirely covered he muft carefully view the whole at fome diftance remarking in what respect it is out of keeping that is what parts are too light and what too dark being particularly attentive to the white or chalky appearances which muft be fubdued with lake and carmine the above method being properly put into execution will produce the appearance of painting princi- pally compofed of three colours viz carmine black and white which is the beft preparation painter can make for the producing fine crayon picture the next hep is to compleat the back-ground and the hair as the duft in painting thefe will fallon the face and would much injure it if that was compleated firft from thence proceed to the forehead finithing downward till the whole picture is compleated back grounds may be of various colours but it requires great tafte and judgment to fuit them properly to differ- ent complexions in general flrong coloured head should have weak and tender teinted ground and on the con- trary delicate complexion should be oppoted with rrong and powerful teints by which proper contraft be- weci painting ii cr atons the figure and the back-ground the picture will re- ceive great force and strike the spectator much more than it could poffibly do was this circumftance of contraft not attended to tounc painters often treat the back-grounds of pictures as matter of very little or no confequence when it is moft certain great part of the beauty and brilliancy of the picture especially the face depends upon the teints being well fuited the darks kept in their proper places and the whole being perfectly in fubordination to the face thus fimple back-ground requires attention but the difficulty is hill greater when variety of objects are introduced tuch as hills trees buildings ecc in thefe cafes one rule muft be strictly attended to that each grand object be dif- pofed fo as to contraft each other this is not meant mere- ly respecting their forms but their colour their light shade cc for inftance we will fuppofe the figure receiv- ing the ftrongeft light behind the figure and very near at hand are the ftems of fome large trees thefe muft have shade thrown over them either from driving cloud or fome other interpofing circumstance behind thefe ftems of trees and at diftance are feen trees on rifing ground thefe should receive the light as contraft to the former etc if an architedural back-ground be chofen the fame rule muft be applied fuppofe building at moderate diftance is placed behind the figure receiving the light column or fome other object in hadow should intervene to preferve proper decorum in the piece or what will have the fame effect fhadow muft be thrown over the lower part of the building which will give equal fatisfaction or repofe to the eyc it muft be remembered the light muft be always placed againft the dark and the weak againft the ftrong in order to produce force and effect and vice versa in painting over the forehead the laft time begin the higheft-light with the molt faint vermillion teint in the fame place where the faint carmine was firft laid keeping it broad in the fame manner in the next fhade fucceeding the lighteff the student muft work in some light blue teints compoted of verditer and white intermixing with them tome of the deeper vermillion teints sweetening them to- gether with great caution infenfibly melting them into one another increafing the proportion of each colour as his judgment shall direct some brilliant fellows may alfo be ufed but paringly and towards the roots of the hlair rrong verditer teints intermixed with greens will be of lingular fervice cooling crayons compoted of black and white should fucceed thefe and melt into the hair this direction is for the finell complections but the student mull vary his colouring according to his fubjecl deneath with cr tons beneath the eyes the pleafing pearly teints are to be per- terved compofed of verditer and white and under the nofe and on the temples the fame may be ufed be- heath the lips teints of this kind alfo are proper mix- ing them with the light greens and some vermillion the introduction of greens and blues into the face in painting has often given furprize to thofe who are unac- quainted with the art but there is reafon fufficient for their introduction tho it may appear ftrange at firft in order to break and correct the other colours the carmine predominating in the dead colour is as has been obferved the beft preparation for the fucceeding teints the crudeness of this preparation muft be corrected by varioutly intermixing greens blues and vellows which of thefe are to be ufed is to be determined by the degree of carmine in the dead colour and the complexion in- tended the blue and vellow are of nature diametri- cally oppofite and ferve to correct the reds and oppoie one another the greens being compounded of both thefe colours is of peculiar ufe in many cafes where the tranfi- tion is not to be to violent the student attentively confidering nature will dif- cover pleafing variety of colours on the furface and dif- through clear and tranfparent skin this variety will be sill encreated by the effect of light and hade he will perceive one part inclining to the vermilion red an- other to the carmine or lake one to the blue this to the green and that to the vellow ecc in order to produce thefe different effects he will apply thofe colours to which the teints are moft inclined yet in crayon painting it is often beft to compound the mixed colours upon the pic- ture fuch as blue and fellow inftead of green blue and carmine inflead of purple red and vellow instead of orange in other circumftances the compounds already mixt should be ufed but in this cafe there can be no ab- folute rule given it muft be left to the experience and difcretion of the painter though the student may be great- ly affifted in the commencement of his studies by an able mafter to direct and point out the beft method to treat circummftances of this nature as they occur in practice which may at firft appear obicure and myfterious but will foon to good capacity become demonftrably clear upon certain and fure principles the circumftances that require different treatment are fo various and to many as to render it im- postible for me here to defcend to every particular iw finithing the checks let the pure lake clear them from any duit contracted from the other crayons then with the lake may be intermixed the bright vermillion and laft of all if the futycel should require it few touches of painting with cr atons the orange coloured crayon but with extreme caution after this fweeten that part with the finger as little as poftible for fear of producing heavy difagreeable effect on the cheeks as the beauty of crayon picture con- fifts in one colour thewing itfelf through or rather between another this the student can not too often remark it be- ing the only method of imitating beautiful complections the eye is the moft difficult feature to execute in crayons as every part muft be expreffed with the utmoft nicety to appear finithed at the same that the painter muft preferve its breadth and folidity while he is particu- larizing the parts to accomplith this it will be good general rule for the student to ufe his crayon in fweetening as much and his finger as little as poffible when he ants point to touch fmall part with he may break off of little of his crayon againft the box which will produce corner fit to work with in the minuteft parts if the eyc-lathes are dark he muft ufe fome of the car- mine and brown oker and the crayon of carmine and black and with thefe he may alfo touch the iris of the kye if brown or hazel making broad fhadow caufed by the ryc-lath red teints of vermillion carmine and lake will execute the corners of the eye properly but it the eyc-lids are too red they will have difagrecable fore appearance the pupil of the eye muft be made of pure lamp-black between this and the lower part of the iris the light will catch very firong but it muft not be made too fudden but be gently diffuted round the pupil till it is loft in shade when the eye-balls are fufficiently prepared the fhining speck muft be made with purc white crayon which should be firft broken to point and then laid on firm but as it is poffible they may be defec- tive in neatnels they should be corrected with pin taking off the redundant parts by which means they may be formed as neat as can be required the difficulty with respect to the nofe is to preferve the lines properly determined and at the fame time to art- fully blended into the cheek as to express it projection and yet no real line to be perceptible upon clofe exami- nation in fome circumftances it should be quite blended with the check which appears behind it and determined entirely with flight touch of red chalk the fhadow caufed by the nofe is generally the darkeft in the whole face partaking of no reflection from it furrounding parts carmine and brown oker carmine and black and fuch brilliant crayons will compofe it beft student having before prepared the lips with the frongeft lake and carmine cc muft with thefe colours make them compleatly correct and when finifhing intro- duce the ftrong vermillions but with great caution as they ifc painting with cratons extremely predominant this if properly touched will give the lips an appearance equal if not superior to thofe executed in oils notwithflanding the feeming fupe- the latter has by means of glazing of which the former is entirely deftitute when the student paints the neck he should avoid ex- prefting the mufcles too ftrong in the ftem nor should the bones appear too evident on the cheft as both have an un- pleafing effect denoting violent agitation of the body circumftance feldom neceffary to express in portrait painting the moft neceffary part to be exprefted and which should ever be obferved even in the moft delicate fubjects is jult above the place where the collar bones hrong marking unite and if the head is much thrown over the shoulders tome notice should be taken of the large mufcle that rifes from behind the ear and is inferted into the pit between the collar bones all inferior mufcles should be in ge- neral quite avoided the student will find this caution neceffary as moft fubjects especially thin perfons have the muicles of the neck much more evident than would be ju- dicious to imitate as few necks are too long it may be nccellary to give fome addition to the ftem fault on the the method with which painters in oils exprets tranfparency in the lips is by painting them firll with light vermillion teints and when dry touching them over with pure lakc other fide being quite unpardonable nothing being more ungraceful than fhort neck in colouring the neck let the student preferve the ftem of pearly hue and the light not fo ftrong as on the cheft if any part of the breaft ap- pears it tranfparency muft alfo be expreffed by pearly teints but the upper part of the cheft should be coloured with beautiful vermillions delicately blended with the other iv ainting the drapery is commonly thought to be very inferior branch of the art this is moft certainly miftake very great painter being afked what part of the picture he thought moft difficult to execute antwered the drapery whether we allow this to be abfolutely true or not we may venture to affirm that it is very difficult part to execute with tafte merely to give the effeet of silk sattin or cloth coc is not the point this the fervile co- pyift by the mere dint of labour may effect and may even deceive paintinc with cr ayons the vulgar eye to that the imitation may be taken for reality but to make the folds give grace and dignity to the figure to cloath it uninfiuenced by prejudice fathion or caprice fo as to bear the teft of ages requires the fulleft exertion of true genius and the frudy of man life but it is not my defign to fay much on this copious subject there- fore shall difmiss it with few observations concerning the colouring and execution dark blue purple black pink and all kind of red draperies alfo should be firft tinged with carmine which will render the colours much more brilliant than any other method over this should be laid on the paper the middle teint medium between the light and dark teints of which the drapery is to be painted except the dark maffes of chadow which should be laid on at firft as deep as poffi- ble thefe sweetened with the finger being deftitute of the smaller folds will exhibit mafterly breadth which the lefter folds when added ought by no means to deftroy with the light and dark teints the smaller parts are next to be made with freedom executing as much with the crayon and as little with the finger as poftible in each fold touching the laft flroke with the crayon which ftroke the finger muft never touch in the cafe of reflections the fimple touch of the crayon will be too harfh therefore fingering will be neceffary afterwards as reflected lights are always more tender than thofe which are direct with respect to reficelions in general they muft always partake of the fame colour as the object reflecting but in the cafe of fingle figures it may be ufeful to make fome particular obferva- tions in blue drapery let the reffections be of greenith call in green draperies make them of yellow teint in yellow of an orange in orange reffeet reddith caft in all reds fomething of their own nature but inclined to the yellow black should have reddith reflection the re- flection of reddith teint will alfo prefent purples to the beft advantage or whatever colour the drapery is its reflection on the face muft partake thereof otherwife the picture will have but gaudy effect linen lace fur should be touched spiritedly with the crayon fingering very little except the latter and the laft touches even of this like all other parts should be executed by the grayon without fweetening with the finger have contented myfelf with treating on the firft prin- ciples of the art of painting only which hope will prove not altogether ufeless becaufe many judicious writers on the subject have not been to explicit concerning the ele- ments painting with crayons of the art whofe works notwithftanding merit the higheft attention and to whom muft recommend the stu- dent for farther knowledge and instruction the methods have recommended have been practifed by the moft cele- brated crayon painters whofe works have been held in public eftimation but the knowledge of and ability to exxecute each feparate part with brilliancy and truth will be found very infufficient to conftitute compleat painter without his judgment enables him to unite them with each other by correctness of drawing propriety of light and thadow and harmony of colouring in order to accom- plish this the student should carefully avoid finishing one part in particular till he has properly confidered the con- nection it is to have with the reft the neglect of this is the principal reafon why the performances of indifferent painters are fo deftitute of what is termed breadth fo con- spicuoutly beautiful in the works of great mafters it muft be granted that this obfervation relates more particu- larly to large compofitions where diverfity of figures re- quires fuch judicious difpofition that each may affitt in the combination of kind of univerfal harmony yet even in portrait painting the student should be particu- larly attentive to observe this idea of breadth if he is de- firous of acquiring that importance and dignity which con- stitutes excellence in painting se ct ton on of the material perfection of the crayons confifts in great meafure in their foftness for it is impoflible to execute brilliant picture with them if they are otherwife on which account great care should be obferved in the pre- paring them to prevent their being hard.—in all compo- fitions flake-white and white-lead should be wholly re- jected becaufe the flighteft touch with either of thefe will unavoidably turn black the ufual objection to crayon paintings is that they are subject to change but whenever this happens it is intirely owing to an injudicious ufe of the above-mentioned whites which will fland only in oils to obviate the bad effects arifing from the ufe of fuch grayons let the student make ufe of common whiting prepared in the following manhner take large veffel of water put the whiting into it and mix them well together let this fland about half mi- nute then pour off the top into another veffel and throw the with crayons gritty fediment away let what is prepared reft about minute and then pour it off as before which will purify the whiting and render it free from all dirt and grittinets.— when this is done let the whiting fettle and then pour the water from it afterwhich lay it on the chalk to dry and keep it for ufe either for white crayons or the pur- pofe of preparing teints with other colours for with this all other teints may be fafely prepared if the student chufes to make crayons of the whiting immediately after it is wathed it is not neceffary to dry it on the chalk for it may be mixed inftantly with any other colour which will fave confiderable trouble all colours of heavy or gritty nature especially blue verditer muft be purified by wath- ing after this method the student muft be provided with large fexible pallet-knife large stone and muller to levigate the colours two or three large pieces of chalk to abforb the moifture from the colours after they are levigated piece of flat glass to prevent the moifture from being abforbed too much till the colours are rolled into form and veffels for water spirits ec as neceffity and convenience thi direct eds mine and ir is rather difficult to procure either good carmine or good lake good carmine is inclined to the vermillion teint and should be an impalpable powder and good lake to the carmine teint the carmine crayons are prepared in the following manner as their texture is inclinable to hardness inflead of grind- ing and rolling them take fufficient quantity of carmine lay it upon the grinding-ftone mix it with levigating knife with spirits of wine till it becomes fmooth and even yet the lets friction produced by the knife the better the chalk-ftone being ready lay the colour upon it to abforb the spirit but be careful that it is laid on in pro- per hape for painting if it is levigated too thin the grayons will be too flat and if too thick it will occafion wafte of colour by their adhering to the pallet-knife but practice will render the proper degree of confiftency familiar when thus made if the carmine crayons should prove too hard they muft be reduced to an impalpable powder in mortar and again mixed in the same manner till foft chough painting with cr yons for ufe which will not be if the carmine be ground by the muller with any fluid the limple colour being prepared the next slept is to compofe the different teints by mixture with whiting the proportion to be obferved confifting of twenty grada- tions to one which may be clearly underffood by the fol- lowing directions take fome of the fimple colour and levigate it with spirits of wine adding about one part of wathed whiting to three parts of carmine of which when properly incorporated make two parcels the next grada- tion should be compoted of equal quantities of carmine and whiting of which four crayons may be made the third compofition should have one fourth carmine and three fourths whiting of this make fix crayons which will be good proportion with the reft the laft teint should be made of whiting very faintly tinged with carmine of which make about eight crayons which will compleat the abovementioned proportion as thefe compound teints are levigated they are to be laid immediately upon the chalk that the moifture may be abforbed to the proper de- gree of drynels for forming into crayons which may be known by its lofing the greateft part of its adhefive quality when taken into the hand if the confiftency is found to be right it may be then laid upon the glass which having no pores will prevent the moifture from becoming too dry before it is convenient to form it into crayons otherwife the grayons would be full of cracks and very brittle which will be great inconvenience when they are ufed in painting though thefe teints made with whiting may be rolled yet the pure carmine will not bear it but muft be left on the chalk-ftone till perfectly dry is colour very apt to be hard to prevent which the student muft obferve the following particulars take about half the quantity of lake intended for the grayons and grind it very fine with spirits of wine let it dry and then pulverize it which is eafily done if the lake is good then take the other half and grind it with spirits after which mix it with the pulverifed lake and lay it out directly in crayons on the chalk the colour will not bear rolling the fimple colour being thus prepared proceed with the compound grayons as directed before and in the same degrees of gradation as the carmine teints if thefe should prove too hard when made let them be again pul- verized and treated as the carmine ver painting ith crayons or native cinabar to prepare the beft is inclined to the carmine teint this colour mix it on the stone with foft water or spirits after which it may be rolled into crayons it is fome- times indeed inclined to be fo very foft as to return again to powder and can not be held in the fingers which may be remedied by mixing it up with thin water-gruel well frained which will give fufficient cohefion the diffe- rent teints are produced by mixture of the fimple co- lour with whiting according to the proportions already given is colour very apt to bind and is rendered foft with more difficulty than carmine and lake the fame method of preparation is to be followed with this as directed with respect to lake only it is neceffary to grind larger quan- tity of the pure colour as it is chiefly ufed for painting dra- peries the different teints may be made according to neceffity or the fancy of the painter is colour naturally gritty and therefore it is neceffary to wath it well its particles are fo coarfe as to require fome binding matter to unite them otherwife the crayons will never adhere together to accomplith this take quan- tity fufficient to form two or three crayons to which add piece of flacked plaifter of paris about the fize of pea mix thefe well together and form the crayons upon the chalk this blue is extremely brilliant and will be of great ufe in heightening draperies ec the teints muft be formed with whiting as directed in the former inftances and are highly ferviceable for painting fleth to produce thofe pearly teints to beautiful in crayon pictures it is not necefiary to mix the compounds with fpirits as clear water will be fufficient brilltant greens are produced with great difficulty which may be procured of thofe who make it their bufiness to prepare them yet the following compositions will be take yellow oker and after grinding it found ufeful thefe brilliant crayons will be necelfary for the student to compleat his fet with of which he will find great want both in the browns and deep reds as well as in the greens but in general he should be careful what white or light crayons he ufes that they are not compounded by the maker with flake- white trial may be made of one of them thus bruife the crayon to powder between the finger and thumb and mix it with an equal quantity of charcoul- dull put this into crucible which muft be placed in fierce fire till the char- coal duft is confumed and if the crayon be made with flake-white the lead will return to its original metallic flate confequently thefe light crayons are not fit for ufe in this limate as the leall damp will make them turn black yet notwithlland- ing the dark colours will be perfectly good and may be ufed without danger with painting with cr yons spirits mix it with the powder of pruffian blue then temper it with knife and lay the crayons on the chalk without rolling them befides this ufe king yellow mixed with pruffian blue brown oker and pruflian blue the crayons made of thefe laft may be rolled various teints may be produed by thefe colours according to fancy or neceflity fome to partake more of the blue and others of the yellow is the moft ufeful and the moft brilliant levigated with spirits of wine and compofe the different teints as before directed yellow oker and naples yellow ground with spirits will make ufeful crayons produced with king'-yellow and vermillion ground together with spirits and the teints formed as in other cafes but no great quantity of them is required vl ii is fine dark brown after fix or eight of the fimple crayons are prepared feveral rich compound teints may be roman oker and pruffian blue mixed in different proportions will be ufcful produced from it by mixture with carmine in various degrees black carmine and this colour mixed together make ufeful teints for painting hair feveral gradations may be produced from each of thefe by mixture with whiting roman and brown oker are excellent colours either fimple or compounded with carmine whiting tinged in feveral degrees with either of thefe will prove very ferviceable in painting common sea-coal ground and mixed with carmine is fine brown may be treated in juft the fame manner only it is ne- ceftary to levigate it with spirits of wine prussian elue ground with spirits and mixed with pul- verized lake will produce good purple carmine thus mixed with pruffian blue will produce purple fomething different from the former various teints may be made from either of thefe compounds by mixture with whiting painting with crayons is the only full black that can be ufed with fafety as all others are fubject to mildew but as good lamp-black is very fcarce the student will perhaps find it moft expedient to make it himself the process of which is as follows provide tin cone fix it over lamp at fuch height that the flame may juft reach the cone for the foot to ga- ther within it when fufficient quantity is collected take it out and burn all the greafe from it in crucible it muft then be ground with fpirits and laid on the chalk to abforb the moifture various grey teints may be formed from this by mixture with whiting as mentioned in for mer inftances black chalk ground is very good blue black cinabar mixed with carmine.—this is compofition of great ufe and teints made from this with whiting will be found very ferviceable carmine and black is another good compound of which five or fix gradations should be made fome partaking more of the black and others having the carmine moft predomi- nant befides feveral teints by mixture with whitng cinabar and black is alfo very ufeful compound from which feveral different teints should be made paussian elue and black is another good compound and will be found of fingular fervice in painting draperies ir is impoftible to lay down rules for the forming every teint neceffary in compofing fet of crayons there being many accidental compofitions entirely dependant on fancy and opinion.—the student should make it rule to fave the leavings of his colours for of thefe he may form various teints which will occafionally be ufeful the cologn or cullen'-earth yellow oker brown oker roman oker naples vellow umber black chalk and sea-coal duft are all subject to throw out white kind of falt which will injure the picture if the following method of treating them be not ftrictly obferved grind them extremely fine with water and feparately put them into large glazed veffel filled with bollinc water.. after the colour has been well ftirred leave it to precipitate then pour off the water which will take away the falts and leave the colour excellently prepared for making grayons after it has been dried on the chalk-ftone and pulverifed on painting with cr ayoe vi of rolling the crayons and disposinc them for paintinng he different compositions of colours muft be cut into proper magnitude after they are prepared in or- der to be rolled into paftils for the convenience of ufing them each crayon should be formed in the left hand with the ball of the right firft formed cylindrically and then ta- pered at each end.—if the compofition is too dry dip the finger in water if too wet the compofition muft be laid upon the chalk again to abforb more of the moifture the crayons should be rolled as quick as poffible and when fi- nithed muft be laid upon the chalk again to abforb all re- maining moitture after the gradation of teints from one colour are formed the chalk and the grinding-ftone should be well fcraped and cleanfed with water before it is ufed for another colour whien the fet of grayons is compleated according to the rules prescribed they should be arranged in claffes for the convenience of painting with them.—some thin drawers divided into number of partitions is the moft convenient method of difpoling them properly the crayons should be depofited according to the feveral gradations of light the bottom of the partitions muft be covered with bran as bed for the colours becaufe it not only preferves them clean but prevents their breaking the box made ufe of when the student paints should be about foot quare with nine partitions in the upper corner on the left hand fuppofing the box to be in the lap when he paints let him place the black and grey crayons thofe being the moft feldom ufed in the second partition the blues in the third the greens and browns in the firft partition on the left hand of the second row the carmines lakes vermillions and all deep reds the yellows and orange in the middle and the pearly teints next and as thefe laft are of very delicate nature they muft be kept very clean that the gradations of colour may be eafily dif- tinguithed in the loweft row let the firft partition con- tain piece of fine lnen rag to wipe the crayons with while the second all the pure lake and ver- they are ufing million teints and the other partition may contain thofe teints which from their complex nature can not be claffed with any of the former
