printed for prruz at locke ’ -head in amen corner pater-noster-row occxxxit price one shilling to the lady walpole madam your ladyship is distinguished for your excellent per formances in paint- ing japaning and many other curious arts beg leave to lay before you few experi enced receipts which have ne ver yet appeared in the world many of theml have been at great pains and expence to procure and for the rest am obliged to some manuscripts of the great mr the dedicatton boyle 't is by the influence of his name that venture to address this little treatise to your lady ship which perswade myself will not be unacceptable to you as am sure the experiments therein contamed will fully answer their several intentions am madam your ladyship' most obedient humble servant preface the following piece is designed for tbe instruction and en tertainment of gen tlemen and ladies who chuse to divert themselves in the cu rious arts of drawing japan ing painting upon glass var nishing upon metal wood or past board and of taking views and prospects justly according to the rules of perspective the author has taken care to prescribe short and easy directions for the speedy attaining the know ii the preface ledge of these useful and amusing arts without giving the students the trouble of consulting large vo lumes which are generally taken from one another right or wrongs or of learning several branches of the mathematicks as is generally thought necessary in order to un derstand perspective science without the knowledge of which it is impossible to make any great improvement in the arts of draw ing or painting or even to be judge of good drawing or to un¬ derstand whether one is right or wrong in what one would invent or design mus confess owe my know ledge of several valuable receipts to some manuscripts of the great mr. boyle which have never been printed and have fallen into my hands by means of the same no ble lord his relation whom before mentioned in my art of the preface drawing and painting in water colours am likewise obliged to wor thy gentleman who after deli berate study of perspective set me to rights in few hours when was at any loss as for the rest they are obsersations from the ex periments which have made from time to time at large expence and with great industry have been upbraided by some workmen in curiosities for publish ing receipts of value to instruct the gentry in the manner of draw¬ ing and painting and in arts of the like kind for say they it is damage to the workmen who get their livelihood by such things have short answe to this ar gument namely that there are none of the receipts which pub lish but what are either my own invention or have bought at good price or else have been pre sented with by people of fashion the preface with their desire to have them made publick and these are such as would never come to the know ledge of tbe workmen if was not te communcate them in this manner by which they have an opportunity of improving them selves as many of tbem have done from things that have already published in the same wa so that can say from my own certain knowledge that many of them are obliged to me and instead of com plaining ought to thank me if any person should find difficulty in the performance of any article shall be ready to put them to rights for reason able satisfaction the method of learning to draw in perspective chap short rules for drawing in perspective which will prove of great use to all de signers when observe the faults daily committed in the designing of landscapes or drawing views and prospects more and more find the necessity of knowing little perspective to correct and avoid such errors for under standing that art will render any one capable of drawing any thing with mathematical truth and certainty but conceive that the reason why so many mistakes are commonly made in drawings pro ceeds from the apprehensions that some have of the length of time it will take up to render themselves masters of perspective and from being frightned at the difficulties they conceive are in that study particularly imagining that one must be first well grounded in the mathematicks this know has discouraged many from engaging in the rules relating to this art but for their sakes undertake in this tract to instruct them in the following lessons how to lay any plan in perspective and raise pillars or buildings to due heights according to their proper distances lesson of the plan fig we have square piece of pavement as in figure consisting of twenty five pieces of marble each foot square it must be mea sured exactly and laid regularly down upon pa¬ per you may likewise for your better obser vation mark every other stone or marble black which will better inform you how every parti cular square will appear when we have true perspective view of them or else you may num ber every one and when the following lesson is done number those in the perspective plan with the same figures as are marked on the first plan lesson ii of laying figure in perspective it is to be understood in perspective that there are two points to be considered the first we call the point of sight that is what relates to every thing in our view from the place where we stand and it matters little where we stand to take our view for the perspective will still be true according to the appearance of the plan to our eye if we stand at corner or in the middle or at any point the method shall pre scribe presently will lay pur plan justly before us as it will appear the other point is called she point of distance because it governs the distances and the pro portions of every thing we can truly see of the plan in whatever position we happen to be fig ii at you see the plan of fig this is di vided into squares as mentioned in that figure the three at the bottom marked in both and the squares in the plan marked are those which are marked in perspective with the same numbers now to lay your plan in perspective fix your point of sight as you observe in the figure or more or less to the right or left as you think proper then draw the line parallel to and at what distance ypu will from the line then raise line on each side from to to form the figure you see as frame to your picture then draw line from the cor ner which is the point of distance to and this line will regulate your work then draw lines from the squares of your plan to the point of sight as exactly as possible and wherever your line of distance cuts those lines which are drawn from the squares of your plan to the point of sight that marks where your squares in perspective ought to be then draw lines parallel to the line where the line of distance cuts and that will give you the true figure of every square so in the perspective plan answers to in the measured plan and answers to the others in the same when you have done this the next rule you are to know is how to raise either pillars trees houses or any other bodies according to their respective heights at different distances and pro portion on the plan you have laid down how to raise pillars or any bodies of certain proportion in perspective you have now your plan measured out in perspective into squares of foot one of these squares in this lesson serves for the base or bot tom of pillar foot thick this figure iii is exactly of the same dimensions of the plan laid in perspective at figure ii first mark the line in equal proportions by the qame scale of the ground-plan figure ii as which are so many feet in height and they standing on the base of the first figure are up rights not in perspective then draw line parallel with from number which gives you the front of the body you are to raise and if it is to be only three feet high draw line cross from to the line raised from no and that determines the height which you will then find to be foot wide and three feet high by measure measure then from the top of the line draw line with black-lead pencil to the point of sight and raise another line from parallel to the line till it touches the pencil ’ line passing from to the point of sight which gives you the side-appearance of the column or body as you will fee it from the place where you stand the line from point should be drawn with pen because it is to remain then with pen cil draw line from to the point of sight which will determine the other line to make the shape of the top df the column and then raise line parallel with with pencil from the point till it touches the tine from to she point of sight draw then parallel line to at and you will have the square of the top of the pillar or column as you can observe it from the place where you stand which suppose to be at you must remember that the line drawn from to is only an ima ginary line to be rubbed out for it can not be seen from the place where you stand and there fore must not appear in the drawing but you should not leave it out because it shews you where to regulate the top of your column and teaches you how to place your column upon its base with certainty by this means you may see the front and one side of your column and the line from to must also be rubbed out because it can ’ be seen then finish your column only with the lines from to from to to from to and from to from it will be drawn without any imperfection and appear as follows in figure iv fig iv when this is done you may place another column on any one of the squares erected in the same manner observing to fling your shades all on one side and then you can not err but espe cially mind where the dotted lines are in fi gure iii when you can master these few lesions which you may gain with very little pains you will be capable of doing any thing in this way that will be regular and certain and know the faults of the ignorant and unskilful chap ii of painting upon glass painting upon glass is an art which has generally appeared so difficult that few have succeeded in the attempt and yet there is no representation of any portrait can appear more elegant than in picture done well in this manner for you have all the softness and all the tenderness that can be desired in picture and and it is easy too for any person to work upon for there are no out-lines to draw nor any shades to make but you put on the colours without the trouble of either the pictures which we use on this occasion are those done in mezzo-tinto or what we call mezzo-tincto prints for their shades are rubbed down with an instrument on the copper-plates so that the several lines which are forced to be drawn to represent the shady part of any common print are by this means scumbled together and appear as soft and united as in any piece done with indian ink when you are provided with such prints as you like cut off the paper of the margin so that none be left but the print itself then take some of the finest crown-glass and have it cut exactly to the size of your prints and when you have cleaned your glass very well lay on one side of it some fine venice turpentine as thin as possible with brush made of hog ’ -hair and if you perceive the turpentine to lie unequally pass piece of wood made like fiat ruler over it till it lies equal in every part then wet the back of your print with sponge and water and lay the pictur ’ side upon the turpentin ’ side of the glass taking care that every part of it lies close to the glass and that there are no bubbles or blisters to be seen then you may roll it over with wooden roll made like cylinder of two inches diameter to fix it close to the glass and when that is done wet the back of the print again with sponge and water till the paper will rub off with your fingers then rub it gently till there remains only the picture itself upon the glass so will you have all the lines and shades very visible as if it was fine drawing in indian ink then let it remain till the next day to dry for else the colours would not take because they are ground in oil colours for painting on glass with the necessaries for such work at most colour-shops of note in london we may meet with colours of several sorts ground in oil and tied up in little bladders to be fold at three-pence groat or six-pence piece according as they are more or less valuable of these provide as follow whites flake white white-lead yellows english pink yellow oaker dutch pink yellow orpiment reds rose pink vermillion red-lead indian red lake carmine verditer prussian blue sander blue indigo blacks lamp black ivory black greens verdigrease distill ’ verdigrease and yellow oaker mixt verdigrease andenglisti pink mixt verdigrease and dutch pink mixt blues ultramarine blue bise browns spanish brown umber when you are provided with these colours you may mix them one with another to what degree of colour you think proper upon pal let let with smooth knife with tender bending blade adding little more of one colour to ano ther mixing them well till you have what you want to get the colour out of the bladders prick hole at the bottom of each bladder you de sign to use and press the bladder till you have colour enough upon your pallet for your present use for in day time the colours will dry and ean never be recovered provide on this occasion box about two foot and half long about five inches high and sixteen inches wide with partitions in it as follow the use of this box which is to keep all your painting things together and preserve them clean shall here very particularly explain at number must be box of tinned no iron to be placed in the wooden box be cause it must hold oil of turpentine to clean your pencils when you have done work when you paint you must take care to use on ly one pencil in colour or in other words to have pencil for each colour and as soon as you have done using them for the day clean them from the colours by dipping them into the oil of turpentine and laying the hairy part of the pencil on the tinn ’ division be- no tween number and number press your finger hard on the hair and draw it four or five times oyer the tin then will the colours which came out of the pencils -fall into the tin-box number and by that means the pencils will be clean and the several mixtures of colours that fall there with their oils will become good size for gold then lay your pencils with their sticks no in the box no and they will be fit for use another time note the pencils should be of two sorts that is some of camel ’ -hair to paint with such as will come to point when the colour is in them and some dry brushes of white hair never to be dipp ’ in colour but used only to scunjble or join one colour in another when they are just laid on so that they appear soft atod you can not di stinguish where any one leaves off abruptly you ought at least to have three dozen of ca¬ mel ’ hair-pencils of all sizes and dozen and half of rough brushes with sticks to each about ten inches or foot long the sticks may be bought ready made at the colour-shops they are commonly made of cedar or brazil-wood but some nice persons have them turn ’ in ivory at numb you should have case di no vided of wood in several parts to keep your dry colours in such as carmine and ultra marine with others that you may keep by you to grind when you want them for sometimes you may have occasion in the country to grind colour that you want the reason of having divisions made in this box is to keep these colours from mixing with each other and thereby spoiling one another for if there were no separate apartments sometimes in hasty taking out or putting in of these co lours you may disturb the papers they are com monly wrapped in so much that some of the co lours will be spilled the fine or rich colours such as ultramarine or.carmine may rather be bought in powder than ground in oil for the first is worth near four pounds an ounce and she carmine if ’ tis good worth about twenty shillings therefore it is better to have these in powder than to have them ground in oil at the colour shops for by degrees they will dry though in the bladders and you will have so much loss from them the method to grind these in oil is to put little of either of them upon polished marble and with drop or two of oil mix them well with soft bladed knife and lay it on your pal let but of the ultramarine aud carmine very little will serve for the least touch on the light sides of your drawing will give lustre to your picture and if it be ultramarine it will be lasting whereas have great deal of reason to suspect that the pruffian blue will not if it is exposed to the weather at have observed in some sign-paintings of two years standing an there find that colour to change into dirty yellow but if we mix the prussian blue with varnish it will hold and last like ultramarine in short the air must be kept from it to pre serve it if we want to grind any other colours coarser than these in their powder we must have mul ler which must be made of one of the hardest stones we can get and finely polished porphyry would be the best made in the shape of sugar- loaf if one could get it but for the shape the sugar-loaf figure is the easiest fof any one to turn with their hand and every painter knows the way marble is good or any stone that will polish nay even glass or crystal or any such like thing but if you hive great quantity of colour to grind you must consider that you must have large quantity of oil but never so much as to overcome the quantity of colour in the grinding-part you may observe that the colour will frequently turn from under the mul¬ der then with thin knife scrape it up and place it under the muller again till 't is as fine as you desire it then immediately put it into piece of bladder first having che bladder immerged in warm water to soften it tie it up and let it remain to be used as have directed the others number may in its use be explain ’ no thus let that partition be lined with tin or iron tinn because this is to enclose the bladders of oils which you should always keep by you as oil of linseed and turpentine nut-oyl and burnt oil and in the taking of these in and out the apartment would be greasy and stain the wood whereas the tin will pre- serve it from any stain from the oils number is in the middle of the box no and should be made of tinh ’ iron like wise to take out and put in at pleasure for 't is to contain all the bladders of oiled colours and as some of them will be frequently used the re servoir for them must in time become greasy and over them is to be laid the pallet which every night after you have done your work should be cleaned of the colours you have put upon it or else covered with its colours in war ter to keep them useful till the next day to keep your pallet clean rub it with coarse lin- nen-cloath with oil of turpentine and then rub it till 't is dry as one may call it with nut or lin seed-oil but take what tare you will of your oil-co lours in small quantities when they are exposed to the air there will be coat of thick hard scale over them in day or two which indeed one may take off with knife but we lose much of the colour and some of them are very costly when you take off the scaly part the rest of the colour is fit to use and if it is too thick then put drop or two of linseed-oil to it and mix it well with your tender knife some people when they use ultramarine and carmine because of their great price only put drop of oil on their pallets and put as much colour to it as they think will be enough only working them together with knife which indeed is more saving than to mix it on the stone ii how to use the colours in painting on glass as the lines and shades of your picture hap pen to open so you ought to dispose your co lours that is lay on the lighter colours first on the light places of your prints and the darker over the shaded places and if you have once laid on the brighter colours 't is no great mat ter whether the darker sorts are laid little over them for the first colour laid on will hide those you lay on afterwards as for example yellows the lightest yellow may be laid on first and the dutch pink will shade it reds the red-lead may be laid on first as the bright est red colour and to shade it with lake or car mine will bring your picture to beautiful scar let equal to any tincture of the finest dye of cochineal blues lay on first the blue life and shade it with indigo or else take ultramarine and lay it on in the lights and lhade it with indigo greens lay on first some verdigrease and then the mixture have mentioned of that and the dutch pink but you may make this green as yellow as you please by adding more dutch pink as you see occasion it is to be noted that when any of these co lours are too strong they may be lightened to any degree by mixing white with them upon your pallet or you may darken them by mix ing them with the deeper colours but they must be well mixt with the knife before you use them when you have painted your glass it must stand three of four days before it will be dry enough to put in frame chap chap in os'the making of crayons for dry colouring the use of crayons for dry colours is so necessary in raking of views and prospects and there are so few crayons that are good of the sort that think the way of making them necessary article to be known to every one who is lover of drawing and painting it as for white we have nooccagon of any other than white soft chalk which should be sawed into lengths of an inch and half or two inches there are little saws made on purpose for such uses about four inches long and very thin when you have sew ’ out your crayons of chalk which should be at most quarter of an inch

must consider that the reason why we make five or six shades of each colour is because in this cafe we can not mix any when we use them whereas in oil-painting and painting in water-colours we may make what mixtures we please in an instant and when we set about any painting or drawing in crayons which hap¬ pens to have great variety of colour in it we ought not to be without every sort of colour that can be thought on ivbte these colours should be kept in box partitioned every sort by itself viz.-. thtwhite tellows lay the brightest sorts in one and the deeper sorts in another till'you come towards the orange-colours `` orange-colour^ the lighter sorts of orange-co- lours in apartment and the deeper in another reds the paler sorts or flesh-colours in one apartment the brighter reds in another the stronger reds in another and the .deepest reds in another every one with its proper shades till we come towards purple purples the paler sorts inclining to red in one apartment the next sorts more inclining to blue in another with their shades and these which are next digitized by joo^le niext to blue with their shades in part by them¬ selves blues should follow the purples put the light¬ est preparations in the first apartment the next degree into another third into another and the fourth to the last into others but keep the pruffian-blue quite by itself and its mixtures by themselves it'serves very well in this way to supply the place of ultramarine and as it is much cheaper forbear to mention the use of ultramarine-blue in this cafe which is ex¬ travagant in the price for crayon of it could not be made under half guinea and be¬ sides in this way of crayon-drawing the'pre¬ paration of pr « flian-blue does very well an¬ swer the fame end though that colour will not do in water-colours nor even last in oil-colours if it comes to be exposed to the weather- for in either case it changes to dirty yeliow-colour but find that the crayons hold by being imbodied as have directed greens should be divided into three or four sorts and with their shades be laid in several apartments browns should be likewise put in three or sour parcels with their .proper shades ’ to be
