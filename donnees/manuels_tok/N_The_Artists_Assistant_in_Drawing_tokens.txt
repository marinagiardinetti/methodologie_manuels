the artists assistant in drawing perspective etching engraving mezzotinto-scraping painting on glass in crayons in water-colours and on silks and satins containing the easiest and most comprehensive rules for the attainment of those truly useful and polite arts methodically digested and adapted to the capacities of young beginners illustrated with suitabie examples engraved on copper the third edition improved london printed for robert sayer map and print-seller ° in fleet-street and john smith ° as the act directs january has ever been the misfortune of those who have prosessed to lay down rules for the at tainment of any art or science to leave them enveloped with difficulties which if not ut terly insuperable at lealt dilcourage the learner from proceeding in study which he can have little hopes will ever reward his pursuit from hence we may reasonably infer that the said professors were totally unacquainted if not with the theory at least with the practical part of what they undertook to teach others and that the instructions they have given were founded rather upon bare supposition of their efficacy than upon the furer bafis of long and repeated experience which alone could have ensured their success and from which with all due deference to the judicious whofs sanction we shall at all times be ambitious to deserve we may venture to answer for the prac ticability of our own to obviate every objection and to remove all those difficulties which had so long blocked up the path of science and retarded if not wholly impeded the pupil in his progress to the temple of fame was the chief view in com piling the subsequent little treatise over and above the improvements made in illustrating the several arts hitherto so imper fectly and unitelligibly explained we have introduced directions for scraping in mezzo tinto which in this edition are still farther en larged and which as they have never been be fore attempted in any books of this kind we flatter ourselves will be the more acceptable especially when it shall appear from the rules laid down for the performance of this art that it is fo easy to be attained that tolerable profi ciency in drawing will enable any one to under take it with all imaginable prospect of suc cess the reader will also find in this impression the addition of very useful problem in the article of perspective illustrated by new plate as this book is chiefly intended for the use of young practitioners we have purposely avoided all abstruse expressions and obsolete terms contenting ourselves with such familiar stile as we judged most likely to inform those minds we would with to improve yet as the ideas ef an artist are not wholly to be conveyed without some necessary terms peculiar to each branch we have taken care to explain such as could not be omitted without manifest injury to the work by familiar words of synoni mous tendency where-ever they occur so that we apprehend we have not left the least stum bling-block for the reader to encounter the artists assistant chap of drawing drawing is the art of representing by outlines and shadows the various producti ons of nature and art and of enlarging and contracting objects in the most exact proportion this art recalls to our memory things long since past and rescues from oblivion the deeds of our illustrious ancestors at the same time that it revives their image in our mind by preserving their fea tures for many generations in word it may be said to be the silent but most expressive language of nature which speaks to the eye is underitood by all nations and conveys an idea where even words themselves would prove deficient after giving some general directions for the at tainment of this truly polite and rational amusement which is the basis on which all the rest of the arts depend we shall confider it more particularly under the following heads and lay down the most copious and intelligible rules for each respectively viz copying of draughts drapery emarging and contrasting landskip imitation of life light and shadown history the implements necessary for drawing are ruler compasses charcoal black lead pencil penknife porte-crayons black white and red chalk crayons indian ink crow-quill pens ca mel hair pencils fitches paper of several sorts and porte-folios general rules for drawing the first thing to be observed is the choice of proper originals and here we would recom mend le clerc ’ principles of drawing as the easiest and best calculated for the instruction of beginners this may be had price at the publishers of this work having provided this begin with the outlines of the several features as eyes nose mouth ears as they occur in the book practise these often over till you are quite master of them then procced to profile or side face after that to an oval or full face always remembering that each of these must be perfectly attained before you venture to proceed further when you can copy face correctly the next thing is to draw the several limbs or parts of the body as the hands arms feet legs then go on to the body itself which having done you will be able to undertake whole figure observing carefully the exact proportions and bearings of one part with respect to the other the learner ought to be particularly cautious that he do not attempt whole figure before he has made himself master of the several parts for this is begin ning the work at the wrong end and is indeed the same thing as if man should attempt to climb to the top of house without the help of the stairs as for beasts birds fruit plants we deem it useless to give directions for drawing them as it is wellknown thar he who has fo far improved his ideas as to be able to draw human figure correctly will find it no difficulty to perform every other branch of this art skerch or draw all your outlines faintly with piece of soft charcoal which may be known by the pith in the middle cut to point like pencil and when you see any thing amiss whisk it out with fandkerchief or feather correct your errors with black-lead pencil and compare your work with the original till every part of them perfectly correspond this done finish your outlines with black lead or indian ink this advice properly uttended to will save you an infinite deal of trouble in drawing over and over again to your no small discouragement if you prefer indian ink rub it with water upon marble sold for that purpose at the star holborn hill and with crow-quill pen perfect your out iines then rub out the marks of the pencil with brend.—keep three or four different shades of ink in the hollows of your stone to distinguish your distances reserving one of the holes for water when you are thoroughly versed in the outlines your next business will be to learn to shadow but of this hereafter under the article of light and shade be not too hasty at first setting out which will but impede your progress and hinder your improvement whereas by bestowing little more time you will attain perfection sooner than you can well imagine and expedition will come of itself as you become more experienced of copping of draughts then you would copy print or drawing exactly of the same size rub the back of it with the dust of red chalk or black lead lay this upon your paper and pin it down at the four cor ners then with blunt point trace the outlines and breadths of the shadows which done having care fully examined it to see that nothing be omitted take it off and finish it with the pencil or pen another way to make an exact copy and at the same time to preserve the original is to lay piece of transparent paper upon it and draw the outlines thereon with black-lead pencil then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon place piece of thin post-paper reddened or blackned at the back after which proceed to trace and finish it according to the foregoing rule if you would reverse your original you need only turn the transparent paper with the drawing you have made upon it downwards upon the post-paper and trace it as above directed of enlarging and contracting divide your original with pair of compasses into any number of squares and rule them across with black-lead pencil from side to side and from top to bottom then having your paper of the size you intend divide it into the fame number of squares either big ger or less as you would enlarge or contract it place jour original before you and draw square by square the several parts observing to make the part you are drawing fall into the same part of the square as it does in your original to prevent mis takes number the squares both of the original and copy as in fig and ii of the drawing-plate then outline it with indian ink rub out the marks of the pencil with bread and shade it at pleasure of imitation of life let the person you draw after be of proporti onable size and well shaped place him in the easiest and most natural attitude then sketch faintly with your charcoal the head or any of the limbs separately which having carefully done proceed to finish with your pencil when you have sufficiently practised the several parts or limbs you may draw the whole figure in whatever attitude you think proper to place it be ginning with the easiest and proceeding by degrees to the more difficult postures as time and experi ence shall enable you be sure to finish your outline so correctly mark- ing all the muscles as they occur that even before you give it any shadow it may have fome resem blance of the person the true proportion which one part of human figure bears to another may be seen in fig iii which will serve as standard to examine your draw ing by except where the figure is to be fore-short ened in which cafe nature will be the best guide in drawing of likeness care must be taken to express the passions in the most lively manner which is to be done by observing the peculiar cast and dis position of every feature with the exactest nicety and as this is of all the parts of drawing by far the most difficult it will require more than ordi nary attention and should be last attempted of drapery drapery is the art of cloathing your figures with elegance and propriety when your naked figure is outlined first draw the outlines of the drapery lightly then the greater folds and afterwards the lesser observing never to let them cross each ether particular regard is to be had to the quality of the drapery as the folds of stuff or woollen cloth are more abrupt and harsh and those of silk more flow ing and easy linen cambrick gauze as their substance is lighter than either require still greater delicacy in expressing the waving of the folds by the faintness of their shadows the drapery should not stick too close to the bo dy but must seem to flow round as it were yet in such manner as that the motion of the figure may be free and easy great lightness and motion of the drapery should only be used when the fi gures are supposed to be in much agitation or ex posed to the wind but in calm place and free from violent action their drapery should be large and flowing in order to give them more graceful appearance let the loose parts of the drapery blown by the wind all flow one way and draw that part which lies closest to the body before you draw those which fy off suit your garments to the body and make them bend with it the closer the garment sticks to the body the narrower and smaller must be the folds and if it fits quite close there will be no folds at all but must only have faint shadow to represent the part of the body which lies under it by observing diligently in what manner the dra pery flows upon any person standing or sitting before you for that purpose you will see in what manner to dispose your folds and shadows according to the unerring rule or-nature of landskip landskip represents the face of the country —— as it appears to our view with all the various objects analogous thereto as towns castles churches houses trees hills cattle rivers rocks ruins be caretul to augment or lefssn every object ac cording to its distance making the most remote ob jects fainter and less distinct as they appear to the eye and enlarging them proportionably as they ad vance nearer shew the sky cloudy or clear as occasion re quires and if you introduce the gun let it be rising or setting either of which representations will give an additional grace to your picture as they repre sent nature in its liveliest and most agreeable ap pearance adapt every part of your landskip to the season of the year and the time of the day you intend it to reprefent and dilpose your lights and shades with consistent propriety lastly we would recommend it to practitioners in this noble art to rise early in fine morning that they may have better idea of the harmony and beauty of the works of the great creator which would wonderfully replenish their minds as to co lour and effect of light and shade the true distribution of light and shade in picture is absolutely necessary to be known as it not only determines the proper distance of onc object from another without which the whole would be an undistinguishable mass of confusion but it gives likewise to each respective object in substance roundness and effect shadowing is performed with the pen or pencil in either of which great judgement is required having made your outlines correct the first thing is to observe from which side of the original the light comes in which if natural is either from the right hand or left for whenever the light ap pears in the middle of picture and seems to glare more than ordinary it is caused by candle lamp or some other luminous body and is called an artificial light lay on your little tints first disposing them as you see they are done in the original and then pro ceed to the deeper ones till you come to the darkest parts of all for you may at any time darken your shadows when you can not lighten them let all your shadows in the fame piece fall on the same side that is if the right side of man face be dark so must be the right-side of his body arm leg thigh but if the light side be darkened by the opposition of some other body intercepting the light it must receive contrary shadow make your shadows fainter as they grow towards the light breaking them gradually that they may not appear too sudden or harsh if you shade with black-lead or with crayons you may blend your shadows and often them one into another as you require with stump made of paper paper or glove-leather rolled and tyed hard and cut almost to the point with which you may also weaken your shades where they are too strong when one part of the body projects over or before another the part projecting must receive stronger light those parts that bend inward must be made so much the darker and shadowed deepest next the light two equal lights must never be made in the same picture the strongest light should fall upon the middle of the piece where the principal figures ought to stand diminishing gradually towards the extremities by frequently examining into nature you will have an opportunity of improving your ideas of light and shade and will be enabled to form proper judgment of the effect which the different rays or degrees of light will produce in picture for which reason you should never let flip an opportunity of remarking the various appearances you meet with of history this branch of drawing presents to our view things past prefent and future an historical picture must describe the transaction represented in manner so clear and conspicuous as to convey an idea of it to our minds as fully as could be done by verbal description and care must be taken to preserve such an analogy or con nection between the figures that not one may seem to be introduced but for fome end or purpose and as in dramatic writing it is essential to make every person speak consistent with the part he represents so here it will be equally necessary to observe the same propriety of character and make every figure lock the sentiment it is intended to express chap ii of perspective perspective is the art of delineating ob jects as they appear in nature upon plain surface according to their distance and height perpendicular to the horizon between the object and the eye this art is of great consequence to those who would excel in drawing etching engraving car ving bas-relief or painting for being well un derstood the artist will be enabled to know when to adhere to the strict rules and when to depart from them with propriety explanation of the terms used in perspective base or fundamental line is the bottom-line of the drawing on which the perfon is supposed stand with his face towards the point of sight perpendicular is line drawn upright with resp ect to any part of the base parallel lines are lines equidistant from each other as the horizon to the base horizon is the most distant part of plain where the clouds seeming to touch the earth limit the sight the horizontal line gives the heigh tof the eye for we can not see any thing above the ho rizon which does not exceed this height yet the summit summit of mountain may be above the horizon though its foot be far beneath it point of sight is that part of the horizontal line where all the visual rays center in point visual rays are beams of light conveying the likeness of any object to the eye or sight and the knowledge thereof to the mind or understanding points of distance are suppoled points set off on the horizontal line at equal distances on each side the point of sight diagonal lines are those drawn from the points of distance to the extremities of the base line abridgment of the square is the line where the diagonals intersect or cross the visual rays and must always run parallel to the base it is only made where the sight is limited by perpendicular as the far ther end of church hall room and sup posing person to stand thereon parallel linedrawm through the point of sight will feem to pass through the eyes and will conxequently shew what height that perion ought to be the nine foregoing definitions are illustrated in fig of the perspective plate point of direct view this is nothing more than the front view of house church or in other words geometrical elevation raised from plan or ground plot and comprehending an equal space on both sides of the point of sight see fig xiv ii point of oblique view is when we see the ob ject sideways or aslant example suppose per son was to draw view of canal with fome re¬ markable building he is desirous to shew more dif tinct he must place himfelf on the base or funda mental line opposite to that building that the ray of light may be more oblique by which means the admired building will be less fore-shortened and ap pear to greater advantage the points of sight being still before him though not in the middle of the pic ture see fig xv accidental points are those where objects end in the horizontal line but neither in the points of sight or distance and serve for streets houses chairs roads which take different directions as for example suppoxe street leading to the point of sight and from it two others branch the one on the right hand the other on the left and take dif ferent direction these two last streets make what we call accidental points terminating in some part of the horizontal line on each side of the point of sight see fig xvi the same is to observed in grove park where the walk you are in directs immediately to the point of sight and the avenues branching out on either side terminate also in different parts of the horizon ichnography is the plan or ground-plot of any ob ject that is to be raised in perspective scenography is the art of bringing any thing raised in perspective from an ichnographick plan to it ’ due proportion according to the distance in which it is placed that all objects may be diminished according to their distance in picture in the same degree as they are diminished by distance in anatural prospect scenographic view may be either direct as in fig xiv or oblique as in fig xv as the art of perspective is constructed upon geo metrical principles it will be necessary previous to the rules themselves to learn the following intro ductory operations from point in given line ab to raise perden dicular see fig ii draw with the ruler the given line ab then fet one foot of your compasses in and extending them to rather more than half the length of the line ab sweep the arch cd and with the same extent of compasses fet one point in and sweep the arch ef then without altering the compasses set one foot in and describe the arch hi next rule through the points cg to interfect the arch hi in and draw the line from to which is the perpen dicular required another way see fig iii from the point take the equal distances ab and ac on each side of it then stretch †he compasses to any distance greater than ab or ac and with one foot of them in sweep the arch de then with the same extent of the compasses set one point in sweep the arch fg and these two arches will inter sect ach other in the point from which line drawn to the point is the perpendicular required to draw one line parallel or equidistant to another given line ab see fig iv extend your compasses to the distance of the pa rallel you require then with one foot in any point of the given line as in describe the arch de again without altering the compasses six one foot in any other pont as in and sweep the arch gh then rule the line ik touching the outward parts of the two arches and that will be the parallel to the given line to bisect or divide given line ab into two equal parts se fig take with your compasses any distance greater than half the given line then with one foot of them in sweep the arch cc and with the same distance setting one foot in sweep the arch dd and these arches will interfect cach other in the points gh which joined by perpendicular will intersect ab in the middle point upon the end of given line ab to raise per pendicular see fig vi place one foot of the compasses in and extend them to any point without the given line then set one foot of them in and turn the circle and and through draw the diameter meeting the circle in join and that right line is the perpendicular required to turn the circle through any three given points not in right line see fig vii fix three points at any distance you think proper as at and and join them by the right lines ab and bc then by fig bisect the line ab with the line de which done bisect the line bc with the line fe and from the center where these lines meet extend your compasses to and describe the circle abcg to draw an oval see fig viii draw given line ab which divide into four equal parts fet one foot of the compasses at and from that center describe circle with the same extent of compasses place one foot in the center and turn the circle then with one foot still in extend your compasses and turn the arch and with the same extent placing one foot in describe the arch join the intersections with perpendicular from to next place one foot of the compasses in sweep the arch ll and without altering them set one foot in and describe the arch another method for an oval see fig ix draw given line ad and with the compasses extended placing one foot in with the other turn the circle then without altering your compasses on the line ad in the supposed point sweep the circle and through the points where the two circles interfect draw the perpendicular then fix your compasses with one foot in and ex tend thein so as to describe the arch to the lower extremities of the circles then with the tare ex tent with one foot in sweep the arch to join the upper extremities by these examples it will appear than an oval of any form or size may be constructed at pleasure on ly taking care always to six the compasses equidis tant from the given line ad in the perpendicular hi practical examples in perspective to draw square pavement in perspective see fig and xi suppose your piece of pavement to consist of of marble each foot square your first business is to draw an ichnographical plan or ground plot of it which is thus performed having made an exact square of the size you intend your plan divide the base and horizon into eight equal parts and from every division in the base to its oppo site point in the horizon rule perpendicular lines then divide the sides into the same number ruling pa rallel lines across from point to point so will your pavement be divided into square feet because the eight feet in length multiplied by the same in breadth give the number of square feet or pieces of marble contained in the whole then rule diagonals from corner to corner and thus will your ground plot appear as in fig now to lay this in perspeclive draw another square to your intended size and divide the base line ab into eight equal parts as before then six your point of sight in the middle of the horizon de and from the same point rule lines to every di vision in the base ab after which rule diagonal lines from to and from to answerable to those in the ground-plot and your square will be reduced to the triangle abc then from the point where the diagonal intersects the line ac to the opposite intersection where the diagonal ea crosses the line cb rule parallel line which is the abridgment of the square then through the points where the diagonals cross the rest of the lines which go from the base to the point of sight rule parallel lines and your square pavement will be laid in perspective as in fig xi to find the height and proportion of any objects as they appear above the horizon on supposed plane see fig xii first rule your horizontal line no and fix your point of sight as at then mark the place of your nearest pillar by making dot for the base or bot tom as at and another for the summit or top as at rule line from to the point of sight and another from to and these two lines will give the height of any number of pillars as for example suppose you would have pillar at fix your dot for the base and rule from thence pa rallel line to meet the diagonal am at then rule the perpendicular de to the diagonal bm which perpendicular is the height of your figure re quired at or if you would place pillars at and observe the same method ruling the parallels fg and ik the perpendiculars gh and kl will give theur heights at the distances required to find the diameter or thickness of pillars at any particular distances you are also to be guided by the nearest the base for instance suppose your nearest pillar ab to be ten feet high and one foot in diameter divide it from ’ op to bottom into ten equal parts and fet off one of them upon the base of the pillar then rule line from the point of sight to the diameter and you will have the thickness of all your pillars on their respective parallels or bases the same rule exemplified in objects below the ho rizon see fig xiii if you would know the heights of number of figures below the horizon rule your horizontal line qr and fix your point of sight as at then place your nearest figure or mark the dots for the head and feet by the points and which an swers the same purpose and rule from these dots to the point of sight the lines ap and bp and if you would find the height of figure to be drawn at rule from thence the parallel to the diagonal bp and the perpendicular will give the height re quired the same directions will shew the height of figure at any other distance you have mind to place it as at and by ruling the parallels fg ik and mn and from each of these their respective perpendiculars gh kl and no which perpendicu lars will shew the heights of the figures at and to draw diret view see fig xiv to illustrate this example suppose you were to draw the inside of church as represented in this figure first take your station at the point in the center of the base line bc from which you have front view of the whole body of the church with all the pillars on each side then fix your horizon at any height you think proper as at de bisect it by the perpendicular ea and where these two lines interfect is the point of sight this perpendicular will pass through the centers of all the arches in the dome or cupola which centers may be found by any three given points as in fig vii next divide your base line into any given number of feet and the visual lines ruled from thefe di visions to the point of sight will reduce all your objects to their just proportion by setting off their height upon perpendicular raised at their respective distances the base in the example here given is divided into twelve equal parts of five feet each from which supposing your front column to be feet high take seven divisions from the base line of your drawing and fet them off upon the perpendicular gh then supposing this column to be five feet thick at the base fet off onc of those divisions upon the parallel ik which is the breadth required so that by proportioning this scale to any distance by the foregoing directions you may not only find the dimensions of all your columns but also of every distinct part of them as well as of all the doors windows and other objects that occur for instance having found the height and breadth of your first or nearest column draw from the top and bottom of the said column to the point of sight the lines hf and kf after which rule the line if from the base of the column to the polnt of sight and you have the height and breadth of all the rest of the columns as has been already shewn in fig xii by ruling lines from the points to the point of sight you will see that all the sum mits and bases of your columns doors windows must tend immediately to that point and by lines drawn from the points on each side to the correspondent points on the oppo site side may be seen all the parts of your building lying upon the same parallel to draw an oblique view see fig xv first draw your horizontal line then if your favourite object be on the right hand as at place yourself on the left hand upon the base line as at then from that station erect perpendicu lar which will pass through the horizon at the point of sight to which rule the diagonals and which will shew the roof and base of your principal building and will also as before di rected serve as standard for all the rest observe also either in direct or oblique views whether the prospect before you make curve for if it docs you must be careful to make the same curve in your drawing to draw perspective view wherein are accidental points see fig xvi rule your horizontal line ab and on one part of it fix your point of sight as at from which rule the diagonals and on the one side and and on the other which will shew the roofs and bases of all the houses in the street direclly facing you supposing yourself placed at in the center of the base line then fix your accidental points and upon the horizontal line and rule from them to the angles and im where tlie streets on each side take different direction towards the accidental points and and the lines and gk give the roofs and bases of all the buildings on one side as lh and mb do on the other accidental points seldom intervene where the dis tance is fmall as in noblemens seats groves ca nals which may be drawn by the strict rules of perspective but where the prospect is extensive and varied including mountains bridges castles ri vers precipices woods cities it will re quire such an infinite number of accidental points that it will be better to do them as nature shall dic tate and your ripened judgment approve to find the center for the roof of house in an ob lique view see plate iv suppose from the point of sight the visual lines and ac be drawn bc being one per pendicular given and de the other rule the dia gonals from to and from to and the per pendicular fg raised through the point of their intersection will shew the true center of the roof as will appear by ruling the lines and for want of being acquainted with this necessary rule many who have been well versed in other parts of perspective have spoiled the look of their pic ture by drawing the roofs of their houses out of their true perpendicular chap iii of etching etching is method of working on copper wherein the lines or strokes instead of being cut with graver are eaten with aqua fortis this art being executed with greater ease and freedom than engraving represents curious subjects better and more agreeable to nature as landskips ruins and small faint or remote objects build ings the principal materials for this art are the plate hard and soft ground the first for winter and the other for summer dabber turpentine-varnish lamp-black soft wax and aqua fortis the tools are an oil-rubber burnisher scraper hand vice etching-boards etching needles an oil-stone and parallel ruler the plate may be had of any size and well po lished fit for use of mr. whittow in shoe-lane holbourn mr. torond in little st. andrew ’ -street or mr. watts in great st. andrew street seven dials directions for laying the ground having provided yourself with plate of the size of the print or drawing you intend to copy rub it well with an oil-rubber made of swan skin-flannel till all the marks of the charcoal used in polishing it entirely disappear then wiping off the dirty oil with linen rag dip your finger in some clean oil and touch it over every part of the plate after which with your burnisher polish the plate till you can see your face in it and in case any sand-holes or flaws appear the scraper will as sist you in taking them out the marks left by the scraper are to be taken out with the burnisher till nothing appear having fixed your hand-vice at one end of the plate with rag and whiting clear the plate carefully from grease then heat it over charcoal-fire or lighted paper till it will melt the ground which is to be laid on thinly and dabbed all over with the dabber till it is perfectly smooth and even then warm the plate again and holding it up with the ground downwards smoak it all over with large candle taking care that the snuff of it do not touch the ground and waving the candle continually ever every part so that the ground may not be burnt by heating it more in one place than another if the plate be large you may bind four penny-candles together directions for tracing the first thing to be done while the plate is cooling after the ground is laid is to rub the back of your print or drawing all over with bit of rag or cotton dipt in the scrapings of red chalk and shake off the loose dust or wipe it off gently with clean rag place the red side upon the plate making it fast at each corner with little bit of soft wax lay your etching-board under your hand to prevent bruising the ground then with blunt etching-needle trace lightly the outlines and breadths of the shadows till the marks of them appear upon the ground which you must take care not to pene trate by tracing too hard as great nicety is required in this part of your work it will be necessary now and then to lift up one corner of your original and examine whether every part be traced before you take it off as it will be extremely diffcult to lay it down agai in its for mer position directions for etching having carefully traced your original take it off and lay silk or linen handkerchief next the plate and over that your etching-board then procced to the etching for which observe the following directions which are adapted to every par ticular branch as landskips shipping portraits history architecture distances in landskips or the faint parts of any other picture are the first to be done and these are to be worked closer and with sharper-pointed needle the darker parts must be etched wider and with blunter needle but to prevent mistakes the needles may be marked according to their different degrees and the uses for which they are intended as for the very faintest parts of all they are to be left for the graver or dry needle of which here after in building and all architecture in general use parallel ruler till frequent practice enables you to do them well enough without the needles may when necessary be whetted upon your oil-stone keeping them turning in your hand so as to whet them equally all round the oil-stone will be farther ufeful in whetting the scra per whlich is to be rubbed flat upon the stone and with steady hand keeping oil conitantly upon the stone of biting or eating in thie work with aqua fortis first examine your work carefully to see that nothing be omitted and if any scratches appear upon the ground or mistakes be committed in the etching they are to be slopped out which is done by covering them with mixture of lamp-black and varnish laid on thinly with hair pencil which when dry will resist the aqua fortis but it will be best to stop out these as they occur to you in the course of your work for by this means they will be less liable to escape your notice and when the var nish is dry you may etch over it again if required the next thing is to enclose the work with rim or border of soft green or other coloured wax about half an inch high bending the wax in the form of spout at one corner to pour off the aqua fortis and that it may not run out at any other part take care to lay your wax so close to the plate that no vacancies be left your aqua fortis must be single and if too strong as will be seen in the biting take it off and mix it with little water shaking them together in bot tle and when by often using it becomes too weak it may be strengthened by mixing it in bottle with little double aqua fortis the bottle which con tains the aqua fortis should have large mouth and glass stopple let the aqua fortis lie on the plate short time wiping off the bubbles as they arise with feather which may remain upon the plate while it is biting after which take it off and wash the plate with wa ter then let it dry and by scraping off part of the ground from the faintest part of the work try if it be bit enough and if not stop out the part you have have tried with the lamp-black and varnish and when that is dry pour on the aqua fortis again when the faint parts of your work are bit enough stop them out and procecd to bite the stronger parts stopping them out as occasion requires till the whole work is sufficiently bit then warm the plate and take off the soft wax after which heat the plate till the ground melts pour on little oil and wipe the whole off with rag when the ground is taken off rub the work well with the oil-rubber and wipe the plate clean then proceed to finish it with the graver according to the following di rections chap iv of engraving the tools necessary for engraving are the oil-rubber burnisher scraper oil-stone neddles and ruler already mentioned to be used in etching also gravers compasses and sand-bag gravers are of two sorts square and lozenge three of each sort should be provided the first is used in cutting the broader strokes the other for the fainter and more delicate no graver should exceed the length of five inches and half the handle in cluded excepting for strait lines the sand-bag or cushion is used to lay the plate on for the conveniency of turning it about the oil-stone must be of the turkey sort of whetting and tempering the graver as great pains are required to whet the graver nicely particularly the belly of it care must be taken to lay the two angles of the graver which are to be held next the plate flat upon the stone and rub them steadily till they are polished like mir ror and till the belly rises gradually above tbe plate so as that when you lay the graver flat upon it you may just perceive the light under the point other wise it will dig into the copper and it will be impos sible to keep point or execute the work with freedom in order to this keep your right arm close to your side and place the fore-finger of your left hand upon that part of the graver which lies upper most on the stone when this is done in order to whet the face place the flat part of the handle in the hollow of your hand with the belly of the graver upwards upon moderate slope and rub the extremity or face upon the stone till it has an ex ceeding sharp point which you may try upon your thumb-nail the oil-stone while in use must never be kept without oil when the graver is too hard as is usually the case when first bought and may be known by the frequent breaking of the point the method of tem pering the steel is as follows heat poker red hot and hold the graver upon it within half an inch of the point waving it to and fro till the steel changes to light straw-colour then put the point into oil to cool or hold the graver close to the flame of candle till it be of the same colour and cool it in the tallow but be careful either way not to hold it too long for then it will be too soft and in this case the point which will then turn blue must be broken off and whetted afresh and tempered again if required but be not too hasty in tempering for sometimes littlc whet ting will bring it to good condition of holding the graver cut off that part of the handle which is upon the same line with the belly or sharp edge of the graver making that side flat that it may be no obstruction hold the handle in the hollow of your hand and extending your fore-finger towards the point it rest upon the back of the graver that you may guide it flat and parallel with the plate take care that your fingers do not interpose be tween the plate and the graver for they will pre vent you from carrying the graver level with the plate and from cutting your str directions for engraving tthe table or board you work at be firm and steady upon which place your sand-bag with the plate upon it and holding the graver as above directed proceed to business in the following man ner for strait strokes hold your plate firm upon the sand-bag with your left hand moving your right hand forwards leaning lighter where the stroke should be fine and harder where you would have it broader for circular or crooked strokes hold the graver stedfast moving your hand or the plate as you see convenient learn to carry your hand with such slight that you may end your stroke as finely as you began it and if you have occasion to make one part deeper or blacker than another do it by degrees and that you may do it with greater exactness take care that your strokes be not too close nor too wide in the course of your work scrape off the barb or roughness which arises with the belly of your graver but be careful in doing this not to scratch the plate and that you may see your work pro perly as you goon rub it with the oil-rubber and wipe the plate clean which will take of the glare of the copper and shew what you have done to the best advantage any mislakes or scratches in the plate may be rub ed out with the burnisher and the part levelled with the scraper polishing it again afterwards lightly with the burnisher having thus attained the use of the graver ac cording to the foregoing rules you will be able to finish the piece you had etched by graving up the several parts to the colour of the original begin ning as in the etching with the fainter parts and advancing gradually with the stronger till the whole is compleated the dry needle so called because not used till the ground is taken off the plate is principally employed in the extreme light parts of water sky drapery architecture for your first practice copy such prints as are openly shaded the more finished ones being too dif ficult till you have gained farther experience great choice of prints of every kind fit for young beginners may be had where this book is published to prevent any obstruction from too great degree of light we would recommend the use of sash made of transparent or fan-paper pasted on frame and placed sloping at convenient distance between your work and the light this will not only preserve the sight but when the sun shines can not possibly be dispensed with chap of mezzotinto-scraping this art which is of late date is recom mended to the practice of the ingenious read er for the amazing ease with which it is exe cuted especially by those who have any notion of drawing mezzotinto prints are those which have no hatch ing or strokes of the graver but whose lights and shades are blended together and appear likea draw ing of indian ink the tools used in this art are the copper-plate oil-stone grounding-tools scrapers burnisher and needles directions for laying the mezzotinto-ground mark off upon the bottom of the plate the distance you intend to leave for the writing coat of arms then laying your plate with piace of swanskin-flannel under it upon your table hold the grounding-tool in your hand perpendicu larly lean upon it moderately hard continually rock ing your hand in right line from end to end till you have wholly covered the plate in one direction next cross the strokes from side to side afterwards from corner to corner working the tool cach time all over the plate in every direction almost like the points of compass taking all possible care not to let the tool cut in one direction twice in place this donc the plate will be full or in other words all over rough alike and would if it were printed appear completely black having laid the ground take the scrapings of black chalk and with piece of rag rub it over the plate or you may with two or three candles smoak it as before directed for etching now take your print or drawing and having rubbed the back with red-chalk dust mixed with white lake proceed to trace it as directed page for whetling the grounding-tool if tooth of the tool should break it may be per ceived in the working by particular streak or gap which will appear in the ground in strait line in which case the tool must be whetted on the back holding it sloping and in circular man ner like the bottom of the tool directions for scraping ihe picture take blunt needle and mark the outlines only then with scraper scrape off the lights in every part of the plate as clean and smooth as pos sible in proportion to the strength of the lights in your picture taking care not to hurt your outlines and that you may the better see what you do with the thumb and fore-finger of the left hand hold piece of transparent paper sloping just over your right hand and you will soon be judge of the dif ferent tints ofthe work you are doing scraping off more or less of the ground as the different strengths of light and tints require the use of the burnisher is to soften or rub down the extreme light parts after the scraper is done with such as the tip of the nose forehead linen which might otherwise when proved appear rather misty than clear another method used by mezzotinto-scrapers is to etch the outlines of the original as also ofthe folds in drapery marking the breadth of the shadows by dots which having bit of proper colour with aqua fortis according to the directions given page and take off the ground used in etching and having laid the mezzotinto-ground as in page proceed to scrape the picture as above four or five days before you think the plate will be ready for proving notice must be given to the rolling-press printer the properest person to print mezzotintos is mr. smith king ’ -head-court shoe¬ lane to wet some french paper as no other will do for this work and as that time is necessary for it to lie in wet when the proof is dry touch it with white chalk where it should be lighter and with black chalk where it should be darker and when the print is retouched proceed as before for the lights and for the shades use small grounding-tool as much as you judge necessary to bring it to the pro per colour and when you have done as much as you think expedient prove it again and so procced to prove and touch till it is entirely to your mind when the plate tarnishes in the part where you are at work little vinegar and salt kept by you in vial will take it off wiping it dry with clean rag avoid as much as possible over-scraping any part before the first proving as by this caution the work will appear the more elegant chap vi of painting upon glass painting upon grass is an art which has generally appeared difficult yet there is no re presentation can be more elegant than that of picture done well in this manner for it gives all the softness that can be desired in picture and is eafy to work as there are no outlines to draw nor any shade to make but the colours are put on without the trouble of either the pictures are those done in mezzotinto for their shades being rubbed down on the glass the several lines which represent the shady part of any common print are by this means blended together and appear as soft and united as in any drawing of indian ink provide such mezzotintos as you like cut off the margin then get piece of fine crown-glass the size of your print as flat and free from knots or scratches as possible clean the glass and lay some venice turpentine quite thin and fmooth on one side thereof with brush of hog ’ hair lay the print flat in water and let it remain on the surface till it finks 't is then enough take it carefully out and dab it between some papers that no water may be seen yet so as to be damp next lay the damp print with its face upper most upon flat table then holding the glass over it without touching the turpentine till it is exactly even with the print let it fall gently on it press the glass down carefully with your fingers in several parts so that the turpentine may stick to the print after which take it up then holding the glass towards you press the print with your fingers from the center towards the edges till there be no blisters remaining when this is done wet the back of your print with spunge till the paper will rub off wich your fingers then rub it gently and the white paper will roll off leaving the impression only upon che glass then let it dry and with camel ’ hair pencil dipt in oil of turpentine wet it all over and it will be perfectly transparent and fit for painting colours proper for panting upon glass the several sorts of colours ground in oil for this purpose and tied up in little bladders may be had of mr. dicker opposite newport-market and mr. drake or mr. sandys in long-acre whose busi ness it is distinct from that of other colourmen to prepare the finer colours for limners whites flakes white spodium blacks lamp black ivory-black reds rose pink vermillion red-lead indian red lake cinnabar browns spanish brown umber yellows english pink masticot english oker saunders blue smalt spruce oker dutch pink orpiment greens verdigrease terra vert verditer blues blue bice prussian blue the ultramarine for blue and the carmine for red are rather to be bought in powders as in that case they are less apt to dry or be lost and as the least touch of these will give the picture caft mix up what you want for present use with drop or two of nut-oil upon your pallet with your pallet- knife the pallets may be had at the colour shops above mentioned the pallet-knies arc fold at mr. bur chell ’ cutler in long-acre to get the colour out of the bladders prick hole at the bottom of each and press it till you have enough upon your pallet for present use because the colours are apt to dry and skin over then lay sheet of white paper on the table and taking the picture in your left hand with the turpentine side next you hold it sloping the bottom resting on the white paper and all the outlines and tints of the print will be seen on the glass and no thing remains but to lay on the colours proper for the different parts as follows the method of using ihe colours as the lights and shades of your picture open lay the lighter colours first on the lighter parts of your print and the darker over the shaded parts and having once laid on the brighter colours it is not material if the darker sorts are laid little over them for the first colour will hide those laid on afterwards as for example reds lay on first the red lead and shade with lake or carmine yellows the lightest yellow laid on first may be shaded with dutch pink blues blue-bice or ultramarine used for the lights may be shaded with indigo greens lay on verdigrease first and then mixture of that and dutch pink this green may be lightened by an addition of dutch pink when any of these colours are too strong they may be lightened to any degree by mixing white with them upon your pallet or you may darken them as much as you please by mixing them with deeper shade of the same colour the colours must not be laid on too thick but if troublesome thin them before you use them with little turpentine-oil take care to have pencil for each colour and never use that which you have used for green with any other colour without first washing it well with turpentine-oil as that colour is apt to appear pre dominant when the colours are dry wash all the pencils after using in turpentine oil your glass when painted must stand three or four days free from dust before it be framed all sorts of mezzotinto and other prints proper for painting on glass may be had at the place where this book is published chap vii of painting in crayons crayons are to be had in boxes every co lour partitioned off separately to prevent mix ing the best are those of switzerland fold by mr. drake or mr. sandys in long-acre the different colours are white black yellow orange red purple blue green and brown and each of these have their several shades except ing the two first directions for using them the paper to be used on this occasion is rough venice paper of whited-brown colour and the stiffer the better that sort called cape-paper is found to be the best because upon that the colours best distribute themselves by this method figures may be drawn in their proper colcurs as they appear to the eye because the colours may be matched with the crayons and the crayons being dry will not alter their colour but the colours when wet appear deeper than when they are dry which is apt to deceive young beginner another way to make the necessary preparations is to take some of the thickest and smoothest light blue or other paper and get straining frame from frame-maker ’ or carpenter on which strain fome coarse scotch or irish cloth drawing and fastening it wich small tacks round the edges till it be quite smooth after which with spunge and fair wa ter gently wet the blue paper and then with brush or rag paste the paper all over and lay it carefully on the cloth exactly even with the straining frame after which take it up and laying white paper on the table place the blue paper down wards with one hand keep the straining-frame steady and with the other rub the cloth close to tho paper do this very carefully and taking it up lay it on the table with the blue paper upwards and piece of paper under your hand and rub it close to the straming-frame without touching any other part then let it stand to dry after which fet it on an easal which may be had at the colour shops and proceed as follows make the first sketch or rough draught with char coal then with black white or red chalk cor rect what you see amiss the outline being thus compleated rub in your crayons according to their proper colours and then with your finger or fitch soften and blend them together chap viii of painting in water

sharp-pointed after you have drawn them through your mouth before you begin have all your colours ready be fore you and pallet for the conveniency of mixing them paper to lay under your hand and to keep your work clean as well as to try your colours upon also large brush called fitch to wipe off the dust when your colours are dry lay your colours on but thinly at first deepening and mellowing them by degrees as you see occasion the quicker you lay them on the evener and cleaner your drawing will appear take care to preserve all your colours from dust and before you use them wipe your shells and pallet every time with fitch when you have done your work or would lay it aside be careful to wash out your pencils in warm water for face-painting mix up little light carnation or flesh-colour with gum-water in shell by it felf if it be for fair complexion mix vermillion and white flake together and for swarthy one add to the former little masticot or english oker or both let your flesh-colour be always lighter than the complexion you would paint for by working on it you may bring it to its true colour in large shell or upon your pallet lay your dif ferent shades of flesh colour at convenient dis tance from cach other and always have ready suf ficient quantity of white to lighten your shadows for the checks and lips use mixture of lake and red lead or carmine as occasion requires and for blue tints as under the eyes and in veins indico or ultramarine and white for grey faint shadows use white english oker sometimes masticot for deep shadows white english oker umber for darker shadows lake and pink which make good fleshy shadow in colouring landskips at first only lay dead co lours smooth all over the piece leaving no part un covered and be not over curious in this part of the performance but rather use masterly freedom and the work though seemingly rough to the eye will have good effect when placed at distance let not the roughness of the colour discourage you for it is eafily to be softened by degrees with the other shadows observing only to sweeten and heighten them according as the light falls in fome places lay on strong touches and in those places bring your work up together to an equal roundness and strength tempering and sweetening your colours with sharper pencil than the first that no lumps or harsh edges be lest but that all your shadows may lie disperied soft and smooth gliding gently as it were into one another you are not to finish any part before the other but work up all the parts gradually alike till you fee nothing wanting to compleat your picture having laid your dead colours begin first with the lightest parts as the sky sun-beams then the yellowish beams which are to be done with masticot and white next the blueness of the sky with ul tramarine or smalt alone for purple clouds only mix lake and whiter making your colours deeper as they go upwards from the horizon except in tempestuous skis the tops of distant mountains must be worked so faint that they may seem to lose themselves in air bring your colours forward as your distance de creases painting your first ground next the hori zon downwards of bluish sea-green and as you advance forwards of reddish or darker green till you come to the fore-ground itself which as it is to be the darkest part of all do with dark green shaded with dark brown or yellow which rule of shadow will also serve for the trees on each respec tive ground all distant objects are to be made imperfect as they appear to the eye as has been already observed under the article of light and shade in colouring trees boughs and branches touch in all the dark shades first raising the lighter leaves above the darker by adding masticot to the dark green which may be made with bice pink and indico for the uppermost of all which are to be done last touch lightly the extremities of the leaves with little green masticot and white and fet off the darkest shadows with sap-green and indico these rules are adapted to general appearances but the learner may deviate from them as nature shall dictate with regard to drapery fruit flowers and other branches of painting the best observations are to be taken from the objects themselves or the most curious and exact representations of them receipts for those who paint in water-colour to make gum-water dissolve one ounce of pure white gum arabic and half an ounce of double-refined sugar in quart of spring water strain it through fine sieve or piece of muslin and bottle it off for use keeping it free from dust another way take some gum-arabic of the whitest sort bruise it and tie it up in piece of woollen cloth and steep it in spring-water in glass or earthen ves sel till it be dissolved if it be too stiff add more water and if too thin more gum with this water you may temper most of your co lours using such quantity that being touched when dry the colour will not come off if the co lour shines there is too much gum in it to keep tbe flies from your work when you have made your gum-water according to either of the foregoing discretions add thereto little coloquintida which will preserve your work when exposed from being spoiled by the flics to make liquid gold for vellum-painting fans grind the finest leaf-gold with strong gum-wa ter very fine adding as you grind it more gum-wa ter as you see necessary when you have ground it as fine as you can wash it in large shell then temper it with little mercury-sublimate bind it in the shell with little dissolved gum shake and spread it equally all over the shell and use it with fair water only to make liquid silver for the same purpose the process for this is the fame with that of liquid gold only observing in the using it to temper it with glair of eggs instead of water to make the glare of eggs take the whites and beat them with spoon till they rise all in foam let them stand all night and they will be clarifed into good glare to recover liquid silver that has contracted rust if your silver by length of time or damp wea ther become rusty cover that part of your work with juice of garlick which will effectually recover it to keep the colours from sinking boil four ounces of roch-allum in pint of spring-water till it is thoroughly dissolved then filter it through brown paper and keep it for use before you lay on your colours take spunge and wet the back of your paper with this water while it is hot this will not only prevent the colours from sinking but will likewise give them an addi tional beauty and lustre and preserve them from fading if your paper is not good it must be washed three or four times with this water drying it every time if your prints are to be varnished wash them all over with white starch before you begin to lay on your colours to make size for painting scenes and other candle-light pieces steep quarter of pound of the cuttings of white glove-leather in water for fome time then take them out and boil them in three quarts of wa ter till it wastes to pint and strain it through cloth into an earthen pan when the size is cold if it fed firm under your hand it is strong enough you may prepare any colours in this size while it is warm and it will take off the glare which would appear upon them by candle-light if mixed with gum-water to recover colours when decayed take rosemary-water double-distilled or pure spirit of rosemary and with few drops of it tem per your colours which however dead and faded will recover their bloom and brilliance this water or spirit will prevent the bubbles in white and umber which are troublesome in grinding pink the single pink does not admit of so great variety as the carnation but is nevertheless so variegated as ta make it an agreeable flower for sattins silks the most common are either white or crim son others are striped white and red others are white spotted with red others edg ’ with red all which may be work according to the rules for the other flowers so diversified wich the same colours the leaves and stalk arc blueish green only at the joints there is for the most part yellowith tinge which is also at the bottom of the cup and scales chap ix painting on silks sattins when the out-line is made according to the ar tists fancy wash of isinglass should with care be laid on to take away the glare and sleekiness of the sattin otherwise the colours will not work freely the isinglass be melted in very clear water over the fire so as not to be very glutinous otherwise it will disco lour the sattin and consequently spoil the colours in the foregoing rules we have recommended for the most part the leaving the paper for the light parts of flower and working with colours mostly transparent but here the lights are to be made by small tinéture of the colourof the intended flower mixt with the flake-white so much as just to make degree from the colour of the sattin if white or if any other colour to be mixt proportionably to the colour of the flower for instance if blue flower the bice or verditer very small quantity of it with the white using less of it proportionally as the shades grow darker and in the most dark indico alone may be used it being by that time rendered opaque enough but great care must be used not to lay the colours on too thick otherwise they will crack little white sugar-candy will be found very necessary when mixt with the gum-water as preventive to that incon veniency if flower happens to be of so deep colour as not to admit of any pure white in the lightest of the parts sort of priming of white should be laid on after which when dry begin with the ground colour of the flower proceeding gradually with the shades as in the above directions which with the seleted examples we have annexed peculiarly chosen from nature for the purpose we hope will be suffi cient for our ingenious students in this most delight ful amusement
