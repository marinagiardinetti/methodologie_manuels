country well suited to facilitate the attainment of this arr yet we are always invited to attend to ample and learned instructions to beginners where the preliminary dis- courses often puzzle and

placed wbich carefully survey and alter by rubbing it gently ont with stalé bread gr indian rubber slighely and cautioussy retouching withmore correctness still keeping your copy so faint that you may wph ease take out and amend it when you can sind no farther disagreement from the original in your sketch -fresh point your pencil and keeping arwaste paper under your hand begin to finifhi your qut-line taking particular care to observe and imi¬ tate such parts as appear daré distinctly from those which are faint or swaller the strong touches be- ing what gives spirit to the out-line and when properly given always denote master hand let your greatest application be employed in mak ing perfect out-line for in this principally consists the art of drawing this sully attained all arts are easy and every study will become delightful tlie qut-line completed light and shadow become your next concern wliich is à labeur so pleasing that no commendation can be given adcquate to the pleasure real proftssor finds in the execution of this art or rather science succeeding ars- begin- ners are apt to leave the study of qut-lines too soon and so commence painters like those who raise structure ere the foundation be compleated light and shadow are produced by etcbing or hatching wasbing claro obscuro painting modelling sculp- ture —as the first three are chiesly used by learners shall give few hints for the execu- ting each and first of hatching -- carefully ob- serve the engraving or manner inwhich the strokes of the original are laid and keep with exactness the form not so much regarding their number first alightly making them of thickness and after by various retouchings strengthen them to the tone of colour in your original whether you use black or red chalk or black lead -- which may be used singly or thus compounded working the fainter parts with black lead and give strength with black chalk or finisning your drapery hair and eye-brows in this manner and the flest or naked with red cholk-this method is best for copying engraved prints which principally recom- mend to beginners.-next of washing or shading with indian ink -go exactly over your out-line with pen dipped in common ink with clean stale bread rub out all remains of your black lead then mix your indian ink by rubbing it in an earthen saucer with water till it is pretty black then take another clean saucer and dip your pencil in the indian ink and with water mix it to the lightest shade as it dries deepen it where necessary till you come up to the strength of your original—- this method is most proper to use in drawing from metzotintos or paintings -- lastly of crayons beginning with black and wbite take blue or pur- ple-coloured paper and having exactly formed your out-line begin on the second degree of your shades and with black chalk darken dounwards then take white french chalk to be found at all colour-shops and heighten the lighter parts to perfect white— in this manner all paintings may be copied in their propercolours by having different crayons of each colour from dark to light in due gradations and practising by the preceding rule rolling piece of paper to point and stumping or rubbing each co- lour on the proer when finished to prevent their coming off which yet will be tender and should be kept behind glass
