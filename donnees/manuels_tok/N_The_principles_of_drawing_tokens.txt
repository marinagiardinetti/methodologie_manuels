th principles of drawing or an easy and familiar method for the improvement of youth- in the practice of that useful art being compleat drawing book containing curious collection of examples in all the variety of cases as the several parts of the human body whole figures landskips cattle curioussy engraved on copper-plates after the designs of albert durer abrah bloemart carlo morac le clerc hollar and other great masters to which is prefix an introduction to drawing containing an account of the instruments and materials used in drawing and the method of managing them with easy and proper lessons for young beginner tending to form his judgment and direct his practice translated from the french of monsieur gerard de lairesse and improved with abstracts from du fresnoy the sixth edition londons printed for john bowles at the black horse in cornbills and carington bowles in st. paul church tard mdcclxiv drawing is the art of representing by lines and shades the figure of any object we see or of any form we conceive an idea of in the mind it is most ingenious useful and elegant art and the study of it ought to be encouraged in every youth that discovers an inclination or genius towards the practice thereof whatever station of life he may be placed in its utility is so very ex- tensive there are few arts and few professions in which it is not serviceable all designs and models are executed by it mathematicians cngineers architects mariners gardiners embroiderers weavers and multitude of other professions have frequent occasion to practise it in most stations it is use- ful from the general who commands an army to the me- chanic who supports himself by handicraft person who has knowledge in drawing and capacity of performing it usually sees and remembers the form shape and other circumstances of objects more minutely and perfect than one unacquainted with the art and posiesses an accom- plishment exceedingly desirable both for amusement and use he is qualified to take on the spot the sxetch of fine build- ing of beautiful prospect of any curious production of art or of uncommon and striking appearances in nature and to bring home for future inspection and service the forms of ob- jects which yield entertainment in journies and distant placcs whether you draw after nature or the performances of others the hand can only express by lines and shades those forms and ideas which have imprest the mind hence the utility appears of accustoming the mind to curious and attentive observation of objects especially of those intended for imitation its impressions will hereby be strengthened its con- ceptions will be more exact and just and the hand will deli- neate with greater ease and correctness those forms which are clearly and strongly retained in the memory inform yaur judgment of the properties and excellencies of drawing well executed in this knowledge the mind will make quick improvement by frequent aftentive inspection of the performances of those who have excelled in viewing them contemplate the srecdom and boldness of the outline the cor- rectness or justness of the proportion of the several parts the character which is peculiar and distinguishing in every figure and expressive of the circumstances it is supposed to be in the elegance or that which gives kind of delicacy or certain agreeablenefs which pleases every one the perspective or re- presentation of thie parts according to their situation with re- spect to the point of sight if the judgment be well informed in these particulars the young practitioner will make much greater improvement than can possibly be attained if he pro- ceeds in practice without due regard to increasing knowledge and judgment mere to the genius than the hand eve owe from this the beauties of your art must flow the labour of the hand must second and support that of the brain to become an able artill tnc art must be made habi- tual an easy and just expression is only to be gained by con- stant practice in all arts the rules are lcarred in little time but the practice requires long and severe diligence the hand should be improved in practice and the mind in judg- ment every day this ingenious art not only affords à very pleasing entertain- ment to men of leisure and fortune in variety of instances but enables them to judge the propriety of designs for such works as they intend to have executed to lay down and ex- hibit their construction and vary and improve the plan most to their own liking of all others this art has the greatest number of admirers and no wonder since in kind of universal language under- stood by all men it represents to our view the forms of innu- merable objects we have no other ways of beholding and helps us to the knowledge of many of the works in nature or art which any other method of describing would be insufficient to give an idea of it transmits to our view things long fince past and preserves the forms of others that will soon perisn it represents the deeds of people and actions for many ages dead and hands down to us the features and resemblances of our ancestors and of other valuable and renowned persons of former generations the esteem of this excellent art is not confined to adults children admire it and often by the power of natural genius draw varicty of objects in such man- ner as to excite commendation for the instruction of youth in this useful art the following rules are laid down and course of proper leffons exhibited for their practice let your first practice be employed in imitating the most plain and simple objects in accustoming your hand to draw strait lines perpendicular and horizontal ones circular and irregu- larly curved lines this method will be useful in bringing the hand to facility of operation moreover these lines are the rudiments of all objects that can be expressed they bound and circumscribe every figure all its parts or members are com- posed of them little time may be advantageously employed in drawing after plain inanimate sigures which require strokes of various curvings after this draw the particular features of the face beginning with the eye the nose tlie mouth the ears draw them in their different positions persevere in copying several times after the same example before you make the tran- sition to new one you can not expect to draw an entire head or face till you are capable of performing the parts separately nor of copying with pleasure and improvement those objects which require more art and time till you have acquired cus- tomary exercise of patience and freedom and exactnefs in copying those that are casier sketch your outline at first very faint that the amendment of if may be performed without its appearing to be re-touched endeavour at graceful freedom boldness and just proportion of all its parts in these the excellency of good outline con- sists it should be drawn with flowing and gliding strokes not swelling suddenly but with gradual risings such as might just be felt in statues be careful that it loses nothing or in gee and boldness when you correct it by reducing some parts and swelling others the outline on that side nearest the light must be fainter than the other the surest and most improving method of practice is to fketch outlines for considerable time without attempting to shade any of them and to make num- bers of sketches srom the same pattern imitating as nearly you can every stroke and carefully to compare each of you copies with the original that you may observe wherein it is faulty and avoid those errors in your next sketch good outline is of the greatest importance and extent in the art of drawing an ability to make it can only be acquired by appli- cation and practice proceed slowly in your first attempts making it your care to secure every stroke and rather to produce one good sketch than in heedless manner to hurry over number of bad ones view your original with close attention ponder upon the length the breadth and the form of each paït their proportions to one another and to the whole the distance from one part to the other which of them lie parallel and which underneath the other in confidering what parts are opposite to each other you may conceive or occafionally draw perpendicular line from the top to the bottoin and strait line frem side to side and notice what parts are marked by these lincs and in what manner others deviate from them this obsei vation may be made by laying your ruler across the work and observing tlie parts interfected thereby sketch out the general appcarance of the whole in very faint strokes without regarding the minute particulars and little turns these may be aaded afterwards review your sketch after it has been laid aside for some time comparing it again with the original faults may then appear which were undifcovered be- fere this method of practice tends to make you more per- fect in any particular sketch and by improving your know- ledge of outlines aad proportions to enable you for nearer imi¬ tations after other patterns proportion or the just magnitude of the several members of figure with regard to one another aed the whole figure makes one essential article in every good draught scheme of the proportions of graceful huiman iigure is given in the fifth lesion taken from the meafûres of antique stlatues esteenied for the highest degrees of proportion knowledge of thefe will be of great service to the young sludent yet it must not be fup- posed that this scheme is the standard of measurement for all figures for different attitudes make sensible difference in the limbs of the fame body the muscles shist their appearances swelling one way and narrowing another in different movements thus the arin the soot the knee are enlarged by bending them and the limbs are also foreshortened moreover different human bodies of agreeable appearances have not the same meafures and exact proportions in their features and limbs therefore the eye must judge of gracefulness and proportion fitness to peculiar characters should always be joined to the idea of proportion brawny muscular limbs are expressive of strength and more slender forms of agility for motion the legs of chairmen and the shoulders of watermen are enlarged by their different occupations aukward as such figure ap- pcars yet thoughtless country clown is fitly expressed by large head short neck high shoulders flat stomach thick knees and thighs and large feet proportion in these and other in- stances are regulated by fitnefs to peculiar characters and no exact dimensions can be given of them the proper materials for drawing the materials for drawing are black lead pencils char- coal crayons of black white or red chalk or other dry colours made up into crayons poitcrayon indian ink hair pencils crow-quill pens ruler and pair of compasses black lead pencil is most convenient at the beginning of practice slope your pencil to fine point accustom yourself to hold it further from the point than the nib of pen in writ- ing this is necessary to an eafy command of hand and to the making your strokes with freedom and boldnefs charcoal of fine fmooth grain slit into slender pieces for the portcrayon is very proper sor skctching as any strokes made with it are eafily brushed out with feather or clean soft rag if you think them wrong having fecured your outline with charcoal wipe it slightly over with feather to make the lines faint then go over them with black or red lead endea- vouring to make them more correct 'hefe new strokes whea wrong may be discharged with the crumbs of stale white bread in sketching after plaister or academy figures charcoal is much used because it is cafily discharged chalk the best sort of it is free from grittiness and sand is pretty soft and has kind of fatness in it black chalk is often ufed on biue or grey paper the colour of which serves for good part of the shading and the lights are put in with white chalk red chalk is used on white paper the shades made in hatching with it receive à softness by rubbing them in gently in the broad strong parts with stump made of wasn-lezther and then hatching upon them again chalk is proper for drawing large figures but littie experience will teach you to le careful not to make falfe strokes with it for they are very difficult to be discharged from the paper crayons are any colours mixt with tobacco-pipe clay which while soft and in tie consistency of paste is rolled up in pieces about the thicknefs of quill and two or three inches in lengta and then being dried are properly called dry colours tliey work eafiest and express theniselves strongest on paper of rough grain and are used on coloured paper if dark or brownilh or near the colour of whited-broivn paper it yields good relief to the tender parts of the work in using these colours they arc rubb ’ and wroughit one into another in such man- ner that no slrokes appear but the colours are mixt as if they were laid in with brussi many pictures after the life are painted in crayons drawing with these dry colours is quick and expeditious and when the crayons are handled with judgment they give delicate softness but the touch of rude finger may spoil the sine work or damp place mildew it- indian ink docs not spread and run like common ink and the work performed with it appears much softer it is bought in small cakes and by mixing it with water may be made to any degree of strength and used either wilh hair pencil or in pen like common iuk when the young student has made some pro- grefs in drawing with his black lead pencil and begins to use this ink let him secure his outline as correct as he can with the black lead then he may trace it over with pen or hair pencil and indian ink and afterwards with the crumb of white brcad rub out any remaining marks of his black lead pencil shading with this ink is sometimes done by hatching with the pen or making strokes crosfing one another but this is as well or better performed with the hair pencil more expe- ditious and customary manner is washing or working the shades with the ink and hair pencils in the same way as water colours are used the shades made by hatching resemble the strokes of engraved prints in wassiing the snades they appear like those in metzitinto prints in which there is not any lines the ruler and compasses are useful in making geometrical figures and in architecture excepting in thefe instances the ruler is never to be used and the compasses but seldom occa- sionally they may be applied in nicely examining tlie agreement of the copy with the original but it is best to judge in most cases by the eye only and if you would the compais manage right guide it not witb your hands but by your sight the conduct of the tints of lights and shadows it is the proper distribution of light and shade which gives the appearance of substance round or siat shapes distance and relievo or projection to whatever bodies you represent draw circle and according to the manner in which you shade it it will either receive flat globular or concave appearance fill it up with an even colour or with number of lines of the same strength and it will resemble body with round circumference and flat sides by colouring it strongest in the middle the edges are made to retire by the gradating shades and it receives convex appearance like globe by gradually weakening the shades from the edge towards the cen- ter the middle part will be made to retire and concave ap- pearance like bafon be given to it those parts of an object which have the greatest vivacity of colour catch the sight sirst and aprear nearest to it by gradu- ally weakening the coloer the other parts are made to iccede from the eye and appear farther off pure and unmixed white either brings an object nearer or makes it to retire further if the white be gradually weakened and supported by fhade it then advances but unless it be thus forced forward it flies off to the remotest view in rounding the parts of any object the light and shade must be gradually foftened into one another and lose themselves by slow and almost imperceptible degrees the outline must be saint in those parts which receive the light and strong aad boid where the stiades fall begin your shading at the top proceed downward and go through the whole of it with faint shade before you give the finishing to any particular part balance should be preserved between the lights and shades they serve for repose to one another broad light must there- fore be accompanied with broad shade fainter light with fainter shade light objects must have sufficient strength of shadow to sus- tain them and dark bodies must be relieved by mass of light behind without this opposition objects will adhere to the ground or stick to one another but by distributng lights and shadows to advantage they are loosened and set free and re- ceive strong relievo those objects or parts of objects which come forwardest to view must have strong and smart oppofitions and the highest finisning those that are designed to be thrown further off must be made still weaker and less distinct in nature objects ap- pear distinct er confused according to their nearneis or dis- tance the features of face or folds of garment are not diilinguishable the length of street and the innumerable leaves of distant plantation look like one confused mafs more accurate or slighter finishing gives to objects relative dominion over each other as to their distances the heightening of one chaïes another further from the sight which is not so minutely and strongly pencilled give to eyery object such lights as are most proper to its sup- pofed fituation in the open air when the sun shines full upon objects the lights must be strong aad bold and the shadows dark if the sun is obscured by clouds the light is more equal and universal but not so strong and warm and the shades must be fainter and more siveet artificial light tinges the object with its own colour and occasions large shadows with bold extremities elcmentaiy light is pure and more generally diffased and the shadows it produces are softer the pro- jecting parts of objects are nearest to the light catch it first are brightest and produce shades upon the lower parts confider from what point and in what direction the light falls upon the in all arts and sciences the learner begins with the most simple principles the knowledge of the alphabet is an introduction to the grammar and an ability to imitate the forins of different lines ’ tis no matter of what shape so that they are exactly imitated is the foundation of drawing after every kind of object in this first lesson the scholar is presented with many lines of differeat kinds for his imitation perpendicular lines marked that is line falling directly on another so as to object and place all your lights and shades according to that direction if it falls perpendicular upon man the top of the head is then lightest the shoulders in the next degree so and the lower part gradually darker the cavities and parts that bend inwards not receiving any direct rays are darkest of all and the colours are lost in them the fuil force of the princi- pal light is to be only in one part and ought not to be crossed or interrupted with little shadows sudden brightness is seen and many reflections and demy tints are produced when the sorce of light strikes upon silks fattins vessels of silver copper or upon other glittering objects the very extremity of the shadowed side of objects is seldom the darkest of all because it almost always receives reflection of light from adjacent bodies reflexes are scarce sensible ex- cept in the shadowed parts all reflccted light is supposed to carry with it part of the colour of the body which reflects it so that those places which receive this light have their own colour mixed or tinged with the other much szill and accu- racy is often required in manacement of the refiexes as the sanie place many times receives them from different objects dif- ferently coloured every circumstance of the colour light and pofition of cach figure and what effect each has toon the other is to be considered and nature pursued in all the variety of mixtures nature gives vast variety of appearances in light and shade curious observer of them is rewarded with high delight and the artist with much improvement the sky always gradates one way or another the rifing and setting fun exhibit it with astonishiing beauty and perfection the variety of forms and colours reflected in water from the sky and clouds from trees houses and other objects are exceeding beautiful to behold accustom yourself to consider the different effects of light fall- ing upon objects its various and delightful softnings and mo- dulations in the shades or parts which are more or less deprived of the rays your judgment will this way be best informed by your senfes how to represent these pleafing appearances the proper management of which makes one of the great divisions or branches of painting make equal angles on each side horizontal lines which pafs from one point to another without any deviation ob- lique lines converging or approximating one way and diverg- ing or continually increasing their distance the other way parallel lines which are every where equidistant from each other. at two semicircles are drawn from points asfumed in the lower line and the upper line being tangent to both of them proves the truth of its being drawn parallel en- amples are also given of various forts of curved and twining lines this second lesson consists partly of geometrical figures some of them with plain lines others with their furfaces formed by light and shade number is circle the circle appearing with flat fide being filled with an equal shade convex appear- ance given to the circle by light and shade concave ap- pearance given to it other convex and concave surfaces square of four equal sides an cquilateral triangle this lesson will be more pleasing to the learner than the qualisy him to copy more difficult representations the following leaves exhibit many examples of the fea- turcs of the human face as the eyes nose mouth cars the pupil should practise after the different fcatures in their various positions till he able to draw them well unless he can perform the parts separately it will be fruitless to at- tempt the whole together spiral or curve line issuing from center and continu- ally going off from it at every tur cone these with other figures shewn in this lesson are useful in different parts of practice by consulting fmall treatise of practical geometry by le clerk the student in fhort time will gain knowledge of the construction of geometrical figures very advantageous in drawing multitudes of objects former ones and practising after the instances here given will several easy examples are also given of entire faces and heads in various attitudes when the student has made progress in sketching after those in outline there are others which are sinisned ior him to shade after by considering the plate annexed he will improve his ideas of face and the method of drawing it in all the changes and variations which are occasioned therein by different turnings of the head the divisions and proportions of the head and face drawing head and face four equal parts the length of the nofe are usually allotted from the top to the bottom from the crown of the head to the top of the sorchead from thence to the top of the nofe to the bottom of the nose from thence to tlie bottom of the chin the breadth of the faoe is divided into five cqual parts one of which parts is the length of the eye the distance between the eyes is the measure of one part and from the corner of the eye to the side of the face is one part the width of the mouth is little moic than one of these parts the width of the nose across the nostrils little less the eye is divided into three parts one of which is the meafure of the pupil or fight with the iris round it the ear is usually the length of the nofe these are approved proportiens of good face viewed in front but in different beautiful subjecis the fame featutes often vary both in lengeh and shape the head in general has nearly the shape of an egg or oval as in figure of the annexed plate in the middle of the oval draw from the top to the bottom perpendicular line as in fig through the center of the line draw another directly zeross as in fig on these two lines the features of the face are to be drawn in their due proportions that the learner may apprehend more per- fectly the ufe of these two lines their varia- tions in the different turnings of the head and how the features on them appear when the face is inclining to either fide turning up- wards or downwards let him either conceive of or procure piece of fmooth wood turned in the form of an egg draw line lengthways quite round the egg as in fig and perpen¬ dicular from top to bot- tom as in fig di- vide this line into two equal parts by another which reaches from side to side as in fig features being drawn on these crofs lines produce front right face as in fig turning the egg fmall matter to the left or to the right the cross lincs appear more cur- ved as in fig and the features inust be drawn on them a in fig and nose always pro- jects beyond the per- pendicular line in pro- portion as the face is more or less turueil aside and moie of the car and nearest side of tlie face eecomes vifi- bie the firstlinc which was drawn round the egg is no longer its boundary but it gains new circumferent line by being turnied into new position by ju- clining the egg down- wards and little to the left the cross will appear as in fig if raiied upwards and re- clining to the right the lines appear as ili fig and the features in these instaazes are shewn in fig vast varietv of faces dif- fetently inclined may be stewn by this oval or egg divide the perpendicular line into four equal parts the first must be allotted to the hair of the head tne second is from the top of the forehead to the top of the nose the third reaches to the bottoen of the nose fhe fouith divinon includes the lips and chin this peipendicular line divides the face breadth-ways into two equal parts it lies exactly in the middle betwixt the eyes runs down the midst of the nose and the gutter underneath the middle of the mouth must always be placed on it and the bottom of it terminates on the point of the chin divide the cross line which is the breadth of the face into five equal parts and place the eyes upou it so as to leave ex- actly the length of one eye between them this is t be un- derstood of front face as in fig for if it turns to either side the distance appears lessened on that side which is sarthest from you the cross line is the boundary fer the top of the cars the bottom of them is parallel with the boctom of the nose the noitrils should not swell beyond the inner corner of the eye the features of front face when drawn upon the cross lines according to these directions will aprear in their proper places whatever way the oval or egg is tal-aed as is shewn in fig and or side faces are to be drawn by means of perpen¬ dicular as in ngure on which the forehead nofe mouth and chin are to be placed as in fig in these figures the line froin top to bottom is strictly perpendicular it would be so in an oval drawn on paper or any flat surface but the cur- vizy of an egg tuins it out of that sorm tho ’ for dislinction sake it is described by that name in the foregoing account when you mark the featutes in their proper places touch thein very lightly at first and afterwards proceed on them with greater exactness then draw the hair beard and shadows about it in all faces there are some principal toucles which when the pupil can draw face and head tolerably well he miy proceed upon the hands and feet the hands are very important articles and to perform them with ease and freedom is not à littie difficult much labour should be bestowed in practising aster the examples given of them in theit various actions and soreshortnings the hand from the tip of the fore-singer ’ the wrist is the length of face that is three quarters of head and this length is equally di¬ vided into two paits one of which is for the palm of the hand the thumb is the length of the nose the breadth of the plam is the same as its length equal to the length of the fore singer the nail of the finger is about half the joint it stands upon the foot viewed sideways is in length the sixth part of the sigure and may be divided into four equal parts one of which is for the heel two others for the sole and the other for the toes the great toe is commonly the length of the thumb these proportions usually obtain and it will he useful for the pupil to fix an idea of them in his niind thol there be few opportunities of applying them directly because of the foreshortnings in which these parts appear in almost every graceful action the ancients commonly allowed eight heads to their figures the moderns ordinarily divide the figure into ten faces the face beginning at the root of the lowest hairs on the forehead and ending at the bottom of the chin an human figure divided according to this method into ten cqual parts of the length of face each division will reach as follows the first from the crown of the head to the nostrils the fecond to the hole in the neck between the collar-bones the third to the pit of the stomach the fourth to the navel the fifth to the lower part of the belly ihe sixth and feventh to the upper part of the knee the thigh being the length of two faces he knee contains half face from the lewer part of the knee to the ankle two faces from the ankle to the sole of the foot half face man with bis arnis extended from the extremity of the longest singer of his right hand to the longest of his lest nicasures as broad as he is long viz from the tip of the long finger to the joint of the wrist one facc thence to the elbow one sace and one third begin with making the oval for the head and divide it according to the instructions al eady given agreeable to that universal rule in all just designs of comparing and pro- portionisg every part to the first the rest of your figure must now be proportioned to the head therefore draw perpendi- cular from the top of the oval and mark on it eight divifions er lengths of the head for the heighth of the figure and ad- justment of its parts this line is also of ufe in placing the figure uptight and wbether it be measured by eight heads or ten faccs the former lesson directs what parts of the body are to be placed on the feveral divifions ketch the head first then the shoulders then draiv the trunk of the body beginning with the arm-pits leaving the arnis till afterwards and so down to the hips on both fides give spirit and are the characteristic tkereof thesé should sa well confidered and earafully exprest if the face be fat the ehecks will seem to fwell if lean the jaw bones will stick out and checks fall in the corters of the mouth and iniddle of the eye-brows will be elevated in agreeable fensations the eye brows will rise up at the ends and fall in the middle and the eorner of the mouth will fink in pain or uneasinefs the mouth by shooting forwards and riling in the middle expresses averfion every passion of the soul is vifible in the features of the face the lines and lights which are expressive- of them claim particular attention thence to the juncture of the shoulder one face and one third thence to the hole in the neck one sace and one third in all five faces which with the five along the other arm to the tip of the middle finger gives ten in measuring figure by eight parts each part the length of the head the divifions allotted to them- are viz from the erown of the head to the point of the chin one thence to the bottom of the breasts one thence to the navel one- thence to the lower part of the belly one thence to the middle of the thigh one thence to the lower part of the knee one thence to the small of the leg one thence to the bottoin of the foot one the figure with his arms stretched out meafured breadth- ways by eight parts or heads is divided as follows ariz. from the end of the long finger to the wrist one thence to the bend of the arni one thence to the bottom of the shoulder one thence over to the other shoulder two thence to the end of the other loug finger three the proportions of man differ in some respects from those of woman particularly the head of woman is lefs than that of man and her neck longer tlie breasts and belly are lower the fpace from the bottom of the breast to the navel is half the length of the nose less than in men and the thigh third part of the nofe shorter as to the breadth woman has her breasts and shoulders narrower and her haunches larger her thighs at the place of articulation are larger the tops of their arms and legs are larger than man ’ but down- wards more slender and their hands and feet are less new born insant is not at most above four heads long and feldom so much at four or five years old it is about five heads long and the length of the body increases with its age till it arrives to the state of manhood and attains its full pro- portions the thickness of the limbs must be adjusted agreeable to the quality and eharacter of the figure in general it iay be noticed that the breadth of the thigh at the thickest is double that of the thickest part of the leg and treble that of the fmallest but therc is diffcrence in the contours of parts when put in different postures thus when the arm is bent it is arger than when straight the same is true of the foot and knee and other limbs and joints being careful to observe the breadth of the waiit then draw that leg which the body rests npen and afterwards the other which stands loose next draw the arms and last of all the hands it is sometimes recommended to begin the sketch on the right fide of the figure that in the procefs of the work the performer ’ hand may neither hide or shade any part of it as it may happen in some draughts when begun on the left side to enforce direction already given in the general rules carefully view the original you draw after the distance of one feature limb joint muscle from another thieir length breadth and turnings their proportion to each other and to the whole figure which of them are directly under the other which of them are parallel and how they stand fituated with regard to any part of the figure preserve just symmetry and harmonious correspondence in all the parts of the figure by forming them in due proportions to one anotlier not one arm bigger or longer than the other or of size ill adapted to any of the other parts not plump and strong limbs with shrivelled face or decayed body or broad herculeati shoulders with the wasted limbs of fribble take notice of the bowings and bendings of the body and contrast the opposite parts answerable thereto if the belly bends in the body must stick out if the knee bends out the in drawing naked body whatever muscles appear must be exprest agreeable to the rules of anatomy they must not be subdivided into small sections but kept as entire as possiblé only the principal muscles and those which are of significa- tion to express that action which is represented should be made appcar the motion or action of the figure must al- ways be considered in drawing the muscles for they rise and sink and are cither less or morc apparent according to the different motions of the body the muscles of the leg which supports the body or of an arm that lists weight are fuller or more swelled than in the leg or arm which are not so em- in cloathing your figures or casting the drapery over them with elegance and propriety it should be considered that the beauty of draperies consist not in the multitude of folds but in their natural order and plain simplicity the dra- pery miust encompass the parts loosely when it sits too strait or close it gives stissness to the figure and seems obstructive to its motions draw the plaits large and following the form of the limbs underneath that they may be distinguissied from others by due management of the light and shades the extremiities of the joints as the shoulders elbows knees should be so niarked as to be apparent as sar as art and probability will permit notwithstanding they are covered this is so material consideration that many artists first sketch the naked iigure and afterwards put the drapery on it the grcat folds must be drawn sirst and afterwards broke and di- vided into lesser ones and great care be taken that they do nat cross one another improperly tho ’ in general the solds should be laege and as few as possible yet they must be gicater or less according to the quality of the stuff of which the drarery is suoposed to consist some as coarse woollens make their folds abrupt and harsh and others as silks and fine innens more soft and easy the surïace of some has lustre others are dull some are pliable and transparent others strong and tolid the quality of the person is likewise to be con- sidered in the drapery if they are magistrates or dignified perforages theit robes or dtaperies should be large and ample if ladies and nymphs thin soft and piable if country clowns ordinary people er slaves they ought to be stout and ham must fall in and so of every other joint in the body sketch your outline at first very faint marking the general ap- pearance and proportion of the most conspicuous and remark- able particulars with slight touches and afterwards introduce the minute parts by tracing it over again correcting the first sketch by little and little untii the whole contour be finisned with admirable exactness steady even light is always to be chosen that no glare may come on the original or on your own work ployed those of the breast become more or less visible by listing up or holding down the arm in drawing young persons the muscles must not appear so manifestly as in those who are elder and full grown the same is to be observed in fat and fleshy people and in such as are very delicate and beautiful in women and children scarce any muscles at all are to be exprest and but faintly when swelled by forcible action in persons of an hardy and ro- bust make they are most apparent coarse suit the garment and folds to the postare of the body and the sway or action of the limbs crooked or strait or bending one way or another according to their various po- sitions in such manner as will best express their attitude and motion different postures and niotions vary the folds and bring them into new forms and whatever posture the body is supposed to be in should be exprest by an artsul complication of them when they are well imagined they give much spirit to every action grcat lightness and motion of the dra- pery are only proper sor figures in great agitation or exposed to the wind the loose apparel in this case must all fly one way and that part of the garment which adheres closest to the body should be drawn besore the loose part which flies from it in order to secure the true position of the figure the closer the garment sits to the body the narrower aud smaller must be the folds the draperies which cover those parts that are exposed to great light niust not be so deeply shaded as to seem to pierce them nor should thc limbs in that situa- tion of light be crossed by solds that are too strong lest the great darkness of the shade give them the appearance os be- ing broke whenever the drapery is adorned with rich ornaments they should be introduced with judgment and priety suitable to the character of the figure and in ge- used sparingly it is altogether improper and debasing to use them in the imaginary representation of angels the dignity and grandeur of whose draperies oight rather to consist in noble flow of the folds slow of the solds than in rich stuff and the glitter of ornaments always chuse north light if possible because it is steady and mofi equally diffused darken with the shut- ters all the windows of the room but one and darken the lower part of that window the light contracted in this maniier aed only admitied at an altitude above the position of the figure will make the sliadows distinct and shew every part of it to ad- vantage if you are constrained to window which has south aspect transparent fasn of oil ’ paper will moderate the light and take off the glare sit at distance from the model in proportion to its size so far that you may see the whole of it at once which may be effected at distance about twice or three times its magnitude seat yoursels in such manner as to bring your eye upon ievel with tlee figure directions for copy place your picture in good light by which is meant not only an even steady light as directed in the former ar- ticle but also the proper light for the picture that it may fall thercon either on the right or left side agreeable to the lights and shadows in the painting seat yourself at proper dis- tance from it to see the whole picture at once observe nicely what object is placed in the middle of the picture mark slightly the middle of your paper and give it the same situa- tion observe the principal ohjects on the lest and on the right side how they are placed and ranged sketch their rough form very slightly in the same disposition and proportion till all the principal parts are marked on your paper in their pro- per places the expression or supposed character and cir- cumistances of every object in the picture must be well studied and imprinted on your mind its attitude postuie and gesture preserved in your copy and thofe parts be particularly no- ticed by which the action and fentiment are represented in strong and lively manner as the whole composition should be slightly sketch ’ before you begin to finisn any part so in the snading you should go on with the whole together with faint shade before you finisn any part many directions are given in the preceding essay for the lights and snades common method of adjusting the distances the situation and proportion of every object agreeable to the picture is to divide it into little squares and then to divide the paper for the copy into the same number of squares and to draw in them for drawing landskips or having fixt your station and determined what extent ha of view to delineate draw the horizontal line faintly and mark it into three divisions then divide in your mind the landskip iuto three divisions likewise sketch the niddle divi¬ fion first then that on the left hand afterwards that on the right observe what objects fall under one another and mark them on your paper accordingly what objects raage on level with each other between the two sides and place them parallel in your draught remark what objects are the observations heretofore laid doin are applicable branch of drawing to urge the most material of them copy after good originals mark out all the parts be- fore you begin to shadow make tlie contours in great pieces without taking notice of the litile mufcies and other breaks observe every stroke as to its perpendicular pa¬ rallel and distance and particuiariy so to compare anc op pvse the parts that meet upon and traverse the perpendicular as to form kind oi square in the mind which is the great and al- most the only rule sor producing à just and exact copy regard not only the model you are copying after but also the parts you have already drawn there being no possibility of preserving strict justnes in your performance but by comparing and proportioning every part to the first what is correspondent to each square this is sure method to enlarge or reduce draught with exactness but is the stu- dent accustom himself to practise by the help of these fquare he will certainly stint and confine his judgment let him ratiier help it by imaginary lines than cramp it by real ones let him conceive in his miind perpendicular and an horizontal line intersecting each other in tlie middle of the picture and observe what objects are crossed by them and tuen suppose two such lines crossing his paper in order to give those objects similar situation in the like manner the situs-tion and pro- portion of all the chief parts throughout the gicture may be considered by imagining other lines traversing them and di viding as it were the several paits of the painting into imall squares the primary qualification in the art of drawing is readiness of comparing and meafuring by the eye all tte parts of composition and an ability to expreis them with boldneis and justness this essential accomplishment is to be acquired by habit and application the proportion form and magnitude of objects their dimi- nution in size and lustre are governed by the rules of perspec- tive knowledge in the practical part of that science will greatly advance the pupil ’ judgment and facilitate his prac- tice and this knowledge may be attained with surprizing ease by consulting that plain and familiar treatise the jesuit per- spective translated by ephraim chambers seen through the intervals of other particular objects and give them the same apparent situation enceavour to sxetch all the olijects in taeir propcrtional magnitudes and distances they gradually diminisn as they are sarther removed from the eye and it is this diminution with gradual softenings and in- distinctness which gives distant objects their remote appearance theze are certain infallible rules in perspective for the manage- ment of this important article make all yeur lights and shades sall one way
