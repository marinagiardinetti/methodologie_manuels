plan of work- ing yet in miniature painting there is certain degrae of mechanical attention to be paid to the management of the water colours to preserve them clear and free from muddine hich is much more difficult to attain than the management hy him observing the style of penciling and management of the marking of his features and colouring of his picture from the person sitting to him in the management of back-grounds the young painter is proper value and on the other hand of harmonizing the what of similitude in the back-ground to teint in the face which otherwise in course of working to express particular part might apncar too prevalent the liighest degree of perfection we esteem in miniature pattinx is to sce fine effect produced to the naked eve and an examining it with magnifving glass to discover that tinwork in it so certain has the artist been or his toitat every stroke of his pencil told as much as twentv secin an inserior in the art would very particularly recommend it to person who commences miniature painting and who has formerly been copying either from large drawings or from busts to continue at his leifure hours still drawing large in black and white chaiks as

to the center of the ivory unless the person be very tall in wliich case it must be rather higher up and if very low the contrary shall now conclude with advising the young miniature painter to be modest and attentive not by overleaping the bounds prescribed by the former argue himself into too high an opinion of his abilities or for want of à due observance of the latter prevent the world from perceiving he was ever possessed of any of the requisites necessary to constitute an artist of colours used in miniature painting in painting tlie face the yellows that are used are five viz gall-stone terra sienna nottingham oker roman oker and naples yellow the latter three of which are opaque colours the other tiansparent the greens are confined to one which is sap-green thie blues are verditer prussian indigo smalt uitramarine and antwerp the reds are carmine drop lake chinese vermillion and indian red under the class of reds may also be put burnt terra sienna its colour inclining much that way though more to the orange the only browns if any be used the face and burnt umber and terra de cassell and they are only to be used in the mixture of dark shadows under the nose for draperies we shall only add to the above colours lamp-black king ’ yellow and flake white of the nature and qualities of colours yellows we shall first begin with gall-stone genuine kind of which is very difficult to be had in london spurious kind being manu sactured from dried ox-gall to which colourmen put gum-water and so impose it on their customers for colour wliich is one of the finest and brightest in the world and lasting one although in face painting it should be sparingly used its worrderful brilliancy being apt to drown all the other colours and make the workit is used in too warm in its tints to get it genuine apply to the slaughtermen who will examine the gail-hladders of the oxen in many of which gall-stones tbeing concrescences formed in the bladder are found by this mode only will the artist or amateur attain possession of this unrivalled colour in its pure state terra sienna is à bright vellow earth somewhat of foul greasy nature it is used by some miniature painters as warm yellow hut when burned it is beautiful colour partaking of three tints yellow red and brown nottingham oler is bright yellow earth it works well and is much in use amongst the painters in london but on account of its heavy quality it must be used with caution it certainly is lasting colour and of much service in the fleshy tints of the face roman oler is reddishi yellow earth of very great body some painters have used it with success in miniature painting as it works when properly portioned with guin-water extremely sharp and neat and being in itself warm colour it communicates that quality to the tints it is worked in naples vllow although mentioned under the head of yel- lows is colour whicn though adopted by some artists is not by any means in general use for miniature painting it is pale gritty yellow very hard to grind and prepare is of very fickly hue and has this very bad quality that itsabsorbs all colours that are either worked on it or mixed with it blues it is scarcely necessary to inform our readers that of all blues ever in use none can in the smallest degree be set in competition with ultramarine its wonderful brightness and permanency by far excelling them but the misfortune artists labour under is that like every other valuable article imported from foreign countries it is generally so adulterated that it is next to an impossibility to meet it genuine the ingredient that it is mixed with is smalt sinely gruund in water and then dried but the way to detect the impnsition is to put small quantity of what you should buy for ultramarine on hroad case knise and hold it over candle keeping tlie smoke from tonching it wlien if adulterated it will apnear in grey spots hut if puie it will remain brilliant as before tlie trial prussian blue is good colour and for which thcic is no substitute in miniature painting on account of its strenech of effect and transparency of it there are several kins seme very light coloured others dark the former is ons- com pound of the good kind and is either whiting er some such thing the best and purest sort is dark and brittle smalt is à very sine bright blue inelininz to purple hut so exccssively hard that nothing burt an agate flag and mulle will sufficiently pulverize it for sine uses in sume things it may be used when ultramarine is not to he had it is colour that does not work well nor is it to he denended on as to permianency indigo is useful blue though it must be sparingly used on account of its extrene depth of colour nearly approachitig to black the best is called the rock indigo the way to judge of its qualities is to bieak it and if good it will have copperish hue hut if bad it will he of dead blackissi cast erditer is sine blue and much used by miniature painters not onsy in their sky grounds but likewise in the delicate parts of their saces and in sincly expressing thie anatomy of ladies and childten ’ necks it is bcautiful colour hut requires to he

antwerst biue it certainly is one of tle greatest deceptions in the world heing when dry à mest beautisul bright elue but when wet and prepared very dingy colour and totally unsit sor the face of miniature it appears to he compound of prussian blue verditer and some kind of wliite as vou will perceive on hreaking lunp of it white specks all through it it may be used in blue draperies or back-grounds but in nothing elle sap-green which is the juice of buck-thorn berries is liighly useful colour wlen judicioussy mixed withother volours producing warm fleshy tints wliich can not be produced with- out it its extreme thinness and transparency is greatly in its savour and it does not change tliere are à variety of tints under the tiile of sap green some being of yellowish cast others darker and some very dark the last is best the berry at that time being at its full growth and persection carmine is very fine bright crimson inelining to the scar- let and is rather an opaque colour fromit variety of sine tints may he made hut its being such very hiigh red renders it unfit to be used in delicate subjects such as children or sine women there are various kinds of it prepared by chemisis but the deep kind is the best the lighter sort being frequentlv made so by adulteration if any crimson colour stands in water it is this drop lake is made from the shearings of scarlet cloth and is pleasing crimson colour its inelining to tlie purple makes it partieularly useful for tlie carnation tinits in painting delicate subjects there are many kinds of it at various prices some being nearly as bright and high-coloured as carmine lake heing of rather purple crimson is more transparent than carmine and therefore by miniature painters more generally used chinese vermiilion when good is charming bright red and useful in miniature pictures though not to be freely used its opacity rendering it dangerous to mix much with other colours but by itself in touching the under lip and other parts tliat require extreme brightness it is of wonderful service lt is very difficult to find the real kind the common vermillion mixed with lake or carmine being general substitute but the spurious and the genuine kind very materially differ in tle working the former being thick and hieavy the other the contrary it comes from china in small parcels of fourteen ounces each with chinese characters marked on the cover but although this is the only mode of coming at the genuine kind still there are descriptions of people who contrive to baffse artists in that particular by counterfeiting the characters on the covering of the packets indian red is of deep purple cast and is most excellent colour not only for touching the deep red parts but likewise in the fleshy tints of mens pictures it is colour difficult to prepare being very hard and gritty but it is to be bought in the capital colour-shops in london ready for use in an im¬ palpable powder and works extremely well it is useful in bright back-grounds and also in draperies browns umber is yellowishi brown very greasy and mixes un- kindly with water colours and in miniature painting useful only for draperies and even for them can be dispensed with but when properly burnt is charming reddisn brown very useful in many parts of miniature painting and works ex tremely shiarn and neat terra de cassl or vandyke brown so called from the very great estimation the inimitable painter of that nanie held it in is the finest rich brown in tne world in itself producing mure heautiful colour than can he formed by the junction of any clours whatever it is in general use amongst the oil and water painters in london it is in its natural state rather coarse and sandy but when prepared it amply repays the artist for his labour in doing so lamp black is the smoke of burning rosin and is useful for marking the pupil of the eve for mixing in hair colours the smoke of candle received and in painting draperies on plate is found the best being blacker than the common lamp black king ’ yellow is fine bright opaque colour and is admira- bly calculated for painting lace gilt buttons but is rank poison therefore should be cautioussy used flake white or refined white lead is useful in the cloth draperies of men ’ pictures but not to be used by itself as white for it will turn black which circumstance should be nicely attended to by all the artists if used in miniature painting for linen it should be immediately covered with glass which method is the only one which stands chance of preserving its purity of the prcharation of colours amongst the number of necessary colours just mentioned there are three which require to be burnt viz terra-sienna umber and lamp-black the method is as follows the colour is to be put into crucible which is to be covered and placed in hot fire and when you think that the lump of colour is red hot through take the crucible off the fire and let the colour cool but the lamp black is to be prepared in different manner you take some of the com mon kind put it on clean fire shovel or plate of iron over the fire it will immediately on receiving the heat begin to smoke on the ceasing of which your lamp-black is freed from the oily substance it originally contained and fit for im¬ mediate use gum water chuse the large white pieces of gum arabic which is brittle and easily comes to pieces in your fingers also that which wiich is clear put it into clean vial and pour some water on it which is well strained and divested of all sandy particles make vour gum water about the thickness of barley-gruel that is so thick that vou can feel it in your fingers note the freshier made your gum water always is the better to grind colours and firepare them for the pallet you must provide yourself if possible with an agate flag and muller but if that can not conveniently be had glass ones may answer though not quite so well the glass muller and flag must be lightly roughened with fine flour emery which will give it à furface that will continue long time after being particularly careful that your flag are quite clean you lay some of thie colour to be ground on it brusing it whilst dry gently with the muller then put few drops of water on it and grind it very carefully not making it too wet as that will prevent it from keeping sufficiently under the muller when you think it is finely ground in the water take your pallet knife or thin edged picce of ivory scrape your colour together in little heap on your flag which let dry for short time then add your gum water to it gradually having piece of ivory near you on which you are frequently to lay some of the colour with camel-hair peneil thin and when you perceive the colour in the smallest degree to shine when dry it is gummed enough when you are to scrape it off your flag and transser it to your pallet note there are some colours which will not bear suf- ficient quantity of gum to make them shine without injuring their qualities as smalt ultramarine and verditer blues of hair pencils manner of choosing them pencils for painting in miniature are not made of camel ’ hair but of the tips of squirrel ’ tails and of these there are two kinds the dark brown and yellowisni red pencils made of the latter kind are called sable pentils and are of stiffer nature than the others and bear more than double the price they certainly are useful kind of pencil as long as the sine flue at the end of the hair remains on account of their elasticity but the instant the flue is worn off they froin their harshness become useless however they may be dispensed with as nopencil can be superior to one made of the common kind of hair we here caution our readers against an error too prevalent amongst young miniature painters which is that of preferring very small pencil for their work vainly hoping by the assistance of such one to execute their picture with more neatness and accuracy but in this as before observed they will not only by their own experience but by their intercourse with eminent miniature painters find themselves egregioussy mistaken the finest and most highlv finished pictures being executed with middle sized pencil the point of which being not only sufficiently neat but from its body containing quantity of colour in fluid enables the artist to give that melsow firm touch wliich is so generally admired by connoisseurs in the art the young artist is there- fore advised to choose middle sized pencil with good spring and point both of which he will know by drawing the peneil lightly through liis mouth and touching it on his thumb-nail if he finds it on being moderately wet to spring again into its form after being bent it is good sign but as there are manv peneils possessed of that quality which are desicient in another material one namely that of good point that must be very cautioussy looked to by turning the peneil round on the nail in every direction observing the hairs at the point keep equally together of length and none shooting out on either side swhich is often occasioned by the peneil maker putting the hair into the quill with twist in it all these defects being carefully guarded against you are sure of being in possession of very principal material for miniature painting- ivory method of choosing bleaching and preparing it of lvory there are various kinds the distinction of which in this art is of very material consequence but must first inform my reader that lvory newly cut and full of sap is not easily to be judged of the general transparency it exhibits in this state almost preeluding the possibility of discovering whether it be coarse grained or sine streaky or the contrary unless to tiie artist who by long course of experience is familiarized to it the best way to discover the quality of it is by holding it grainways to the light then holding it up and looking through it still turning it from side to side and very nafrowly observing whether thete be any streaks in it this you will unless the ivory be frelhly cut easily discover and in this you can not be too particular as it is an observation of manv experienced painters that good piece of lvory is half the work done there is à species of lvory which is very bad for painting on although it has no streaks in it being of horny coarse nature wliich will never suffer the colours to be thrown out in the brilliant manner finer species of ivory will you are therefore not oily to be cautious in choosing ivory free from streaks but likewise that which has the finest grain and close having instructed in the mode of choosing ivory we now procced to treat on the manner of preparing it for painting on you are to heat à fmoothing iron in so sinall degree that you can hold your hand on the face of it so long as you can reckon three or four in moderate time then put your ivory between clean piece of folded paper on which place the hot iron turning vour ivory frequently until it becomes transparent white for you are to observe that very particu larly an opaque whit not answering for face painting in miniature as it would give harssiness and unpleasant appear ance to your picture when you think your ivory is suffici ently white for your purpose lay it under some flat weight until it cools as thiat will prevent its warping you then proceed to prepare it for which purpose you must pound some pumice-stone in mortar as clear and fine as you can which put into fine linen or cambrick bag tying it about midway tight but leaving room for the pumice dust to sift through the bottom then get long mustard-bottle perfectly clean and dry in which suspend the pumice dust covering the top with the muzzle of the bag so as nothing can come out then shake the bottle smartly in your hand when the fine particles of the pumice will fift out and remain at the bottom of the boitle thereby preventing any coarse grains from being amongst what you are going to use wliich would very materially injure your ivory your pumice dust being prepared scrape the leaves of ivory with sharp pen-knise uiitil the scratches of the cutting saw be entirely obliterated then take either piece of dutch polishing russi or piece of middling fine patent glass paper the latter of which is the handiest and carefully polish your lvory with it not by passing your hand backwards and forwards but in circular manner until you have it pretty level then strew some of your pumice dust on the ivory and put few drops of water on it which done with your muller work on it in circular manner as before until you find every part has equally received the puniice which you will know by its exhibiting à dead grave appearance thofe parts which have not received the pumice continuing to fhine in spots which you must still labour to do away with vour pumice and muller when you find it pumiced to your satis- faction take clean sponge and fair water with which gently to rub it hard for fear of giving the ivory gloss that would prevent vour colours from taking on it so pleasant as you could wish after this lay your ivory to dry and in few hours it will be fit for use then you are to paste it on piece of wove paper by touching the back of it merely at the edges as gum water or any other cement heing put near the center of your ivory will cause dark unpleasant spot perhaps to appear through in the very part where your face is to be painted purple is formed of either ultramarine prussian blue smalt or indigo mixed with either carmine or drop lake of uitramarine although the most beautiful and brilliant colours by itself yet in any mixture it loses that perfection but it still retains sufficient share of brightness to render it desirable teint in the purplishi grey shadows of tlie face prussian blue mixed as before mientioned makes bright or dark purple according as the quantities of either colours are portioned but indigo makes still darker owing to its great natural depth of colour smalt and carmine or lake form nearly the same tint as uitramarine and may be used nearly for the same purposes grey of grey tints there are various kinds aceording to the subjects they are required for and the parts thev are to be placed in warin grey tint may be made by duly portiening burnt terra sienna prussian blue and drop lake the more tetra sienna in it tlie warmer the tint the more prussian blue and lake the colder another grey tint which has heen used with success by some eminent miniature painters is composed of prnssian blue and chinese vermillion but on account of the unkind manner with which vermillion incorporates with any other colour it required greater portion of gum than ordinary to make them work or keep together third grey tint which is an excellent one is formed of drop lake sap green and prussian blue olive tints very sine ofive tint is formed of gall stone notting- ham oker and carmine or lake and another of sap green and lake simply beautiful hair colour either dark or light according to the quantities of colours is made of carmine lamp-black and sap green thie manner of forming it is only to be aquired by practice but the knowledge of making it when once attained will be found worth the time disposed of in tte trial that very difficult tint which is often to be met with in children ’ hair by the proper junction of these colours will be produced to perfection other hair tints may be made of terra-de-cassel simply or by the addition of lamp¬ black somc excellent painters make all their hair tints of burnt terra sienna lamp black and nottingham oker the latter being added onlvwhen there is light hair wanting to be represented burned umber has been substituted for terra sienna along with the lamp black and forms good tint but care must be taken to avoid either the greenisn or reddisn cast which it is apt to produce tints for sine linen gauze of all teints in transparent painting such as the miniature works of the prefent day thiere is none more difficult to ascer tain than the one at present we are about to treat on for this reason the delicacy not only of mixture but tlie delicacy of touch would require painter to be what no man ever was purpose which man might hit on this day to-morrow he might not be so fortunate in nor might he be so happy in that exquisite touch which conveys the idea of beauty in the thinness and folding of sine linen or gauze the true painting of which often stamps the character of an artist and in the general opinion throws veil over the defects in other parts of the picture which the more experienced connoisseur would readily point out we shall therefore only observe that any of the teints under the head of grey will properly managed answer the purpose having now pointed out the manner of preparing the delicate transparent teints for miniature painting we shall proceed to treat on the grosser ones namely those for draperies of colours proper for men draperies we shall under the above head make some general obser vations the first of which is that in all cloth draperies for men ’ portraits it is necessary to add some flake white as it not only gives the colour the dead appearance which cloth exhibits exhibits but likewise its being incorporated with the flake hite gives it body which bears well against the face gires value to it and makes the flesh teints appear to more advantage the next observation is that in grinding up your draperies you are to make them appear several degrees lighter in colour than vou want them to be when dry for this reascal the flake white is colour so very heavy that after you sloat in vour coat it will sink to the bottom and leave jour colour several degrecs darker than when it was wet and finally you are not to be too heavy or thick in floating in xour draperies but merely to see that your colour be evenly sjread over the part whereon your coat is to appear it is necessary to inform the young artist that there are four rechnical terms in miniature painting -namely floating wafhing in handling and maiking the first procefs which is floating and is chiefly used for draperies is thus drapery is to be grind up your colour on your flag suot puiine quantity of gum water that would make it fhine as it would frustrate your purpose then take large soft hair peneil and having previoussy laid your ivory on very level table sill vour pencil plentifully with the colour and lay it quick all over the parts of the ivory vou want covered seeing that it runs on every part equally which if kept in proper fluid state it will readily do then lay it in some place to dry wliere it is not likely to receive dust when you will have with colour and giving very broad stroak rather faintly as in beginning the hair back-grounds and likewise on laying on the general flesh tint of the sace it is also used in the first touches of the dark shadows which ever ought to be begun faint and broad handling is the manner in which all the washing in and lastly marking consists in the sharp spirited touches given to the different fcatures in order to give that animated appearance so necessary to constitute fine picture plack diapery is fermed of lamp-black burnt and flake white and must be laid in with good deal of the latter as otherwise it would be very difficult to manage the shadows so as to produce pleasing effect blue drapery may be made of either prussian blue or antwerp blue mixed with white indigo being too much inclined to blackish cast and as before observed of the black good deal of the flake white must be mixed with it for the same reason green drapery is well made of king ’ yellow and prus- sian or antwerp blue and it is scarcely necessary to observe the more blue tlie darker tlie green and the more yellow the contrary yellow for officers facings or the like can not be so well represented by any colour as king yellow as above-menti- oned laid thin with moderate quantity of gum in it drab colour is well represented by judicious mixture of umber in its raw state and flake wliite queen ’ brown as it is called is made of burnt roman oker little lamp black and lake with flake white amongst it claret colour may be well represented hy mixture of terra- de-cassel little lamp black and lake the more black and lake the deeper the colour dark brown can be formed by junction of nottingham oker lake and lamp black lilac is made of carmine prussian blue and flake white grey can be formed only of lamp-black flake white and the smallest quantity of lake laid in very thin reddissi brown is best made of indian red very little lamp-black and flake white scarlet for officers pictures is colour very difficult to lay down rules for making as in some pictures it is dange¬ rous to make it too bright for fear of hurting the effect of the face by its brilliancy catching the eye too readily conse- quently if the subject you are painting from life be very pale you run very great risk indeed by annexing very bright scarlet to his picture the management in that point we must therefore leave to the young artist himself to judge of and only mention that very bright scarlet is made of chinese vermilsion and carmine ground together swithout any flake white and if you want it still rendered brighter when it is dry fill your peneil with plain carmine mixed with thin gum water and glaze over it nicely but if on the con- trary you wish to sadden or take away share of its brilliancy add little flake white to it and that will have the desired effect of painting the face in miniature you are first to provide yourself with mahogany delk for painting on which is box about fourteen inches high and foot broad on the top there is to be lid covered with green cloth which is to have pair of small hinges at the front and to lift occasionally with supporting rail at the back and notches so as readily to adjust it to any height you may choose it in the same manner as music desk about the middle of the green cloth there is to be slip of very thin mahogany glewed at each end but the centre of it left free to fasten your ivory by slipping it between tlie mahogany and green cloth 'he next thing vou are to observe is the choice of your light which in this kind of painting can not be too particularly attended to it not leing like oil painting where the rays of the sun may be kept out with blinds without causing any material inconvenience north light or as nearly as possible to it ust be attained if there be more than on window in the room the second must be closed so as to admit no light and the one you sit at is to have green baize curtain against the lower part of it to reach about foot higher than your head as you fit at your painting desk with left hand towards the light place your setter at thie distance of about yard and half from vyou in that point of view by which the shadows will not only have their proper effect in marking the fcatures fo as pleasing one for the young artist may rely on it that no person of any description ever yet sat for likeness but would wisn to have that likeness as favourable as possible this outlines of the face and in this be very particular as much depends on it when you have them drawn cor rectly and that even in such state there appears to vour own eye degree of likeness to the subject sitting for yous begin to lay in the colour faintly of the iris of the eye thel shiadows under the eye-brows in grey teint and under the nose rather warm purple in broad faint washes ever keeping this in your mind that you must in the process the of painting face of miniature picture go on faintly at the beginning and niot hurry in your colours as such conduct will to certaintv inake vour taints look dirty and your picture harsh and dis- having as before observed laid in your grey agrceable teints where your ihadows are to fall go on heightening them by degrees working in hatches with middling full pencil not too wassiy nor too dry as the former would be the means of muddving your colours and the latter would make them raw when you think you have pretty strongly marked out and worked up the shado-ys mix wassi of either gall stone er nottingham oker and drop lake with which faintly go over the fleshy parts of the face where the shadows do not come and then proceed to heighten the carnations on the checks the colour of the beard if any such appears still working in the handling manner as already mentioned in various directions so as that after some time working the intersections appear like so many nice points or dots which appearance in fine pictures leads the inexperieneed artist to imagine that the picture was entirely dotted in and is thereby led into thousand errors and difficulties there is general rule you are to observe that it is much easier to warm the teints of your face than to cool it by working proper colours over it it is therefore adviscable to begin with cool greys and purples and towards the finishing of the picture to add warmth if necessary by gradually working such colours as gall stone terra sienna or the like over in addition to the carmine or lake that may be necessary to produce the teint of nature on the subject of managing the colours in painting miniature it is unnecessary to say any thing more shall therefore onsy advise the amateur or young artist to procure good miniature picture painted by some eminent artist and to closely copy it calling these observations often to his aid an attention to which we dare venture to say will favilitate his improvement instructions for painting in wax crayons painting in wax crayons is an art at present scarcely known and when properly managed produces very pleasing effect it differs very materially from the former stile of instead of pipe clay which is the basis of dry crayons it also hinute drawings and not mouldering away or rubbing off the paper but it requires the assistance of washes in water colours to improve its effects as from the nature of the wax the frequent workings over of the crayons would cause glassiness that would prevent their taking hold in the latter part of the finishing so as to produce the strength required therefore it is to be observed that the water colours are to be used on beginning the picture and in finishing it the crayons to be judicioussy worked on the water colours when they produce the appearance of an elegantly finished stippled engraving coloured in the plate the tooth or grain of the paper catch¬ ing the crayons in dots when worked gradually with light hand in wonderfully pleasing manner we shall now proceed to the instructions which we shall nsed in making the crayons the colours fit to be incorporated with it the choice of paper and the mode of using the crayons the wax proper to be used in making crayons must be bleached bees-wax entirely free from adulteration either by spermaceti or tallow it must not only be pure but likewise of the hardest kind of which the russian wax is the best although in colour not quite so fine as the american or english wax but its hardnefs gives firmness to the crayons and preyents greasiness which softer wax would create following viz for yellows king vellow or yellow oker for nese vermillion for browns umber burnt and uuburnt for blacks lamp black only as to compound teints they are to be produced by judicious management of tlie water-colours over thie crayons and this rule with respect to the colours proper none are fit for the purpose but such as in their dry unmixed state will mark on paper pretty freely for the reader may prevent any hard colour from working that was incorporated with it having procured the kind of wax mentioned vou are to have nice glazed white pipkin perfectly clean and free fromn any greasy particles and having previously ground your colours on flag with your muller perfectly fine in fair water and dried put sinall quantity of wax into the pipkin which you are to place over very slow fire when the wax is entirely dissolved by the gentle heat lfor if it bubbles it is spoiled gradvally sprinle in your colour stirring it with an ivory pen cil handle until you find it perfectly mixed at the same time observing that you do not overload the wax with colbur as it will make the crayons too brittle nor are you to put in too little colour as it makes them faint and work greasy so medium is be observed to ascertain wliich practice only will conduce there are some colours such as vermillion which if it receives too great heat turns black and that must be very cautioussy observed as vermillion in this kind of painting is highly useful colour as is also lamp-black harder kind of crayon from which it is to be made by mixing some of it in its raw state with strong glue letting it unstructions for caleining colours for miniature painting then pulverizing it on your flag and mixing it with vour wax as lent for giving shaip touches in dark parts and for making sketches to refresn the memory is much superior to italian chalk as nothing will cause it to rub or spoil it remain- ing as immoveable as writing ink and working extremely pleasant the paper fit to be used in wax cravon painting must be of the wove or vellum kind but as of this there are several forts it is necessary to mention that it must be of middling fine- ness for if too coarse the grain will catch the cravons in dots so remote from each other as to make your work look unplea- fant and if the paper be too fine it will not catch the cray- ons as it ought but clog your painting without produeing any effect the only rule therefore for choosing your paper is to go to the stationer ’ and taking small piece of soft black crayon in your pocket inquire for wove paper and by gently rubbing the crayon on few sheets of different kinds you will then become judge of what paper is the best for your purpose which experience you will attain without any expence worth nientioning having procured this necessay article to your satis- faction you then proceed to work the desk you are to work on must be much larger than the one mentioned for miniature painting this kind of work being often used for larger sizes than that stile of painting is having your sitter placed in the same manner as pointed out in the treatise on miniature painting with soft piece of charcoal sketch faintly the distances and forms of the features then touch them in more strongly with vour crimson or black crayon still altering until you are perfectly certain you have correct outline which in this kind of painting is absolutely neceffary for if in your fair drawing you commit an error in our outline you never can alter it the crayons being in their nature so adhesive that nothing will remove them having on your first sheet made your outline correct rub the back of tlie face part with crimson crayon thie hair part with suitable coloured one and the drapery if white with black then laying the paper on fair sheet go over the lines of your sketch with tracer when you will transfer in very neat manner vour outline ready to colour in you are then to mark in the seatures of your sitter more strongly with crayon or water-colour and fine pencil ever observing when you nse it to work over with suitable coloured crayon as it is that which will give it the beautiful dotted appearance so much to be admired having marked in the features sufficiently strong to put the likeness out of danger of being spoiled make wasn of yel¬ low oker entirely over the fleshy parts deepening its teint according to your subject wasn in the colour of the eyes lips hair all which being dry work with your different colour crayons on the parts until you produce the effects required silling up any interstices of the crayons with dots of water colours and fine pencil as to the teint for your linen shades the black crayon will produce that in every degree the paper answering for the lights of any coloured drapery for then you are to wash in and shadow it with the crayons your paper is to be perfectly dry otherwise the work will appear glazy but even should that be the case hold it before the fire and the shining appearance will instantly vanisn with respect to vour back grounds as this stile of painting is intended to be light and fketchy sky and back grounds are den prelits aty colour to whatever taint you find pleafing which will give proper value to the appearances of your wax-cravons your drawing either of portrait or landscape being finished have ready large flat board on which you are to stretch sheet of royal paper and having pasted the back of vour drawing with some flour paste mixed with isinglass lay it on the royal paper and carefully prefs it in all directions with soft towel or handkerchief wlien your work is completed of gilding upon glass the art of gilding upon glass which is revival and improvement upon attempts made many years ago is chiefly used for decorating the borders of prints in executing name plates and inscriptions for various purposes as also for orna mental decorations in variety of elegant works with different colbured grounds but as black is the most general one in demand ishall first proceed to treat on that in two ways of performing it you are to procure some of the finest isinglass which vou will distinguissi by holding between you and the light when that which is white and transparent is the best and the contrary is totally unfit for this purpose -you are to dissolve it in very clean water pretty thick and strain it through linen cloth then into tea-cup of very clean milk-warm water put about the size of small pea of the isinglass jelly which let gently incorporate with the water then having your glass that is to be gilt quite clear and free from any dirt or grease get some leaf gold the lefs porous in the beating the better put it on agilding cushion and cutit in pieces sized for the purpose accord- ing to the breadth you want to have your work gilt then touch with hair pencil dipped in the thin isinglass water on the glass and while moist lay on your leaf gold piece by piece until you have the parts you want covered the leaf will instantly adhere to the glass then place it withiin air of the fire in slanting position until it dries which will be in few minutes while it is gently warm take piece of clean cotton wool and rub the gold to the glass smartly until you not only find the superfluous pieces of leaf gold gone but that likewise the back of the part gilt receives kind of polisn then proceed to lap on second coat of gold in the same manner as the first drving it as before and polishing it and so third coat which is full sufficient and to gild properly can be dispensed with then take the size of the print or dra ing which is to be framed and laying it on the gilt part of the glass mark where the corners are to come with hair pencil and some dark colour after which being provided with long wooden ruler and pointed picce of ivory draw two parallel lines out of your gold and with mahogany or deal stick pointed cautioussy work away the superfluous part leaving the gold fillet which is to encompass you picture sharp and neat when if you have mind to ornament it by any other lines to appear black in the centre lay on your ruler and with vour ivory point scribe them and then varnisn having some black japan to which little burnt lamp-black has been added to deepen its colour paint it all over part of your glass and the space between it and the edge then set it to dry which will take place in few hours when you are to lay out the breadth of the black line that is to be inside your gilding seribe it with sharp point and cut away the waste black with graver or some sharp instrument lf you want to cut figures or any kind of ornament out of vour gold after your glass is gilt have drawing of your design on paper at the black of which rub some powdered red chalk and the smallest quantity of fresh butter lay the paper on the gold and with bluntish ivory point go over the lines of the drawing and they will be nicely transferred on tlie gold when vou can with an ivory point trace them from the drawing you have by you and then by mixing any but the most important secret in the glass gilding is in an instant after your glass is blacked taking away the parts where vour gold is to appear and the remainder of the black to stand fast by which means the black gilding work is done in one half the time and with half the gold leaf the process is simple and is thus performed -you are to get the very best black asn baesgieganie pae ervegy egans which you must add very small share of burned lamp-black very finely ground in spirits of turpentine then with large flat varnisn brush give vour glass one even thin coat holding it between you and the light observing that it does not appoar thick dead black but exhibits degree of transparency and not too much so as to prevent its appearing good black at the right side of the glass aster this you are to have your letters or ornaments drawn on paper as before-mentioned and trace it in the same manner on your black varnifh when it is per- fectly dry the drawing will be very critically transferred to the black you are then to get fine needle and fix it in wooden handle firmly with which you are to scribe the out¬ lincs of what black is to come out through the varnisn so as not an edge hangs to the main body of the black then take some thick brown paper dipit in water and squeeze it gently and spread it over the parts of the varnish you want to detach from the glass and in few minutes by raising one edge of tlie black it will all peel away as elean from the glass as if it never was on it in an instant when all the black you want is taken out lay vour glass to the fire and the remaining part of the vamnisn will instantly become hard as ever and ready to have the gold put on the art of dyeing the theory of dyeing is far from being thoroughly known or established though many facts and observations and particular processes have been offered for this purpose we shall collect the principle of them in the sequel of this article the basis of just history of dycing must be theory of light and colours.. two things it may be observed are chiefly aimed at in the enquiry of colours the first to increase the materia tinctoria the second to six those colours we have in order to these it may be remembered that soie colours are afisiarent as those of flowers the juices of fruits and those of animals others are latent and only discovered by the effects which the several species of salts and other things have on them concerning the afsarent colours of vegetables and animals and the effects of different salts in changing them srom one colour to another we have many instances in mr. boyle collected and ranged in new order by dr. lister as that acid salts advance the colours of flowers and berries thus they make the infusions of balaustia or pomegranate-flowers red roses clove-july-flowers mezereon peas-bloom violets and cvanus-flowers of very fine red and the juices of the berries of lirrustrum of black cherries and buckthorn-berries of much fairer red to the same purpose it is observed that acid salts make no great alteration upon the white flowers of jasmine and fnow-drops urinous salts and alcalies on the contrary quite alter the colours of the flowers last named as well as the juices of the berries above mentioned from red to green urinous salts and alcalies advance at least they do not hurt the colours of the juices of vegetable leaves woods and roots thus urinous spirits and alcalies make the vellow infu- sions of madder-roots red of brasil wood purplisn of lig- num nephrilicum blue the red infusion of log-wood purple and that of the leaves of sena red acid salts quite alter the said infusions from red or blue to yellow cochineal which of itself is red upon the infufion of oil of vitriol an acid salt strikes the most vivid crimson that can be imagined and with urinous salts and alcalies it will be again changed into an obscure colour betwixt violet and purple all red blue and white flowers are immediately upon the effusion of an alcali changed to green colour and thence in no long process of time they tunn yellow all the parts of vegetables which are green will in like manner strike yellow with an alkali what flowers are already yellow are not much changed if at all by an alkali or urinous spirit the blue seeds-husks of glastum sylvestre old gathered and dry diluted with water stain blue which upon the effusion of ley strikes green which said green or blue being touched with oil of vitriol dyes purple and all these three colours stand on the tops of the funges tubuloses are certain red knots which upon the effusion of ley will strike purple and stand as for the latent colours in animals and vegetables discovered to us by effusion of salts they likewise are very numerous we will only mention few the milky juice of the lactuca sylvestris costa spinosa fonchus asper lavis upon the effusion of ley will strike vivid flame colour or crimson and after some time quite degenerate into dirty yellow the milk of the cataputia major upon the effusion of ley especially if it be drawn with knife and have anv time stood upon the blade thereof will strike purple or blood- red colour and soon after will change into dull yellow the common hawthorn-caterpillar will strike purple or carnation with ley and stand the heads of beetles primroses will with ley strike the same carnation colour and stand the amber-coloured scolopendra will give with ley most beautiful and pleasant azure or amethystine and stand it remains to be observed that in all the instances above mentioned whether vegetable or animal there is not one colour truly fixed though there may be some use made of them as they are by not truly fixed we mean not proof against salt and fire for what seem to stand and be ley-proof are either wholly destroyed by different salt or changed into much different colour which must needs prove à stain and blemisn when it shall happen in the use of any of them that both the apparent and latent colours of vegetables are fixable an instance whereof we may observe in the seed-hulks of glastum and the use dyers make of the leaves of that plant after due preparation it is probable from the same instance that we may learn from the colour of some part of the fruit or seed what colour the leaves of any vegetable and the whole plant might be made to yield for our use that the latent colours of vegetables are pre-existent and nôt produced from tlie same instance of woad and likewise from this that the milky juice of-lactuca silveris affords of itself red serum that the change of colours in flowers is gradual and con¬ sait that the colours of flowers which will not stand with ley seem to be wholly destroyed by it and irrecoverable thus one part of violet leaf under the affusion of ley is changed very soon into yellow and will never be revived into à red by an acid salt but if anothier part of the same leaf be still green it will be revived the dryness seems to be à means if not of fixing yet of bringing the vegetable colour into condition of not wholly and suddensy perishing by the otherwise destroying alcali that those plants or animals which will strike different yet vivid colours upon the affusion of different salts and stand as the cochineal and glastum are of all others to be reckoned the best many more valuable colours may be drawn from the vege- table kingdom if the world would be at the pains of enquiring more minutely into the properties of plants with respect to the theory of dyeing it is farther to be observed that all the materials wliich of themselves give colour are either red yellow or blue so that out of them and the primitive fundamental colour white all that great variety which we see in dyed stuffs arises that sew of the colouring materials as cochineal soot wood-wax or woad are in their ontward and first appearance of the same colour wliich by the slightest solutions in the weakest menstrua they die upon cloth silk that many of the colour- ing materials will not yield their colours without much grind- ing steeping boiling fermenting or corrosion by powerful menstrua as red wood weld woad arnotto that many of the said colouring materials will of themselves give no colouring at all as copperas or galls or with much disad- vantage unless the cloth or other stuff to be dyed be first covered or incrustated as it were with some other matter though colourless aforehand as madder weld and brazil with alum that some of the colouring materials by the help of other colourless ones do strike different colours from what they would alone and of themselves as cochineal and brazil that some colours as madder indigo and woad by reiterated tinctures will at last become black that though green be the most frequent and ommon of natural colours yet there is no simple ingredient which is now used alone to mye green with upon any material sap-green the condensed juice of the thamnus or buckthorn berry being the nearest and this only used by country people there is no black thing in use wliich dyes black though both the coal and the blacker by how much the matter before it was burnt was whiter as in the famous instance of ivory black the tincture of some dyeing stuffs will fade even with lying or with the air or will stain even with water hut very much with wine vinegar urine some of the dyers niaterials are used to bind and strengthen colour some to brighten it some to give lustre to the stuff some to discharge and take off the colour either in whole or in nart and some out of fraud to make the materials dyed if costly to be heavier sonie dyeing ingredients or drugs by the courseness of their bodies make the thread of the dyed stuff seem coarser and some by shrinking them smaller and some by levigating their asperi- ties finer many of the same colours are dyed upon dif- ferent stuffs with different materials as red-wood is used in cloth not in silk arnotto in silks not in cloth so that they may be dyed at several prices scouring and wassiing of stuffs to be dved is to he done with apptopriate materials as sometimes with ox galls sometimes with fullers earth some- times with soap this latter however is pernitious in some cases where pot-ashes will stain or alter the colour great quantities of stuff are to be dyed together or pieces are very long hroad thick they are to be differ- ently handled both in respect to the vessels and ingredients in some colours- and stuffs the tingent liquor must be boil- ing in other cases only blood-wari in some it may be cold some tingent liquors are fitted for use by long keeping and in some the virtue wears away by the fame some colours or stuffs are best dyed by reiterated dippings ever into the same liquor at several intervals of time and some by con¬ sone cases the mattet of the vessels wherein the liquors are heated and the tinctures prepared must be regarded as that the kettles be peuter for the bow-dye liitle regard is had how much liquor is used in proportion to the dyeing drugs the- liquor being rather adjusted to the bulk of the stuff as the vessels are to thie breadth of the same the quantity of dyeing drugs being proportioned to the colour higher or lower and also to the stuffs as likewise the salts are to thie dyeing drugs concerning the weight which colours give to silks for in them it is most taken notice of as being sold by weiglit and heing commodity of great price it is 'observed that one pound of raw silk loses four ounces by washiing out the gums and natural sordes that the same scowered silk may be raised to above thirty ounces from the remaining- twelve if it be dyed black with certain materials that the reason why black colour may be dyed the heaviest is that all ponderous drugs may be dyed black being all of colours lighter than it whiereàs perhaps there seem to be sen or no materials wherewith to increase the weight ofsilk which will consist with fair light colours such as will having been used as white arsenie to carnations of thines used in dveing. especially black nothing increases weight so much as galls boy means wliereof black silks reco- ver the weight wliich they lost by washiing out their gum nor is ir counted extraordinary that blacks should gain about four or six nunces in the dving unon each pound next to galls old fustie increases the wvight ahout in madder about an ounce in the pound weld half an ounce the blue fat in deep biues of thie sisth stall adds no considerable weight neither do logwond cochincal or aronotto nor even copperas itself where galls are not used slipp adds much to the weight and gives deener black than copperas which af- fords gond exeuse sor thie dyers that use it dying ingredients or the alatcria tinctorin are best re- duced under tvo hieads colorata or those which properly zive the colour and non-colorata used to prepare the stuffs for better taking the dye and to heighten the lustre of the colours as to tlie colouring ingredients colorantia colorata we have iron and steel or what is made from them which are used in dving blacke though how they contribute thereto is not so obvious we know that green oaken hoards become black by the affriction of faw green sour apnle cut with knise turns of the same colour the white grease wlierewith the wheels of tarriages are anointed hecomes likewise hlack by means of the iron boxes wherewith the have is lined and the friction between the nave and the axle-tree and that an ouken stick becomes black by violent friction against other wood in turning-lath and the black colour on earthen-ware is given with scalings of iron vitrified from all which it seems to sullow that the business of blacking lies in tlie iron and particularsy in its ustulation or astriction be this as it will cedieras the most usual ingredient for dring black is the salt of the nyrites wlerewith old iron is incorporated and wlierever this is used some of tlie astringents are to accom- pany it red wood chopped and ground in mill is used for

covered with greenish froth or flower an intense woad-colour is almost black that is of damascene-colour it is tlie foundation of so many colours in different degrees or shades that the dyers have fcale whereby to compute the lightness and depth of this colour indigo is of the like nature and used for the same purpose as woad only that it is stronger logwood chopped and ground yields purplish blue it may be used with alum formerly it was of ill repute as most salse and fading colour but since it has been used with galls it is less complained of the dyeing materials are generally applied in decoctions made in water more or less strong according to the occasion sometimes by only dipping the stuff in the vat of dve some- times by boiling it therein and sometimes by leaving it day or more

menstruum to extract the tingent particles of certain hard drugs or to scower tlie sordes whiich may interpose between the stuff and the die and hinder their due adhesion or to in- tenerate the hairs of wool and heir stuffs that they may better imbibe their colours or to contribute to the colour itself as copperas does to galls in making hlack or juice of lemons to cochineal in carnations or aqua fortis impregnated with pewter in the bow dye or which seems most probable to serve as vinculum between the cloth and the colour as clammy oils and gum waters do in painting alum being sub tance whose aculeated particles dissolved with hot liquors will enter the pores of stuffs and on which the particles of dving drugs will catch though it may also serve another use viz to dry up certain particles which disagree with the colour to be superinduced to which add that it may also serve to brighten colour by incrustating thie stuff to be dyed with its crystals on which the dye coming to be applied has finer effect than if it were applied on fcabrous matter such as an unalumed cloth is bran and bran-water whose flower entering the pores of the stuff levigates its suiface and thus renders tlie

we shall only treat of few which are most importanit dyeing of cloths serges druggets and other woollen mannsactues with respect to black in cloths and stufts of price it is begun with strong decoction of woad and indigo which gives deep blue the use assigned for this blue ground is that tlie dloth having already considerable body of colour may require dels of tlie blackening materials and consequently he leis wekened than if it was dved directly from white to black besides blue is essential to the produc- tion of the black dye for without either blue ground or blue superadded to tlie vitriol and galls no other than brown dyes are obtained logwood is the material which anlds black- ness to tlie various shades of brown produced by vitriol and gall and this black dye though not of tle most durable kind is the most common on blue cloth good black may be dyed by vitiiol and galls alone but even here an addition of logwood contributes much to improve thie colour hundred pounds of woollen cloth dyed first to deep blue require for the black dye about five pounds of vitriol five of galls and thirty of lugwood the galls beaten into moderately fine powder and uied up in bag are boiled for little time in copper of water sufficienily for working the cloth in the blued clothi after being steeped in river water and drained is in this state put iuto tlie boiling decoction of the galls and kept turning therein for two hours or more the bag of galls being now and then squcezed in order to extract their virtues the log- wood being rasped and shaved into small chips or pulverized is boiled in another copper for several hours and this liquor is usually prepared considerable time before it is used as its colour improves by keeping when this liquor is made of scalding heat the vitriol is thrown into it and as soon as it is dissolved the galled cloth is put in boiling heat should never be used after the vitriol is added to the liquor because it would augment thie corrosive power of the salt and impair the beauty of the colour by hastily extricating part of the ferru- ginous matter of the vitriol in an ochery form before it can come sufficiently in contact with the astringent substance with which the cloth is impregnated the cloth is continually turned about in the liquor and occsiaonally taken out and aired which operation contributes to secure the colour after two hours continuance in the dye the cloth having received good black is taken out washed with cold water and paf- sed through the fulling-mill supersine cloth is fulled three times witli warm solution of soap by which the superfluous colour is discharged and the cloth softened tlie cloth is improved neither in beauty nor durableness of colour by being repeatedly passed through the dyeing liquor or by increasing the quantity of ingredients first used after it has once -quired full black colour our dyers use small quantity of verdi- gris for some of the sunerfine black cloths but this is more frequently used by the french simple greys which are no other than-shades of black are dyed nearly in the same manner as the ’ full blacks only by using à less proportion of the dyeing ingredients or continuing the cloth in the liquor for à shorter time these simple greys are dyed from white cloth without any previous ground of blue or other colours there are also multitude of compound greys and browns produced from cloth dyed blue red yellow brown or of colours compounded of these by darkening them with the black dye scarlet is dyed with kermes and cochineal with which may also be used agaric and arsenic crimson scarlet is given with cochineal mastich aqua fortis sal ammoniac sublimate and spirit of wine violet scarlet purple amaranth and pansy-scarlets are given with

fustic here is forbid as false colour the artist ’ assistant part ii of drawing drawing is the art of representing by outlines and shadows the various productions of nature and art and of enlarging and contracting objects in the most exact propor- tion this art recals to our memory things long since past and rescues from oblivion the deeds of our illustrious ancestors at the same time that it revives their image in our mind by pre- serving their features for many generations in short it may be said to be the silent but most expressive language of nature which speaks to the eye is understood by all nations and conveys an idea where even words themselves would prove deficient after giving some general directions for the attainment of this truly polite and rational amusement which is the basis on which all the rest of the arts depend we shall con- sider it more particularly under the following heads and lay down the most copious and intelligible rules for each respectively viz copying of draughts-enlarging and contracting-imitation of life-drapery-landscasie-light and shade-history the implements necessary for drawing are- ruler com- passes charcoal black-lead pencil penknife port-crayons black white and red chalk crayons indian ink crow-quill pens camel ’ -hair pencils fitches paper of several forts and porte-solios general rules for drawing the first thing to be observed is the choice of proper ori- ginals and here we would recommend le clerc ’ principles of drawing as the easiest and best calculated for the instruction of beginners this may be had price at most of the booksellers in great britain having provided this begin with the outlines of the several features as the eyes nose mouth cars as they occur in the book pactise these often over till you are quite master of them then proceed to profile or side face after that to an oval or full face always remembering that each of these must be perfectly attained before you venture to proceed further when vou can copy face correctly the next thing is to draw the several limbs or parts of the body as the hands arms legs feet then go to the body itself which having done you will be able to undertake whole figure observing care- fully the exact proportions and bearings of one part with the other the learner ought to be particularly cautious that he does not attempt whole figure before he has made himself master of the several parts for this is beginning his work at the wrong end and is almost similar to man attempting to raise build¬ ing without foundation as for beasts birds plants we deem it useless to give directions for drawing them as it is well known that he who has so far improved his ideas as to be able to draw human figure cotrectly will find it no difficulty to perform every other branch of this art sketch or draw all your outlines faintly with piece of soft charcoal swhich may be knoin by the pith in the middle cut to point like pencil and when vou see any thing amiss whisk it out with handkerchief or feather correct your errors with black lead pencil and compare your work with the original till every part of them correspond this done finifh your outlines with black lead or indian ink this ad- vice properly attended to will save you an infinite deal of trouble in drawing over and over again to your no small disconragement if you prefer indian ink rub it with water upon marble and with crow-quill pen perfect your outlines then rub out the marks of the pencil with bread keep three or four dif- ferent shades of ink in the hollows of your stone to distinguish your distances reserving one of the holes for water when vou are thoroughly versed in the outlines your next business will be to learn to shadow but of this hercafter under thie articles of light and shade be not too hasty at first setting out which will but impede your progress and hinder your improvement whereas by bestowing litile more time you will attain perfection sooner than you can well imagine and expedition will come of itself as you become more experienced of cohying of draughts when you would copy print or drawing exactly of the same size rub the back of it with the dust of red chalk or black lead lay this upon your paper and pin it down at the four corners then with blunt point trace the outlines and breadths of the shadows which done having carefully ex- amined it to see that nothing be omitted take it off and finish it with the pencil or pen another way to make an exact copy and at the same time to preserve the original is to lay piece of transparent paper upon it and draw the outlines thereon with black lead pen¬ cil then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon place piece of thin post paper reddened or blackened at the back after which proceed to trace and finish it accord- ing to the foregoing rule lf you would reverse your original you need only turn the transparent paper with the drawing you have made upon it downwards upon the post paper and trace it as above of enlarging and contracting divide your original with pair of compasses into any num- ber of squares and rule them across with black lead pencil from side to side and from top to bottom then having your paper of the size vou intend divide it into the same number of squares either bigger or less as you enlarge or contract it place your original before you and draw square by square the several parts observing to make the part you are drawing fall into the same part of the square as it does in your original to prevent mistakes number the squares both of the original and copy then outline it with indian ink rub out the marks of the pencil with bread and shade it at pleasure of imitation of life let the person you draw after be of proportionable size and well shaped place him in the easiest and most natural at- titude then with your charcoal sketch faintly the head or any of the limbs separately which having carefully done pro- ceed to finisn with your pencil when you have sufficiently practised the several parts or limbs you may draw the whole figure in whatever attitude you think proper to place it beginning with the easiest and proceeding by degrees to the more difficult postures as time and experience shall enable vou be sure to finish your ontline so correctly marking all the muscles as they occur that even before you give it any shadow it may have some resemblance of the person the true proportion which one part of human figure bears to another will be seen in the figure you draw from which may serve as standard to examine your drawing by except where the figure is to be fore-shortened in which case nature will be the best guide in drawing of likeness care must be taken to express the passions in the most lively manner which is to be done by observing the peculiar cast and disposition of every feature with the exactest nicety and as this is of all the parts of draw¬ ing by far the most difficult it will require more than ordi¬ nary attention and should be last attempted of drapery drapery is the art of cloathing your figures with elegance and propriety when your naked figure is outlined first draw the outlines of the draperv lightly then the greater folds and afterwards the lesser observing never to let them crofs each other particular regard is to be had to the quality of the drapéry as the folds of stuff or woollen cloth are more abrupt and harsh and those of silk more slowing and easy linen cam- brick ganze as their substance is lighter than either re- quire à still greater delicacy in expressing the waving of the folds by the faintness of their shadows the drapery should not stick too close to the body but must seem to flow round as it were yet in such manner as that the motion of the figuie may be fiee and easy great lightness and motion of the drapery slinuld only be used when the sigures are supposed to he in iuch agitation or exposed to the wind hut in calm place and fice from violent action their drapery should be large and flowing in order to give them more graceful appearance let the loose parts of the drapery blown by the wind all flow one way and draw that part which lies closost to the body before vou draw those which sly off suit your garments to the body and make them bend with it the closer the garment sticks to the body the narrower and smaller must be the folds and if it fits quite close there will be no folds at all but must only have faint shadow to re- pesent the part of tlie body which lies under it by observing diligently in what manner the drapery flows upon any person standing or sitting before you for that purpose you will ’ see in what manner do dispose your folds and shadows according to the unerring rule of nature of landscahe landscape represents the face of the country as it appears to our view with all the vatious objects analogous tlereto as towns castles churches houses trees hiills cattle rivers rocks be careful to augment or lessen every object according to its distance making the most remote object fainter and lefs- distinct as they appear to the eye and enlarging them pro¬ portionably as they draw nearer shew the sky cloudy or clear as occasion requires and if you introduce the sun let it be rifing or setting either of which representations will give an additional grace to your picture as they represent nature in its liveliest and most agree- able appearance adapt every part of your landscape to the season of the year and the time of the day vou intend it to represent and dispose your lights and shades with consistent propriety lastly we would recommend it to practitioners in this noble art to rise early in fine morning that they may have better idea of the harmony and beauty of the works of the great creator which would wonderfully replenissi their minds as to colour and effect of light and shade the true distribution of light and shade in picture is abso lutely necessary to be known as it not only determines the proper distance of one object from another without which the whole would be an undistinguishable mafs of confusion but it gives likeness to each respective object its substance roundness and effect shadowing is performed with the pen or peneil in either of which great judgment is required having made vour outlines correct the first thing is to ob- serve from which side of the original the light comes in which if natural is either from the right hand or left for whenever the light appears in the middle of the picture and seems to glare more than ordinary it is caused by candle lamp or some other luminous bodr which is called an artificial light lay on your little tints first disposing them as you see they are done in the original and then proceed to the deeper ones till you come to the darkest parts of all for yon may at any time darken your shadows when you can not lighten them let all vour shadows in the same place fall on the same side that is if the right side of man ’ face be dark so must the right side of his body arm leg thigh but if the light side be darkened by the opposition of some other body inter- cepting the light it must receive contrary shadow make vour shadows fainter as they grow towards the light breaking them gradually that they may not appear too sudden orharsh if you shade with black lead or with crayons vou may blend your shadows and soften them one into another as you require with stump made of paper or glove leather rolled and tied hard and cut almost to the point with which vou may also weaken your shades where they are too strong when part of the body projects over or before anothers the part projecting must receive stronger light those parts that bend inward must be made so much the darker and sha- dowed deepest next the light two equal lights must never be made in the same picture the strongest light should fall upon the middle of the piece where the principal figures ought to stand diminishing gra¬ dually towards the extremities by frequently examining into nature vou will have an op- portunitv of improving your ideas of light and shade and will be enabled to form proper judgment of the effect which the different rays or degrees of light will produce in picture for which reason you should never let slip an opportunity of re- marking the various appearances you meet with of history this branch of drawing presents to our view tlings past present and future an historical picture must describe the transactions repre- sented in manner so clear and conspicuous as to convey an idea of it to our minds as fully as could be done by ver- hal description and care must be taken to preserve such ana- logy or connection between the figures that not one may seem to be introduced but for some end or purpose and as in dramatie writing it is essential to make every person speak consistently with the part he represents so here it will be equally necossary to observe the same propriety of character and make every figure look the sentiment it is intended to express of perspective perspective is the art of delineating oljects as they appear in nature upon plain surface according to their distance and height perpendicular to the horizon between the object and the eye this art is of great consequence to those who would excel in drawing etching engraving carving in bas-relief or paint- ing for being well understood the artist will be enabled to know when to adhere to the strictest rules and when to depart from them with propriety exhlanation of the terms used in pershective base or fundamental line is the bottom line of the draw- ing on which the person is supposed to stand with his face towards the point of sight perpendicular is à line drawn upright with respect to any part of the base parallel lines are lines equidistant from each other as the horizon to the bafe horizon is the most distant part of plain where the clouds seeming to touch the earth limit the sight the ho¬ rizontal line gives the height of the eye for we can not see any thing above the horizon which does not exceed this height yet the summit of mountain may be above the horizon though its foot be far beneath it point of sight is that pait of the horizontal line where all the visual rays centre in point visual rays are beams of light conveying the likeness of any object to the eye or sight and the knowledge thereof to the mind or understanding point of distance are supposed points set off on the hori- zontal line at equal distances on each side the point of sight diagona diogonel lines are those drawn from the points of distance to the extremities of the base line abridgment of the square is the line where the diago- nals intersect or crofs the visual rays and must always run parallel to the base it is only made where the sight is limited by perpendicular as the farther end of church hall room and supposing person to stand thereon parallel line drawn through the point of sight will seem to pafs through the eyes and will consequently shew what height that person ought to be¬ point of direct view this is nothing more than the front view of house church or in other words geo- metrical elevation raised from plan or ground plot and comprehending an equal space on both sides of the point of sight point of oblique view is when we see the object side- ways or aslant example suppose person was to draw view of canal with some remarkable building he is desirous the shew more distinct he must place himself on the base or fundamental line opposite to that building that the ray of light may be more oblique by which means the admired building will be less foreshortened and appear to greater ad- vantage the points of sight being still before him though not in the middle of the picture accidental points are those where objects end in the horizontal line but neither in the points of sight or distance and serve for streets houses chairs roads which take different directions as for example suppose street leading to the point of sight and from it two others branch the one on the right hand the other on the left and take different direction these two last streets make what we call accidental points terminating in some part of tlie horizontal line on each side of the point of sight the same is to be observed in grove park where the walk you are in directs imme- diately to the point of sight and the avenues branching out on either side terminats also in different parts of the horizon lchnography is the plan or ground plot of any object that is to be raised in perspective scenography is the art of bringing any thing raised in per- spective from an ichnographic plan to its due proportion ac- cording to the distance in which it is placed that all objects may be diminished according to their distance in picture in the same degree as they are diminished by distance in na- tural prospect scenographic view may be either direct or oblique of etching etching is method of working on copper wherein the lines or strokes instead of being cut with graver are eaten with aqua fortis this art being executed with greater case and freedom than engraving represents curious subjects better and more agree- ably to nature as landscapes ruins and small faint or remote objects buildings the principal inaterials for this art are the plate hard and soft ground the first for winter and the other for summer dabber turpentine varnish lamp black soft wax and aqua fortis the tools are an oil rubber burnisher scraper hand vice etching boards esching needles an oil stone and parallel ruler the plate may be had of any size and well polisned fit for use of the copper-smiths in london directions for laying the ground having provided yourself with plate of the size of the print or drawing you intend to copy rub it well with an oil rubbert mde van hie rsl ien eos rob it vel wien an on charcoal used in polishing it entirely disappear then wiping off the dirty oil with linen rag dip vour singer in some clean oil and touch it over every part of the plate after which with your burnisher polisn the plate till you can see your face in it and in case any sand-hole flaws appear the scraper will assist you in taking them out the marks left by the scraper are to be taken out by the burnisher till nothing appear having fixed your hand-vice at one end of the plate with rag and whiting clear the plate carefully from grease then heat it over charcoal fire or lighted paper till it will melt the ground which is to be laid on thinly and dabbed all over with the dabber till it is persectly smooth and even then warm the plate again and holding it up with the ground downwards smoke it all over with large candle taking care that the snuff of it do not touch the ground and waving the candle continually over every part so that the ground may not be burnt by heating it more in one place than another if the plate be large you may bind four penny candles to- gether directions for tracing the first thing to be done swhile the plate is cooling after the ground is laid is torub the back of your print or drawing all over with bit of rag or cotton dipt in the scrapings of red chalk and shake off the loose dust or wipe it off gently with clean rag place the red side upon the plate making it fast at eaeh corner witha little bit of foft wax lay your etching- board under your hand to prevent bruising the ground then with blunt etching-needle trace lightly the outfines and breadths of the fhadows till the marks of them appear apon the ground which you must take care not to penetrate by tracing too hard as great nicety is required in this part of your work it will be necessary now and thon to lift up one corner of your origi- nal and examine whether every part be traced before you take it off as it will be extremely difficult to lay it down again in na¬ former pofition directions for etching having carefully traced your original take it off and lay silk or linen handkerchief next the plate and over that your etching-board then proceed to the etching for which ob- serve the following directions which are adapted to every par- ticular branch as landscapes shipping portraits history ar- chitecture distances in landscapes or the faint parts of any other pic- ture are the first to be done and these are to be worked closer and with sharpet pointed needle the darker parts must be etched wider and with blunter needle but to prevent mistakes the needles may be marked according to their different degrees and the uies for which they are intended as for the very faintest parts of all they are to be left for tlie graver or dry needle of which hereafter ruler till frequent practice enables you to do them well enough without the needles may when necessary be whetted upon your oil-stone keeping them turning in your hand so as to whet them equally all round the oil-stone will be further useful in whetting the scraper which is to be rubbed flat upon the stone and with steady hand keeping vil constantly upon the stone of biting or eating in the work with aqua fortis pirst examine your work carefully to see that nothing be omitted and if any scratches appear upon the ground or mis¬ takes be committed in the etchings they are to be stopped out which is done by covering them with mixture of lamp-black and varnish laid on thinly with hair pencil which when dry will resist the aqua fortis but it will be best to stop out these as they occur to you in the course of you work for by this means they will be less liable to escape your notice and when the varnish is dry you may etch over it again if required the next thing is to inclose the work with rim or border of soft green or other coloured wax about half an inch high bending the wax in the form of spout an one corner to pour off the aqua fortis and that it may not run out at any other part take care to lay you wax so close to the plate that no vacancies be left your aqua fortis must be single and if too strong as will be seen in the biting take it off and mix it with little water shaking them together in bottle and when by often using it becomes too weak it may be strenghened by mixing it in bottle with little double aqua fortis the bottle which contains the aqua fortis should have large mouth and glass stopple let the aqua fortis lie on the plate fhort time wiping off thie bubbles as they arise with feather which may remain upon the plate while it is biting after which take it off and wash the plate with water and then let it dry by scraping off part of the ground from the faintest part of the work try if it be bit enough and if not stop out the part you have tried with the lamp-black and varnish and when that is dry pour on the aqua fortis again when the faint parts of your work are bit enough stop them out and proceed to bite the stronger parts stopping them out as occasion requires till the whole work is suffici- ently bit then warm the plate and take off the soft wax after which heat the plate till the ground melts pour on little oil and wipe the whole off with rag when the ground is taken off rub the work well with the oil-rubber and wipe the plate clean then proceed to finish it with the graver according to the following directions of engraving the tools necessary for engraving are the oil-rubber bur- nissier scraper oil-stone needles and ruler alrcady mentioned to be used in etching also gravers compasses and sand-bag gravers are of two forts square and lozenge three of each sort should be provided fhe first is used in cutting the broader strokes the other for the fainter and more delicate no graver should exceed the length of five inches and half the handle included excepting the strait lines the sand-bag or cushion is used to lay tlie plate on for the conveniency of turning it about the oil-stone must be of the turkey sort of whetting and temhering the graver as great pains are required to whet the graver nicely par- ticularly the belly of it care must be taken to lay tlie two angles of the graver which are to be held next the plate flat upon tlie stone and rub them steadily till they are polished like mirror and till the belly rises gradually above the plate as that when you lay the graver flat upon it you may just perceive the light under the point otherwise it will dig into the coppet and it will be impossible to keep apoint or execute thie work with freedom in order to this keep your right arm close to your side and place the fore-finger of vour left hand upon that part of the graver which lies uppermost on the stone when this is done in order to wliet the face place the flat part of the handle in the hollow of your hand with the belly of the graver upwards upon moderate slope and rub the extremity or face upon the stone till it has an exceeding sharp point which vou may try upon your thumb-nail the oil- stone wliile in use must never be kept without oil when the graver is too hard as is usually the case when first bought and may be known by the frequent breaking of the point the method of tempering the steel is as follows heat poker red hot and hold the graver upon it within half an inch of the point waving it to and fro till the steel changes to light straw colour then put the point into oil to cooi or hold the graver close to the flame of candle till it be of thie colour and cool it in the tallow but be careful either way not to hold it too long sor then it will be too soft and in this case the point which will then turn blue must be broken off and whetted afresn and tempered again if re- quired but be not too hasty in tempering for sometimes little whetting will bring it to good condition of holding the graver cut off that part of the handle which is upon the same line with the belly or sharp edge of the graver making that side flat that it may be no obstruction hold the handle in the hollow of your hand and extend- ing vour fore-finger towards the point let it rest upon the back of the graver that you guide it flat and parallel with the plate take care that vour fingers do not interpose between the plate and the graver for they will prevent you from carrying the graver level with the plate and from cutting your strokes so clean as they ought to be directions for engraving let the table or board vou work at be firm and steady upon which place your sand-bag with the plate upon it and holding the graver as above directed proceed to business in thie following manner for straight strokes hold your plate firm upon the sand-bag with your left hand moving your right hand forwards lean¬ ing lighter where the stroke should be fine and harder where you would have it broader for circular or crooked strokes hold the graver stedfast moving your hand or the plate as you see convenient learn to carry your hand with such- sleight that you may end your stroke as finely as you began it and if you have occasion to make one part deeper or blacker than an- other do it by degrees and that you may do it with greater exactness take care that your strokes be not too close nor too wide in the course of your work scrape off the barb or rough- ness which arises with the belly of your graver but be care- ful in doing this not to scratch the plate and that vou may see your work properly as you go on rub it with the oil-rubber and wipe the plate clean which will take off the glare of the copper and shew what you have done to the best advantage any mistakes or scratches in the plate may be rubbed out with the burnisher and the part levelled with the scraper polishing it again afterwards lightly with the burnisher having thus attained the use of the graver according to the foregoing rules you will be able to finish the piece you had etched by graving up the several parts to the colour of the original original beginning as in the etching with the fainter parts and advancing gradually with the stronger till the whole is completed the dry needle so called because not used till the ground is taken off tlie plate is principally employed in the extreme light parts of water sky drapery architecture for your first practice copy such prints as are openly fhaded the more finished ones being too difficult till you have gained farther experience to prevent any obstructions from too great à degree of light we would recommend the use of sashi made of transparent fan paper pasted on ftame and placed sloping at convenient distance between your work and the light this will not only preserve the sight but when the sun shines can not possibly be dispensed with of mezzotinto-scraping this art which is of late date is recommended to the practice of the ingenious reader for the amazing ease with which it is executed especially by those who have any notion of drawing mezzotinto prints are those which have no etching or strokes of the graver but whose lights and ihades are blended together and appear like drawing of indian ink the materials used in this art are the copperplate oil-stone grounding tools scrapers bur- nisher and needles directions for laying the mezzotinto ground mark off upon the bottom of the plate the distance you intend to leave for the writing coat of arms then laying vour plate with piece of swanskin flannel under it upon your table hold the grounding-tool in you hand perrpendicu larly lean upon it moderately hard continually waving your hand in right line from end to end till you have wholly co vered the plate in one direction next crofs the strokes from side to side afterwards from corner to corner working the tool each time all over the plate in every direction almost like the points of compass taking ass possible car not to let the tool cut in one direction twice in place this done the plate will be full or in other words all over rough alike and would if it were priuted appear completely black having laid the ground take the scrapings of black chalk and with piece of rag rub it over tlie plate or you may with two or three candles smoke it as before directed for etching now take vour print or drawing and having rubbed the back with red chalk dust mixed with white lake proceed to trace it as before directed directions for whetting the grounding tool lf tooth of the tool should break it may be perceived in the working by particular streak or gap which will appear in the ground in straight line in which case the tool must be whetted on the back holding it sloping and in circular manner like the bottom of the tool directions for scraping the picture take blunt needle and mark the outlines only then with scraper scrape off the lights in every part of the plate as clean and as smooth as possible in proportion to the strength of the lights in your picture taking car not to hurt you out lines and that you may the better see what you do with the thumb and fore-finger of the left hand hold piece of trans- parent paper sloping just over your right hand and you will soon be à judge of the different tints of the work you are doing scraping off more or less of the ground as the dif- ferent strengths of light and tints require the use of the burnisher is to soften or rub down the ex treme light parts after the scraper is done with such as the tip of the nose forehead linen which might otherwise when proved rather appear misty than clear another method used by mezzotinto-scrapers is to etch the outlines of the original as also of the folds in drapery marking the breadth of the shadow by dots which havingbit of pro per colour with aqua fortis according to the directions before given take off the ground used in etching and having laid the mezzotinto ground proceed to scrape the picture as above four or five days before you think the plate will be ready for proving notice must he given to the rolling-press printer to wet some french paper as no other will do for this work and as that time is necessary for it to lie in wet when the proof is dry touch it with white chalk where it should be lighter and with black chalk where it should be darker and when the print is re-touched proceed as before for the lights and for the shades use small grounding-tool as much as you judge necessary to bring it to the proper colour and when you have done as much as you think expedient prove it again and so proceed to prove and touch till it is entirely to your mind when the plate tarnissies in the part where you are at work little vinegar and salt kept by you in phial will take it off wiping it dry with clean rag avoid as much as poffible over scraping any part before the first proving as by this caution the work will appear more elegant of painting upon glass painting upon glass is an art which has generally ap- peared difficult yet there is no representation can be more elegant than that of picture done well in this manner for it gives all the softnefs that can be desired in picture and is easy to work as there are no outlines to draw nor any shade to make but the colours are put on without the trouble of either the pictures are those done in mezzotinto for their shades being rubbed down on the glass the several lines which re- present the shady part of any common print are by this means blended together and appear as soft and united as in drawing of indian ink provide such mezzotintos as vou like cut off the margin then get piece of fine crown glass the size of your print as flat and free from knots or scratches as possible clean the glass and lay some venice turpentine quite thin and smooth on one side thereof with brusn of hog ’ hair lay the print flat in water and let it remain on the surface till it sinks ’ tis then enough take it carefully out and dab it between somc papers that no water may be seen yet so as to be damp next lay the damp print with its face uppermost upon flat table then holding the glass over it without touching the turpentine till it is exactly even with the print let it fall gently on press tlie glass down carefully with your fingers in several parts so that the turpentine may stick to the print after which take it up then holding the glass towards you press the print with your fingers from the centre towards the edges till there be no blisters remaining when this is done wet the back of your print with sponge till the paper will rub off with your fingers then rub it gently and the white paper will roll off leaving the impres- sion only upon the glass then let it dry and with camel ’ hair pencil dipt in oil of turpentine wet it all over and it will be perfectly transparent and fit for painting colours prosier for painting upon glass the several sorts of colours ground in oil for this purpose and tied up in bladders may be had at all the capital colour- shops in manchester whitesflake white podium blacks-lamp black ivory black brouns-spaniss brown umber reds.- rose pink vermillion red lead indian red lake cinnabar vellowsenglish pink masticot english oker spruce blues-blue bice prusfian blue saunder ’ blue smalt greens-verdigrease terra vert verditer the ultramarine for blue and the carmine for red are rather to be bought in powders as in that case they are less apt to dry or be lost and as the least touch of these will give the picture cast mix up what you want for present use with drop or two of nut-oil upon your pallet with your pallet- knife the pallets and knives may be had at most of the colour- shops and ivory turners to get the colour out of the bladders prick hole at the bottom of each and press it till you have enough upon you pallet for present use because the colours are apt to dry and skin over then lay sheet of white paper upon the table and taking the picture in your left hand with the turpentine side next you hold it sloping the bottom resting on the white paper and all the outlines and tints of the print will be seen on the glafs and nothing remaitis but lay on tlie colours proper for the different parts as follow the method of using the colours as the lights and shades of your picture open lay the lighter colours first on the lighter oarts of your print and the darker over the shaded parts and having once laid on the brighter co- lours it is not material if the darker forts are laid à little over them for the first colour will hide those laid on afterwards rads -- lay on the first red lead and shade with lake or carmine yellous-the lightest yellow laid on first may be shaded with dutch pink blues-—-blue bice or ultramarine used for the lights may be shaded with indigo greens-lay on verdigrease first and then mixture of that and dutch pink this green may be heightened by an addition of dutch pink when any of these colours are too strong they may be lightened to any degree by mixing white with them upon your pallet or you may darken them as much as vou please by mixing them with deeper shade of the same colour the colours must not be laid on too thick but if trouble- some thin them before you use them with little turpentine take care to have pencil for each colour and never-use that which vou have used for green or for any other colour without washing it first well with turpentine oil as that colour is apt to appear prédominant when the colours are dry wasn all the pencils after using in turpentine oil your glass when painted must stand two or three days free from dust before it be framed of painting in crayons rayons are to be had in boxes every colour parti- tioned off separately to prevent their mixing the best are those of switzerland the different colours are white black yellow orange red purple blue green and brown and each of these have their several shades excepting the two first directions for using them the paper to be used on this occasion is rough venice paper of white-brown colour and the stiffer the better that fort called cape paper is found to-be the best because upon that the colours best distribute themselves by this me- thod figures may be drawn in their proper colours as they ap- pear pear to the eye because the colôurs may be matched with the crayons and the crayons being dry will not alter their colour but the colours when wet appear deeper than when dry wliich is apt to deceive voung beginner another way to make the necessary preparations is to take some of the tliickest and smoothest light-blue or othes paper and get straining frame from frame-maker ’ of carpenter ’ on which strain some coarse scotch or lrish cloth drawing and fastening it withi small tacks round the edges till it be quite smooth after which with sponge and fair water gently wet the blue paper and then with brush or rag paste the paper all over and lay it carefully on the cloth exactly even with the straining-frame after which take it up and laying white paper on the table place the blue paper downwards with one hand keeping the straining-frame steady and with the other keep the cloth close to the paper do this very caresullys and taking it up lay it on the table with the blue paper up¬ wards and piece of paper under your hand and rub it close to the straining-frame without touching any other part then let it stand to dry after which set it on an easal which mnay be had at the colour shops and proceed as follows make the first sketch or rough draught with charcoal then with black white or red chalk correct wliat you see amiss the outline being thus completed rub in your crayons ac- cording to their proper colours and then with your finger

hand and to keep your work clean as well as to try your colours upon also large brush called fitch to wipe off the dust when vour colours are dry lay your colours on but thinly at first deepening and mellowing them by degrees as you see occasion the quioker you lay them on the evener and cleaner your drawing will appear take care to preserve all your colours from dust and be fore you use them wipe your shells and pallet every time with fitch when you have done your work or would lay it aside he careful to wasn out your pencils in warm water for face painting mix up little carnation or flesh-colour with gum-water in shell by itself if it be for fair com plexion mix vermillion and white flake together and for swarthy one after the form of litile masticot or english oker both let your flesh colourbe always lighter than the complexion you would paint for by working on it you may bring it to its true colour in large shell or upon your pallet lay your different shades of flesn colour at convenient distance from each other and always have ready à sufficient quantity of white to lighten your shades for the checks and lips use mixture of lake and red lead or carmine as occasion requires and for blue tints as under the eyes and in veins indigo or uitramarine and white for grey faint shadows use white english oker sometimes masticot for deep shadows white englisn oker umber for darker shadows lake and pink which makes good fleshy colour in colouring landscapes at fiist only lay dead colours all over the piece leaving no part uncovered and be not over curious in this part of the performance but rather use à maf- terly freedom and the work though seeminglv rough to the eye will have good effect when placed at distance let not the roughness of the colour discourage you for it is easy to be softened by degrees with the other shadows observing only to sweeten and heighten them according as the light falls in some places lay on strong touches and in those places bring your work up together to an equal roundness and strength tempering and sweetening your colours with sharper peneil than the first than the lumps or harsh ridges be left but that all your shadows may be dispersed soft and smooth gliding gentlv as it were into one another you are not to finish any part before the other but work up all the parts gradually alike till you see nothing wanting to complete vour picture having laid vour dead colours begin first with the lightest parts as the sky sun-beams then the yellowish beams which are to be done with masticot and white next the blue- ness of the sky with ultramarine or smalt alone for purple clouds only mix lake and wlite making your colours deeper as they go upwatds from the horizon except in tempestuous skies the tops of distant mountains must be worked so faint that they may seem to lose themselves in air bring your colours forward as your distance decreases painting your first ground next the horizon downwards of bluish sea-green and as you advance forward of reddisni or darker green till you come to the fore-ground itself which as it is to be the darkest part of all do with dark green shaded with dark brown or yellow which rule of shadow will also serve for the trees on each respective ground all distant objects are to be iade imperfect as they appear to the eye as has been already observed under the article of light and shade in colouring trees boughs and branches touch in all the darker shades first raising the lighter leaves above the darker by adding masticot to the dark green which may be made with bice pink and indigo for the uppermost of all which are to be done last touch lightly the extremeties of the leaves with little green masticot and white and set off the darkest shadows with sap-green and indigo these rules are adapted to general appearances but the learner may deviate from them as nature shall dictate with regard to drapery fruit flowers and other branches of painting the best observations are to be taken from the objects themselves or the most curious and exact representa- receipts for those who paint in water colours to make gum water dissolve one ounce of pure white gum arabic and half an ounce of double-refined sugar in quart of spring water strain it through fine sieve or piece of muslin and bottle it off for use keeping it free fromdust another way take some gum arabic of the whitest sort bruise it and tie it up in piece of woollen cloth and steep it in spring water in glass or earthen vessel till the whole be dissolved if it be too stiff add more water and if too thin more gum with this water you may temper most of your colours using such quantity that being touched when dry the colour will not come off if the colour shine there is too much gum in it to keep the flies from your work when you have made your gum-water according to either of the foregoing directions add thereto little coloquinida which will preserve your work when exposed from being spoiled by the flies te make liquid gold for vellum-painting fans grind the finest leaf gold with strong gum-water very fine adding as you grind it more gum-water as you see necessary when vou have ground it as fine as you can wash it in large shell then temper it with little mercury sublimate bind it in the shell with little dissolved gum shake and spread it equally all over the shell and use it with fair water only to make liquid silver for the fame purhiose the process for this is the same with that of liquid gold only observing in the using it to temper it with glare of eggs instead of water to make the glare of eggs take the whites and beat them with spoon till they all rise in foam let them stand all night and they will be cla- rified into good glare to recover liquid-silver that has contracted rust if your silver by length of time or bad weather become rusty cover that part of your work with juice of garlick which will effectually recover it to keep the colours from sinking boil four ounces of roch allum in pint of spring water tillit is thoroughly dissolved then silter it through brown pa¬ per and keep it for use before you lay on your colours take sponge and wet the back of vour paper with this water while it is hot this will not only prevent the colours from sinking but will also give them an additional beauty and lustre and preserve them from fading if your paper is not good it must be washied three or four times with this water drying it every time if your prints are to be varnished wash them all over with white starch before you begin to lay on your colours to make size for painting scenes and other candle-light pieces steep quarter of pound of the cuttings of white glove leather in water for some tine then take them out and boil them in three quarts of water till it wastes to pint and strain it through cloth into an earthen pan when the size is cold if it feel firm under your hand it is strong enough you may prepare any colours in this size while it is warm and it will take off the glare which would appear upon them by candle- light if mixed with gum water to recover coloars when decayed rosemary and with few drops of it temper your colours which however dead and faded will recover their bloom and brilliance this water or spirit will prevent tlie bubbles in white and umber which is troublesome in grinding pink-the single pink does not admit of so great variety as the carnation but is nevertheless so variegated as to make it an agreeable slower for sattins silks the most com mon are either white or crimson others are striped white and red others are white spotted with red others edged with red all which may be worked according to the rules for the other flowers so diversified with the same colours the leaves and stalks are bluishi green only at the joints there is for the most part vellowissi tinge which is also at the bottom of the cup and scales painting on silks sattins when the outline is made according to the artist ’ fancy wasn of isinglass should with care be laid on to take away the glare and sleekiness of the sattin otherwise the colours will not work freely the isinglass to be melted in very clear water over the fire so as not to be very glutinous otherwise it will discover the sattin and consequently spoil the colours in the foregoing rules we have recommended for the most part the leaving the paper for the light parts of flower and working with colours mostly transparent but here the lights- are to be made by small tincture of the colour of the in- tended flower mixt with the flake white so much as just to make degree from the colour of the sattin if white or of any other colour to be mixed proportionably to the colour of the flower for instance if blue flower the bice or verditer very small quantity of it with the white using less of it pro- portionally as the shades grow darker and in the most dark indigo alone may be used it being by that tine rendered opaque enough but great care must be used not to lay the colours on too thick otherwise they will crack litile sugar-candy will be found necessary when mixed with guin- water as preventative to that inconveniency if flower happens to be of so deep colour as not to admit of any pure white in the lightest of the parts sort of priming of white should be laid on after which when dry begin with the ground colour of the flower proceeding gradually with the shades as in the above directions which with the selected examples we have annexed peculiarly chosen from nature for the purpose we hope will be sufficient for our ingenious stu- dents in this most delightful amusement of colouring maps and other prints in water colours vaving as yet seen nothing published upon this sub¬ hject that is authentic have thought fit for the sake of those who are inelined to ingenuity to set forth the way and manner of doing this work it being an excellent recreation for the gentry and others who delight in the knowledge of maps which by being coloured and the several divisions dis- tinguished one from the other by colours of different kinds do give better idea of the countries they describe than they can possibly do uncoloured now to perform this work after the best manner there must be provided in the first place lye made with tartar and gum water to make the tartar lye do thus take two ounces of the best white tartar which is stony substance that sticks to the side of wine vessels and is sold by the druggists wrap it up hard and tight in half sheet of cap paper wet it thorouglly in water and put it into clear sire either of iood or sea-coal let it remain therein till it be red hot quite thirough then talte it out withi pair of tongs andeput it imn¬ mediately into apint of water and with vour singer rub it well to pièces put it ini » long narrow glass and in day or two the black will all settle and the lve will become pure and clear pour oit tlie lye into clean glass and keep it cluse stopped for use to muke gunn-water take three ounces of the best and clearest gumn arabic wliich is sold at tlie druggists and heat it as small as yon can bruise it thien put it into pint of fair spring water and let it dissolve therein which will be much hastened hy shaking tle botile two or three times day very well thit tlie gum that is dissolved may mix the better with the water that is ahote it and wien it is all dissolved if there appear anv foulness in it sirain it through rag into clean earthen dissi and put it into glass and stop it for use remember that too much of this ought not to be made at tinie for if tlie gum he kept too long dissolved in tlie water it will rot and be of no use you must therefore always olserve to make it fressi once in two montlis or tliree at the farthest in the next place vou mest prepare or make your colours for uie and tlie best for this work are those that sol- low naniely copper green and that is made thus take pound of right french verdigrease made at montpelier this being thie best for the verdigrease made at any otlier place will fade to this add three ounces of cream of tartar beat them both into sine poiyder and take care uhile tlie verdigrease is in the in our mouth to breailie tiirnugh else the subtle powder of the verdigicase will he apt to offend and when this is done mix hothi the powders into two quaris of wates and boil it in an earthen pirkin tiil it boil away quart then strain it nut when coid and put the liquor into glass stop it up and let it stand to settle till tne liquor be very clear so you will have à delicate green but sometimes the verdigrease not being al¬ ways of geodncss thie colour may not he deep enough fur some uses in this case put some of it into broad earilien dith and set it over charing-dish of coals and by à gentle lieat diminissi so much of the siquor till by trying on paper and letting it dry tlie colour please you and liere you are to note that if it shine toe much wlien dry it is not right for it is not rightly made except it just shine and if you can not make the colour deep enough by evaporating by heat the abounding liquid without making it shine too much it were better to add some more verdigrease and boil it up again till it become deep transparent green lf vou would make but pint of this you must take but half the quantity of each and you are also to take notice that this is colour that will keep many years without decaying if the glass that contains it be the next colour needful to be made is stone colour or liquor ’ of myrrh which is thus done take pint of your tartar lye and add to it one ounce of the best myrrh in pow¬ der which vou can get at the druggists and boil it till the myrth is dissolved which will be done in little time let it settle and pour off the clear for use wliich you must close stop up this is also tincture that will never decay and may be made fainter or deeper by boiling more of the liquor away to make it deeper or by adding water te make it fainter and in the last place there is required crimson colour which is speedily made thus -buy at the druggists some good cochineal about half an ounce will go great way take thirty or forty grains bruise them in gallipot to fine powder then put in them as many drops of the tartar lye as will just wet it and make it give forth its colour and immiediately add to it half spoonful or more if the colour be yet too deep and you will have delicate purple liquor or tincture then take bit of allum and with knife scrape very finelv very little of it into the tincture and this will take away the purple co- lour and make it delicate erimson strain it through fine cloth into clean gallipot and use it as soon as you can for this is colour that always looks most noble when soon made use of as it will decay if it be made too long indigo is another colour used in colouring of maps this is bought at the shops that sell paint and it must be ground very fine on stone as you do oil colours with little tartar lye to niake it give its colours and look the brighter when it is ground perfectly fine like thick syrup add gum water to it till it he thin enough for your purpose and keep it in glass close stopped up but it will seitle so that when you use it vou must stir it exceeding well up from the bottom for yellow gamboge is the best it is sold at the drug- gists in lumps and their way to make it fit for use is to make little hole with knise in lump and put some water into the hole stir it well with peneil till the water be either deeper or fainter yellow as your occasion requires then pour it ints gallipot and temper up more till you have enough for your purpose red lead is also colour much used in this work and so is orpiment both which you may buy at the colour shiops very well ground so tliat they need only to be tempered with gum- water to be fit for use blue bice is also often used which needs only to be tem- pered with gum-water and when men design to be curious they may uie instead thereof ultramarine wliich is the best and most glorious of all blues vet extremely dear though small papers of it at about two shillings price may be bought at some colour-shops which if carefully used will go great way it need only be tempered in very small gally-pot with some gum-water till it lie on the paper with sine and almost transparent colour there is likewise an exceeding glorious red or crimson colour named carmine which is exceeding dear yet about half crown ’ worth will go great way in the uses to which it is put it is tempered with guin-water and gives several degrees of colour according as it is thick or thin tempered vermillion is also used in some cafes this is glorious scarlet that needs only to be tempered with gum-water for it may be bought very finely ground to powder at the colour shops only it is to be noted that this colour shews much brighter when dry if glazed over with some thick gum-water wliich is made by puiting two ounces of gum arabie to half pint of water or lels and for some uses burnt umber ground very sine with water as thick as possible and then tempered with gum-water to à due thickness and then it makes good transparent colour there is another colour needful in this work which is most pleasant grass green and that is made thus take lump of gamboge and make hole in it then put therein some copper green stir it about with pencil and from willow copper green it turn to grass green which you may make deeper or lighter as you stir it about longer or lesser time of the practice of colouring maps the colours being prepared as before directed the only way to colour maps well is by pattern done by some good workman of which the dutch are esteemed the best three or tour such maps coloured by good aitist are sufficient to guide man in tlie right doing of hiis work but if he can not obtain this he may by few trials grow good artist in short time for this is only attained by practice and is man spoil half score maps in order to get the knack of colouring map well at last there is no man that is ingenious will grumble at it thie art of colouring right may be attained by practice as was said but the hardest thing is to know rightly how to make and prepare the colours properly without suffering them to sink into it all that are here mentioned will lie fair and pleasant to the eye and it is the fairneis of the colour is this art of mappainting but if the paper be not gend and strong no art can make the colours lie well therefure in buyieig maps chuse those that are printed on tlie thickest and strongest paper the practice of working oil colours and painting timber-work after the manner of comnon painting that which ihere call common painting is only the way and manner of colouring all kinds of wainscot doors windows posts rails pails gâtes border-boards for gardens or any other materials that require either beautv or preservation from the violence of rain or injury of weathier the method of doing which shall lay down in the plainest manner possible suppose then that there he set of pallisadoes or pair of gates or some posts and rails to paint and would finish tliem in stone colour first look over tlie work and take notice wliether the joints be open in the gates or whether there are any large clefts in the posts for it these are nor well sccured the wet will insinuate itself into those desects and make the quicker dispatch in ruining the whole work let the first businels therefore be to stop up these places smooth and even with putty made of whitening and linseed oil well heaten together on the grinding stone with wooden mallet to the consistence of very thick dough and with this let all the crannies clefts and other defects be perfectly filled ur that it may he equal to the surface of the stuff then proceed to the priming of the work with some spanissi browni well ground and mixed with very thin linseed oil with this do over the work giving it as much oil as it will drink up this in about two days will be tolerably dry then if you would do this woik substantially do it over again with the same priming colour when this is thoroughly dry then take the white lead well ground and tempered up not too thin for the stiffer you work it tlie better body will be laid on and the thicker coat of co- lour that your timber is covered withal the longer it will last let this colour be well rubbed on and the whole surface of the work be so entirely covered that there remain no creek nor corner bare which you may easily perceive by jobbing in the point of bristle brush let this first colouring dry and then go over it à second time and if you please third also the charge will be à little more but the advantage will be much greater this course is sufficient for any kind of timber work that requires onsy plain colour wliether you thus cover the work with stone colour or else with timber colour in umber and white or lead colour in indigo and white that of the white being the cheapest of the three by much nay have known some lay over their work only with coat of spanissi brown by tempering it up more stiffthan was done for the two sirst primings which in some respects is cheapest of all and pre- serves the timber perhaps as well as any now he that is able to bring the work thus far on has proceeded to the highest pitch of that common painting that aims at preservation beyond beauty though something of beauty is necessarily in- cluded in this also but this is not all -- for he that is arrived thus far is in fair way to other perfections in the art of paint- ing but for the pannelling of wainscot with its proper shadows and for imitating olive and walnut wood marble and such like these must be obtained by ocular inspection it being impossible to deliver the manner of the operation by precept without example and am bold to affirm ghat man shall gain more knowledge by one day ’ experience than by hundred spent to acquire it in souie other way advise therefore all those that desire an insight into this business to be little curious if opportunity offers in ob- serving the manner of painter ’ working not only in grinding his colours but also in laying them on and working them in in all these observing the motion of his hand in managing of any kind of tool and by this means with little imitation oined to the directions here given ldoubt not but in fhois tine you may arrive to great proficiency in the business of common painting note-that when vou have made use of your colours if there be occasion for small cessation till the work be finished in this caseit is best to cover your colours in pot with -water for that will prevent their drying even in the hottest time and for your pencils they ought as soon as you have done working to be well washed out in clean linseed oil and then in warm suds for if either oil or colours be once dried in the brusn or pencil it is spoiled for ever it has been observed that timber laid over with white when it has stood some time in the weather the colour will crack and slirink up together just as pitch does if laid on any thing that stands in the sun the cause is that the colour was not laid on with stiff body able to bind itself on firm and fast lf you shall at any time have occasion to use either brushes or pencils that are very small as in many cases there will he occasion vou ought then to dispose of the colouis you use upon pallet which is wooden instrument easy to be had at any colour-shop and there work and temper thiem about with your pencil that the peneil may carry away the more colour for vou are to note that if apencil be only dipped in à pot of colour it brings out no more than what hangs on the outside and that will work but very little way whereas if vou rub the pencil about in the colour on the pallet good quantity of colour will be taken up in the body of the peneil and besides all this you may work pencil better to point on pallet than you can do in apot the point of pencil being of the greatest use in divers cases especially in drawing of lines and all kinds of flourishing catalogue of the several colours used in hainting with oil whites-the principal of all whites is white lead of this colour there are two forts the one called ceruse which is the most pure and clean part the ntlier is called by the plain name white lead besides white lead and ceruse there is another fort to be met with sometimes which they call flake white blackslamp black lamp or candle black ivory black willow charcoal reds.-vermillion is the most delicate of all light reds being of itself most perfect scarlet colour lake especially the richest sort is the best of all dark reds being most pure crimson red lead is the lightest of all reds now in use it is fandy harsh colour and such one as is not easily ground very fine although you bestow much labour on it spanish brown is dark dull red of an horse fleshi colour it is anearth but there is some of it of very good colour and pleasant enough to the eye considering the deepness of its colour it is of very great use amongst painters being generally used as the first or priming colour that they lay first upon any kind of work being cheap and plentiful and colour that works well if it be ground fine as you may do with less labour than some better colours require the first fort is the deepest colour and most free fram stones the other sorts are not so good to give colour to the eye but yet they serve as well as any other for prim- ing colour vellows-yellow oker is of two forts one called plain oker the other spruce oker the one is much lighter colour than the other pink yellow orpiment is that colour which some call yellow arsenic masticot is good light yellow for most uses especially in making greens of which several sorts may be framed out of this colour being mixed with blue greens-verdigrease is the best and most useful green of all others green bice is of fandy nature and therefore not so much used green verditer is also sandy colour neither of them bear any good body and are seldom used but in landscapes where variety is required blues.— blue bice bears the best body of all bright blues used in common work but it is the palest colour blue verditer is of no good body something sandy and of no very good colour itself being apt to turn greenisn and being mixed with yellow makes very good green indigo is dark blue if worked by itself to remedy which whites are usually mixed and then it makes bui faint blue note-that the longer this colour is ground the more beautiful and fair it looks smalt is the most lovely blue of all others notethat of thiis colour there are two forts the finest is that which is called oil smalt umber is colour that really has no affinity with the others before mentioned being neither white black red yellow blue or green yet it is colour of as great use as any of the what colours are most suitable and set off best one with by setting off best mean their making each other dlook most pleasant for two of some particular colours put together or one next the other shall add much to the beauty of each other as blue and gold red and white and such like -but green and black put togethier look not so pleasant neither do black and umber or haw colour and such like all yellows then set off best with blacks with blues and with reds all blues set off best with whites and yellows greens set off well with blacks and whites whites set off well enough with any colour reds set off best with yellows whites and blacks gold looks well enough upon white ground especially if the matter to be gilt be carved gold and black shew very well gold on timber colour shew also very well so does gold and horse-flesn colour made with the finest spaniss brown but the most glorious ground of all others for gold are the vermillion red the smalt blue and the lake laid on light ground of some colours that arise from mixture asni colour is made of wliite lead and lamp black if deep asn colbur then take more black if light one then take but little black and must white lead colour is made of indigo and white colour resembling new oaken timber is made of umber and white lead flesn colour is compounded of lake white lead and little vermillion buff colour take yellow oker and white lead for willow green take verdigrease alone for light willow gieen take verdigrease and white for grass green take verdigrease and pink carnation is made of lake and white orange colour yellow oker and red lead light timber colour mix spruce oker and white and very little umber brick colour red lead little white and yellow oker for straw colour take white and little yellow oker olive wood is imitated with oker and little white veined over with burnt umber walnut tree is imitated with burnt umber and white veined over with the sane colour alone and in the deepest places with black pails and posts are sometimes laid over with white which they call stone colour sometimes posts and pails are laid over with indigo and white wlich is called lead colour window frames are laid in white if the building be new but if not then they are generally laid in lead colour or indigo and white and the bars with lead doors and gates if painted in pannels then the shadows of white ground are umber and white but if laid in lead colour then the shadows are listed with black it is impossible to set down all those variety of colours that may be produced by mixture they that would see more may peruse dr. salmon ’ polygrafice where they will find great variety but those which have here given an account of will sufficiently seive for common painting some directions for mixing of oil colours for divers purposes in the art of colouring prints with oil colours colours for several faces for faces that are accounted fair take white lead little vermillion and small touch of lake for the lips take more of the vermillion and lake than you did for the face for brown face take burnt oker and white for tawiiy moor take cullens earth little burnt oker and little white colours for hair for brown hair mix umber and little black and white for yellow hair take stone oker white lead and little vermillion for flaxen hair take white lead stone oker and little cullens earth linen is done with white lead or ceruse silver is done with white little smalt and some white masticot gold is done with red orpiment and white masticot of each an equal quantity colours for garments for blue garments the best smalt and white lead for grass gréen mix verdigrease and little pink yelloiv for willow green mix verdigrease and very little white sea-green is made by mixing green verditer pink and white lead french green is made by mixing pink and indigo carnation by mixing lake and white lead crimson is made by mixing vermillion lake and white fcarlet is only vermillion laid on alone cherry colour is made by mixing vermillion and white lead for vellow lay on either yellow orpiment or yellow maf¬ ticot if your yellows are more pale then mix white with the former for an orange colour mix red orpiment and little ver- million for purple mix smalt lake and white for violet mix bice and lake straw colour is made with white and yellow oker and very little umber an afhi colour is made by mixing black and white achesnut colour is made by mixing umber lake and white dove colour or the wings of an angel take white little lake and little smalt colours for trees for bodies of trees take pink yellow white lead yellow oker and little black for the leaves of them that are near the eye take verdi grease and pink or if dark coloured then take indigo and pink for leaves of trees farther off take green verditer pink and white lead for them that are farthest of all take terra-verd and white colours for grounds behind picture nore that light hair requires dark ground and dark hair light ground ground colour for picture with light hair is made with umber white and black ground colour with dark hair is made with umber and white for ground in landscape take pink oker and white with little green verditer for country houses at distance take white lead yellow oker and smalt the same colour serves also for houses of stone for brick houses or walls take yellow oker burnt and white lead if the work be far off but if near then indian red and little white for pails of wood or other timber work of what kind so- ever in country cottages take umber white and little oker sky colours are made of smalt and white for the highest skies more white for the lower and yellow mixt with little vermillion for the lowest of all how to make size for gilding both with gold and silver the operation is thus for the making of gold size -- take yellow oker and grind it on stone with water till it be very fine and afterwards lay it on chalk stone to dry this is the common way or you may wash your oker for when it is washied to be sure nothing but the purest of the colour will be used and besides it is done with less daubing when your oil and oker are thus prepared you must grind them together as you do other oil colours only with fat dry- ing oil but it is somewhat more laborious and must be ground very fine even as oil itself for the finer it is the greater lustre will your gold carry that is laid on it here note that you must give it such quantity of vour fat oil that it may not be so weak as to run when you have laid it on nor so stiff that it may not work well but of such competent body that after it is laid on it may settle itself smooth and glossy which is chief property of good size silver size is made by grinding white lead with fat drying oil some adding little verdigrease to make it bind how to gild with gold or an oily size either letters or figures whatsoever vou would gild must first be drawn with gold fize the making of which has been men- tioned according to the true portion you would have gilt whether figure letter or whatever else it be when you have thus drawn the true proportion of what you would have gilt let it remain till it be sufficiently dry to gild upon which you shall know by touching it with the end of your singer for if vour finger stick little to it and yet the colour come not off then it is dry enough but if the colour come off on your finger thenit is not dry enough and must be let alone longer for if you would then lay vour gold on it would so drown it that it would be worth nothing but if vour size should be so dry and the gold will not take sor wliich there is no re- medy but new sizing therefore you must watch the true time that it be not too wet or too dry both extremes being not at all convenient when your size is ready for gilding take vour book of leaf gold and opening loaf of it take it out with your cane ply- ers and lay it on your gilding cushion and if it lie not smooth blow on it with your breath which will lay it flat and plain then with knife of cane or for want of it an ordinary poeket knife that hath smooth sharp edge with this sbeing wiped very dry on vour sleeve that the gold stick not to it let your leaf of gold be cut into such pieces or forms as your judgment shall think most suitable to your work when you have thus cut your gold into convenient forms then take your gilding pallet ’ tis flat piece of wood about three inches long and an inch broad upon which is to be glewed ’ piece of sine woollen cloth of the same length and breadth and breathe upon it to make it dampisn that the gold may stick to it with this tool take your gold by clapping it down on the several pieces you had before cut into forins and transser it to your size upon which clap it down according to discretion and your gold must afterwards press down smooth with bunch of cotton or- hare ’ foot and this you must do piece hy piece till you have covered all your size gold and after it is fully dried then with your hare ’ foot brush off all the loose gold so will your gilding remain fair and beautiful if your work to be gilt be very large open your book of leaf gold and lay your leaf down on your work without cutting it into pieces and so do leaf by leaf till vou have covered quite over what you intend to gild and if some particular places should miss take up with small bunch of cotton piece of leaf gold cut to fit size and clap it on that the work may be entirely covered and if the gold be to be laid in the hollows of carved work you must take itup on the point of camel hair pencil and convey it in and with the said pencil dab it down till it lie close and smooth how to gild with silver in laying on silver upon an oily size the same method in all respects required as for gilding with gold save only in this that the size upon which silver is laid ought to be com¬ pounded of very little yellow oker and much white lead for the size being of light colour the silver laid on it will look more natural and retain its own colour better the whiter the size is note that the common painters do now generally in gild- ing use more silver than gold in most works that are not much exposed to the air to wliich they afterwards give the colour of gold by means of the lacker varniss whose use is now so common that if they gild any thing that stands free from the weather they only gild with silver and so give it the colour of gold with lacker varnist made of gum lake dis- solved in spirit of wine and laid over it
