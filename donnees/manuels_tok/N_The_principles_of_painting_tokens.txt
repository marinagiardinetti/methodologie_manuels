useful treatises on this art in the year he published the present system as the re- sult of all his thoughts and to make it of more service has handled it by way of principles method believe

them incomplete without finishing bis reftections abroad for wbich pur- pose he travelled into several parts op europe to see the finest paintings- wbereby he was enabled to make me balance of painters we find in this treatise an attempt which for its novelty must needs be acceptable to the curtous his love of painting induced bim also to draw up parallel between it and poesy wherein with bis usual candour and learning he shews the excellences and preferences of both arts we shall bere endeavour to make some remarks on portraiture as it is the branch of painting chiesly practised among us anh at the same time to sbew what may be learned from the following system by those who study er practise this art in the balance aforesaid van- dyke whom for several reasons wa may call ours stands high as hav¬ ing fifteen degrees of merit for com- position ten for design seventeen fon colouring and thirteen for expression and we accordingly discover in his works such composition air grace and fine penciling as none of his suc- cessors have hitherto attained his method indeed was pretty singular wbich our author does not wholly agree to and calculated for dispatch- for he bestowed not above an hour on sitting but being pretty jure of the effects of bis colours he painted without much scuaubling the best way to preserve their purity and vivacity rembrant swbom the balance equals with vandyke for colouring tho not perfect model for an engish face- painter was so careful not ta torture bis colours that he chose rather to add jresp ones and for this reason bis works as well as vandyke maintain to this day an unusual strength and vigour now it may be naturally anferr from the practice of these two painters that as any colour any stroke is to express some drawing some tendency towards teint and like- ness so any great disturbance or wrong colour too often the case portraiture not only spoils drawing but surprisingly alters and fouls te teint and makes the painting less like and lefs durable but to return to vandyke what if we should suppose that the historical management he was brought up to under the excellent rubens loosened his head gave him easy penciling and noble air and in- duced bim to exprefs nature with more spirit even more to improve her than if bis genius and pencil had been always confined to portraiture à ips very probable that such genius will never quit historical freedom and yet like vandyke it will on coming to portraiture be thereby better en- abled to exalt nature and preserve likeness the transtator preface but no pains was too great for this artist who proposing an exact truch in all things always sketched in black and white crayons the size at- titude and dress of the person who fat to bim and from them painted afterwards his cloaths wbich were sent to him for that purpose this wbatever trouble painters may think it must needs look more free natural and becoming and tend more to like- ness than any size posture or dress taken from layman as for hands this artist painted them from those of the persons he retained for that purpose in speaking of the attitudes wbich with the face are the language of portraiture our author makes them of two kinds viz in motion and at reft the one for young people only and the other for any persons indif- ferently yet allowing the mactive to have some motion now if the atti- tude be to express who and what the sitter is and bis very temper very nice bistorical point how much does it concern the portraitist to study- it and make the distinctions aforesaid whereas the postures of most of our portraits are at rest and at best taken from the layman but to prove motion and histo- rical management in portrait must acquaint the reader that bave seen picture drawn in italy of an english gentleman where he is repre- sented in sitting posture the ground is à piece of walling with window at the outside of wbich appears person holding up small image of white marble for the gentleman to look at who with extended arms admires its beauty and tho bis face was on this account fore-shortened lengthwise yet it retained great likenefs there is yet bebind favourite historical principle of vandyke and titian which face-painters little heed mean the dlaro-obscuro com- pound itahaan word signifying simply an opposition of light and shade but in more refined sense any co- lours naturally luminous and light in themselves opposed to others na- turally more brown and heavy the artifice of the claro-obscuro of whatever small import painters may think it in portrait is certainly practicable in family-piece because our author tells us that every such picture picture is an history and becomes group by the meeting of the figures of different sexes and ages and in different attitudes and draperies noso this group must be so managed that the foremost figures must net only as be- ing nearest to the eye receive the greatest light but also be improved by draperies of natural light colours and in this white and yellow sattin does wonders and the off-figures be more brown and heavily coloured but with discretion so that the whole group may appear to bave one general light opposing one general shade in word- this treatise will ap- pear as our author would bave it be palace and bulwark for art to wbich both painters and lovers of painting may safely retire for instruction and entertainment as to the translation we have endeavoured to make it as acceptable to the engish reader as possible by ob- serving medium between too wide parapbrase and too literal verfion the properest method for work that treats so learnedly and profoundly oj the art of painting the author' preface on the idea of painting the prize of race is not to be won if we have not the goal in our eye is the perfect knowledge of any art or science to be acquired without having trie idea of it this idea is our goal or mark and directs us unerringly to the end of our career that is to the pof- session of the science we desire but though there is nothing which does not include in itself and discover its true idea yet we must not from hence infer that this idea is so obvioues as not to be mistaken or that the false idea does not often pafs for the true and perfect there are several ideas of painting as well as of other arts the difficulty lies in discovering which of them is the true one for this purpose it is necessary to observe that in painting there are two forts of ideas general idea wlich is common to all men and particular idea peculiar to painters the surest way to know infallibly the true idea of things is to derive it from the very basis of their essence and definition for desinition was invented for no other purpose than preventing equivocation and ambiguity in ideas banishing those that are false and informing the mind of the true end and principal effects of things whence it fol- lows that the more an idea leads us directly and rapidly to the end which.its essence points out the more certain we ought to be that such an idea is à true one the essence and definition of painting is cne imitation of visible objects by means of form and colours wherefore the more for- cibly and faithfully painting imitates nature the more directly and rapidly does it lead us to its end which is to decerve the eye and the surer proofs does it give us of its true ide general idea above-mentioned strikes and attracts every one the ignorant the lovers of painting judges and even painters themselves picture that bears this cha- racter permits no one to pass by it with in- difference but never fails to surprise us and to detain us for while to enjoy the pleasure of our surprize true painting therefore is such as not only surprises but asit were calls to us and has so powerful an effect that we can not help coming near it as if it had something to tell us and we no sooner approach it but we are entertained not only with sine choice with the novelty of the things it represents with the history or fable it puts us in mind of with ingenious inventions and with allegories to give us the pleasure of employing our parts either in discovering the meaning or criticising the obscurity of them but also with that true and faithful imitat ion which attracted us at first sight and afterwards lets us into all the particulars of the piece and ahich accord- ing to aristotle never fails to divert us how horrible soever those natural objects may be which it represents the other idea which as we said to painters and to which they ought to be perfectly habituated concerns in particulat the whole thebry of painting and should be so much at command that it may seem to cost them no reflection to exé- cute their thoughts. so that after having studied correct design fine colouring and all their dependencies they ought to have those ideas always present and ready which answer to the several branches of their art on the whole true painting by the force and great truth of its imitation ought as have observed to call the spectator to surprise him and oblige him to approach it as if he intended to converse with the figures in effect when the piece bears the character of truth it seems to have drawn us to it for no other purpose than to entertain and instruct us but here we must observe that the zdeas of painting in general are as different as the manners of the several schools not that painters are without those particular ideas which they ought to possefs but the use they make of them not being at all times just the habits which this use brings upon them their attachment to one parf more than an- other and the affection they preserve for the manner of those masters whom they have imitated prejudice their choice and bias them to some favourite branch of the art though they are under the strictest ob- ligation to make themselves masters of every part of it in order to contribute to the ge¬ neral idea above-mentioned for most painters are always divided in their inclina- tions some following raphael others mi- chael-angelo others the caracchis and others the scholars of these masters some prefer the whole oters the abundance of thoughts ofhers the graces others the ex- pression of the passions of the soul and there are some who give themselves wholly up to the heat and transport of their genius thor but little improved either by study or re- flection but what can be done with all these vague and uncertain ideas tis certainly dangerous to reject them we must therefore resolve to prefer to all other things that truth which we have supposed in the ge- neral idea for to all painted objects the appearance of truth is more necessary than the manner of any master whatever becau se truth in painting is the basis of all the parts which heighten the excellence of this art as the sciences and virtues are the foundation of all those accomplishments which can either exalt or adorn human nature for which reason we must suppose truth on the one hand and virtue and science on the other to be in perfection when we talk of those finishings or accomplishments of which either painting or human nature is susceptible and which without resting upon such basis can have no good effect in short the spectator is not obliged to seek for-truth in painting but truth by its effect must call to the spectator and force his attention tis in vain to adorn stately palace with the greatest rarities if we have forgot to make doors to it or if the entrance be not proportionable to the beauty of the building so as to raise the passenger ’ desire to walk in and gratify his curiosity all visible objects enter the understanding by the faculty of seeing as musical sounds do by that of hear- ing the eyes and ears are the doors which admit us to judge of painting and mufick- the first care therefore both of the painter and the musician should be to make these entrances free and agreeable by the force of their harmony the one in his colouring con- ducted by the claro-obscuro and the other in his accords the spectator being thus at- tracted by the force of the performance his eye discovers in it those particular beauties which are capable of instructing and pleasing the curious finds in it what suits his taste and the painter there observes the different branches of his art in order to improve himself by what is good and to reject what- ever may be vicious every thing in picture is not equally perfect some paint- ings there are which with several faults when minutely consider ’ do not fail ne- vertheless to catch the eye because of the artist ’ excellent management in his colouring and the claro-obscuro rembrant for instance diverted him- self one day with drawing his maid ’ picture in order to set it at his window and deceive passengers his project succeeded for the fallacy was not discoverd till some days after and yet as we may justly imagine of rembrant this effect was not owing to the beauty of the design nor to the noble- ness of the exprefsion when was in hol- land had the curiosity to see this picture and finding it to be well pencild and of great force bought it and it has at this time considerable place in my cabinet other painters on the contrary have shewn in their works good many per- fections in the several parts of the art yet have not been so happy as rembrant to gain at first sight such favourable regards say not happy because if they have sometimes succeeded ’ twas owing to chance dispo- sition of objects which in the places they filled required an advantageous claro-obscuro perfection which can not be denied them but wherein the skill of the painter had very littie share since if it had been the effect of science it would have appeared in all his other productions thus nothing is more common than to séë paintings set off room purely by the rich- ness of their borderings whilst the insipidity and coldness of those paintings is such that people pafs unconcernedly by them without being attracted by that truth which calls to us now to make this point clearer must explain it by the example of some skilful painters who yet have not been masters enough to strike the eye at first sight by faithful imitation and trutk which ought to decelve as even excelling nature itself thé most rémarkable examplé can quote is raphael because of his great reputation and because there was never any painter who possessed so many parts of the art or possessed them in so high degree of perfection is very certain by the confession of many that men of knowledge have often sought for raphaels works in the midst of them that is in the halls of the vatican where are his best performances and have asked their guides to shew them the works of raphael without giving the least indi¬ cation of being struck with them at the first glance of the eye as they expected to be from that painter ’ reputation the paint- ings of raphael did not answer the idea they had conceived of so great genius because they measured them by that idea which one ought naturally to have of perfect works they could not imagine that the imitation of nature would not in the works of so wonderful an artist appear in all its vigour and all its perfection this shews that without the knowledge of the claro-obscuro and of whatever depends on colouring the other parts of painting lose much of their merit even when they are in that degree of perfection to which raphael carried them shall offer here late instance of the little effect which raphael ’ works produce at first sight had it from friend well known for his genius and knowledge and monsieur de valincourt who as it usually happens to persons of his parts has such an esteem for this famous painter as comes up to admiration being some time ago at rome he was very im- patient to see raphael ’ works the most admired of which are his fresco paintings in the halls of the vatican he was accord- ingly carried thither but happened with indifference to cross the halls without per- ceiving that he had before his eyes what he so eagerly sought after his conductor thereupon stopt him short and said whitber are you going so faft sirè theres wbat you look for and you do not mind my curious friend no sooner perceived the beauties whech his fine genius pointed out to him in those works but he resolved to repair thither cften fully to gratify his curiolity and to form his taste on what he could fur- ther discover but what if besides charmn- ing with the sight of so many fine things raphael had at first sight called to him by the effect of colouring proper for each object and supported by an excellent claro- obscuro this gentleman thought he should be extremely surprised at the sight of paintings that had so great reputation but was not and not being painter he contented him- self with examining and praising the airs of the heads the expressions the nobleness of the aftitudes and the graces of the parts he best best understood in other things he had but little curiosity because they relate to the painter only this story is often revivéd as well by painters who never saw any of ra- phael ’ works as by other curious persons ignorant of painting yet it must be acknowledged that some of this artist ’ paintings are well colour ’ but we must not form our judgment of the whole by the few of this kind for it is the general run of his and other painters works that must determine the extent of their capacities some object that this great and perfect imitation is not essential to painting and that if it were the effects would appear in most pictures that picture may call and yet not always answer the idea of the per- son who comes to it and that it is not ne- cessary for the figures to seem desirous to enter into conversation with the spectator because he is already prepossessed with the notion of its being only painting it is certain that the number of pictures which call the spectator is but few but that is not the fault of the art the essential effect of which is to surprise and deceive the eye we must only blame the painter ’ nieg- ligence or rather impute it to his genius as not being exalted enough or not sufficiently furnish ’ with the principles necessary for com- ompelling as it were those who pass by stop and give attention to his pieces but further it argucs more genius to nake good use of lights and shades har- nony of colours and théir suitableness to éach articular object than to design single igure correctly design which requires much time to earn perfectly consists of little more than habit which is often repeated of giving neasures and outlines but the claro-obscuro nd harmony of colours is continual sub- ect of reasoning which employs the genius ways that are as different as the compo- itions them selves moderate genius may hrough perseverance attain correct design- ng but the clare-obscuro requires besides lie rules such compass of genius as may ncorporate with and as it were diffuse tself through all the other parts of paint- ng tis well known that the works of ti -- tian and of all the painters of his school have fcarce any other merit than their claro- obscuro and colouring and yet they bear à great price are in great repute and maintain their posts in the cabinets of the curious as first-rate pictures when speak of design must be un- derstood to mean only that material part which by just measurès foris all objects in regular manner for am not ignorant that that in design there is genius capable to season all sorts of forms by the asfistance of taste and elegance yet it is easy to observe that the effect which calls to the spectator arises principally from the colouring of all the parts by which we are to understand the claro-obscuro and the general harmony of colours as also such as we call local or colours which faithfully imitate those of any particular object but all this hinders not the other parts of art from being necessary to help forward the whole work and from mutually assisting each other some to form others to adorn the objects painted in order to give them taste and grace that may in- struct respectively both lovers and painters and in word may please every one thus as it is the duty of painting both to call and please when it has called the spectator it must necessarily entertain him with all the various beauties of which it is capable must now proceed to set the several parts of painting in their natural order that may confirm the reader in the idea have been endeavouring to establisn and because this idea is founded on truth shall begin the following discourses with treatise on this- subject which am the more obliged to do because the subject of trutb and the idea of painting are so nearly allied as to be almost the same thing for all the parts of painting are no further valuable than they ear this character of truth after the idea of painting which have endeavoured to establisn and after the trea- tise upon truth snall speak of the other parts of painting and if the grounds go upon are solid they may possibly sereen me well from the false critick as from those who are ignorant of the true principles of the art such principles will endeavour to esta- bish as may serve to build rampart and palace for painting where great painters rue criticks lovers of painting and all per- ons of good taste may safely retire in- vention will furnish the thought of the structure and chuse its painter-like situation which though fanciful and sometimes even wild will nevertheless be extremely agree- able invention will also prepare the ma¬ erials and disposition compart the rooms or receiving all the solid beauties and orna- nents we would place in them after in- vention and disposition design and colouring and their dependencies are ready to perform their parts in executing the building co- couring will visit every thing and every- there distribute its gifts according to the exigence- and propriety of the place and pointly with design will chuse the furniture of the palace design also will by way of pre-eminence have alone the charge of over- seeing the architecture as colouring will have that of chusing the pictures and both will co-operate to put the finishing hand to the structure the situation to make it commodious for painting must be diversified with objects produced without art or culture as rocks cascades mountains rivulets forests skies and fields all in an uncommon manner yet keeping within the bounds of probability and which will be more particularly handled in my discourse on landskip among other inhabitants of this palace painting will receive poesy with all the marks of distinction fhe deserves where they will live together like two kind sisters who ought to love one another without jealousy and without disputes it is with parallel between these two arts intend to close this system of painting some persons of good sense have blamed me for making use of the defect in raphael to confirm- my sentiment on the idea of painting raphael who ought not to be mentioned say they but as the model of all perfection considering the general and esta¬ blished reputation he has acquired they own have reason in the main yet say that ought to chuse some other example and join with people of understanding in creating raghael with more complaisance they add that the curious are already set against against me because they have imagined that preferr ’ rubens to raphael and that the example make use of to confirm my senti- ment would rather irritate than convince them and would likewise with them very much lessen the opinion which the world entertains of my skill in painting can only answer that chose raphael xx as an example that is what often happens at the first sight of his works for no other reason but because he excelled more in all the parts of his art than any other painter and because should reap more advantage and more certainly establisn my sentiment on the idea of painting if set it in oppo¬ sition to all raphael ’ perfections to chuse raphael therefore as an example because he possessed more excellencies than any other painter and in order to shew that all excel- lencies lose much of their lustre when they are not accompanied with colouring which calls the curious to admire them can never be thought to argue contempt of him my intention is not to write either for the learned in painting or the ignorant but for such as are born with an inclination to this sine art and may at least have improved it by conversing with able judges and learned painters write in word for young pupils who may have set out in right path and for all those who after acquiring some tincture of design and colouring have impartially impartially examined the best works and are docile enough to embrace those truths which may be hinted to them as for half-learned painters who have set out in the wrong path and most of the book-learned they usually maintain the false ideas which they have hastily embraced and tho strangers to design or colouring or ra- phael or rubens will talk of those two painters according to an antient tradition which though much lessened of late by good reflections has yet left its imprefsions on the minds of many as for myself can say that having in my travels view ’ with great attention the finest pictures in europe have studied them with fondness and such parts as nature has bestowed upon me ihave improved and employed this way ladmire every thing that is good in the works of the great masters without respect to names or any other com- plaisance value the several celebrated sclools ilove raphael titian and rubens and do my-utmost endeavours to dive into the rare accomplishments of those great painters but whatever perfections they may have love truth better truth alone is what should be had in view especially by one who writes for the publick this is respect to which the publick has right and there- fore thought could not excuse myself from paying it of truth in painting ma however much given to lying hates nothing so much as lye and the surest way to gain his confidence is to treat him with sincerity tis needless therefore to make an encomium here on truth since every one loves it and feels the beauties of it nothing is good nothing pleases without truth ’ tis reason equity good sense and the basis of all perfection tis the aim of the sciences and all the arts whose object is imitation have no other ten- dency than to instruct and direct men by faithful imitation of nature wherefore those who either cultivate the sciences or exercise the arts can not say that their en- deavours have been crowned with success if after all their pains they have not dis- covered that truth which they look upon as the reward of their studies besides the general truth which ought to appear in all things there is truth pecu¬ liar to each of the fine arts and to each of the sciences my present design is to dis- cover what is truth in painting and of what importance it is to the painter to express it well but before we enter on the subject it must be premised with regard to imitation in painting that though the true object is the natural one and the feigned object that in the picture the latter is nevertheless called true when it is perfect imitation of the former it is therefore the truth in painting which shall endeavour to dis- cover in order to shew its worth and neces- sity observe in painting three kinds of truth viz the simple the ideal and the compound or perfect truth the simple which call the primary truth is plain and faithful imitation of the motions that express nature and of those objects which the painter has chosen for his copies such as they appear to the eye at first sight so as the carnations may seem to be real flesh and the draperies real stuffs in their several varieties and each object main- tain the true character of its nature and by the force of the claro-obsucro and of the union of colours the several painted objects may appear to have relief and the whole be harmonious in all natural things this simple truth discovers the way by which the painter may gain his end which is such strong and lively imitation of-nature that it may seem possible for the figures to come out of the picture as it were in order to talk with those who look at them but let it be here observed that from this idea of the simple or primary truth abstract all the beauties that may embellish it and which either the painter ’ genius or the rules of art may add to it in order to make the whole perfect the ideal truth is choice of various perfections not meeting in any single copy but taken from several and commonly from those of the antique this kind of truth comprehends an abun- dance of thoughts richnefs of invention propriety of attitudes an elegance of out- lines choice of fine expressions an hand- some cast of draperies and in word every thing that can without altering the primary truth make it more moving and more agreeable but as all these perfections can only subsist in idea with regard to paint- ing they have need of lawful subject both to preserve and set them off to advan- tage and this lawful subject is simple truth in the same manner as moral virtues are only ideal if they have not lawfui subject that is subject properly disposed to receive and support them without which they would be but the shadows of virtue simple truth subsists of itself and gives both relisn and spirit to the perfections which attend it and if it does not alone lead to an imitation of perfect nature which depends upon the choice the painter makes of his copy it leads at least to an imitation of na- ture which in general is the end of paint- ing ideal truth of itself must be allowed ’ to lead into most agreeable path yet it is such as does not carry the painter to the end of his art but leaves him short of it and the only affistance he can expect to come to the end of his career must proceed from thé simple truti hence it appears that the simple and ideal truths together make perfect compound and mutually assist each other with this difference that the former overpowers and darts its rays through all the perfections that are joined to it the third truth as compound of the other two gives the last hand to art and the perfect imitation of fine nature it carries so beautiful probability as often appears to be more true than truth itself and the reason is that by the aforesaid conjunction che primary truth seizes the spectator salves many negligencies and produces its effect the first without our attending to it this third truth is the mark which hi- therto no man has hit we can only say that those who have come the nearest to it are the most accomplished the simple and ideal truths have been divided according to the genius and education of the painters who possessed them giorgione titian pordenon old palma the bassans and all tie venetian school had no other merit but that of pos- sessing the primary truth and leonardo da vinci raphael julio romano polydore da caravaggio poussin and some others of the roman school have gained their greatest repu- tation by ideal truth especially raphael who besides the beauties of ideal was master of considerable part of the simple truth by which means he came nearer to that truth which is perfect than any other italian in effect it appears that in order to imitate nature in its variety this painter usually made use of as many different na- tural objects as he had figures to introduce into his pieces and if at the same time he added some things of his own it was to make his drawings the more regular and more expressive but always preserving truth and the distinguishing character of what he copied though he was not thoroughly master of simple truth in the other parts of painting yet he had such taste for truth that in most of the parts of the human body which he designed after nature he drew them on paper as they really were in order to be testimonies of the most simple truth and to be joined to the idea he had of the beauty derived from the antique an ad- mirable conductl in which no painter has been so successful as rapbael since the re- vival of the art now if perfect truth be composed of the simple and ideal painters may be said to excel in proportion to the degree wherein they possess those several truths and to the happy facility they have acquired of joining them into one compound atter having settled what truth is in painting it is proper to inquire whether those painters who exaggerate or overdo the out-lines of their figures in order to seem learned have not abandoned truth by exceeding the bounds of regular simplicity in this point painters use the word charge to signify any thing that exceeds now as every thing that exceeds is beyond proba- bility ’ tis certain that whatever may be said to be charged is contrary to the truth which we would establisn et there are charged out-lines which please because they are above the lowliness of ordinary nature and because they carry with them an air of freedom and certain idea of great taste which deceives most painters who call these excesses the grande maniere but those who have true idea of correctness of re- gular simplicity and of the elegance of nature will look upon these excesses as fuperfluous since they always adulterate the truth yet one can not help praising some overcharged things in great works when the distance from whence they must be viewed softens them to the eye or when they are used with such discretion as makes the character of truth more apparent some painters there have been who in- stead of reasonable moderation in their de- signs have affected to express their out-lines and muscling with greater exactness than the art of painting requires their motive was to gain to themselves the reputation of being fkilful in design and anatomy but their motive like theit pictures has cer- tain air of pedantry more capable of lessening the beauty of their works than of increasing their reputation it must indeed be granted that the artist ought to understand anatomy and the sharp swells which are its conse- quences because anatomy is the basis of de- signing and because these swells may lead those to perfection who know how to take and to leave as much of them as is necessary to make exactness and simplicity of design agree with good taste such things may also be tolerable and often agreeable in mere sketches of picture and the learned painter may profitably make use of them when he begins and dead-colours but should cut them off when he would have his work appear in perfection as the architect strikes his centre as soon as the arch is set on the whole the antique statues which have passed at all times for the rule of beauty have nothing charged nothing af- fected nor is there any thing of this kind in the works of those who have always imi- tated them as raphael poussin domini- chino and some others not only all affectation is displeasing but nature besides is obscured and overcast by bad habit which painters call manner- the better to understand this principle ’ tis proper to know that there are two forts of painters some and they are but few paint according to the principles of art and make truth so obvious in their works as to stop and entertain the spectator others work only practically by an expeditious habit which they have either taken up without reason or learnt of their masters without reflection though these sometimes do well either by chance or by the help of their memories yet they always succeed but in- differently when they work on their own bottom for as they but rarely make use of the natural or else confine theiselves to their habit they never express that truth or that probability which is the sole object of true painter and the end of painting for the rest among all the fine arts there is certainly none where truth ought to be so conspicuous as in painung the other arts do but revive the idea of things absent whereas this intirely supplies them and makes them present by the very essence of it which consists not only in pleafing but deceiving the eye apelles drew his portraits so true and like both in air and every thing else relating to the face that certain horoscope-maker could on sight of them tell the temperament or constitution of the person painted and what would befal him- twas this painter ’ care therefore rather to observe truth in his portraits than to embellish them with falsities in effect truth has in this case so many charms that it ought to be always preferr ’ to borrow ’ beauty since without it portraits can-only preserve à vague and confufed idea of our friends and not the true character of their persons what can be inferr ’ from all this rea- soning but that there is in painting pri¬ mary an essential truth which leads the painter directly tohis end an animated truth which not only subsists and lives of itself but also gives life to all the embellisbments of which it is susceptible and which ought to be joined with it and that these per- fections are but secondary truths which by themselves have no force to move but yet do do honour to the primary truth when added to it now this primary truth in painting is as we have said simple and faithful imitation of the motions which express na- ture and of objects such as at first sight they present themselves to the eye with all their varieties and in theif true characters it appears therefore that every painter who not only neglects the primary truth but does not take great pains to make him- self thoroughly master of it will only build upon sand and will never pafs for genuine imitator of nature and that the whole per- fection of painting consists in the three forts of truth we have endeavoured to establish rom monsieur du copy of letter guet to à lady of quality who bad sent him the preceding discourse and had asked bis opinion of it march discourse of truth in painting madam has better informed and pleased me than those other discourses with which you know was so well satisfied it appears to me not only to be summary of the rules but also to discover the foundation and ultimate end of them and have there earned with great pleasure the secret of reconciling two things which took to be opposite the art of imitating nature and that of going beyond this imitation by fadding to her beauties in order- to attain them and of correcting her to make her more apparent the simple truth gives life and motion and the ideal chuses with art every thing that can either adorn or make it moving yet does not chuse but from the simple truth which indeed is barren in some parts but upon the whole is rich and fruitful now if the secondary truth does not support the primary but rather overpowers it and hinders it from being more apparent than any addition from the secondary art departs in this case from nature takes her place instead of representing her disappoints the spectator ’ expectation and not his eye and warns him of the snare instead of con- cealing it from him if on the other hand the primary truth has all the truth of life and motion and is wanting in that nobleness exactness and grace which sometimes are only to be found elsewhere if it subsists without any aid from the secondary which is always great and perfect it pleases no fur- ther than it is agreeable and finish ’ and the copy has nothing that was missed in the original the use we are therefore to make of this secondary truth is to supply every subject with those things which it has not but inight have and such as nature has distri- buted among others and thus to unite those perfections which nature has commonly separated the secondary truth is strictly speaking very near as real as the primary for it does not invent it chuses from all parts it studies whatever may please instruct or animate nothing escapes it not even what would seem to have escaped it by chance it catches by means of design what does but once appear and enriches itself with thou- fand different beauties that it may be always uniform and never fall into repetitions tis for this reason methinks that the union of these two truths has so surprising an effect for this union produces perfect imitation of what is most ingenious most moving and most perfect in nature every thing here is probable because it is true but surprising because it is rare every thing strikes because every thing that is capable of striking has been observed yet nothing appears affected or overdone be- cause there is nothing here that is wonderful and perfect which has not been copied from nature tis departing from the rules and the end of painting to let any one beauty over- power another or to aim at à reputation for any one part and not for the whole de- sign skill in anatomy and even the desire to please and be approved should all be subservient to truth true painting in- short ought to transport the spectator from the very first moments he sees it and not to give him leave till afterwards to think of the painter and admire his art monsieur du piles has very hap- pily displayed the character of titian for the simple truth in its greatest force and that of raphael for ennobling the simple truth with the ideal and know not whe- ther any more refined or more universal me- thod could be found for judging of the merit of the greatest painters than going even beyond their efforts and their success and pointing out the union of the two truths which they have endeavoured after but have not attained as the utmost stretch of the art iknow not madam why say so much on this subject if not to let you see how full am-of what have been reading and what value set on such things as can help repeating to you though am sensible that in so doing spoil and weaken them iam madam with all imaginable respect your most humble and most obedient servant norder to observe some method in treat- ing of the several parts of painting we may consider it in two lights either with regard to the young student or to the perfect artist lf it is considered according to the method in which it is learned we must begin with designing then treat of colouring and end with composition be- cause ’ tis to no purpose to think what we would imitate if we know not how to imitate it and because objects can only be represented by design and colouring but if we consider this art in its perfection and according to the order in which it is ex- ecuted and if besides we suppose the painter to have acquired perfect habit in the several parts so as to execute them with facility the first part that offers itself will be invention for before he can represent objects he must determine which he would tis in this second light am represent here to consider painting that may give an idea of it suitable to the taste of -the greatest number of readers several authors who treat of paint- ing make use of the word invention to express different things some would convey such an idea by it as they take to compre- hend the whole composition of picture others have ascribed to it fertility of genius newness of thoughts and the method of expressing them and of treating the same subject in different ways but though these particulars are extremely proper for support- ing invention for ofnamenting it and giving it heat and life they are neither the ground nor the essence of invention for painter who is not master of all these things may nevertheless do his part in invention by the justnefs of his thoughts the prudence of his choice and the solidity of his judg- ment invention therefore as it is but apart of composition can not give perfect idea of it for composition implies both invention and disposition ’ tis one thing to invent ob- jects and another to place them rightly shall not stop here to refute the other ideas which have been entertained of invention as hope to define it in so true and obvious manner that imagine there will be no diversity of opinions on this subject take invention to be choice of the objects that enter into the composition of the subject which the painter would treat of say choice because objects ought not to be brought into picture inconsiderately and without contributing to the expression and character of the subject say that these objects ought to enter into the compo¬ sition but not wholly compose the picture to the end that invention may not be con- founded with disposition and may leave it at full liberty to act its part which consists in placing the aforesaid objects to the best advantage poets as well as orators have their different styles to exprefs themselves in ac- cording to the several subjects they treat of and upon this depends the choice of words of harmony and of the turn which they give to their thoughts tis the same in painting when the painter has chosen his subject he must chuse his figures and their dependencies accordingly the painter as well as the poet has his sublime style for things that are elevated his familiar style for common things his pastoral style for the country and so forth now though all these various styles fall in with all the parts of painting they are nevertheless in more particular manner the province of invention but this point would require à treatise of itself invention as it relates to painting may be considered in three respects it is either simply historical or allegorical or mystical painters with reason use the word history to signify the highest kind of paint- ing which consists in bringing many figures together and ’ tis usual to say such painter does bistory such one paints beasts such one landstip such one flowers and so forth but there is difference between the division of the kinds of painting and the division of invention here take the word bistory in large sense and mean by it every thing that can either fix the painter ’ idea or inform the spectator say there- fore that invention simply historical is such choice of objects as simply of themselves represent à subject this kind of invention comprises not only all sorts of history whether true or fabulous as related by authors or established by tradition but also portraiture views of countries beasts and all the productions of art and nature for in painting picture the artist must not only have his pallet and pen- cils in readiness but as we have said he must before he begins resolve upon what he would paint though but flower fruit plant or insect for though the artist may confine his genius to such things they are often capable of yielding instruction as they have their particular virtues and proprieties those who have written of them and have set off their works with demonstrative figures are- called historians and we say the history of plants the history of animals as well as that of alexander the great invention simply historical has therefore its degrees and is more or lefs valuable according to the quantity of its matter the nature of its choice and the genius with which it is ma¬ naged allegorical invention is choice cf objects that serve to represent mn piece either wholly or partly what in fact they are not such for instance is the painting of apelles representing slander as described by lucian such also is the moral painting of hercules placed between vezus and mi- nerva where those pagan deities are only introduced to shew the force of virtue and such is the picture of the school ef athens in chambet of the vatican where several figures of different times countries and conditions are brought together to re- present philosopby the three other pictures in the same chamber are drawn in the same allegorical manner and if we consider the transactions recorded in the old testament they will appear to be partly allegorical as well as simply historical because they are- the types of what should come to pass under the new llaw these are examples of sub- jects which are wholly allegorical the works which are but partly alle engage our attention more easily and more agreeably because the spectator ebeing assisted by thé mixture of figures purely historical distinguishes with pleasure the allegorical figures that are joined with them we have an authentick example of this in the bas-reliefs of the antonine column where the sculptor being to express some rain which the christian army obtained by their prayers has introduced among the sol- diers raining jupiter having his beard and heir covered with water which falls from thence in abundance now jupiter is not place there as god who makes part of the story but as à symbol of rain after the manner of the heathens antient authors speaking of the paintings of their times re- late many examples in allegory and since the revival of the art painters have made frequent use of them and if some have abused them ’ twas because they knew not that allegory is kind of language which ought to be common among several people this happened in the reign of the emperor marcus aurelius who erected the column here mentioned on which were represented in bas-relief the wars he waged with the germans and sarmatians and in gratitude placed on it the statue of antoninus who had adopted him to the empire and is founded on received usage and the knowledge of books and medals and chose rather than consult them to invent parti- cular allegory which tho ingenious could not be understood by any but themselves mysticae invention respects the chri- stian religion its end is to instruct us in some mystery grounded on scripture which mystery is represented to us by several objects that concur to point out some truth.. our mysteries and the points of faith which the church has injoined furnish great many examples the second council of nice having allowed of setting before the eyes of the faithful the mystery of the trinity painters represent the father under the figure of venerable old man the son in his hu- manity as he appeared to his disciples after the resurrection and the holy ghest in the form of dove the last judgment the church triumphant matters relating to the law to faith and the sacrament come un- der the same denomination among the many examples which able painters have left us shall mention most ingenious one colour ’ sketch of which have by me and prize highly the subject is the mystery of the incarnation now had the author of this design been willing to treat the an¬ nunciation historically he might have only drawn the virgin mary in plain room without other company than the angel but being being resolved to treat the subject mystically he has placed her on kind of throne or half-pace where on her knees she receives humbly but with dignity the angel ’ em- bassy whilst god the father having settled with his son the price of mans redemption assists as it were at the performance of the contract the father is seated majestically on the globe of the world encompassed by the celestial choir and having at his right and justification and peace which it had been agreed to bestow on the whole earth he sends his holy spirit to work this great mystery the holy spirit is surrounded with circle of angels holding each others hands and exulting because mankind were to fill up the places of the bad angels several angels terminating this celestial part of the piece have in their hands different attributes which the church ascribes to the holy vir- gin to shew that of all mankind she was the worthiest of the grace with which she was filled all this great sight takes up the upper part of the piece beneath are the patriarchs who longed for the coming of the messiab the prophets who foretold it the sibyls who spoke of it and the little genii reconciling the passages of the sibyls with those of the prophets thus does this picture mystically display the truth and grandeur of its subject have now gone through the three ways in which we may conceive invention to wit as either simply historical or allego- rical or mystical let us now see what they have in common one with another after which we shall speak of the qualities peculiar to each of them painter of genius finds in all the parts of his art ample matter to make it appear but the part that gives him most opportunities of shewing his sense imagin- ation and judgment is without doubt tis by means of invention that painting goes hand in hand with poesy it is chiefly invention that gains the esteem of the better fort mean persons of judgment who not satisfied with the bare imitation of objects would have the choice of them to be just in order to express the subject but this very genius must be cultivate the knowledges that relate to painting because let the imagination be ever so bright it can only bring forth such things as the understanding is already filled with and the memory supplies us with no other ideas but those of what we know and have seen accordingly the talents of particular men are either sunk in the lowness of com- mon objects or else rise to the sublime by searching for such as are extraordinary for this reason some painters who have cul- tivated their parts have happily supplied want of genius and raising themselves with their subject their subject has been observed to rise and grow greater on their hands without the neceffary parts of knowledge one is liable to many mistakes but when we are possessed of them every thing pre- sents itself regularly and comes insensibly into order tis nevertheless convenient for young people after having studied the essentials of their art and before they give publick proofs of their abilities to exercise their genius on all forts of subjects because like new wine which violently ferments that it may be- come in time more palatable they at first give themselves wholly up to the impetuosity of their imagination but when their first sallies are evaporated the images of their conceptions without losing their force grow more clear and purified but if they do not trust so much to their own understandings as not to consult their knowing friends on the kind and measure of their talents they ought to consider them as plant which must be set in particular fort of ground prefer- ably to any other in order to yield its fruit in its season in the same manner if the painter can chuse his owa subject he ought to prefer that which best suits the nature and compass of his genius aad affords him mat- ter for exercising it in the manner for which he is best furnished to give heat to his imagination imagination he must turn his ideas into dif- ferent shapes he must read his subject se- veral times with great attention that lively image of it may be form ’ in his mind and that in proportion to the greatness of the matter he may suffer himself to be trans- ported even to enthusiasm which is the distinguishing quality both of great painter and great poet as the painter can represent in the same piece no more of nature than what is to be seen at one glance of the eye he can not for this reason exhibit in the same piece what passed at different times and if some have taken the liberty to do otherwise they are inexcusable for it unlefs they were forced to do it by those who employed them or unless they meant to compose mysterious or allegorical subject like the picture of the school of athens but after the subject is well fix it is extremely proper to introduce such circum- stances as serve to fortify its character and make it known they must not however be so numerous as to tire the attention but rather so judiciously chosen as to give an agreeable exercise to the mind these cir- cumstances relate to place time and per- sons thus whilst the artist is instructing the spectator he ought besides to divert him with variety this variety appears in the sexes ages countries conditions atti- tudes tudes expressions diversity of animals stuffs trees buildings and every thing that can exercise the mind and properly set off the scene of the picture would not how- ever approve of this abundance of objects and of this variety how pleasing soever in other respects but so far as it is suitable to the subject or at least has some instructive relation to it for as some subjects breathe nothing but joy and tranquillity so there are others which are either mournful or tumultuary some require gravity dignity respect silence and sometimes solitude and consequently admit but of few figures as there are others which are susceptible of great many and of such variety of objects as the skill of the painter thinks proper to introduce for the whole must have ten- dency to the hero of the subject and pre- serve an unity well expressed and well con- ceived these are the general properties of the three kinds of invention it remains to con¬ sider what is peculiar to each of them among the properties of which in- vention simply historical is susceptible observe three fidelity perspicuity or clear- ness and good choice have elsewhere obierved that fidelity in history is not the essence of painting but only necessary ap- pendage to the art for though the painter be only an historian by accident he is ne- vertheless vertheless to blame if he does not acquit himself well in what he has undertaken by fidelity mean an exact imitation of things whether true or fabulous as trans- mitted to us either by authors or by tra- dition and it is not to be doubted but the more fidelity such an imitation preserves the greater force does it give to the invention and the greater value to the painting but if the painter has been careful to stamp his subject with some mark of erudition such as may awaken the spectator ’ attention without destroying the truth of history if he can blend some poetical passage with those historical facts that admit of it in word if he can treat his subject with that moderate licence which is allowed both to painters and poets he will make his inven- tions sublime and will gain himself distin- guished reputation fidelity therefore is the first property of historical invention the second is perspicuity or clearness so that the spectator if sufficiently acquainted with history may easily discover what par- ticular passage the painter would represent whence it follows that all ambiguity must be removed by some peculiar mark of the subject that may distinguish it from any other speak here of subjects which are uncommon for these which are generally known and are often repeated have no need of this precaution if the subject is not not enough known or if the painter can not well bring in some object to explain it he ought to make no difficulty of inserting motto or inscription of the many ex- amples of this kind both antient and mo- dern shall chusé only two which are well known one of raphael and the other of hannibal caracche the latter having painted in the farnesian gallery the story of anchises endeavouring to give proofs of his love to the goddess venus lest anchises should be mistaken for adonis has artfully made use of virgil ’ words genus unde latinum which he write beneath the bed on the bottom of the alcove and raphael on his parnassis having placed sappho among the poets has writ the name of that learned dame lest sne should be taken for one of the muses the third property of historical inven- tion is the choice of the subject supposing the painter has the power to chuse for re- markable subject furnisnes most opportunities of enriching the scene and commanding attention but if the painter bestows his pencil upon little subject he must endear vour to make it great by the extraordinary manner in which he treats it allegorical invention in like man- er has three properties the first is that alluding to the origin of the italian race it it be intelligible tis great fault to keep the attention long in suspense by means of new-invented- symbols as ’ tis perfection to entertain it for some moments by such alle- gorical figures as are known generally re- ceived and ingeniously employed obscurity tires the mind but perspicuity makes it en¬ joy the discovery with pleasure the second property of allegory is its authority caesar ripa has written volume upon this point which is in the hands of the painters but the best things in this author are his extracts from the antique medals and indeed the best authority for allegories is antiquity because ’ tis incontestable the third property of allegory is that it be necessary for as far as history can be explained by fimple objects which belong it ’ tis needlefs to seek for foreign aids which serve rather to embarass than adorn such subject mystical invention as it is intirely devoted to religion must be pure and free from any mixture of objects drawn from fable it must be grounded either on scripture or the ecclesiastical history we have ample matter for this kind of invention in our sa- viour ’ parables and in the apocalypse obscurity of which we ought to reve- rence but are not obliged to imitate the holy spirit which breathes where it pleases sicut tenebræ ejus ita et lumen ejus nakes itself intelligible when it pleases but he painter who can neither penetrate nor iter the spectator ’ understanding ought to se his utmost efforts to be understood as nothing is more sacred more grand nore permanent than the mysteries of our eligion they can ’ be treated in style that too majestick all that pleases does not lways please and the greatest pleasures ommonly end in aversion but that which reates an idea of grandeur and magnificence ndures for ever to conclude in whatever manner the part of invention be discharged it must ap- pear to be the effect of an easy genius rather than of laborious reflection and as there are talents for attaining facility there are also talents for concealing labour and each have heir merit and their partizans happy is the man on whom nature has bestowed genius able to run through the vast race in this part of painting and to chuse his objects well in order to make his subject intelligible in order to enrich it and instruct the spectator but still more happy is the artist who after knowing every thing that contributes to fine invention knows himself still better and makes proper esti- mate of his own abilities since it is the glory of painter not so much to undertake great things as to execute well what he undertakes description of the school of athens painting of raphael referred to in the preceding discourse of invention this picture usually called the scheol of athens has been variously under- stood by those who have described it and it is surprising that among others who have publisned an explication of it vasari cotemporary of rapbael should have made so great mistake as to neglect con- sulting him that he might draw from the source itself those instructions he had oc- casion for to explain work which has made so much noise throughout all italy this author who first wrote of it says pat it is the agreement of philosophy and astro- logy with divinity and yet there appears no mark of divinity in the whole compo- sition the engravers of it have as im- properly put an inscription under it taken from from the acts of st. paul to induce us to be¬ fieve that this apostle after having met with an altar on which was inscrihed to the unknown god is here presenting himself before the judges of the areopagus to give them the knowledge of the god they were ignorant of and to instruct them in te article of the resurrection of the dead about which the epicureans and stoicks were then disputing agostino venetiano is yet more grosly mistaken when in his print of five or six of the figures which are towards the right-hand in the aforesaid piece he has supposed the philosopher who is writing to be st. maré and the young man with one knee on the ground to be the angel gabriel holding table on which is engraved the angel ’ salutation — ave maria as ’ tis needless to spend much time here in refuting these errors which are equally gross shall only describe the four cieling figures which correspond with the four subjects painted in the chamber where this stands and which evidently point them out the first represents tbeology with these words — scientia divinarum rerum thie knowledge of things divine the second is philosopby with these words — causarum cognitio the know- ledge of causes the third is jurisprudence or knowlédge in the law with these words-— jus situmi unicuique doing right to every one and the fourth reprefents poesy with these words -- numine afflatur inspired by the deity now in the piece called the school of athens the figure of pbilosophy is placed uppermost and therefore it can not be doubted but that this painting represents philosopby as will appear more clearly from the particular description am going to give of it the scene opens with building of mag- nificent architecture consisting of arcades and pilasters and so disposed as to render the prospect of them gradually diminishing and the break advantageous and to give grand idea of the subject the place is filled with philosophers mathematicians and others who give themselves up to the sciences and as it is only through course of time that philosophy is come to that degree of per- fection in which we see it raphael who had mind to represent this science by an af- sembly of philosophers could not effect it by putting together only those of one age the painter ’ intention was not to compose simple history but an allegory where the diversity of times and countries does not hinder the unity of the subject raphael has taken this method in drawing the three other other pictures in the same chamber to wit theology jurisprudence and poesy in the first of which we see the several fathers of the church in the second the lawyers and in the third the poets of all ages from the disposition of the sigures in this piece and from the nature of their seve- ral employments we may safely conclude that it must be meeting and society of men possessed of several parts of know- ledge such as the philosophers nay we discover among them pythagoras socrates plato aristotie and their disciples and mixed with them we see persons employd in mathematical sciences in the middle of the piece are placed uppermost the two most celebrated philo- sophers of antiquity plato and aristotle the former holds under his left-arm book the stalian word for the title of which is written timeo platos finest dialogue and as this book treats mystically of natural things compared to divine this philosopher has his right-arm raised and points with it to heaven as the supreme cause of all things on the left-side of plato is his disciple aristotle holding book on his thigh on which is written the word ethica or the science of manners to which this philosopher chiefly applied himself and his arm being stretched out gives him the attitude of peace- peace-maker and moderator of the pas- sions character perfectly agreeable to moral philosophy on each side of these two great philoso- phers are their disciples of all ages so art- fully grouped and disposed as to set off the two heroes of the piece to great advantage and tho the attitudes of these disciples are very different yet they all shew great attention to the words of their masters behinp platos hearers is socrates turned towards alcibiades who is opposite to him both are in profile the former is known by his bald head and flat nose and the latter is handsome young inan in warrior ’ dress with his flaxen hair flowing on his shoulders his armour edged with gold ornament and one hand on his side and the other on his sword and as he was both philosopher and warrior he gives great attention to the discourse of socrates which the latter enforces with very expressive action he extends both his hands and takes with his right the tip of the first singer of the left to shew that he is explaining and illustrating his thoughts so as to make them thoroughly understood while all his disciples are attending to what he says next to alcibiades is antisthenes the currier in whom socrates discovered so great propensity to philosophy that he instructed him in the principles of it and antisthe- nes nes quitting his trade became famous professor of moral philosophy upon which he wrote thirty-three dialogues tis he who is the chief of the cynick sect the painter to vary his figures and give them motion has set behind alcibiades man turning about and holding out his hand to call fater the italian manner and hasten à ser- vant who brings book and great roll of papers to which the antients gave the name of volumes and behind the servant appears the face of another who with his and to his cap seems respectfully to an- wer the person who calls among aristotle ’ disciples raphael has in like manner displayd their attention to their master ’ words one among the rest having understood the demonstrations of archimedes is leaving according to the greek custom the mathematick school to go to that of pbilosopby and meeting with person on the way he inquires of him where the science may be learnt and is directed to aristotle and plato hard by this figure is studious young man leaning upon the base of pilaster with his legs across and writing down on paper what he wants to learn while an old man learning on the same base and resting his chin on his hand is seriously weighing what the young man has been riting among other figures that terminate thio side of the picture is democritus wrapt up in his cloak he walks in the asfembly after the manner of blind men by the help of his stick for near the end of his life he blinded himself of his ewn accord that he mighe not be disturbed in his philosophical contemplations the painter may have re- presented him in great old age to shew that man should labour even to his grave to and undeceive himself in the group on the right-side of the piece and on the first ground ’ tis easy to discovet pythagoras seated who writes the principles of his philosophy taken from che harmonick proportions in musick next to him is young man holding table on which are in greeè characters the accords and consonances of singing which are read cus — diapente diapason diates- saron— terms well known to able mu- ficians it is even said that this philo- sopher is the author of the demonstration of these consonances of which plato his disciple formed the accords and barmonick proportions of the soul pythagoras sits profile-wise with book in his lap he appears intent upon shewing the relation of mufical numbers to cic de finito bon et mal idem tusc aal gel ex laborum mimis the the science of natural things near to him are his disciples empedocles epicharmes ar¬ chitas one sitting by his master and bald- headed writes on his knee having his ink- horn in one hand and his pen held up in the other his eyes very open and mouth shut to shew him very careful not to let any of his master ’ writing be lost behind this philosopher another dis- ciple with his hand on his breast comes forward to lcok into the book he has cap on his chin is shaved but he has bold pair of whiskers and his cloak is clasp all this decoration probably tends only to shew the variety raphael always aimed at in his works behind this group are seen the face and hand of another philosopher who some- what stooping opens his two first fingers as if he was reckoning after the italian man- ner and seeming to explain the diapason which is the double consonance described by pythagoras in corner of the piece is person shaved with book resting on the pedestal of column in which he is earnestly writing this figure is thought to be the portrait of some officer in the pope ’ palace because he is crowned with oak-leaves which were the device of pope julius ii to whom as his benefactor and the reviver of the golden age in italy with regard to the fine arts raphael dedicated this work hard by and at the extremity of the picture we see an old man with little boy in his arms who in manner suitable to his age reaches out his hand to book wherein the old man is writing it looks as if he had brought the boy thither purely to discover whether he had any inclination for the sciences intimating that we can not too soon discover and cultivate the talent which nature has given us on the side of this group of figures ap- pears young man of noble mien in white cloak fringed with gold with his hand on his breast this is believed to be fran- cisco maria de la rovere the pope ’ nephew and that he is introduced into the piece on account of the love he had for the fine arts little more before pythagoras an¬ other of his disciples with one foot on stone and his knee raised appears with book in one hand and copying with the other some remarkable passages which he would reconcile with his master ’ sentiments this man may well be taken for terpander or nicomachus or some other disciple of pythagoras who believed that the motion of the stars depended on mufical principles more forward we see philosopher by himself leaning with his elbow on marble base base has pen in his hand and looks stedfastly upon the ground as if he was intent upon the solution of some great diffi- iculty he is coarsely clad and his stoekings hang out his heels to shew that philo- sophers little regard dress and place all their pleasure in reflection and the improvement of their understanding on the second step appears diogenes by himself half naked and with his cloak slung back and by himn is his dish as his badge of distinction his attitude is negli- gent and becoming cynick who is so much taken up with morality as to despise wordly pomp and grandeur on the left side are seen several mathe- maticians whose science though it consists of what falls under the senses yet has re- lation to philosophy which considers things intellectual the first of these persons is archimedes under the likeness of the archi- tect bramante he stoops and with arms bending downwards is measuring with the compasses an bexagonal figure composed of two equilateral triangles and seems to demonstrate some property of it to his scholars he has about him four disciples well-made who in different actions discover eitheir ardent desire to learn or the pleasure they have in conceiving what they are taught they are painted youthful be- cause it was necessary to learn the mathema- ticks ticks before one could proceed to philosophy the first of them has knee on the ground his body bent and his hand on his thigh and the fingers spread he is attentive to the aforesaid demonstrative figure the second disciple who stands behind him rests his hand on his companions back thrusts out his head and earnestly observes the motion of the compasses the two other disciples next to archimedes are advanced very for- ward to see commodioussy the foremost having knee on the ground turns about and shews the figure to the person behind him who stooping discovers to us by his arms crossed and advanced his admiration and the pleasure he sinds in instruction vasarz will have this to be the figure of frederick il duke of mantua who was then at rome behinp archimedes are two philoso- phers one holding the celestial globe and the other the terrestrial the first by his garb seems to have some relation to the chaldaeans the inventors of aftronomy and the other who turns his back and has royal crown on his head is presumed to be zoroaster king of the bactrians who was great astronomer and great philosopher these two sages are conversing with two young men who are at the corner of the picture one of whom is raphael himself in in this learned sublime and judicious manner has raphael chosen his subjects and thus produced one of the finest inventions of the ’ kind that ever appeared but not con- tent to illustrate his subject by the several persons who enter into it he was also de- sirous that the statues and bas-reliefs which adorn thé architecture should contribute to the richness and expression of his thoughts accordingly the two statues one on each side the picture are those of apollo and mi- nerva the deities who preside over arts and sciences in the bas-relief under apollo ’ figure is represented the emblém of zraf- cible and concupiscible passions tne one by furzous man who outrageoussy insults all he meets with and the other by triton em- bracing nymph ’ on the element which gave birth to venus and as vice is only to be subdued by virtue which is its opposite the painter has in the bas-relief under mi- herva ’ figure placed virtue sitting on the clouds with one hand on her breast the seat of valour and indicating to mortals by the sceptre in her other hand the power of her empire near her is the figure of the lion in the zodiack the emblem of force which in the moral science can only be gained by good habits thus has raphael with beauty of genius delicacy of thought and solidity of judgment set before us the allegorical subyect of philosopby ue of disposition my division of painting ihave assigned to composition which is the first part of it two things to wit invention and disposition and in treating of invention have shewn that it consists in finding objects proper for the subject the painter would re- present if they are not well distributed the composition will never give full satisfaction to the unbiassed spectator nor have ge- neral approbation but however advanta- geous the subject be however ingenious the invention however faithful the imitation of the objects chosen oconomy and good order is what gives value to every thing and in the fine arts draws attention and fixes it till the mind is replenished with whatever in such work can both instruct and please and this aconomy properly call disposition in which are six parts viz the distribution of objects in general the grouping the choice of attitudes the contrast the the cast of draperies and the effect of the whole together where shall occasionally speak of harmony and enthusiasm these in their order shall examine as succinctly and clearly as possibly can of the distribution of objects in general as the subjects which painters may treat of are innumerable it is not possible to- relate them all here much less to shew their par- ticular dispositions but good sense and the nature of the matter must in general de- termine the artist to assign to his objects such places as are proper to make the composition good in compofitzon the painter ought to con- trive as much as he possibly can that the spectator may at first sight be struck with the character of the subject or at least may after some moments of reflection take the principal scope of it it will greatly con- tribute to this end that he place the hero and the principal figures in the most con- spicuous places yet this must be done without affectation and in such man- ner as the subject and probability require for oconomy or management depends upon the nature of the subject which may be either pathetick or gay heroick or po- pular tender or terrible in short the pic- ture must have more or less motion as its subie ct subject is more or less stirring or still as the subject points out to the artist the proper ceconomy in the disposition of objects so distribution in its turn wonderfully con- tributes to the expression of the subject gives both force and grace to what is in- ven ted prevents confusion in the figures and makes every thing in the picture more clear more apparent and more capable to pro- duce the effect above-mentioned of calling to aud detaining the spectator of the grouping the aforesaid distribution of objects does in general respect grouping and the groups proceed from the joining of objects together now this joining or combination may be con- sidered two ways either with regard to design alone or with regard to the claro- obscuro both of which concur to hinder the eye from being dissipated and to fix it agreeably the joining of objects with regard only to design that is without taking in the claro- obscuro principally respects human figures the actions conversations or affinities of which often require that they be near one another but though these circumstances do not always happen where several persons meet together yet it is sufficient that the thing be possible and that there be figures enongh enough in the composition of the picture to give the painter an opportunity of displaying his art and pleafing the eye by joining the figures together when he thinks it agreeable and probable tis impossible to enter into such detail as to shew how these different kinds of groups must be managed the painter must in this case rest upon his own genius and reflec- tions nevertheless in order to form just idea and good taste of them he ought to consult the fine grouping in the pictures of the best mafters especially raphael julio romano and polydore who have often com- bined several figures in such manner as to discover all the judgment and all the beau- ties that can be desired in grouping but before the artist makes this examination he must be apprised that the joining or com- bination we speak of derives its best principles from the choice of attitudes and fine con- trast of the choice of attitudes the part of painting which falls under- the word attitude as it comprehends all the motions of the body and requires perfect knowledge of ponderation ought to be tho- roughly examined in particular treatise that may have relation to design and as it likewise falls within the province of dispo- sition with regard to the groups we talk of shall only observe upon this occasion that whatever attitude be given to the figures let the subject be what it will this attitude must shew their beautiful parts as much as the subject will permit and must besides have such turn as without departing from probability or from the character of the figure may diffuse beauty over the action in effect there is nothing in imitation ut what is susceptible of some grace either by the choice or by the manner of imitating is graceful exprefsion of the vices as well as of the virtues the outward actions of soldier have particular grace which would ill become woman as the actions of woman have grace which would not become the soldier in fine the each object and chiefly depends upon its sex age and condition is the foundation of good choice and the source of the graces proper for each figure tis easy therefore to observe that the choice of fine attitudes makes the greatest part of the beauties of grouping let us now see what affistance the contrast affords in this point of the contrast if in grouping the attitudes must not be repeated in the same view and if diversity be part of the graces of nature those graces can ’ be better discovered than in the variety and opposition of motion the word contrast is not much in use except among painters who took it froni the italians it signifies an opposition among objects with regard to lines which either wholly or partly compose them it takes in not only the different motions of figures but also the different situations of the members and of all other objects which meet together yet in such manner as to appear without affectation and only to give more energy to the expression of the subject now the painter who disposes his objects to advantage contrastes not only his figures but also inanimate objects that by such con- trast he may breathe into them kind of life and motion contrast therefore may be defned to be such an oppositzon of lines that form objects as makes those objects set off one anotber this opposition if well expressed gives life to objects commands attention and in- creases that gracefulness which is necessary in groups at least in those that relate to design and the conjunction of attitudes we have before observed that the first sort of groups as relating to design princi- pally belongs to human figures but those groups which relate to the claro-obscuro take in all sorts of objects they require not only knowledge in the lights and shades of of every particular object but also in the effects which those lights and shades are ca- pable of producing by their asfemblage or union and it is this which is properly called the- art of the claro-obscuro which shall treat of with as much exactness as possible when come to speak of colouring of the cast of draperies the chief beauty of draperies lies in proper cast or distribution of the folds and as they are of frequent use in grouping this subject must needs be considered as depend- ing partly on disposition therefore refer to what shall say hereafter on the subject of draperiès of the whole together the last point depending on disposition is the whole togetber which is the result of the parts that compose the piece but the whole arising from the combination of se- veral objects must not be like number made up of several unities independent and equal among themselves but like one poeti- cal whole where the great have need of the lower people and these have need of the great all the objects lines colours lights and shades of picture are great or small strong or weak only by comparison but let let their natures qualities or conditions be what they will they have such relation to one another in their combination as no one in particular can supersede for the effect of the whole consists in general subordina- tion where the darks heighten the lights and the lights set off the darks and where the merit of each part is founded on mutual dependence so that we may define the whole together to be such general subor- dination of objects one to another as makes them all concur to constitute but one now this subordination by which se- veral objects concur to make but one is founded on two principles viz the satis- faction of the eye and the effect of vision and this shall explain the eye has this in common with the other organs of sense that it cares not to be obstructed in its office and it must be agreed that great many people met in one place and talking together at the same time and with the same tone of voice so as that no one in particular could be distinguished would give pain to those who heard them it is just so in picture where many objects painted with equal force and illuminated by the same light would divide and perplex the sight which being drawn to several parts at once would be at loss where to fix or else being desirous to take in the whole whole at one view must needs do it imper- fectly now to hinder the eye from being dis- sipated we must endeavour to fix it agree- ably by combinâtion of lights and shades by an union of colours and by oppositions wide enough to support the groups and give them repose but where the picture has several groups one of them must predomi- nate in force and colour and besides de- tached objects must be so united with their ground as to make but one mafs that may serve as rèpose to the principal objects the satisfaction of the eye is therefore one of the foundations upon which the unity of objects in painting depends the other foundation of this same unity is the effect of vision and the manner of its operation now the eye is at liberty to see all the objects about it by fixing succes- sively on each of them but when ’ tis once fix ’ of all thofe objects there is but one which appears in the centre of vision that can be clearly and distinctily seen the rest because seen by oblique rays become obscure and confused in proportion as they are out of the direct ray this truth appears as oft as we direct our eye to any object suppose my eye for instance at plate directed to the object by the strait line ab tis certain that if do not move my eye and yet would observe the other objects which can can only beeen by oblique lines to the right and left of ae shall find that though they are all in the same circular line and at the same distance from my eye yet they decrease both in force and colour in pro- portion as they recede from the strait line which is the centre of vision whence it follows that vision proves the uinity of an object in nature now if nature which is wise and which in supplying our -wants accompanies those supplies with pleasure thus brings several objects into one glance of the eye so as to make them but one sne instructs the painter to take the same method in such mannêr as his art and the natire of the subject will permhit this observation seëms to me not unworthy of his notice if he would emhploy liis art for the satisfaction of thé eye after the examiple of nature whom he imitâtes another experimient may be made by thè convex mirrour which improves upon nature as to the unity of the object in vision- all objects that afe seen there with one glance of the eye make together one whole and whole much more agreeable than that which the fame objects would produce in an ordinary glafs or will venture to say even in nature itself suppose this convex mir- rour to be of à reasonable size and not one of those which being segments of small circle impair the forms of objects too much let me observe by the way that glasses of this sort which are become pretty rare might be usefully consulted for particular objects as well as in general for the whole together after all the painter must consult him- self in his undertakings for if his work be large he may compose it of several groups which may after the first view be capable of fixing the eye by the help of well-ma¬ naged reposes and become in their turn so many centres of vifion thus the judicious painter ought to contrive so that after the first view let his work be ever so large the eye may take it in successively it remains that we now speak of won- derful effect which the whole together pro¬ duces and it is that of putting all the objects into harmony for harmony where-ever it appears proceeds from arrangement and good order there is harmony in moral as well as in natural philosophy in the con- duct of human life as well as in the pro¬ portions of the human body and in short in every thing that consists of parts which however different from one another yet agree to make but one whole more or less general now as this order must be sup- posed to exist in all parts of painting sepa¬ rately we must infer that each part has its particular harmony but it is not enough that each part has its particular arrangement and propriety they must all agree together in in the picture and make but one harmo- nious whole in the same manner as it is not enough in concert of musick that each part be heard distinctly and follow the particular arrangement of its notes they must all agree together in harmony which unites them and which out of several par- ticular wholes makes but orie whole that is general this is what painting does by the subordination of objects groups colours and lights in the general of picture there are in painting several sorts of harmony the sweet and the temperate as usually practised by correggio and guido reni and the strong and great as that of giorgione titian and caravaggio and these may be in different degrees according to places times light and the bours of the day great light in close place produces strong shades the same in an open country requires broken colouring and sweet shadow- ing in short the skilful painter knows what use he ought to make not only of the seasons of the year but of the times of the day and of the accidents that happen either in the skies or on the earth in order to bring all as we have said into one har- monious whole this is the idea have conceived of what is called in painting the whole together- and have endeavoured to make it under- stood as machine whose wheels give each other mutual assistance as body whose members have mutual dependence and in short as an harmonious oconomy which stops and entertains the spectator and invites him to please himself with con- templating the particular beauties of the picture if we do but little reflect on what have said of disposition we shall find that this part of painting as it includes great many others is of very great consequence because it gives value to every thing that invention has supplied it with and to every thing that is most proper to make an impres- sion upon the eye and the mind of the spectator able painters may know by their own experience that in order to succeed in so refiried part they must rise higher than ordinary and as it were be transported out of themselves which gives me occasion to say something here of enthusiasm and the sublime of enthusiasm enthusiasm is transport of the mind which makes us conceive things after sublime surprising and probable manner now as he who considers work is raised to that degree of elevation which he finds in it so the transport of mind which comes up up to enthusiasin is common both to the painter and the spectator yet with this diffèrence that it has cost the painter course fo labour and repeated efforts to heat his imagination and bring his work to the per- fection of enthusiasin whereas the spectator without having the trouble to examine par- ticulars finds himself transported at once without his knowledge and as it were without his consent to that degrae of en- thusiasm which the painter inspires though truth always pleases because tis the basis of all perfcction yet ’ tis often insipid when it stands alone but joined to enthusiasm it raises the soul to kind of admiration mix with astonishment and ravishes the mind with such violence as leaves it no time to bethink itself have comprehended the sublime in the definition of enthusiasm because it is the effect and production of it enthusialin com- prehends the sublime in the same manner as the trunk contains the branches which it sends forth on all sides or rather enthu- siasm is as it were the sun which by its heat and vivifying influence produces ele- vated thoughts and brings them to such state of maturity as we call the sublime but as entbusiasin and the sublinie both tend to elevate the understanding we may con- clude them to be of the same nature with this difference that enthusiasm is rapture that carries the soul above the sublime of which it is the source and has its chief effec in the thoughts and the whole together of work whereas the sublime is perceived equally both in the general and in the par- ticulars of all the parts enthufiasm be- sides has this peculiarity that its effect is more instantaneous whereas the sublime requires at least some moments beforê it can be seen in all its force enthusiasm elevates insensibly and transports us as it were from one country to another without our perceiving it other- wise than by the pleafure it causes in short enthusiasm methinks seizes us and we seize the sublime tis therefore to this surprifing but just and reasonable pitch that the patinter as well as the poet must raise his work if he would attain to that extraor- dinary probability which shakes the heart and gives both painting and poesy their merit some fiery genius ’ have mistaken the sallies of their imagination for real enthusiasin though at bottom the abundance and vi- vacity of their productions are but the dreams of sick persons some whimsical dreams would indeed if little tempered give much genius to- the composition of picture and agreeably rouse the attention poetick fictions as plutarch says are but the the dreams of waking man but we may say likewise that some productions are only the dreams of man in burning fever which have no connexion and the dan- gerous extravagance of which ought to be avoided it is certain that men of fiery genius easily give into enthufiasm because theit imagination is almost always upon the stretch but such as burn with gentle fire and have but moderate vivacity joined with sound judgment may slide into enthu- siasm by degrees and even make it more regular by the solidity of their parts if they do not so easily and so readily enter into this fury of the painter they suffer it at least to seize them by little and little because their reflections have enabled them to see and to feel every thing and because there are not only many degrees of enthu- fiasm but likewise many ways of attaining it if painters of this sort have written subject to handle they ought to read it over and over with application and if it be not written it is proper they should chuse from among the qualities of the subject such as will best furnisn them with circumstances for setting their parts at work and keeping them in motion and when they have thus warmed their imagination by the elevation of their conceptions they will at length arrive arrive at enthusiasm and fill the spectator with admiration to dispose the mind to enthusiasm ge- nerally speaking nothing is better than to view the works of great masters and to read good authors either historians or poets be- cause of the elevation of their thoughts the noblenefs of their expression and the power which examples have over the human mind longinus in his treatise on the sublime advises those who are to write any thing that requires the great and the wonder¬ ful to look upon great authors as à taper to enlighten them and to afk themselves -—- honp would homer bave expressed this would plato demosthenes or thucy- dides bave turned itè the painter accord- ingly may upon the like occasions afk himself— hoie would raphael titian or correggio have concerved designed ordered and painted what am going to repréfent à or else as the same longinus says let us suppose à tribunal of the greatest masters before whom we must give an account of our performance what ardor would not the painter feel on the bare thought of seeing such excellent men who are theobjects of his ad- miration and confidering them as his judges hints are of use to all painters they will inflame those who are born with chap genius aijd even those to whom nature has not been so liberal will by this means feel at least some degree of heat diffusing itself in their works have endeavoured to shew in dis- coursing of invention after what manner we must chuse objects suitable to the sub- ject and have now speaking of dispo- sition shewn the order in which those objects must be ranged so as to compose one ad- vantageous whole thus by joining toge- ther invention and disposition have endea- voured to give the best idea could of that important part of painting which is called composition answers to some objections among the objections which may be made to what have been observing find two which it is very proper to answer one is against the unity of the object and the other against enthusiasmn with regard to the former it may be urged that the demonstration which has been given of vision to establish the unity of the object intirely destroys it because tis not necessary to confine the eye since in any part of the picture to which it is carried it will naturally fix itself and there- by make an unity of object without the aid of the principles of art of disposition to this make two answers first that ’ tis not proper to leave the eye at li- berty to gaze at random because if it should happen to be detained on any one side of the picture this will frustrate the painter ’ in- tention who according to the best ap- proved probability must needs have placed his chief objects in the middle and the by- objects towards the sides of the picture and with good reason since upon such dispo- sition often depends the knowledge of the whole thought of the picture- whence it follows that the eye must be fixed and that the painter ought to determine it to settle on that part of his piece which he thinks most proper for the effect of the whole the second answer is that with respect to the senses all objects of pleasure require not only the agreeablenefs they have received from nature but also the help of art to make their effects more lively by the second objection it may be insi- nuated that enthusiasm often carries some genius ’ too far and makes them infensibly pass over many faults but the answer is easy such transport is not true enthusiasm because it exceeds the bounds of that exact- ness and probability which lay down own indeed that one of the effects of en- thusiasm is that it often hides some fault by means of the transport it generally causes but this is no great misfortune for in fact enthusiasm enthusiasm with some faults will always be preferred to correct mediocrity be- cause it ravishes the soul without giving it time to examine any thing or to reflect on particulars and yet properly speaking this effect proceeds not so much from enthusiasm as from our minds which sometimes when they are transported exceed the bounds of probability ir it be still objected that all say of enthusiasm may be ascribed to the sublime answer that this depends on the idea which every one fixes upon these two words and shall at all times be ready to grant that they are much the same notwithstand- ing any difference have made between them of of design the word defign as it relâtes to painting is taken in threë diffefent senies first it signifies the intire thought of work lighted shaded and sometimes even-coloured and in this sense it is not considered as one of the parts of painting but only as the idea of the picture whiéh the painter has in his thoughts secondly it signifies the representation of some part of an human figure or of an animal or of piece of drapery all taken from the life in order to be put into some part of picture and to stand for an evidence of truth and in this sense it is called study lastly it is taken for the boundary or out- line of objects for the measures and pro- portions of exterior forms and then ’ tis reputed one of the parts of painting now if design be as it really is the circumscribing of exterior forms and if them to such measures and propor- tions as are proper for them we may truly say that ’ tis fort of creation which begins to fetch as out of notbing the visible pro- ducts of nature which are the object of painting upon the subject of invention we ob- served that it was the first in the order of execution but it is not the same in the order of study for design must be learsied before every thing as it is the key of the fine arts as it gives admittance to the other parts of painting and is the organ of the thoughts the instrument of our demonstra- tions and the light of ourunderstanding the young painter therefore ought not only to begin with this part but to be thoroughly master of it that he may the more easily ac- quaint himself with the other parts of which fhis is the foundation now if design be the basis of painting it follows that we can- not bestow too much pains on making it solid that it may be able to sustain building which consists of so many parts as that of painting consider design as consisting of several parts extremely necessary for every one who desires to be an able artist the chief of which are correctness good taste elegance character variety expreffion and perspective correctness is term com- monly used by painters to exprefs the con- dition of design which is faultless in its meafures this correctness depends on the exactness of proportions and the knowledge of anatomy there is à general proportion founded on the measures which are most proper to constitute good figure we ought therefore to study those authors who treat of pro- portzons and have laid down the general measures of human figures such authors mean as have thoroughly consulted na- ture and the sculptures of the antients but as in each species which nature pro- duces she is not limited to one fort of ob- ject only and as diversity constitutes one of her greatest beauties so there are parti- cular proportions which principally relate to sexes ages and conditions and which even in these admit of an infinite variety as to particular proportions nature has fur- nished as many as there are men in the world but in order to make them just and agreeable we must have recourse to the antique only which is derived originally from nature itself and therefore may be set up as model and will give solid idea of the beautiful variety several able painters have measured the antique statues in all their parts and have imparted to their pupils their studies on this subject but if their remarks have not been made either publick or exact enough we have in france more than sufficient number of elegant antiques either originals or moulded copies where every one may find the lights and particulars necessary for his instruction this however is certain that it is im¬ possible to reap any benefit from the measures of the antiques till we have studied them with exactness drawn after them with at- tention and after obstinate practice com- mitted them to our memory vasari re- oorts faying of michael angelo that the compasses ought to be in the eye not in the hand this fine remark has met with good reception among all the painters but nei- ther could he have made it nor they have propagated it if they had not previously sup- posed thorough knowledge in the finest proportions but we must not only take from the antique the finest proportions but every thing else that may tend to the sublime and to perfection tis therefore necessary to form as clear an idea of it as possible sup- ported by reason for this purpose shall consider the antique in its origin beauty and usefulness of the origin of the antique the word antique originally signifies any thing that is antient but we shall here confine it to the works in fculpture made in the age when great men flourished which was that of alexander the great when the fine arts and sciences were in their per- fection shall forbear to trouble the reader with the names of the first sculptors who through long feries of time brought sculpture from its cradle to fuch perfection as merits the name of antzque which it now bears the praises which were in those times bestowed on fine works increased the num- ber of good sculptors and the many statues erected to the honour of fuch persons as distinguished themselves by their merit as well as the idols with which they adorned their temples furnished still more matter for great geniuses to work on and to finish their works in emulation of each other it was in those days that polycletus one of the greatest of the antient greeé sculptors refolved to make statue which should have all the proportions of man perfectly werl shaped for this purpose he made use of many patterns of nature after he had brought his work to the last perfection it was so rigorously examined by men of skill and there- thereupon celebrated with so many encomi- ums that by common consent this statue was called the rule and became general model to all those who wanted to perfect themselves in the art and ’ tis very pro- bable that this experiment having succeeded in one sex gave birth to several essays not only in the other but even in the differeni ages and conditions of persons if iam not mistaken it is to this poly- cletus we may reasonably afcribe those mar- velous works which we call antiques since they were then brought to the degree of per- fection in which we now see them the sculptors of those times continued to give proofs of their skill down to the reign of the emperor gallienus about the year when the goths who had no knowledge of the fine arts nor any regard for them ravaged all greece but since we look upon the proportions of the antique as the models of perfection this naturally leads us to speak of the beauty of the antique some have asferted that the beauty of the human body lies in just agreement of the members with each other so as to make perfect whole others place it in good constitution and vigorous health of body where the motion and purity of the blood diffuse on the skin such colours as are both lively and fresh but according to general opmnion there is no definition of the beautiful beauty say they is nothing real every one judges of it according to his own taste and ’ tis nothing but what pleases be it as it will people are very little divided in their sentiments about the beauty of the antique men of understanding and lovers of the fine arts have always had value for these incomparable works that is not only in our days when they are become fcarce but even in those times when all places were full of them and when as it were they peopled greece and rome we find in antient authors many passages which in order to praise living beauties compare them to statues the sculptors says maximus tyrius by an admirable arti- fice chuse out of several bodies those parts wbich seem to them the most beautiful and put all this variety together into one statue but this mixture is made with so much judg- ment and propriety that those artists seem to bave no other model than one whole and perfect beauty and we must not think says tne same auchor ever to find natural beauty that can dispute the prize with statues art has also something more perfect than nature ovids in the xiith book of his metamorpbosis descri- bing cyllarus the handsomest of the cen- taurs says that so great was the vivacity of his countenance and his neck shoulders hands and breast were so handsome that whatever be had of man might be affirmed to be of the same beauty which is observed in the most perfect statues and philostratus speak- ing of euphorbus says that his beauty had won the hearts of the greeks and that it came so near to the beauty of statue that he might be taken for apollo and lower mentioning the beauty of neoptolemus and his likeness to his father achilles he inti- mates that in beauty his father was as much superior to him as statues are to bandsome men it was not among the greeés alone that statues were erected to men of merit and converted into idols the romans took the same way to reward great actions and to honour their gods the romans after con- quering greece brought away not only their finest statutes but also their best workmen these instructed others and have left to posterity everlasting proofs of their skill as appears from many admirable statues busts vafes and bas-reliefs and from the fine trajan and antonine columns all these antiquities we must look upon as the genuine sources to which both painters and sculptors must have recourse in order to diffuse solid beauty over what their own genius may suggest to them modern authors entertain the same sentiments of the beauty of the antique snall only quote scaliger is it possible says he to see any thing come up to the per- fection of fine statues since art has à liberty of chusing retrenching adding and directing whereas nature has been always changing for the worse ever since the creation of the first man in whom god joined the beauty of form to that of innocence of latin ms. of rubens concerning the imi¬ tation of the an- tique statues to some painters the imitation of the antique statues has been extremely use ful and to others per nicious even to the ruin of their art conclude however that in order to attain the hightest perfection in painting it is ne cessary to understand the antiques nay to be so thoroughly pos sessed of his knowledge that is may diffuse itself everywhere yet it must be judiciously applied and so that it may not in the least smell of the stone for several ignorant painters and even some who are skillful make no distinction between the matter and the form the stone and the figure the necessity of using the block and the art of forming it it is certains how ever that as the finest statues are extremely beneficial so the bad are not only useless but even pernicious for beginners learn from then know not what that is crude liny stiff and of harsh anatomy and while they take them selves to be good pro ficients do but dif grace nature since in stead of imitating flesh they only represent marble tinged with various colours for there are many things to be taken notice of and avoided which happen even in the best statues without the workman fault especially with regard to the difference of shades where the flesh skin and cartilages by their diaphanous nature soften as it were the harshness of great many out-lines and wear off those rugged breaks which in statues by the force and depth of their shade make the stone tho very opaque appear still more opaque and impenetrable to light than it really is there are besides certain places in the natural which change their figure according to the various motions of the body and by reason of the flexibility of the skin are sometimes dilated and af other times contracted these are avoided by the generality of sculptors yet are some- times admitted into use by the most excel¬ lent lent and are certainly necessary to painting but must be used with moderation to this we must add that not only the snade but also the lights of statues are extremely dif- ferent from the natural for the gloss of the stone and sharpness of the light that strikes it raise the surface above its pro- per pitch or at least fascinate the eye ea quisquis sapien¬ he who has with discernment made the proper distinctions in these cases can not consider the antique à statues too attentively study them too he carefully for we of this erroneous age are so far degenerate that we can produce no- thing like them whetherit is that our groveling genius will not permit us to soar to those heights which the antients attained by their heroick sense and superior parts or that we are wrapt up in the darknefs that overclouded our fa- thers or that it is the will wiil of god because we have neglected to amend our formet errors that we should fall from them into worse or that the world growing old our minds grow with it irrecoverably weak or in fine that na- ture herself furnished gi- the human body in those earlyages when itwas nearer its origin and perfection with every thing that could make it perfect mo- del but now being decay ’ and corrupted by succession of so many ages vices and accidents has lost its efficacy and only scatters those perfec- tions among many which it used formerly to bestow upon one in this manner the human stature may be proved from many authors to have gradually decreased for both sacred and profane writers have related the age of heroes many things concerning giants and cyclopes in which accounts if there are many things that are fabulous there is certainly some truth the chief reason why men of our age are different from the antients is floth and want of exercise for most men give no other exercise to their body but eating and drinking no wonder therefore if we see so many paunch-bellies weak and pitiful legs and arms that seem to reproach themselves with their idlenefs whereas the antients exercised their bodies every day in the aca- demies and other places for that pur- pose and exercised them so violently as to sweat and fatigue them perhaps too much see in mer- curialis de arte gym- how many various exercises they took how difficult and what vigour of constitution they re- quired thus all those parts of the body which are fed by idle- ness were worn away the belly was kept within itsbounds and what would have otherwise swelled it was converted into flesh and muscles for the arms legs neck shoulders and whatever works in the body are asfisted by exercifse and nourisn ’ à with juice drawn in- thus increase exceedingly both in strength and size as appears from the backs of porters the arms of prize fighters the legs of dan- cers and almost the whole body of watermen thus far rubens and have given his own words for authorizing the truth of what have extracted from his manuscript which is in my possession in fine the praises of the knowing the testimonies of authors and the general esteem of the most famous ages which are the strongest vouchers for the antique tend all to establish this single reason for the beauty of it towit because it is founded on on the imitation of beautiful nature suited to the object which is to be represented the several characters observed in the finest antiques are those of god an hero and an ordinary person accordingly we see in apollo divinity in hercules extraordinary strength and in antinous human- beauty some may say that the taste for an- tique which appears to be founded on the common consent of knowing men did however suffer change in the times of the goths answer that the gothick manner was introduced at time when the wars having destroyed the fine arts workmen had no other objects to revive them by than the imitation of such natural ones as casually offered and as to embellishing them they employed their imaginations rather in such difficult things as they believed would gain them repute than in cultivating good taste to which they were utter strangers the goths can not therefore be said to have departed from the antique because they rejected but because they were not at all acquainted with it all arts began with the imitation of nature and have been brought to perfection only by good choice this choice which is found in the antique has been made by men of excellent judgment who aimed at glory by the way of science and in order to attain it examined the most perfect natural patterns in country productive of of handsome men and at time that abounded with great geniuss when the fine arts were assiduoussy studied thoroughly examined and brought to à degree of perfection which is at this day the object of our astonishi- ment what more could be done to give pof- terity great idea of the antiqueà an idea not derived from an insipid practice or from an overdoing manner which scholars take from masters of narrow mind and middling capacity but springing originally from nature where truth appears in all its purity elegance grace and force with- out ever departing from its simplicity it is therefore the interest of all those who design to look upon the naked antique as nature purified and as the most certain rule of perfection but as ’ tis in vain to desire to profit by bare sight of fine things if we do not well conceive them so it is impossible thoroughly to understand the beauty of the antique any more than the truth in nature without the help of anatomy we may indeed by seeing and designing the antique acquire certain greatness of design and in the main get practice tending to good taste and de- licacy but these advantages if void of knowledge and principles can only dazzle the spectator by specious shew and by ill- placed remembrances of things man may be in raptures on seeing the sine works of antiquity and yet be far from knowing the genuine source of those beauties which he admires at least if he be ignorant of that fundamental part of design anatomy ir then anatomy be the basis of design and enable us to discover the beauties of the antique can not but observe that the knowledge of so much of it as the painter and sculptor require is easily attained and that the neglect of this attainment procëeds only from its being thought to lead towards dryness of design and pedantry of manner but little reflection will make it appear to be far from corrupting the solid basis of truth and of correctness of out-line purity or spoiling the connexion of the muscles formerly writ under borrowed name an abridgment of anatomy fot the use of painters and sculptors where the demonstrations are very plain shall here give some part of it in order to facilitate this science and the rather because those who have need of it imagine it to be difficult of anatomy anatomy is knowledge of the parts of the human boay but that re- abregé ’ anatomie par tortebat lates lates only to painters who have need of the bones and the principal muscles that cover them two points which are easily demonstrable nature has furnished us with bones forthe solidity of the body and strength of the members to them she has fixed the muscles as exterior agents to draw them whither she pleases the bones de- termine the measures of length and the muscles those of bigness in the parts of nature at least ’ tis the office of the mus¬ cles to settle the form and exactness of out- lines indispensably necessary to be well acquainted with the forms and joints of the bones because motion often alters their measures and likewise to understand the situation and office of the muscles since the most striking truth in design depends upon them the bones of themselves are motionless and stir only by the help of the muscles the muscles have their origins and insertions by their origins they are fastened to bone which they were never intended to stir and by their insertions to another bone which they draw when they please towards their origins every muscle has its opposite muscle when one acts the other yields like well- buckets one of which descends as the orher comes up the acting muscle swells and ontracts next to its origin the other that obeys dilates and relaxes the largest bones and which are moved with the greatest difficulty are covered with the largest muscles these are often aided by others which are designed for the samc office and thereby increase the force of motion and make the part more apparent several painters by overswelling the muscling have thought to gain the reputation of being skilful in anatomy or at least would shew that they were masters of it but they have shewn by this means that they little understood it since they seem to be ignorant that there is skin which covers the muscles makes them appear more gender and easy and is part of the human body and confequently of anatomy this truth is sufficiently proved by the bodies of women and children which are is fully muscled as those of the most robust persons the authors of the antique figures have not made wrong use of their profound knowledge in this part by making the muscles appear more than was prudent and necessary and their exactness in this respect shews the attention they thought due to anatomy in short how is it possible to judge of the truth or falsity of an out-line if we know not for certain to what degree the mus- cle which makes it ought either to swell or relax according to its office and degree of action we often see as has been said before that for want of this knowledge some persons who admire an antique sta- tue do it for no other reason than because tis antique and if you afk why the out- line of figure of their ovn making is thus or thus they can only answer that they saw it so in nature and this is the case of young people and of those who have no morê knowledge than what they have derived from bare practice we often observe in the naked parts of antique figures and even in nature itself certain swells the reason of which we can not discover without considering the situ- ation and office of the muscle which is the cause of them but the skilful in anatomy see all in seeing part and know how to remove from the eye what the skin and fat seem to conceal and what is hid to those who are ignorant of this science have now said enough to fhew that ’ tis impossible to be truly fkilful in design without clear and distinct knowledge in anatomy as it relates to painting and scul¬ pture and this may be attained with little trouble if we would not rather produce monsters than bestow some attention on so necessary point as for the demonstrations refer the reader to my aforesaid abridgment of anatomy of of taste in design the goût or taste is an idea either suiting the natural inclination of the painter and formed by education every school has its taste in design and since the re- establishment of the fine arts that of rome has always been thought the best as being founded on the antique which is- most proper for forming taste in design as have little before endeavoured to of elegance elegance in general is manner either of speaking or making things with good choice politeness and agreeablenefs with good choice in rising aboye what na- ture and painters usually produce with po¬ liteness in giving such turn to things as may strike men of delicate taste and with agreebleness in diffusing such general re- lish as may please and be within the reach of every one elegance is not always founded on correctness as appears appears from the antique and from the works of rapbael tis often seen in works either incorrect or otherwise slighted as in correggio where notwith- standing his incorrectness in design his ele- gance in the taste of it ,and in the turn which he has given to his actions must needs be admired in short correggzo rarely de- parts from elegance but the elegance which is supported by correctness of design as it prefents to us an image of perfection so it answers fully our èxpectation fixes our attention and elevates the mind after having struck it with an agreeable astonishment elegance of design may be further defined to be manner of embellishing ob- jects either in form or colour or both without destroying the truth elegance with respect to design ap- pears more eminently in the antiques than in any of the great painters who have imi- tated them among whom by general con- sent rapbael is the chief of the characters is not correctness only that gives spirit to painted objects but ’ tis also the manner in which they are designed every kind of object requires different mark of distinction stones waters trces hair fcathers and in short all kinds of animals must have their different touchings in order to express the spirit of their characters and even naked human figures have their particular marks of distinction some to imitate flesh give give in the extremities an inflective stroke which has this spirit others to imitate the antique shew in their extremities the regularity of statues that they may not lose any of their beauty we even observe in the designs of the great masters that in order to express the passions of the soul they had made certain strokes familiar to them which exhibited their ideas in more lively manner than the painting itself the word expression in painting is usually confounded with paffion but their difference is that expression is general term signifying the representation of an object according to its character and nature has mind to give it for the benefit of his work and passion in painting is an emo- tion of the body attended with certain strokes or lines in the face denoting an agi¬ tation of the soul thus all paffion is ex- pression but all expression is not passion- is no object in picture which has not its expression might here treat of the passions of the soul but have found it impossible to give such particular demonstrations of them as inight be of much service to painters on the contrary iconceive that if they were fixed by certain strokes which the painter should he obliged to make use of as essential rules this this would be depriving the art of that ex- cellent variety of expression which has no other principle than diversity of imagiations ne number of which is infinite and pro- ductions as new as the thoughts of men are various the same paffion may be finely expressed several ways yielding each more or less pleasure in proportion to the painter ’ understanding and the spectator ’ discern- ment in the paffions there are two forts of emotion one lively and violent and the other sweet and moderate quintilian calls the former pathetick and the latter moral the pathetick commands and the moral per- suades the one brings trouble and shakes the heart and the other calms the mind and both require much skill to be well expressed the pathetick is founded on the most violent paffions as hatred wrath envy compassion. the moral inspires mildnese tenderness and humanity the former pre- vails in combats and unforeseen and mo- mentary actions and the latter in conver- sations and both require decorum and propriety in the figures which compose the scene le brun has publissied treatise of the paffions the definitions of which he has taken mostly from what descartes has writ- ten of them but that philosopher treated only only of the emotions of the heart whereas apinters want what appears in the face now even if those emotions of the heart dlid always produce tlie passions according to the definitions ’ that are given of them its hard to know how those emotions constitute thé lines in the face by which they are re- presented to the eye besides the defini- tions of descartes are not always accommo- dated to the capacities of painters who are not all philosophers though in other re- spects they may not want sense and good natural parts it is sufficient for them to know that the paffions are the emotions of the soul which is seized with certain sen- timents at the sight of some object without waiting for order or the judgment of reason the artist ought to consider this object with attention and endeavour to make it al- ways present in his mind and to afk himn- self what he would naturally do if scized with the same passion nay he should do inore he ought to put himself in the placc heat or cool his imagination to such degrec of liveliness or calmness as that passion re- quires after it is thoroughly felt the look- ing-glass is great help in this matter and person duly informed of the case mighit very well serve for model or figure but it is not enough that the painter himself feel the passions of the soul he must make them felt by others and among the many characters by which one particular passion may be expresed he must chuse such as he judges most proper to affect chiefly men of understanding which can not be done in my opinion without exquisite sense and sound judgment for nothing interests the sgectator more in favour of the picture than tlie painter ’ hitting his taste brun ’ demonstrations are certainly .rned and fine but too general they rtizty ideed be of service to most painters but yet other expressions of the passions may be found as beautiful as le brun ’ though in this respect he has been very happy general expressions are therefore use- ful because the particular ones proceed from them as the branches of tree shoot from the trunk would therefore advise every painter to study them and to mark on paper with crayon the lines or strokes which form them and for this purpose to copy after the antiquc and after nature in order to form such general idea of the principal passions as may suit his genius for we all think differently and our imaginations are according to the nature of our constitutions tho the pafsions of the soul are most visible in the lines of the face they often require the assistance of the other parts of the body for when the subject requires the expression of some essential part if- you touch touch the spectator but faintly you give him coldness that disgusts him whereas if you souch him to the quick you give him an infinite pleasure the head contributes more to the ex- pression of the paffions than all the other parts of the body put together these sepa- rately can only shew some few passions but the head shews them all there are some however peculiar to the head as humility when it hangs down arrogance when it lifts itself up languishiing when it leans on one side obstinacy when with stub- born and rigid air it stands upright fixed and stiff between the two shoulders others may be more easily express ’ than described as shame admiration indignation and doubt the head best shews our supplications threats mildness haughtiness love hatred joy sadness humility in short the face discovers things in half-speech its redness and paleness as it were speak to us as well as the mixture of both all parts of the face contribute towards expressing the sentiments of the heart but the eyes especially which are as cicero says the windons of the soul the paffions they most particularly discover are pleasure languishing scorn severity mildness ad- miration and anger to which we might add joy and grief if they did not proceed more particularly from the eye-brows and mouth but when those two passions fall in also with the language of the eyes the harmony will be wonderful the nose shews no passion in particular but asfists the other parts of the body by raising the nostrils which is as much an expression of joy as of sadness yet scorn raises the tip and swells the nostrils drawing the upper lip up to the corners of the mouth the antients made the nose the seat of derision — eum subdolae irrisioni dicaverunt— says pliny they also placed anger there as in persius-— disce sed tra cadat naso rugosaque sanna— but take the nose to be the seat of anger rather in beasts than men and that it is only becoming in the god pan who partakes very much of the nature of the beast to wrinkle up his nose when he is angry as other anials do and as philostratus reprefents him when the nymphs tied him and offered him thou- sand insults the motion of the lips ought in com- mon discourse to be moderate because man rather speaks with his tongue than with them and the mouth must not be very open unless to express some violent passion for the hands they obey the head and become its weapons and aid in time of need action is weak and as it were half dead with- out their assistance their motions which aré almost infinite create numberless expres- fions is it not by them that we desire hope promise call send back are they not the instruments of threatening prayer hor- ror and praise do we not by them approve refuse fear afk express our joy and grief our doubts regrets pain and admiration in word we may affirm since they are the language of the dumb that they con- tribute not little to speak language common to all nations which is that of painting to say how these parts must be disposed for expressing the various pafsions is impos- sible nor can any exact rules be given for it both because the tafk would be infinite and because every one must be guided in this by his own genius and the particular bent of his studies let it be only remem- bered that the actions of the figures must be perfectly natural can not but think says quintilian speaking of the paffions that this part though so fine and great may pos¬ sibly be attained and that there is road which leads easily to it and it is the study and imitation of nature for the spectators are satisfied when in artificial things they see nature as she usually appears to them in effect it is not to be doubted but that the emotions of the soul as seen in art are never so natural as those in the heat of real passion the best way to express the motions na- turally is for the artist to entertain the same sentiments sentiments and to fancy himself in the same circumstances with the person he would represent for nature says horace lays our mind open to all forts of chances some- times we have content at other times we are swelled with anger sometimes we are intirely weighed down with mortal disquiets and then the motions of the heart swell outwardly by means of the tongue which is its interpreter instead of the tongue let the painter say of the actions which are her- inter preters—-how is it posfible says quintilian to give warmth to any thing if you bave not that warmth in yourselfe we must first be touched ourselves with pafsion before we can affect others with it and hou must we move and affect ourselves continues he since the passions are not in our power à it is thus if imistake not we must form to ourselves the appearances and images of things absent as if they were really before our eyes and he who forms and conceives those images with the greatest force will exprefs the paffions with most advantage and facility but let tne artist take care as we have already said that in these images the motions be natural for some think they give much life to their figures in giving them violent and forced actions which we may rather call contorsions of the body than passions of the soul thus are they at great pains to find out some violent passion where only moderate one was proper app to what is above that great regard must be had to the qualities of the persons that are pafsioned the joy of king must not be like that of footman nor soldiers nettle like that of captain and in these distinctions consists the true discernment of the paffions every body is sensible that the imi¬ tation of the visible objects in nature lies in design and colouring have explained my thoughts of the former in speaking of cor- rectnefs of design founded on the beauties of nature and the antique and on the assistance of anatomy have touched on taste diversity elegance character and the expression of the passions according to the relation which all these bear to design it only remains now to speak of colouring and to add what have to say at present to what have formerly written on this head for the rest if have omitted any thing that has relation to design have done it because others have treated of those things with success and because it would be tire- some to repeat what they have written un- less could better illustrate it draperies diversity of climates change of seasons and their inconstancy have laid men under the necessity of cloathing themselves this necessity has beer accom- modated to the rules of decency and de- cency has given rise to various ornaments invented for enriching dress according to the taste of different nations and the mode of different times but as the use of stuffs has been applied to many other things besides clothing painters have comprised them all under the word drapery and when they would describe an artist who makes proper distribution of the folds they say he knows how to cast drapery well now this phrase of casting drapery is the more- just as the disposition of the folds ought rather to seem the effect of mere chance than of labour and study as there is skill therefore in the adjustment of the draperies we shall endeavour to shew where it lies and of what consequence it is in painting the art of drapery is chiesly observed in hree things viz the order of folds the diversity of stuffs the variety of colouring in stuffs of the order of folds the eye must never be in doubt of its object the chief effect of draperies is to make us understand what they cover espe- cially the naked parts of figures in such manner that the outward characters of per- sons and the exactnessof proportions may appear through them at least in the main and as far as probability and art will permit accordingly after the example of the greatest masters the painter before he disposes his draperies ought to draw his figures naked in order to prevent any doubtful meaning in the folds and that the eye may imagine it sees what he conceals by the cast of his draperies he must also take care that the drapery sit not too close to the partsof the but that it seem to flow round and body as it were caress them and that the figure be easy and have à free motion let not the draperies which cover those members that are exposed to great light be so deeply shaded as to seem to pierce them nor let those members be crossed by by folds which are too strong lest by the too great darkness of their shades the members look as if they were broken but retaining small number of folds let the painter nicely distribute among them such degree of light as suits the whole mafs of which they are part folps should be great and as few as possible maxim that chiefly contributes • to what is called the grand manner be- cause great folds do not so much divide the sight and their rich simplicity is most sus- ceptible of great lights we must never- theless except such drapery as requires much plaiting as it often happens in that of women and as we see in many an- tiques for in such cases the painter ought to groupe his folds and range them at the side of the members which are thus rendered more apparent and more pleasing contrast which is so necessary in the motion of figures is as proper in the order of the folds for contrast by break- ing the lines which would otherwise have too great tendency one way raises in the dra- peries as well as in the figures fort of contradiction that seems to animate them the reason is that contrast is à kind of war that puts the opposite parts in motion accordingly in proper places the folds ought not only to contraste themselves but also the members of the figures when those folds are great and part of large drapery for as to the under draperies which stick more closely to the naked figure they are more apt to take the shape of it than to give it any contrast whatever life the contrast may add to draperies and however necessary it may be to make them pleasing the painter must yet make use of it with great prudence and pre- caution for in upright figures it often happens that the contrast can not be practised without departing from probability and in such cases the painter who knows to turn every thing to his advantage betakes him- self to other principles folds well imagined give much spirit to any kind of action because their motion implies motion in the acting member which seems to draw them forcibly and makes them more or less stirring as the action is more or less violent folps should be great according to the quantity and quality of the drapery and when through the slightness of stuffs we are obliged to use much folding it must be so grouped that the claro-obscuro may not suffer by it judicious repetition of folds in circular manner is great help to the effect of fore-shortenings it ’ sometimes proper in certain parts to put out some folds and put in others more more suitable to the painter ’ intention either for spreading of light or for silling up the vacancies of some attitudes or for accompanying the figures or for making sweet ground to them or for hindering their turnings from ending too quick and looking too harsh and unfinisned rich ornaments make part of the beauty of draperies when used with discre- tion but such ornaments ill become divini- ties and are always beneath the state and dignity of heavenly figures whose draperies ought rather to be rich in the greatneis and noblenefs of the folds than in the quality of the stuff folds made by mere practice and without the help of the natural are usually proper only for single design but in order to perfection the painter should al- ways consult the stuffs themselves because in them the folds are true and the lights agreeable to the nature of the stuffs would not however blame those who have acquired so great an experience in the na- ture of folds and qualities of stuffs as to be capable by memory to express most of them well to imitate truth justly draperies ought either to be set on layman as big as the life or else upon the life itself but care must be taken that such draperies have nothing of the immobility of the layman some painters make use of small lay- men on which they set either thin stuffs or wet papêr but tho ’ this method may be useful to able artists and is very good where whole story is to be put together it can ’ be so useful for particular draperies because the stuffs not having the same weight as in the larger laymen can ’ shew the folds in their true shapes light and flying draperies become only figures in great motion or in the wind but when in close place and free from violent action their draperies must be large and by their contrast and fall of the folds shew grace and majesty tis great fault to make draperies too heavy and cumbersome they ought to be suitable to the figures and ’ tis wrong to think as some have done that the larger they are the more they are grand and majestick profusion of stuffs on the contrary is an hindrance to the motion of the figures and rather embarasses them than makes them majestick these think are the principal obser- ations relating to the order of folds pro- ceed secondly to speak of the diversity of stuffs among the many different things hat please in the composition of picture variety of draperies is not the least consi- derable the order and contrast of folds have indeed their share but it is not enough that the stuffs themselves be variously cast they must also be of various forts as far as the subject will admit wool linen cotton and silk as they are manufactured thousand different ways afford the artist large field for choice by which means he may introduce into his work diversity which is the more necessary as it makes him avoid tiresome repetition of folds of the same kind especially when his piece consists of many figures some stuffs natu¬ rally make broken folds others more soft and round some stuffs are rough-wrought others smooth and glossy some are thin and transparent others more firm and sub- stantial and this variety whether di- spersed among many figures or brought into one according to the subject never fails to produce most agreeable sensation the general use of the same kind of stuff in the figures of one picture is fault into which most painters of the roman school have fallen and which all those are guilty of who either paint by dint of practice only or reduce the imitation of nature to an habit which they have contracted but the in- genious painter will seek all opportunities of introducing into his draperies that happy diversity have been mentioning let him re- remember however that itis above all things indispensable with regard to the difference of ages sexes and conditions the antient sculptors were very fkilful in casting their draperies but as the matter they work ’ on was of one colour and the large folds which receive the greatest light would have often appeared undistinguishable from the naked paris or at least have divided the eye they were obliged to fix it upon the naked parts of their figures because in this case nothing better could be done for the advantage of their art for this pur- pose they made use of wetted linen or- thin stuffs which is the usual drapery of- their statues this remedy by the good- order of their folds was certainly very in- genious and affords much light to those- who can apprehend the reason of it in could produce many examples from anti- quity in this point but shall only mention that of the bas-relief commonly called the dancing women the draperies which cover the naked parts of those figures and shiew in many seeming folds those partss agreeably terminate behind the body the- repetition of which would appear fault to an eye which can not consider the fineness and excellence of the work but if we regard the sculptor ’ purpose which was to shew the naked partsof those figures with elegance these repetitions will be so far from appearing fault in sculpture that they will seem to make à kind of hatched shading so dextroussy ma¬ naged as to set off the naked parts and to give at the same time repose to the eye thus have the antient sculptors with great skill and genius invented several ways to remedy the inconveniences jn the matter they workd on whether they proceeded fromn the largenefs of folds or the variety of the stuffs with which their figures were cloathed having in all other respects generally speak- ing given perfect satisfaction but painters who may use all sorts of stuffs and by means of colours and lights can skilsully imitate truth would be as much to blame if they followed sculptors in the multitude and repetition of their folds as sculptors would be if they imitated painters in the extent of their draperies proceed in the last place to treat of the variety of colouring in stuffs if order contrast and variety of stuffs and folds constitute the elegance of draperies diversity of colours in those stuffs contributes extremely to the harmony of the whole together in historical subjects the artist who has it generally in has power to imagine them as he pleases must particularly study the values of his colours when entire their effects when placed by one another and their their harmony when broken but these points shall handle in treating of colouring and in the mean time only here observe hat the colouring of draperies gives the painter an opportunity of shewing all his skill and address in the claro-obscuro titian made use of this artifice in most of his pictures because he was thereby at liberty to give his draperies what colour he thought most proper either for making his ground or for spreading light or for characterizing objects by comparison but after all the management of dra- peries is not so settled but the painter may give scope to his genius in venturing on unusual folds which may have their merit there is not any effect in nature where chance shews more variety than in the cast of the draperies and thol art has usually something to correct in their disposition yet chance often furnishes with folds more beau- tiful and proper than rules could ever have produced in fine art can not foresee every thing art goes but little way be- yond general things and leaves to men of taste the care of supplying every thing else it is the painter ’ part to make good choice of the effects which nature presents and to use them so as to diffuse over his performance the marks of happy felicity mong the painters who best underftood draperies raphael in my opinion is the best .i copy for the order of folds yet would not derogate by this from the merit ef those who withoat departing wholly from raphael ’ principles have successfully taken greater liberties in the characters of their folds and have even accompanied those freedoms with grandeur and truth the vezetian and flemisp schools have excelled in shewing the variety of stuffs and paolo veronese is an inexhaustible source of examples for an harmonious variety of colours say little of the other great masters in draperies the consideration of whose works will make it evident that the folds require both order and proper choice that thè difference of stuffs enriches work and supports necessary probability and that variety of colouring in draperies may con- tribute very much to the effect of the claro- obscuro and to the harmony of the whole together in short the works of those ex- cellent masters will better demonstrate than all can say wherein the knowledge of draperies lies and of what importance it is in painting an abstract of the preceding ovser- vations relating todraperies by the word drapery in painting is meant all sorts of stuffs whether for cloathing or other use but generally speak- speaking it relates to cloathing in which art considers the order of folds the diversity of stuffs the variety of colouring in stuffs of the order of folds the figure must be designed before it be cloathed the drapery must not sit too close to the parts of the body but flow about them and as it were caress them the members must not seem to be broken by folds too strongly shaded the folds must be great and few as far as the nature of the stuff will admit the folds must contraste one another and also contraste the members the folds on many occasions give life to the action of figure an great vacancies in draperies must be filled up with well adapted folds masters may shew practical folds but for perfection sake we should always consult the life draperies set on little laymen- may be useful but they are falsifying flyingdraperies are proper only in open places or where the figure is in great- motion too much stuff in drapery encumbers the figure chance often creates such beauties in the casting of draperies as art could not foresee painters are much obliged to the antient sculptors for the art of casting dra- peries but the use which either makes of them is very different of the diversity of stuffs it causes diversity of folds it delights the eye it ought to be generally practised as well in single figure as among many especially to shew the different ages sexes and conditions of figures the roman painters and those who paint practically are usually guilty of re- peating the same stuffs of the variety of colouring in stuffs it gives picture harmony it characterizes the objects it shews the claro-obscuro raphael is the best copy for the order of folds the venetian and flemisp schools are best for the diversity of stuffs and paolo veronese for the harmonious variety of their colouring of landskip landskip is kind of painting that represents the fields and all the ob- ects that belong to them among all he pleafures which the different talents of painting afford to those who employ them that of drawing landfkips seems to me the most affecting and most convenient for by the great variety of which it is suscep- tible the painter has more opportunities than in any of the other parts to please himself by the choice of his objects the solitude of rocks freshness of forests clear- ness of waters and their seeming murmurs extensiveness of plains and offfkips mix- tures of trees firmnefs of verdure and ine general scene or opening make the painter imagine himself either hunting of making the air or walking or sitting and giving himself up to agreeable musings in word he may here dispose of all things his pléasure whether upon land or in water or in the sky because there is not any any production either of art or nature which may not be brought into such picture thus painting which is kind of creation is more particularly so with regard to landskip anong the many different styles of landskip shall confine my self to two the heroick and the pastoral or rural for all other styles are but mixtures of these the heroick style is composition of- objects which in their kinds draw both from art and nature every thing that is- great and extraordinary in either the situations are perfectly agreeable and sur- prising the only buildings are temples yramids antient places of burial altars consecrated to the divinities pleasure-houses of regular architecture and if nature ap- pear not there as we every day casually see ner she is at least represented as we think she ought to be this style is an agreeable illusion and fort of inchantment when handled by man of fine genius and good understanding as poussin was who has so happily expressed it but if in the course of this style the painter has not talent enough to maintain the sublime he is often in danger of falling into the childish manner the rural style is representation of countries rather abandoned to the caprice of nature than cultivated we there see nature simple without ornament and with- out out artifice but with all those graces with which sne adorns herself much more when left to herself than when constrained by art in this style situations bear all sorts of varieties sometimes they are very extensive and open to contain the flocks of the shep¬ herds at others very wild for the retreat of solitary persons and cover for wild beasts it rarely happens that painter has genius extensive enough to embrace all the parts of painting there is commonly some one part that pre-engages our choice and so fills our mind that we forget the pains that are due to the other parts and we seldom fail to see that those whose inclination leads them to the beroick style think they have done all when they have introduced into their compositions such noble objects as will raise the imagination without ever giving themselves the troublé to study the effects of good colouring those on the other hand who practise the pastoral apply closely to colouring in order to represent truth more lively both these styles have their sectaries and partisans those who follow the heroick supply by their imagi- nation what it wants of truth and they look no farther as counterbalance to heroick landfkip think it would be proper to put into the pastoral pastoral besides great character of truth some affecting extraordinary but probable effect of nature as was titian ’ custom there is an infinity of pieces wherein both these styles happily meet and whach of the two has the ascendant will appear from what have just been observing of their respective properties the chief parts of landskip are think their openings or situations accidents skies and clouds off- skips and mountains verdure or turfing rocks grounds or lands terraces fabrieks waters fore-grounds plants figures and trees of all which in their places of openings or situations the word site or situation signifies the view prospect or opening of country it is derived from the italian word fite and our painters have brought it into use esther because they were used toit in italy or because as think they found it to be very expressive situations ought to be well put to- gether and so disengaged ’ in their make that the conjunction of grounds may not seem to be obstructed tho we should ses but part of them situations are various and repre- sented according to the country the painter is thinking of as either open or close mountainous or watery tilled and inhabited or wild and lonely or in fine variegated by prudent mixture of some of thefe but if the painter be obliged to imitate nature in flat and regular country he must make it agreeable by good disposition of the claro- obscuro and such pleasing colouring as may make one soil unite with another tis certain that extraordinary situations are very pleasing and chear the imagination by the novelty and beauty of their makes even when the local colouring is but mode- rately performed because at worst such pictures are only look ’ on as unfinish ’ and wanting to be completed by some skilful hand in colouring whereas common situa- tions and objects require good colouring and absolute finishing in order to please it was only by these properties that claud lorrain has made amends for his insipid choice in most of his situations but in whatever manner that part be executed one of the best ways to make it valuable and even to multiply and vary it without alter- ing its form is properly to imagine some ingenious accident in it of accidents accident in painting is an obstruction of the sun ’ light by ghe interposition of clouds in such manner that some parts of the the earth shall be in light and others in shade which according to the motion of the clouds succeed each other and pro- duce such wonderful effects and changes of the claro-obscuro as seem to create so many new situations this is daily observed in nature and as this newnefs of situations is grounded only on the shapes of the clouds and their motions which are very inconstant and unequal it follows that these accidents are arbitrary and painter of genius may dispose them to his ovn advantage when he thinks fit to use them for he is not absolutely obliged todo it and there have been some able landskip-painters who have never practised it either thro ’ fear or custom as claude lorrain and some others of the sky and clouds thesky in painters terms is the ethe- real part over our heads but more parti- cularly the air in which we breathe and that where clouds and storms are ingendered its colour is blue growing clearer as it approaches the earth because of the interposition of va- pours arising between the eye and the hori- zon which being penetrated by the light communicates it to objects in greater or less degree as they are moreor less remote but we must observe that this light be- ing either yellow or reddish in the evening at at fun-set these same objects partake not only of the light but of the colour thus the yellow light mixing with the blue which the natural colour of the sky alters it and gives it à tint more or lefs greenish as the yellowness of the-light is more or less deep this observation is general and infallible out there is an infinity of particular ones which the painter must make upon the na- rural with his pencil in his hand when occasion offers for there are very fine and singular effects appearing in the sky which it is difficult to make one conceive by phy- sical reasons who can tell for example why we see in the bright part of some clouds fine red when the source of the right which plays upon them is most lively and distinguishing yellow who can account for the different reds seen in different clouds at the very moment that these reds receive the light but in one place for these colours and surprising appearances seem to hlave no relation to the rainbow phaeno- menon for which the philosophers pretend so give solid reasons these effêcts are all seen in the evening when the weather is inclining to change either before storm or after it when it is not quite gone but has left some remains of it to draw our attention the property of clouds is to be thin and iry both in shape ande colour their shapes tho ’ infinite must be studied and chosen after nature at such times as they appear fine to make them look thin we ought to make their grounds unite thinly with them especially near their extremities as if they were transparent and if we would have them thick their reflections must be so managed as without destroying their thin- ness they may seem to wind and unite if necessary with the clouds that are next to them little clouds often discover little manner and seldom have good effect unless when being near each other they seem all together to make but one object in short the character of the sky is to be luminous and as it is even the source of light every thing that is upon the earth muft yield to it in brightnefs lf however there is any thing that comes near it in light it must be waters and polisn ’ be-es which are susceptible of luminous reflexions but whilst the painter makes the sky luminous he must not represent it always shining throughout on the contrary he must contrive his light so that the greatest part of it may fall only upon one place and to make it more apparent he must take as much care as possible to put it in opposition to some terrestrial object that may render it more lively by its dark colour as tree tower or some other building that is little high this principal light might also be heightened by certain disposition of clouds having supposed light or light ingeniously enclosed between clouds whose sweet ob- curity spreads itself by little and little on all hands we have great many examples of this in the flemisp school which best understood landskip as paul bril brugel saveri and the sadelers and merian ’ prints give clear idea of it and wonder- fully awaken the genius of those who have the principles of the claro-obscuro of off-skips and mountains off-skips have near affinity with- the sky it is the sky which determines ei- ther the force or faintness of them they are darkest when the sky is most loaded and brightest when it is most clear they sometimes intermix their shapes and lights clouds pafs between the mountains whose ops rise and appear above them mountains hat are high and covered with snow are very proper to produce extraordinary effects on the off-skip which are advantageous to the painter and pleasing to the spectator the disposition of off-ikips is arbitrary et them only agree with the whole together of the picture and the nature of the country we would represent they are usually blue because of the interposition of air between them and the eye but they lose this colour by degrees as they come nearer the eye and so take that which is natural to the objects in distancing mountains we must ob- to join them insensibly by the rounding which the reflections make probable and must among other things avoid cer- tajn edginess in their extremities which makes thém appear in slices as if cut with scifsors and stuck upon the cloth ve must further observe that the air at the feet of mountains being charged with vapours is more susceptible of light than at their tops in this case suppose the main light to be set reasonably high and to enlighten the mountains equally or that the clouds deprive them of the light of the sun but if we suppose the main light to be very low and to strike the mountains then their tops will be strongly enlighten as well as every thing else in the same de- gree of light tho the forms of things diminish in bigness and colours lose their strength in proportion as they recede from the first plan of the picture to the most remote off- skip as we observe in nature and common practice yet this does not exclude the use of the accidents these contribute greatly to hie wonderful in landfkip when they are properly introduced and when the artist has of just idea of their good effects of verdure or turfing call turfing the greennefs with which the herbs colour the ground this is done several ways and the diversity pro- ceeds not only from the nature of plants which for the most part have their particular verdures but also from the change of seasons and the colour of the earth when the herbs are but thin sown by this variety painter may chuse or unite in the same tract of land several sorts of greens inter- mixed and blended together which are often of great service to those who know how to use them because this diversity of greens as it is often found in nature gives cha- racter of truth to those parts where it is properly used there is wonderful ex- ample of this part of landskip in the view of mechlin by rubens of rocks though rocks have all sorts of shapes and participate of all colours yet there are in their diversity certain characters which canriot be well expressed without having re- course to nature some aré in banks and set off with beds of shrubs others in huge blocks either projecting or falling back others consist of large broken parts conti- guous to each other and others in short of an enormous size all in one stone either naturally as free-stone or else through the injuriès of tiine which in the course of many ages has worn away their marks of separation but whatever their form be they are usually set out with clefts breaks hollows bushes moss and the stains of time and these par- ticûlars well managed create certain idea of truth rocks are of themselves gloomy and only proper for solitudes but where accom- panied with bushes they inspire fresh air and when they have waters either pro- ceeding from or washing them they give an infinite pleasure and seem to have soul which aniniates them and makes them so ciable of grounds or lands groundor land in painters terms is certain distinct piece of land which is neither too woody nor hilly grounds con- tribute more than any thing to the gra- dation and distancing of landskip because they follow one another either in shape or in the claro-obscuro or in their variety of colouring or by some insensible conjunction of one to another multiplicity of grofnds though it be often contrary to grand manner does not quite quite destroy it for besides the extent of country which it exhibits tis susceptible of the accidents we have mentioned and which with good management have fine effect there is one nicety to be observed in grounds which is that in order to cha- racterize them well care must be taken that the trees in them have different verdure and different colours from those grounds and difference withal must not be too apparent of terraces terrace in painting is piece of ground either quite naked or having very little herbage like great roads and places often frequented they are of use chefly in the foregrounds of picture where they ought to be very spacious and open accidental verdure and also with some stones which is placed with judgment give ter- race greatter air of probability of buildings painters mean by buildings any structures hey generally represent but chiefly such as are of regular architecture or at least are most conspicuous thus building not so proper name for the houses of country-people or the cottages of shepherds which are introduced into the rural taste as for regular and showy edifices which are always brought into the heroick buildings in general are great orna- ment in landskip even when they are gothick or appear partly inhabited and partly ruinous they raise the imagination by the use they are thought to be designed for as appears from antient towers which seem to have been the habitations of fairies and are now retreats for shepherds and owls poussin has very elegantly handled the roman manner of architecture in his works as bourdon has done the gothick which however gotbick ’ fails not to give à fub- lime air to his landfkips little bernard has introduced into his sacred story what may call babylonian manner which ex- traordinary as it is has its grandeur and mag- nificence would not quite reject such pieces of architecture they raise the ima¬ gination and am persuaded they would fucceed in the heroick style if they were placed among half-distant objects and if we knew how to use them properly of waters muchof the spirit of landskip is owing to the waters which are introduced in it they appear in divers manners sometimes impetuous impetuous as when storm makes them overflow their banks at other times re- bounding as by the fall of rock at other times through unusual pressure gufhing out and dividing into an infinity of silver streams whose motion and murmuring agreeably de- ceive both the eye and ear at other times calm and purling in sandy bed at other times so still and standing as to become à faithful looking-glass which doubles all the objects that are opposite to it and in this state they have more life than in the most violent agitation consult bourdon ’ works or at least his prints on this subject- he is one of those who have treated of waters with the greatest spirit and best genius waters are not proper for every situ- ation but to express them well the artist ought to be perfect master of the exactness of watry reflexions because they only make painted water appear as real for practice alone without exactness destroys the effect and abates of the pleasure of the eye the rule for these reflexions is very easy and therefore the painter is the leis pardonable for neglecting it but it must be observed that tho water be as looking-glass yet it does not faith- fully represent objects but when ’ tis still for if it be in any motion either in natural course or by the driving of the wind its surface becoming aneven receives on its surges surges such lights and shades as mixing with the appearance of the objects con- found both their shapes and colours of the foreground of picture it is the part of the foreground to usher the eye into the piece great care must be taken that the eye meet with good re- ception sometimes by the opening of fine terrace whose design and workmanship may be equally curious at other times by variety of well distinguisned plants and those fometimes flowered at other times by figures in lively taste or other objects either admirable for their novelty or intro- duced as by chance in word the artist can not too much study his foreground objects since they at- tract the eye impress the first character of truth and greatly contribute to make the artifice of picture successful and to anti- cipate our esteem for the whole work am sensible that there are very fine landfkips with foregrounds appearing to be well chosen and carrying great idea but which are nevertheless very slightly fi- nisned own indeed that this slightness ought to be pardoned when it is ingenious when it suits with the nature of the ground and bears the character of truth but it must be owned likewise that this effect is very oflandskip rare and that it is to be feared lest this slight working should give some idea of poverty or of too great negligence so that in whatever manner the foregrounds of picture be disposed would have the artist prescribe it as law to himself to finish them with skill and accurate workmanship of plants plants are not always necessary in foregrounds because as we have observed there are several ways of making those grounds agreeable.. but if we resolve to draw plants there we ought to paint them exactly after the life or at least among such as we paint practically there ought to be some more finisned than the rest and whose kinds may be distinguished by the difference of design and colouring to the end that by probable supposition they may give the others character of truth what has been said here of plants may be applied to the branches and barks of trees of figures in composing landskip the artist may have intended to give it character agreeable to the subject he has chosen and which his figures ought to represent he may also and it commonly happens have only thought of- of his figures after finishing his landskip- the truth is the figures in most landskips are made rather to accompany than to suit them know there are landskips so disposed and situated as to require only passing fi¬ gures which several good masters each in his style have introduced as pouffin in the heroick and fouguzer in the rural with all possible probability and grace know also that reszing figures have been made to appear inwardly active and these two different ways of treating figures are not to be blamed because they act equally though in dif- ferent manner it is rather inaction that ought to be blamed in figures for in this condition which robs them of all connexion with the landskip they appear to be pasted on but without obstructing the painter liberty in this respect am persuaded that the best way to make figures valuable is to make them so to agree with the character of the landskip that it may seem to have been made purely for the figures would not have them either insipid or indifferent but to represent some little subject to awaken the spectator ’ attention or else to give the picture name of distinction among the curious great care must be taken to proportion the size of the figures to the bigness of the trees and other objects of the landskip if they be too large the picture will discover little manner and if too small they will have the air of pygmies which will destroy the worth of them and make the landskip look enormous there is however greater inconvenience in making figures too large than too small becausé the latter at least gives an air of greatness to all the rest but us landskip figures are generally small they must be touch ’ with spirit and such lively colours as will attract and yet preserve pro- bability and general union the artist must in fine remember that as the figures chiefly give life to landskip they must be dispersed as conveniently as possible of trees always thought that the beauty of trees was one of the greatest ornaments of landskip because of the variety of their kinds and their freshness but chiefly their lightness which makes them seem as being exposed to the air to be always in motion though diversity be pleasing in all the objects of landskip ’ tis chiefly in trees that it shews its greatest beauty landskip considers both their kinds and their forms their kinds require the painter ’ particular study and attention in order to distinguisn them from each other for we must be able at first sight to discover which are oaks elms firs sy- camores camores poplars willows pines and other such trees which by specifick colour or touching are distinguishable-from all other kinds this study is too large to be required in all its extent and indeed few painters have attained such competent exactness in it as their art requires but it is evident that those who come nearest to perfection in it will make their works infinitely pleasing and gain great name besides the variety which is found in each kind of tree there is in all trees ge¬ neral variety this is observed in the dif- ferent manners in which their branches are disposed by sport of nature which takes delight in making some very vigorous and thick others more dry and thin some more green others more red or yellow the ex- cellence of practice lies in the mixture of these varieties but if the artist can distin- guisn the sorts but indifferently he ought at least to vary their makes and colours be- cause repetition in landskip is as tiresome to the eye as monotony in discourse is to the ear the variety of their makes is so great that the painter would be inexcusable not to put it in practice upon occasion especially when he finds it necessary so awaken the spectator ’ attention for among trees we discover the young and the old the open and close tapering and squat bending up- wards wards and downwards stooping and shoot- ng in short the variety is rather to be conceived than expressed for instance the character of young trees is to have long slender branches few in number but well set out boughs well divided and the foliage vigorous and well shaped whereas in old trees the branches are short stocky thick and numerous the tufts blunt and the foliage unequal and ill shaped but little observation and genius will make us perfectly sensible of these particulars in the various makes of trees there must also be distribution of branches that has just relation to and probable connexion with the boughs or tufts so as mutually to asfist each other in giving the tree an appearance of thickness and of truth but whatever their natures or manners of branching be let it be remembred that the handling must be lively and thin in order to preserve the spirit of their characters trees likewise vary in their barks which are commonly grey but this grey which in thick air and low and marshy places looks blackisn appears lighter in clear air and it often happens in dry places that the bark gathers thin moss which makes it look quite yellow so that to make the bark of tree apparent the painter may suppose it to be light upon dark ground and dark on light one tre the observation of the different barks merits particular attention for it will appear that in hard woods age chaps them and thereby gives them fort of embroidery and that in proportion as they grow old these chaps grow more deep any other accidents in barks may arise either from moisture or driness or green moffes or white stains of several trees the barks of white woods will also af- ford much matter for practice if their di- versity be duly studied and this con- sideration leads me to say something of the study of landfkip which will do accord¬ ing to my own notion of it without pre- tending to prescribe my sentiments to others of the study of landstip the study of landskip may be considered either with respect to beginners or to those who have made some advances in it beginners will find in practice that the chief trouble of landfkip lies in handling trees and it is not only in practice methinks but also in speculation that trees are the most difficult part of landfkip as they are its greatest ornament but it is only pro¬ posed here to give beginners an idea of trees in general and to shiew them how to express them well it would be needless to point out to them the common effects of trees and and plants because they are obvious to every one yet there are some things which tho not unknown deserve our reflection we know for instance that all trèes require alr osme more some less as the chief cause of their vegetation and productions and for this season all trees except the cypress and osme others of the same kind separate in their growth from one another and from other strange bodies as much as possible and their branches and foliage do the same wherefore to give them that air and thin- ness which is their principal character the branches boughs and foliage must appear to fly from each other to proceed ffom op- posite parts and be well divided and all his without order as if chancé aided na- ture in the fanciful diversity but to say particularly how these trunks branches and foliages ought to be distributed would be needless and only description of the works of great masters little re- flection on nature will be of more service than all can say on this head by great masters mean such as have published prints for those will give better ideas to young copyists than even the paintings themselves among the many great masters of all schools prefer titian ’ wooden prints where the trees are well-shaped and those which cornelius cort and agostino carracche have engraved engraved and say again that beginners can do no better than contract above all things an habit of imitating the touches of these great masters and of considering at the same time the perspective of the branches and foliages and observing how they appear either when rising and seen from below or when sinking and seen from above or when fronting and viewed from point or when they appear in profile and in word when set in the various views which nature prefents them in without altering their characters arter having studied and copied with the pen or crayon first the prints and then the designs of titian and carracche the stu- dent should imitate with the pencil those touches which they have most distinctly specifech ifschejrppijtingeschnshf piesppeds but since they are icaree others fhouig be got which have good character for their touching as those of fouquier who is most excellent model paul bril breugel and bourdon are also very good their touching is neat lively and thin after having duly weighed the nature of trees their spread and- order and the disposition of their branches the artist must up the spirit of them throughout either by making them apparent and distinct in the fore- fore-grounds or obscure and confused in proportion to their distance after having thus gained some know ledge in good manner it will next be pro- per to study after nature and to chuse and rectify it according to the idea which the aforesaid great masters had of it as to perfection iit can only he expected from long practise and perseverance this me- thinks is what concerns those who having an inclination for landfkip would take the proper methods for beginning it well as for those who have made some ada vances in this part of painting it is pro- per they should collect the necessary ma¬ terials for their further improvement and study those objects at least which they shall have most frequent occasion to represent painters usually comprise under the word study any thing whatever which they either design or paint separately after the life whether figures heads feet hands draperies animals mountains trees plants flowers fruits or whatever may confirm them in the just imitation of nature the drawing of these things say is what they call study whether they be for instructiop in design or only to affure them of the truth and to perfect their work be it as ijt will this word study is the more properly used by painters as in the diversity of nature they are daily making new discoveries and confirming themselves in what they al- ready know as the landskip-painter need only study such objects as are to be met with in the country would recommend to him some order that his drawings may be always at hand when he wants them could wish for instance that he copied after nature on in general and the different effects of each kind in particular with their trunks foliage and colours would have him also take the same method with some sorts of plants because their variety is great ornament to terraces on fore-grounds woulp have him likewise stady the effects of the sky in the several times of the day and seasons of the year in the various dispositions of clouds both in serene thun- dering and stormy weather and in the off-skip the several forts of rocks waters and other principal objects these drawings which may be made at times should be collected together and all that relate to one matter be put into book to which the artist may have recourse at any time for what he wants now if the fine effects of nature whe- ther in shape or colour whether for an intire picture or part of one be the artist ’ study and if the difficulty lies in chusing those those effects well he must for this purpose be born with good sense good taste and fine genius and this genius must be culti- vated by the observations which ought to be made on the works of the best masters how they chose nature and how while they corrected her according to their art they preserved her character with these advantages derived from nature and per- fected by art the painter can ’ fail to make good choice and by distinguishing be- tween the good and the bad must needs find great instruction even from the most common things to improve themselves in this kind of studies painters have taken several methods and ibelieve it will not be here imper- tinent to mention those have seen practised and of which myself have some experi- ence there are some artists who have de- signed after nature and in the open fields and have there quite finished those parts which they had chosen but without adding any colour to them others have drawn in oil-colours in middle tint on strong paper and found this method convenient because the colours sinking they could put colour on colour tho ’ different from each other for this purpose they took with them flat box .which commodioussy held their pallet pen- cils oil and colours this method which indeed requires several implements is doubt- less the best for drawing nature more par- ticularly and with greater exactness espe cially if after the work be dry and varnisn ’ the artist return to the place where he drew and retouch the principal things after nature others have only drawn the out-linès of objects and slightly wasn them in colours near the life for tlie ease of their memory others have attentively observed such partâ às they had mind to retain and contented themselves with committing them to theif memory which upon occasion gave thei à faithful account of them others have made dra wings in pastil and wash togenner others with more curiofity and patience have gone several times to the places which were to their taste the first time they only made choice of the parts and dfew them correctly and the other tijnes were as apent in observing the variety of colouring and its alterations through change of light now these several methods are very good and each may be practised as best fuits the student and his temper bijt they fequire the necessaries ofpainting as cédouis pencils pastils and leisure nature how- ever at certain timés prefents extraordinary but transient beautiés and such as ccan be of no service to the artift who has nôt as buch time as is necessary to imitate what she act- mires mires the best way think to make advantage of such momentary co-asions is this the painter being provided with of paper and black lead pencil let him quickly but slightly design what he sees extraordinary and to remember the colouring let him mark the princi- pal parts with characters which he may explain at the bottom of the paper as far as is necessary for himself to understand them cloud for instance may be markd another cloud light à mountain terrace and so on and having re- peated these letters at the bottom of the paper let him write against each that ’ tis of such or such colour or for greater bre- vity only blue red violet grey or any other shorter abbreviation after this he must go to painting as soon as possiblé otherwise most of what he has observed will in little time slip out of his memory this method is the morg useful as it mot only prevents our losing an infinity of sud- den and transitory beauties but also hélps by means of the aforesaid marks and cha- racters to perfect the other methods have mentioned ir it be afkd which is the properest time for these studies answer that na- ture should be studied at all times becausg she is to be represented at all seasons but autumn autumn yields the most plentiful harvest for her fine effects the mildness of that season the beauty of the sky the richness of the earth and the variety of objects are power- ful inducements with the painter to make the proper inquiries for improving his genius and perfecting his art but as we can not see nor-observe every thing ’ tis very commendable to make use of other mens studies and to look upon them as if they were our own raphael sent some young men intogreece to design such things as he thought would be of service to him and accordingly made use of them to as good purpose as if he himself had de- signed them on the spot for this raphael is so far from deserving censure that he ought on the contrary to be commended as an example that painters ought to leave no way untried for improving in their pro- fessions the landskip-painter may accord- ingly make use of the works of all those who have excelled in any kind in order to acquire good manner like the bees which gather their variety of honey from flowers general general remarks on landseip the general rules of painting are the basis of all the several kinds of it we must refer the landskip-painter to them or rather suppose him to be well acquainted with them we shall here only make some general remarks on this kind of painting landskip supposes the knowledge and practice of the principal rules in ber- spective in order to maintain probability the nigher the leaves of trees are to the earth the larger they are and the greener as being aptest to receive in abundance the sap which nourishes them and the upper branches begin first to take the redness or yellowness which colours them in autumn but ’ tis otherwise in plants for their stocks renew all the year round and their leaves succeed one another at considerable distance of time insomuch that nature employed in producing new leaves to adorn the stock as it rises does by de- grees desert the under ones which having first performed their office are the first that die but this effect is more visible in some than others the under parts of all leaves are of brighter green than the upper and almost of landskip always incline to the silverisn and those which are wind-shaken are known from others by that colour but if we view them from beneath when penetrated by the sun ’ rays they discover such fine and lively green as is far beyond all comparison there are five principal things which give spirit to landskip to wit figures ani¬ mals waters wind-shaken trees and thin- ness of pencilling to which add smoke when there ’ occasion to introduce it when one colour predominates throughout landskip as one green in spring or one red in autumn the piece wili look either as of one colour or else as unfinisn ’ have seen many of bourdon ’ landskips which by handling the corn one way throughout have lost much of their beauty tho the situations and waters were very pleasant the ingeni- ous painter must endeavour to correct and as they say redeem the harsh unsightly colouring of winter and spring by means of figures waters and buildings for summer and autumn subjects are of themselves ca pable of great variety titian and carrucche are che beft models for inspiring good itaste and leadimg the painter into good track with regard to forms and colours he must wse all dis efforts to gain juft idea of the principles which which thofs great men have left us in their works and to have his imagination silled with them if he would advance by degrees towards that perfection which the artist should always have in view the landskips of these two masters each us great many things of waich dis- course can give us no exact idea nor any general priaciple which way for example can the measures of trees in general be deter- mined as we determine thofe of the human body the tree has no settled proportions most of its beauty lies in the contraft of its branches an unequal distributaon of boughs and in short kind of whimfical variety vykich nature delights an and of whieh the painter becomes judge when he has tho- roughly relished the works of the twa masters aforesaid but must say in ti- tion praise that the path he struck out is the surest because he has enactly iitated nature in its variety with an exquifite taste and fine colouring whereas carragche tho an able artist has not mare ghan others been stroe from manner in his landfkip one of the gneatest perfections iof landfkip in che variety it represents às imitation of each particular cha- racter as its greateft fault licentious gractice wbick brings us zo do tthings by roee among those things which are painted practically we ought to intermix some done after nature to induce the spectator to be- lieve that all are so as there are styles of thought so there are also styles of execution have handled the two relating to thought to wit the heroick and pastoral and find that there are two also with regard to execution to wit the firm style and the polished these two concern the pencil and the more or less ingenious way of conducting it the firm style gives life to work and excuses for bad choice and the polished finishes and brightens every thing it leaves no employ- ment for the spectator ’ imagination which pleases itself in discovering and finishing things which it afcribes to the artist though in fact they proceed only from itself the polished style degenerates into the soft and dull if not supported by good open- ing or situation but when those two cha- racters meet the picture is fine ii having thus taken survey of the principal parts of landskip having spoken of the study proper for it and made some general remarks on this kind of painting question not but several readers that this work may be made less defective wish me to say something of the practice and use of colours but as every man has his own particular particular practice and the use of colours comprehends part of the secrets in painting we must expect minute account of them only from tne friendship and conversation of the ablest painters and join their opinions to our own experience portraiture if painting be an imitation of nature ’ tis — doubly so in portrait which not only represents man in general but such an one as may be distinguished from all others and as the greatest perfection of portrait is extreme likeness so the greatest of its faults is to resemble person for whom it was not made since there are not in the world two persons quite like one another but before we proceed to the particulars which let us into the knowledge of this imitation tis necessary for shortening this discourse to take view of some general propositions which are preparatory to what am going to say and will make amends for what shall omit imitation is the essence of painting and good choice is to this essence what the vargues are to man they raise the value of it for this reason ’ tis extremely the painters interest to chuse none but good heads or favourable moments for drawing them them and such positions as may supply the want of fine natural ii there are views of the natural more or less advantageous all depends upon turn- ing it well and taking it in the favourable moment iii there is not à single person in the world who has not peculiar character both in body and face iv sinple and genuine nature is more pro¬ per for imitation and is better choice than nature much formed and embellished too artificially to adorn nature too much is doing it violence and the action which attends it can never be free when its ornaments are not easy in short in proportion as we adorn nature we make it degenerate from itself and bring it down to art vi some means are more advantageous than others to come to the same end vii we must not only imitate what we do see in nature but also what we may possibly see that is advantageous in art viii viii things are valuable by comparison and it is only by this we are enabled to make right judgment of them ix painters easily accustom themselves to their own tints and the manner of their masters and after this habit is rooted in them they view nature not as she really is but as they are used to paint her tisvery difficult to make picture thè figures of which are as big as the life to have its effect near as at distance learned picture pleases the ignorant only when it is at some distance but judges will admire its artifice near and its effect at distance xi knowledge makes work pleasant and easy the traveller who knows his road comes to his journey ’ end with more speed and certainty than he who inquires and gropes it out xii tis proper before we begin work to meditate upon it and to make nice co- lourd sketch of it for our own satisfaction and an help to the memory we can not too much reflect on these propositions and it is necessary to be so well ’ acquainted with them that they may present present themselves to our mind of their own accord without our being at the trou- ble to recal them to our memory when we are at work there are four things necessary to make portrait perfect air colouring attitude and dress of air the air respects the lines of the face the head-attire and the size the lines of the face depend upon exacta ness of draught and agreement of the parts which all together must represent the phy- siognomy of the person painted in such mannet that the picture of his body may seem to be also that of his mind it is not exactness of design in portraits that gives spirit and true air so much as the agreement of the parts at the very moment when the disposition and temperament of the sitter are to be hit off we see several por- traits which though correctly designed have cold languishing and stupid air whilst others lefs correct in design strike us however at first sight with the sitter ’ character few painters have been careful enough to put the parts well together sometimes the mouth is smiling and the eyes are sad at other times the eyes are chearful and the cheeks lank by which means their work has has false air and looks unnatural we ought therefore to mind that when the sitter puts on fmiling air the eyes close the corners of the mouth draw up towards the- nostrils the cheeks swell and the eye- brows widen but in melancholy air these parts have contrary effect the eyebrows being raised give grave and noble air but if arch ’ an air of astc- nishment of all the parts of the face that which contributes most to likeness is the nose ’ tis therefore of great moment to set and draw it well though the hair of the head seem to be part of the dress which is capable of various forms without altering the air of the face yet the head-attire which one has been most accustomed to creates such like- ness that we scarce know familiar ac- quaintance on his putting on periwig some- what different from that which he used to wear tis necessary therefore as far as possible to take the air of the head-orna- ment and make it accompany and set off that of the face if there be no reason to the contrary as to the stature it contributes so much to likenefs that we very often know people without seeing their face ’ tis therefore ex- tremely proper to draw the size after the sitter himself and in such an attitude as we think think fit which was vandykes method here let us remark that in sitting the person appears to be of lefs free make through the heaving of his shoulders where- fore to adjust his size ’ tis proper to make him stand for small time swaying in the posture we would give him and then make our observation but here occurs difficulty which shall endeavour to examine whetber ’ tis proper in portraiture to cor- rect the defects of nature likeness being the essence of por- traiture it would seem that we ought to mitate defects as well as beauties since by his means thé imitation will be more com- plete it would be even hard to prove the contrary to one who would undertake the defence of this position but ladies and gentlemen do not much approve of those painters who entertain such sentiments and put them in practice have known ladies rankly own that they had no value for painter who made strong likeness and hat they had rather their pictures had much ess resemblance and more beauty it is certain that some complaisance in this respect is due to them and question not out their pictures may be made to resemble without displeasing them for the effectual likeness is just agreement of the parts that are painted with those of nature so that we may be at no loss to know the air of the face and the temper of the person whose picture is before us this being laid down say that all deformities when the air and temper may be discovered without them ought to be either corrected or omitted in womens and young mens portraits nose somewhat awry may be help ’ or shriveled neck or high shoulders adapted to good air without going from one extreme to another but this must be done with great discretion for by endeavouring to correct nature too much we insensibly fall into method of giving general air to all our por- traits just as by confining ourselves too much to the defects and littleness of nature we are in danger of falling into the low and tasteless manner but in the faces of heroes and men of rank distinguished either by dignities vir- tues or great qualities we can not be too exact whether the parts-be beautiful op not for portraits of such persons are to be standing monuments to posterity in which case every thing in picture is precious that is faithful but after whatever manner the painter acquits himself in this point let him never forget good air nor grace and that there are in the natural advantageous mo- ments for hitting them off of colouring colouring in portraiture is an effusion of nature discovering the true tempers of persons and the temper being essential to likeness it ought to be handled as exactly as the design this part is the more valuable as ’ tis rare and difficult to hit great many painters have come to à likeness by strokes and outlines but certainly they are few who have shewn in colours the tempers of persons two points are necessary in colouring exactness of tints and the art of setting them off the former is acquired by prac- tice in examining and comparing the co- lours we see in life with those by which we would imitate it and the art of these tints consists in knowing what one colour will produce when set by another and in making good what either distance or time may abate of the glow and freshness of the colours painter who does nothing more than what he sees will never arrive at perfect imitation for though his work may seem on the easel to be good to him it may not appear so to others and perhaps even to himself at distance tint which near appears disjoined and of one colour may look of another at distance and to be confounded in the mafs it belongs to if you would have your work there- fore to produce good effect in the place where ’ tis to hang both the colours and lights must be little loaded but learnedly and with discretion in this point consult titian rubens vandyke and rembrant' methods for indeed their art is won- derful the tints usually require three times of observation the first is at the person ’ first sitting down when he has more spirit and colour than ordinary and this is to be noted in the first hour of his sitting the second is when being composed his look is as usual which is to be observed in the second hour and the third is when through tiresomeness by sitting in one posture his colour alters to what weariness usually creates on which account ’ tis beft to keep to the sitter ’ usual tint little im- proved he may also rise and take some turns about the room to gain frefh spirits and shake off or prevent tiresomeness in draperies all forts of colours do not suit all sorts of persons in mens porkxaits we need only observe great truth and great force but in womens there must also be charms whatever beauty they have must appear in fine light and their blemishes must by some means or other be sostened for this reason white lively and bright tint tint ought never to be set off by fine yel- low which would make it look like plaster out rather by colours inelining to green blue or grey or such others as by their opposition may make the tint appear more fleshy than usual in fair women vandyke often made fillemot-colourd curtain for his ground but that colour is soft and brown brown women on the other hand who have yellow enough in their tints to support the character of fleshiness may very well have yellowish draperies in order to bring down the yellow of their tints and make them look the fresher and near very high-colourd and lively carnations linen does wonders in grounds two things are observable the tone and the colour the colour is to be considered in the same manner as those of draperies with respect to the head the tone rnust be al ways different from the mass it supports and of which it is the ground that the objects coming upon it may not seem transparent but solid and raised the colour of the hair of the head usually de- termines the tone of the ground and when the former is bright chesnut we are often embarassed unless help ’ by means of curtain or some accident of the claro- obscuro supposed to be behind or unless the ground is fky we must further observe that where ground is neither curtain nor landfkip or such-like but is plain and like wall it ought to be very much party-colour ’ with al- most imperceptible patches or stains for besides its being so in nature the picture will look the more grand of attitude or posture attitudes ought to suit the ages and qualities of persons and their tempers in old men and women they should be grave majestick and sometimes bold and gene- rally in women they ought to have noble simplicity and modest chearfulness for modesty ought to be the character of wo- men charm infinitely beyond coquetry and indeed coquets themselves care not to be painted such attitudes are of two kinds one in motion the other at rest those at rest may suit every person but those in motion are proper for young people only and are hard to be expressed because great part of the hair and drapery must be moved by the air motion in painting being never better expressed than by such agitations the attitudes at rest must not appear so much at rest as ’ to seem to represent an inactive per- son and one who sits for no other purpose but to be copy and though the figure that that is represented be at rest yet the painter if he thinks fit may giveit flying drapery provided the scene or ground be not cham- per or close place it is above all things necessary that the figures which are not employed should ap- pear to satisfy the spectator ’ curiosity and for this purpose shew themselves in such an action as suits their tempers and conditions is if they would inform him what they really were anc as most people pretend to sincerity honesty and greatness of mind we must avoid in attitudes all manner of affectation every thing there must appear easy and natural and discover more or less spirit nobleness and majesty in proportion to the persons character and dignity in short the portraits in this fort of attitudes must seem to speak to us of themselves and is it were to say to us — stop take notice of me am that invincible king surrounded with majesty— am that valiant com¬ nander who struck terror every-wbere or who by my good conduct have had such glo- rious success— iam that great minister who knew all the springs of politicks that magistrate of consummate wisdom and robity— iam that man of letters who is absorbed in the sciences- am that wise and sedate person whom the love of philosopby was raised above desires and ambition —- that pious learned and vigilant pre- late late — tam that protector of the fine arts and lover of virtue-— am that famous artisan wbo was so singular in his profession and in women the language ought to be — tam the wise princess whose grand air inspires respect and confidence — am that bigh-spirited lady wbose noble manners command esteem .— iam that virtuous — am courteous and modest lady that chearful lady who delight in smiles and joy and so of others in word the attitudes are the language of portraits and the skilful painter ought to give great attention to them but the best attitudes in my opinion are such as induce the spectator to think that the sitter took favourable opportunity of being seen to advantage and without affectation there is only one thing to be observed with regard to womens portraits in whatever attitude they are placed which is that they sway in such manner as to give their face but little shade and that we carefully examine whether the lady appears most beautiful in smiling or in ferious air and conduct ourselves accordingly let us now proceed to the next article of dress by the word dress understand the drapery which eloathes person painted and the the manner in which it is fitted every person must be cloathed according to his quality and in painting it is only the dress that can make distinction of persons but besides keeping to the rank and quality of the person who is drawn his drapery must also be well chosen and well cast very rich cloaths seldom become men and much lacing is beneath their gravity women ought to be adorned in negligent manner but without departing from their dignity and nobleness and when men and women insist on other management the artist must seek his pleasure in imitating what they would have done variety of stuffs gives work the character of truth but imaginary draperies destroy it at this time most portraits are drapered in very odd manner but whether this is proper we shall here endeavour to examine the partisans for this new kind of dra- pery alledge that the french modes being very changeable portfaits become ridiculous in five or six years after they are drawit whereas the dresses that are made after the painter ’ fancy always stand that wo- meas habits have ridiculous sleeves which keep their arms locked up in manner that is very stiff and neither favourable to nature nor painting and that the custom which has prevailed by little and litile of paint- ing ing draperies in this manner ought to be no more followed in this particular than in any other others on the contrary maintain that modes are essential to portraiture and are not only of service to the person painted but also monuments of the times that portraits as they are part of history ought to be faithful in every respect which say they is so true that we should at this day be very sorry to see in medals bas-reliefs and ather antiquities the romans cloathed in different habits from those they wore and that it would appear ridiculous to see their portraits in greeé dress as ours are often so by being in roman at least we should be led by this means into an error as to modes growing ridiculous in six years they answer that we must not impute it to the mode since ’ twas once thought handsome but rather to the understanding which is apt to judge of things not by their relation to-the time when they exifted but by their agree- ment with the present they add that although this aversion to mode may be ex- cusable in real drefs ’ tis nevertheless in painting weakness which the understand- ing takes in at the eye and that it ought rather to be an useful diversion and pleasing instruction to see that at such times people wore broad bands at others ruffs bonnets hanging sleeves caps short hair slafhed doublets doublets scallop ’ point-bands and the like which modes inform us of the times when those persons flourisn ’ as the persons shew is the times when those modes prevailed they alledge also the authority of antient painters of repute as titian raphael paol veronese tintoret fe carracchis van- dyke and in short all portraitists before this shifting of modes came into use which the women have introduced into france within these twenty or thirty years now to give some decision between these two parties the truth appears to me to be this that ’ tis more difficult to give modish habits some agreeable air in painting than to cloathe portraits handsomely when the painter is left to his own liberty think also that modisn habits might sometimes be proper for family portraits and sometimes the drapery of some virtue or attribute or pagan divinity of practice in portraiture can not but think that every man having peculiar cast of mind has also peculiar manner of pursuing his ends and that one may have the same success by making different ways it is also my opinion that every man ought in this respect to fol¬ low the bent of his own genius and take he road he finds the shortest and most con- venient venient shall therefore say nothing particular upon this subject but only observe in ge- neral that portraiture requires three different sittings and operations to zoit dead-colour- ing second-colouring and retouching or finishing before the painter dead-colour he must attentively consider what aspect will best suit the sitter by putting him in dif- ferent positions if we have not any settled design before us and when we have de- termined this ’ tis of the laft consequence to put the parts well together by comparing always one part with another for not only the portrait acquires greater likeness when well designed but ’ tis troublesome to make alterations at the second sitting when the artist must only think of painting that is of disposing and uniting his colours experience tells us that the dead¬ colouring ought to be clean because of the slope and transparency of the colours espe- cially in the shades and when the parts are well put together and become clammy they must be judicioussy sweetened and melted into each other yet without taking away the air of the picture that the painter may have the pleasure of finishing it in propor- tion as he draws but if fiery genius ’ do not like this method of scumbling let them only mark the parts slightly and so far as is necessary for giving an air in dead-colouring ’ tis proper to put in rather too little than too much hair about the forehead that in finishing we may be at liberty to place it where we please and to paint it with all possible softness and de- dicacy if on the contrary vou sketch upon the forehead lock whjch may appear to be of good taste and becoming the work you may be puzzled in finishing it and not find the life exactly in the same po- sition as you would paint it but this ob- servation is not meant for men of fkill and consummate experience who have nature in their heads and make her submit to their ideas the business of the second sitting is to put the colours well in their places and to paint them in manner that is suitable to the sitter and to the effect we propose but before they are made clammy we ought to examine afresn whether the parts are rightly placed and here and there to give some touches towards likeness that when we are assured of it the work may go on with greater satisfaction if the painter under- stands what he is about and the portrait be justly designed he ought as much as pos- sible to work quick the sitter will be bet- ter pleased and the work will by this means have the more spirit and life but this readiness is only the effect of long study and experience for we may well be allowed considerable considerable time to find out road that is easy and such as we must often travel before we retouch or finish ’ tis pro- per to terminate the hair that on finishing the carnations we may be abler to judge of the effect of the whole head if at the second sitting we can not do all we intended which often happens the third makes up the loss and gives both spirit physiognomy and character if we would paint portrait at once we must load the colouring but neither sweeten nor drive norvery much oil it and if we dip the pencil in varnisn as the work ad- vances this will readily enable us to put colour on colour and to mix them without driving the use and sight of good pictures give greater light into things than words can ex- press what hits one artist ’ understanding and temper may be disagreeable to another ’ and almost all painters have taken different ways though their principles were often the same the famous jabac man well known to all the lovers of the fine arts and friend of vandyke who thrice drew his picture told me that as he once observed to him how little time he bestowed on his portraits vandyke vandyke answered that at first he workd bard and took great pains to acquire à re- putation and also to geta swift hand against the time he should work for bis kitchen van¬ dyke ’ custom as jabac told me was this he appointed both the day and hour for the person ’ sitfing and work ’ not above in hour on any portrait éither in rub- ing in or finishing so that as soon as ais clock informed him that the hour was ut he rose up and made bow to the sitter to signify that he had done enough for that day and then appointed another hour some other day whereupon his ser- want came to clean his pencils and brought fresh pallet whilst he was re- ceiving another sitter whose day and hour he had before appointed by this method he work ’ on several pictures the same day with extraordinary expedition after having lightly dead-colourd the face he put the sitter into somé attitude which he had before contrived and on grey paper with white and black crayons he designed in quarter of an hour his shape and drapery which he disposed in grand manner and an exquisite tasté after this jabac ’ observation has according to english tra- lition been made to vandyke by others and his answer hen was that he at first work for reputation but nou er bis kitchen if both reports be true vandyke seems have had very early view of his kitchen he gave the drawing to the skilful people he had about him to paint after the sitter ’ own cloaths which at vandyke ’ request were sent to him for that purpose when his disciples had done what they could to these draperies he lightly went over them again and so in little time by his great knowledge displayed the art and truth which we at this day admire in them as for hands he had in his house people of both sexes whom he paid and who served as models mention this conduct of vandyke rather to gratify the reader ’ curiosity than to excite his imitation he may chuse as much of it as he pleases and suits his own genius and leave the rest for my part dislike no part of it except that of sitting only one hour which think too little must observe by the way that there is nothing so rare as fine hands either in design or colouring tis therefore convenient to cultivate if we can friendship with some woman who will take pleasure in ferving for copy the way to win them is to praise their beauty exceedingly but if an opportunity serves of copying handa after vandyke it must not be let slip for he drew them with surprising delicacy and an admirable colouring is of great service to copy after-the manners which come nearest to nature as are those those of titian and vandyke we must at such times believe them to be nature itself and at some distance consider them as such and say to ourselves — what colour and shall use for such partè and then coming near the picture we ought to examine whether we are right or not and to make fixed rule of what we have dis- covered and did not practisé before with- thout uncertainty but to return to por- believe tis proper before we begin colouring to catch the very first moments which are commonly the most agreeable and most advantageous and to keep them in our memory for use when we are finish- ing for the sitter growing tired with be- in long in the first same place loses those spirits which at his first sitting down gave beauty to the parts and convey ’ to the tint more lively blood and fresher colour in short we must join to truth probable and advan- tageous possibility which far from abating likenes serves rather to set it off for this end we ought to begin with observing the ground of tint as well what it is in lights as in shades for the shades are only beautiful as they are proportioned to the light we must say observe if the tint be very lively whether it partake of yel- lowness and where that yellowness is placed because usually towards the end of the sitting fatigue diffuses general yellowness which makes us forget what parts were of this colour and what were not unless we had taken due notice of it before for this reason at the second sitting the colours must be every-where readily clappd in and such as appear at the first sitting down for these are always the finest the surest way to judge of colours is by comparison and to know tint nothing than to compare it with linen placed next it or else placed next to the natural object if there is occasion say this only to those who have little practised nature the portrait being now suppofed to be as much finish ’ as you are able nothing re- mains but at some reasonable distance to view both the picture and sitter together in order to determine with certainty whether there is any thing still wanting to perfect the work of political conduct in portraiture but it is not enough that all these precautions be taken for making the por- trait perfect others must also be taken for making it thought so in france let portrait be ever so wonderful if it has not stood the criticism of the woinen and had their approbation ’ tis thought to be paltry and eontinues in oblivion for the complai¬ sance sance that is shewn them makes the men echo back what they have determined in france the ladies command and decide like fovereigns and the trifles which are to their taste are destructive to the great man- ners in painting they would even pervert titian and vandyke if they were still living and obliged to work for them in order therefore to avoid the vexation which such inconsiderate judgments may occasion ’ tis necessary to use some political conduct with regard to persons and times the artist must never shew his work in dead-colour to any but painters who are his friends in order to have their opinion upon it nor indeed is it proper to shew any thing finish ’ unless it be fram ’ and ver- nish ’ nor must we in the sitter ’ presencc afk the opinion of people who are strangers to the art because seeing him in one view and the picture in another they will advise the mending what they take to be amiss itwill be an vain for the artist to offer his reafons for as people seldom care to retract and by that means to own that they may be mistaken they will never be favourable tis best there- fore not to give them any handle for de- cision or if they will offer their opinion of their own accord let some artifice be employed to elude long tiresome and uselefs reasoning make them believe for instance instance that the picture is not quite finisn ’ or tell them they are partly in the right and that you are going to retouch it or any thing of this kind that may be able to silence them immediatelys you know what vafari relates of michael angelo on the like occa- sion the pope had been at michael an- gelo ’ work-shop to see marble figure he had carved for him and having no skill himself he softly afk ’ his groom of the chamber how he likd it he answerd that the nose was too large.—-whereupon the pope raising his voice said as of his own accord — the nose is too large michael angelo who perceived what had passed told the pope that bis criticism was just and that he would go and mend the fault in his presence accordingly with his mallet in one hand and chisel and some marble-dust in the other he put himself into working posture before the statue and after having knocked upon his chisel without touching the marble and let the dust fall by degrees out of his hand he turned about and said to the pope-— ad- esso santissimo padre che gliene pare what does your holiness think of it now o michel angelo said the pope gli avete dato la vita ol now my dear sir you have made the figure alive apelles would afk nobody ’ opinion but as pliny says kept behind the cloth and finding shoemaker ’ criticism on the sandal-strap of figure to be reasonable he mended it which elated the poor mechanick so much that he began to joke the artist for something in the thigh which was not to his liking this obliged apelles to tell him scornfully that shoemakers judgment should not exceed the fandal thus when those who pretend to judge shall justly find fault in your work tis wisdom to profit by it without hearken- ing to them too mucl or encouraging their criticisi because they will abuse your do- cility and your praising them for the good hints they may give will provoke them to offer bad ones but in this the painter must employ both art and good breeding by making proper distinctions between the per- sons who talk and give their opinion of his works of colouring formerly publisned dialogue on colouring where endeavourd to shew its value and rank in painting but what now write being handled by way of principles thought colouring ought to be treated in the same manner that this part of painting which is so necessary to all the rest might join with them in making one whole and that the reader might the more easily judge of it there are several people who speaking of painting uie the words colour and colour- ei ng indifferently to signify the same thing and tho ’ these two parts are distinguishable enough yet it may not be improper to ex- plain what we mean by each of them colour is what makes objects percep- tible to sight and colouring is one of the essential parts of painting by which the artist imi- tates the appéarance of colours in all natural objects and gives to artificial objects the colour that is most proper to deceive the this part includes the knowledge of particular colours their sympathies and anti- pathies their manner of working and the knowledge of the claro-obscuro and as think this branch of art has been very little if at all understood by great many of the ablest painters of the two last centuries think myself obliged to give here as true an idea of it as can in order to shew its merit some also confound the simple or capital colour with the local tho their difference be great for the simple colour is that which does not by itself represent objects as pure white without mixture or pure black or pure yellow or pure red blue green or other colours first put on the pallet to make mixtures for faithful imitation of an object whereas the local colour by its agreement with the place it possesses and by the assistance of some other colour represents single object as car- nation linen stuff or any object distinct from others and it is called local because the place it fills requires that particular co- lour in order to give the greater character of truth to the several colours about it but to proceed the painter ought to consider that as there are two forts of objects the natural or that which is true and the artificial or that which is painted so there are two sorts of colours the natural and the arti- ficial ficial the natural colour is that which makes all the objects in nature visible to us and the artificial is judicious mixture of the simple colours on the pallet in order to imitate those of natural objects the painter must therefore have per- fect knowledge of these two sorts of co- lours of the natural in order to know which of them he ought to imitate and of the artificial in order to compose tint proper for representing perfectly the natural colour he must know besides that the natural colour is of three forts the true colour of the object the reflected co- lour the colour of the light as to arti- ficial colours he ought also to know their value force and sweetness both separately and by comparison that he may either ex- aggerate by some colours or attenuate by others as his subject requires for this purpose it must be considered that picture is flat superficies that some time after the colours are laid they lose their freshness and that the distance of the picture takes from it much of its brightness and vigour and therefore that ’ tis impos- sible to make up these three deficiencies without the artifice which colouring teaches and which is its chief object knowing painter ought not to be flave to nature but à judge and judicious imitator imitator of her let picture but have its effect and agreeably deceive the eye and ’ tis all that can be expected in this point but this can never be attained if the painter neglects colouring as it is certain that the whole can not be perfect if any part is wanting and that he is not an able painter who is ignorant of some of the parts of his art so would as much blame painter for neglecting colouring as for ill designing or ill disposing his figures there is however no part of paint- ing where nature is always proper to be imitated that is such nature as offers it- self by chance though she is mistress of arts yet she seldom shews us the best road she only hinders us from going astray the painter must chuse her accord- ing to the rules of art and if he does not find her to be such as he looks for he must correct what offers to him as he wha designs does not imitate all he ’ sees in defective copy but changes the faults into the just proportions so the artist must not imitate all the colours which indifferently present themselves to the eye but chuse the most proper for his purpose adding others if he think fit in order to fetch out the effect and beauty of his work his objects must not only be each of them fine na- tural and true but there must be also an union of the whole together sometimes he must must lessen the vivacity of the life at other times he must exaggerate or improve upon the brightnefs and force of the colours he meets with that he may thus express with greater spirit and truth the character of his object without altering it there are none but great painters and those are but few who have arrived at this art and this learned exaggeration or improvement is so far from weakening the truth of imitation that it gives more truth to what the artist imitates after nature let me here apprise the reader that speaking in general of painting design or colouring always suppose them to be in their perfection those who object to colouring say that ve must needs afcribe to design correctness of proportions an elegance of out-lines and delicacy of expression and that the roman school which was rapbael ’ has al- ways endeavoured principally after these three points as the first and most perfect intentions of nature and made little account of coloür- ing wherefore the artist say they ought to look upon design as his principal object and upon colouring as only accessary answer that the original intentions of nature are not less visible in colouring than in design that indeed these three qualities ascribed to design enhance its va- lue but on the other hand that the artist must must have begun his studies with acquiring them and must be supposed to be perfect master of them and yet they alone do not constitute the painter they only begin him and wait for their perfection from co- louring with regard to the whole com- position god in the creation of bodies has furnished his creatures with ample matter for praising him and discovering him to be their author and having stamped visible colours on them he has-given room to painters to imitate his omnipotency and to produce as it were out of nothing second nature which exists only in their ideas in fact all things on earth would be in con- fusion and bodies only perceptible by touch if diversity of colours did not distinguisn them the painter therefore who is per- fect imitator of nature and supposed to be good designer ought to make colouring his chief object since he only considers na- ture as she is imitable and she is only imitable by him as she is visible and she is only visible as she is coloured for this reason we may consider colouring as the difference in painting and design as its kind* just as reason is the difference of man because it constitutes his being di- stinguishes him from other creatures and alluding to the logical terms genus and differentia sets sets him above them for since the ideas of things ought to serve only for bringing them out of confusion tis necessary to con- ceive them by something which ’ each has in particular and which can not agree with any thing else if we consider the painter by his invention we rank him among the poets if by perspective as some say he is not distinguishable from the mathematician and if by the proportions and measures of bodies we confound him with the sculptor and geometer so tho ’ the perfect idea of the painter depends on design and colouring jointly yet he must form special idea of his art only by colouring fince by this difference which makes him perfect imi- tator of nature we distinguisn him from such as have only design for their object and whose art can not come up to this perfect imitation which painting leads to and we can only be understood to mean painter among the arts which have design in we may reckon common with painting sculpture architecture and engraving which are thus defined painting is an art which on flat superficies imitates all visible objects tis of many kinds and usually divided into mosaick fresco distemper oil crayon miniature and enamel sculpture is an art which by means of design and solid matter imitates the palpable palpable objects of nature tis usually divided into whole-relief and bas-relief architectureis an art that by de- sign and suitable proportions imitates and erects all sorts of edifices tis usually di- vided into civil and militaky engraving is an art that by means of design and incision into an hard matter imitates the lights and shades of visible ob- jects and is-divided into wood engraving etching and black manner the black manner which is of late invention is so called because instead of pre- æ this being it feems but late invention in france and our author very backward in doing justice to english productions of that kind we think ourselves obliged to give the reader fmall sketch of what we call mezzotints this invention is owing to prince rupert who after king charles il. ’ restoration made several prints in that manner the prince laid his grounds on the plates with chanell ’ roller as the french do theirs by close and cross-hatching perhaps the only difference between their method and ours his succesz gave occasion to one sherwin to make some attempts in the same way but he laid his grounds with an half- round file weighted with an heavy piece of lead the prince on sight of sherwin ’ prints thinking his ser- vants had divulged his seeret sent for him who satis- fving his highness to the contrary by shewing hiin his of his rollers file the prince thereupon gave him one to sherwin sueceeded isaat becket and william faithorn and preparing the plate by polishing it ground is laid upon it of close engraving crofsing every way uniformly so as on taking proof it shall appear very strong and in- tirely black the black graving therefore is that where instead of graver to form the strokes and shades they use burnisher to fetch the objects out of darknese and give them by dègrees their proper lights the cutting of precious stones the reader may ascribe either to sculpture or engraving yet people usually say grave-stones and ’ tis and after them were van somer lens smith williams and symons old and young faber george whité among these smith and white seem to be the most excellent the former is still living and his collection of prints mostlv after sir godfrey kneller ’ paintings perhaps the finest in europe and his duke schomberg ’ head and the holy family after picture of carlo maratti are thought to be his best performances white died middle-aged few years ago and though his prints are but few they are observed to have fine paint-like expression for he was painter and bestowed much time on his plates not to be found any-where else his best print is jobn baptist monoyer the flower-painter ’ head both prince rupert ’ and sherwin ’ grounding tools have been laid aside some years and the grounds are now laid with an hand-tool some- what like shoemaker ’ cutting-board-knife the edge whereof having fort of fine crenelling raises thick imperceptible stipping or ground on the plate and was the invention of one edial smith by trade who afterwards became mezzo- tinto printer very probable that the workmen employed in this were both sculptors and engravers without my being at the trouble to define all these divisions ’ tis easy to observe that design which is their rind that is common to them all is determined by particular difference which constitutes what is essential to each of these arts the end of the painter and the sculptor is indeed imitation but they attain it by different methods the sculptor by solid matter imitating the real quantities of objects and the painter with colours shew- ing the apparent quantity and quality of all things visible so that he is not only obliged to please but even deceive the eye by what he represents to this ’ tis usually objected that design is the foundation and support of colouring that tho colouring depends upon it yet it no-wise depends on colouring and therefore the former is more necessary more noble and more considerable than the latter but not conclude any thing in favour of design to the prejudice of colouring on the con- trary we may infer from thence that mere design alone is not as it is supposed to be the foundation of colouring nor has prior existence to it in any other sense but this that it must receive its perfection with re gard to painting from colouring and there is no doubt but the thing which receives must have prior existence to that which is to be received tis the same with all kinds of matters which must be disposed before they can re- ceive the perfection of substantial forms the human body for instance must be intirely formed and organized before it re- ceive the soul this was god ’ method with the first man he took earth and after having given it the necessary dispositions he created the soul which he infused into it for perfecting it into man this body as to its existence had no dependence on the soul because it was prior to the soul and yet no one will affirm that the -body is the more noble and more considerable part of the man nature always makes her begin- nings by means of things less perfect and art in imitation of her takes the same method the painter first rubs in his subject by means of design and afterwards finishes it by the help of colouring which by giving truth to the objects designed gives them at the same time all the perfection that painting is ca- pable of as forbeing more or less necessary to make whole parts that are essential are equally necessary as he is not man who has not soul- joined to his body so that is not painting painting whère colouring is not joined to but if we consider design by itself and as ’ tis instrumental in most parts of art we might for its utility prize it more than colouring as we prefer large diamond be- fore plant tho the meanest plant be in itself more noble and valuable than all the precious stones in the world every one pursues his own profit and considers things in this view ’ tis no wonder if design coming more often into play and being consequently more profitable by its mathematical demonstrations and also by the very draughts themselves which however slight let us into the thought of the work proposed should be more esteemed but if you set colouring aside there will be nothing in design but what may be performed in sculpture which if compared with piece of painting must needs be imperfect for want of colouring and this consideration sets the painter above the sculptor since ob- jects skilfully painted have more perfect resemblance to the true ones yet we can not help allowing that design perfect as we suppose and as we see it in the antique has several marks of elevation which have divided the curious in their choice of pictures for enriching their cabinets in effect according to the subjects and figures which the ancient sculptors had mind to represent represent we discover in their sculptures the terrible or the gracious the simple or the ideal of great character but always sublime and probable on this account we are much in doubt about the preference which ought to be given to pictures whether we ought to prefer such as are better designed than coloured of those which are better coloured than designed but from what we have said of colouring with respect to painting it appears that we must not prefer the former if the design in the latter be not too bad and the reason is that there is design in other things as well as in pictures ’ tis to be found in good prints siatues and bas-reliefs but finc colouring is only to be seen in very few pictures were to make cabinet of pictures should fill it with all such as had any kind of beauty but should prefer-titian ’ to all others for the reasons have given and indeed the price which his works bear among the- curious sufficiently justifies my opinion it must be granted that some persons value design because of the esteem the world has for it in general and of the great numbers of people who for its utility have got manual habit of it and love it much to solve this difficulty we must inquire what is understood by the word design in painting this word has but two signi- cations first it means the thought of picture picture which the painter puts either on paper or cloth in order to judge of what he is contriving and in this manner we may design not only fketch but work well connected as to lights and shades or even small picture well coloured this was rubens ’ method in almost all his designs and the most part of titian ’ which are almost all done with the gen have been performed in the same manner secondly we call design the just measures proportions and outlines supposed to be in visible ob- jects which having no other existence than in the extremities of those bodies do actu- ally reside in the mind and if painters have made them apparent by circumscribing lines and out of absolute necessity it was for the information of their pupils and for their own practice in order to acquire with ease an extreme correctness and yet it may be said that the use of these lines is like that of centre for an arch in archi- tecture where after the stone-work is set the centre is struck in the same manner after the pajnter has formed his figure his lines are of no further use and must no longer appear and it is in this sense that design should be understood to be one of the essential parts of painting but when we give lights and shades to outlines we can- not do it without white and black two of the capital colours in painting and whose management comes under colouring yet have met with several painters who would never allow that design contains only the proportions and outlines of visible objects they say that this part is one of the sorts of design have desined viz the thought of grand picture before it is exe- cuted whether that thought be only slight sketch or be expressed in clare-obscuro and by all the colours proper for the great work of which this design is the specimen believe the best answer to this will be to say that in such case design would no longer be part of painting but the whole of it since it would contain not only lights and shades but also colouring and even in- vention and then we must be always think- ing of new terms and afk these gentlemen by what name they would call that part of design which furnishes the objects that com- pose an history and what name must be given to that other part of design which dis- poses the colours lights and ’ shades ’ hence without further trouble ’ tis easy to con- ceive that ’ tis no matter how we call things provided we understand and agree upon their names and as new terms would be troublesome to the memory ’ think it better to retain the old but let us not here pafs over in silence the pre-eminencies of design the chief of which which are these viz first it alone with- out colouring produces many useful things for which reason great many people are content to have some fkill in design without troubling themselves about colouring se- condly it gives à taste for the knowledge of arts and enables us to make some judgment of them and for this reason designing is lookd upon as à necessary part of young gentlemens education who have commonly their masters for drawing as well as for writing lastiy as this part comprehends many other particular things as the know- ledge of the muscles perspective position of the attitudes and the expression of the passions of the soul it might therefore be considered rather as an intire whole than as separate part it can not indeed be denied that these pre-eminencies in design are real and ex- tremely useful but then we here consider design only as it relates to painting and in this light all its parts require colouring in order to make perfect picture for this reason we here consider design with all the parts it comprehends not as distinct part itself nor yet as an intire whole but only as the foundatian and beginning of painting we have before said that the claro-ob- scuro which is nothing but the knowledge of lights and shades was comprised in co- louring yet there are several painters who will not allow it they alledge that the only reason which is assigned for it is that in nature light and the claro-obscuro aré inseparable and add that the same may be sald of design because without light the eye can not perceive nor know in nature the outlines and proportions of figures to this we may answer that in this case the hands might do the office of the eyes and after feeling solid body might determine whether it were round or square or what its form was whence it follows that without light the outlines and prod portions of figures may be known being upon this subject can not for- bear relating à late story of blind sculptor who made portraits in wax and very like he lived in the last century and the story à was told me by man of probity who was acquainted with him in italy and was wit¬ neis to what am going to relate the blind man this person told me was of cambassi in tuscany he was well made and something more than fifty years of age had great deal of wit and good fense and delighted in talking and telling things agreeably one day meeting him in the palace of justiniani where he had been copying à statue of minerva took occasion to afk him whether he did not see little because he copied so justly cant see at ill says he my eyes are at my fingers ends but then said — how is it possible that bilind as you are you can do such sine things à he replied —ifeel my original texamine the dimensions and the risings and cavities- these endeavour to keep in my memory then feel my wax and comparing one with the ther by moving my hand backwards and forwards several times finish my work in the best manner can in short he did not appear to have any light since the duke of bracciano to prove him obliged him to make his head in very dark cellar and it was found to be very like but though this piece was ad- mired by all who saw it they failed not to object to the sculptor that the duke ’ beard was great help towards likeness and that he could not have hit it so easily had the duke been beardless well then says the blind man give me another whereupon they proposed to him to make the head of one of the duchess ’ maids he accordingly under- took it and made it very like have also seen busto of charles king of england and one of pope urban viii of this mans doing both after the marble finely finish ’ and very like the greatest trouble he found as he confess ’ was in making hair because of its pliablenefs to the fingers but without going farther we have at paris busto by this hand of the late ex- cellent cellent monsieur hesselin master of the trea- sury-chambers who was so well pleased with it and thought the work so wonderful that he desired the author of it to sit for his- picture that he might takeit into france as memorial of him my curiosity induced me to see this picture and after having viewed the face perceived that the painter had set an eye on the tip of each of his fingers to shiew that those he had elsewhere were use- less to him have the more willingly re- lated this story as thought it worthy of the reader ’ curiosity and very proper to de- monstrate the proposition before us to wif that the knowledge of the claro-obscuro is comprehended in colouring it is certain that no one can fail even in great darkness to perceive the contours of man or statue and to judge of the risings and cavities by feeling about whereas it is impossible to see any colour or to make any judgment of it without the help of light we perceive by the story of this blind man that his art which lay all in design afforded him an opportunity to gratify his knowledge and also some consolation for the loss of so precious sense as light and that if he had been painter he would have been deprived of this consolation for co- lour and light are the objects only of sight but but design as have observed is also the object of feeling might also mention more recent ex- ample of blindness in the late sieur buret one of the ablest sculptors of the academy who according to thé testimony of persons of credit lost his sight by the small-pox at twenty-five years of age which however left him the pleasure and consolation of di- verting himself by working like the blind man of cambassi it is in this place we ought to treat of the claro-obscuro as an essential part of co- louring but as the treatise on this subject is of some length we shall set it after the pre- sent discourse on colouring and refer the reader to it the rather that he may have more distinct idea of the knowledge of lights and shades the agreement and opposition of colours are as necessary as union and the cromatick in mufick this agreement and opposition proceeds from two causes- to wit from their apparent and original qualities and from their mixtures their apparent qua- lities proceed from their participation with the air and earth the aereal colours pre- serve lightness which makes them look lovely as white fine ycllow blue lake green and such-like of which may be made an infinity of colours that will always sympathize the earthy on the other hand have have heaviness which by mixture de- stroys the sweetnefs and lightnefs of the aereal tis difficult to aslign the true phyfical reason why colour is aereal or terrestrial yet we may conclude that luminous colours are sweet and airy and perfectly agree when mixed together it is certain how¬ ever that some beautiful sweet and lu- minous colours instead of agreeing destroy each other in the mixture as fine ultra- marine mixed with white or fine yellow or fine vermilion and though these colours set single one by another have great bright- ness yet when mixed they make an earthy colour as ugly as possible whence we may infer that one of the best ways to prove the sympathy or anti- pathy of any two colours set together is to raise third out of their mixture for if this third colour shews by its foulness that the two constituent colours are destroy we may conclude that these two colours haye an antipathy to each other if on the con- trary that mixture makes mellow sweet and agreeable tint which resembles their original quality ’ tis an infallible proof of their harmony the bodies of colours are also another principle by which we may judge of their agreement or repugnancy for some have so much body that they can not bear any other colour without taking away almost entirely its natural qualities as red oker um¬ ber indigo and others proportionably but even if neither art nor reason re- quired harmony of colours yet nature herself shews it to us and obliges even those to mitate it who copy her but servilely for whether we consider the light as direct in open day or reflected in the shades it can- not communicate itself without communi- cating also its colour which is sometimes of one kind sometimes of another we have an experiment of this in the light of the sun which at noon is very different in quality from what it is in the evening or morning and the moon has also particular colour as well as the light of fire or of flam- beau before we quit this article of the har- mony of colours it must be observed that glazing is mighty help to the sweetnefs of colours so necessary for expressing truth few people understand it because this know- edge is generally the effect of long expe- ience accompanied with good judgment dappy is the man who when he views he works of great masters can penetrate into the secrets of their art in this par- ticular the lovers of painting who are not artists must also be informed that glazing made by colours transparent and dia- phanous phanous as having but little body which are thinly scumbled with fitch-pencil over colours that are more staring in order to bring them down and sweeten them into an harmony with those about them having now spoke of the union of colours we must in the next place add word or two of their opposition colours are opposite either through their natural qualities when pure and simple or else in light and shade when they make part of chie claro-obscuro this opposition in quality is called an- tipathy it appears among such colours as predominate and destroy by mixture as ultramarine and vermilion and the con- trariety in the claro-obscuro is nothing but simple opposition of light with shade with- out any destruction for tho nothing feems more opposite than white and black for ex- ample the one representing light and the other the privation of light yet being mixed they maintain kind of friendship which can not be destroyed they make sweet grey that partakes of both colours and what shall appear black by the oppo- sition of pure white will seem white when set next to an intense black the same way of reasoning holds good as to all other colours where more or lesa light alters nothing of their qualities it is certain that this union and oppo sition are evident in some colours but thie difficulty of giving reason for it obliges me to refer the painter to his own experience and to the solid reflections which he may make in the finest pieces of this kind which are very scarce and few for in near three hundred years that painting has been revived we can hardly reckon six good colourists whereas we may count at least thirty good designers the reason is that design has its rules founded on the proportions on ana- tomy and continual experience of the same thing whereas colouring has not any rules that are yet well known and the ex- periments that are made as they differ every day because of the different subjects that are handled have not been able to give any fixed rules on this head for which reason am persuaded that titian gained more help from his long and studious experience joined to the great solidity of his judgment than from any demonstrative rule he had fixed in his mind but can not say the same of rubens who must always yield to titian as to the local colours tho as to the principles of harmony he had discovered such solid ones that he was sure of pro- ducing good effect and good whole if my remark on titian and rubens be just those who desire to be good colourists can not take better method than to study the the works of those two great masters as publick books of instruction it will be proper carefully to examine their works by copying them for some time the better to apprehend them and to make all the re- inarks that appear necessary for establishing principles but it must be granted that all sorts of men are not capable of understand- ing books so as to profit by them for in order to this end the mind must be so turned as to remark nothing but what is remark- able and to penetrate the very causes of the effects which are admired in fine pro- ductions some painters have copied titian ’ works for long time examined them with care and on the whole made all the reflections they could upon them and yet have miss ’ the mark for want of attending to the pro- per objects for this reason their copies tho very much laboured and as they thought extremely exact have fallen very far short of the management in the originals others of more skill and deeper reflection have procured copies of these pictures to pleasure themselves with looking at them and also to profit by them this is very commendable but if they would themselves copy them or at least the finest parts of them they would understand them more thoroughly and profit much better than by bare looking the truth is these originals and and all such others as are finely lighted and coloured are scarce and it is difficult to borrow them for any time yet love is in- genious and finds no difficulty insuperable in short would we gain the good graces of painting the safest way is to labour hard nd make the necessary reflections and then we shall infallibly gain knowledge and faci- lity lf for this purpose we can ’ procure good originals fine copies must serve where we may chuse their best parts only if we think fit we should also often visit the cabinets of particular persons and those of the king and of the duke of orleans ss often as possible the luxemburg gallery is one of rubens ’ finest performances and rubens has more than all other painters made the way to colouring easy and clear the work mention is the helping hand which may save the artist from the shipwreck to which he may have innocently exposed himself- have always valued this work of rubens as one of the finest performances in europe if in several parts we set aside he taste of its design which is not the sub- ect at present before us am sensible that many differ from my opinion of this great man ’ works and that of very considerable number of painters and curious men who have with all their might opposed my opi- ion when ibrought to light if may so say the merit of this great man who be- fore was considered as painter but little above the common level of these people say some yet remain who without distin- guishing the different parts of painting especially colouring of which we are now speaking value nothing but the roman man¬ ner the taste of poussin and the school of te carracchis they object among other things that rubens ’ works appear to have little truth on near examination that the colours and lights are loaded and that in the main they are but daubing and very different from what we commonly observe in nature it is true they are but daubing but it were to be wished that the pictures that are now painted were all daubed in the same manner painting in general is but daub- ing its effence lies in deceiving and the greatest deceiver is the best painter nature in herself is unseemly and he who copies- her servilely and without artifice will al- ways produce something poor and of mean taste what is called load in colours and lights can only proceed from pro- found knowledge in the values of- colours and from an admirable industry which- makes the painted objects appear more true if may say so than the real ones in this sense it may be asferted that in rubens ’ pieces art is above nature and nature only copy copy of that great master ’ works and of what import is it after all if things on examination be not perfectly just if they appear so they answer the end of painting which is not so much to convince the understanding as to deceive the eye this artifice will always appear wonder- ful in great works for when the picture is distanced according to its bignefs it is this artifice which supports the character both of the particular objects and of the whole together but without it the work in pro- portion as we remove from it will appear to remove from truth and look as insipid as an ordinary painting tis in such great works that rubens is observed to have so happily succeeded in this learned and appa- rent load by those especially who are ca- pable of giving attention and of examining it for to others nothing can be greater mystery of all the scholars of this excellent man vandyke was hé who profited most by his master ’ instructions and in speaking of rubens one must-needs pay particular re- gard to this illustrious disciple since if he had not so much genius as his master for grand compositions he surpassed him in certain finesses of the art and ’ tis evident that in general his portraits have delicacy and freedom of penciling beyond any thing else in that way having now faithfully given my thoughts on colouring and its dependencies tis necessary to answer those persons who think that it is impossible to be master of design and colouring at the same time their strongest reason is that in addicting ourselves to colouring we neglect design the charms of the one making us forget the necessity of the other to this it is easy to answer that if it be fo we must not impute it to colouring but to the mind as being too narrow to attend to two things at once but it is not such narrow capacities that painting takes up with her only favourites are such minds as can embrace many objects or are so well turned and conduct themselves in such manner that they never apply but to such things as by degrees must increase their knowledge- their new studies do not make them forget the old on the contrary the former strengthen the latter they use all their éfforts to poffess every study as the necessary means to arrive at their end this was raphael ’ character the order and perspi- cuity with which he conceived things never let him forget any thing he daily improved in knowledge and strengthened his new discoveries by such as he had formerly made after the knowledge of colours we are led to treat of their use management and and operation three points in the use of which the painter ’ greatest satisfaction consists seneca speaking of the agreeableness of painting says that it ytelds more plea- sure in the execution than when tis finished am intirely of the same sentiment be- cause in the course of the work we handle the principles and secrets of the art to our own liking we command them as it were and every one makes them obey according to his capacity and genius whereas when the work is finished it commands the painter and obliges him to be satisfied with it be the performance what it will here follow some maxims concerning the use of colours pliny says that the antients painted with four colours only and out of them made all their tints but it is probable they were anly for grounds to prepare them for receiving such other colours as gave the work its freshinefs vigour and spirit we must learn to view nature so ad- vantage in order to reprefent her well there are two manners of colouring her one depending on the habit which young beginners form to themselves and the other comprehending the true knowledge of co- lours and their values when they come toge- ther and the proper temperament of their mixtures for imitating the various colours in nature the memory of man is often limited to few ideas which he is therefore obliged to repeat the way for the artist to avoid tiresome repetition is to have recourse to that inexhaustible fountain nature itself nay it is proper to anticipate his occasions in this respect by painting after extraordi¬ nary natural objects his various studies in all the branches of the art and painting them on oiled paper that they may be of use to him when he wants them the harmony of nature in her colours arises from objects participating of one an- other by reflexion for there is no light which does not strike some body nor is there any enlightened body which does not reflect its light and colour at the same time in proportion to the force of the light and according to the variety of the colour this participation of reflexion in light and co- lour constitutes that union of nature and that harmony which the painter ought to imitate hence it follows that white and black are seldom good in reflexions variety of tints very near of the same tone employd in the same figure and often upon the same part with moderation contri- bute much to harmony the turti of the parts and the outlines which insensibly melt into their grounds and and artfully disappear bind the objects and keep them in union especially as they seem to conduct the eye beyond what it sees and persuade it that it sees what it really does not see mean continuity which their extremities conceal any loading or overcharge in colouring whether to cover ground or give distance to work or make good the injuries of time ought to be so discretely managed as not to destroy the character of an object we must avoid as much as possible the repetition of the same colour in picture but ’ tis commendable to approach it by the principles of union and elegance fine instance of this we see in the marriage of cana by paul veronese where several whites and yellows meet harmonioussy the eye grows tired with viewing the same objects it loves well imagined va- riety repetition is surfeiting in all things in painting as in any thing else things become valuable only by comparison practice and experience make us learned in this point colours which either by mixture lose strength or become harmonious with others are called broken colours their forts are infinite and paul veronese for his happy success in this may be good copy in order to succeed in it he affected to make choice of light colours which he made more apparent by still lighter grounds his taste was chiefly for wrought stuffs of sweet colour these he purchased at great expence to paint after is wonderful that before and even in raphael ’ time painters were so jealous of their outlines that they took no care to melt them into their grounds it is really pro¬ bable that they were not acquainted with the passages of antient authors in praise of melting one object into another for they only observed regularity and preciseness in their outlines so true it is that there are times and countries where people blindly follow the prevailing practice and where the skilful draw in their pupils to their own habits and are looked upon by them as infallible hence it appears that it is great happiness for those who design to be painters to fall into the hands of able masters but what com- monly happens is this arten the student has made sufficient progress in design and resolved to follow painting he puts himself under master whose sentiments he follows and whose works he copies by this means his eyes and understanding are so accustomed to these works that for all the rest of his life he sees nature coloured in his master ’ manner and yet which is very extraordinary suppose both master and pupil to see nature very ill mean of contrary colour to what she really eally has and shew them any pictures of titian or other good colourists they will nevertheless admire those pictures but still retain the tints-and colouring they have been always used to so prevalent is habit and so hard to quit what can we conclude from hence but either that habit has debauched the painters eye or he has been negligent in correcting it thorough change is certainly very rare for habit having made an alteration in the organs ’ tis hard to quit à manner we have been always used to and find easy in practice for one which will cost much trouble let the pupil examine himself on this point and without losing courage and after having discovered the right way let him use all endeavours to follow it after what have said on the practice of painting imust own that have passed many things over in silence which relate to this subject but as what have here com- municated only learned by examining with great attention the works of the great painters especially those of titian and rubens and as the student himself must draw from the -same source therefore refer him thither to rubens in the first place be- cause his principles are more apparent and easy to the apprehension and then to titian who leems to have polisned his pictures pictures mean to have made truth and exactnefs more apparent in his local colours at reasonable distance but yielding to rubens for grand compositions and the art of shewing at greater distance the har- mony of his whole together of of the claro-obscuro the knowledge of lights and shades which painting requires is one of the most important and most essential branches of the art we only see by means of light and light draws and attracts the eye with more or less strength as it strikes the ob- jects of nature for this reasor the painter who is the imitator of these objects ought to know and chuse the advantageous effects of light that he may not lose the pains he may have taken in other things to be an able artist this part of painting includes two things the incidence of particular lights and shades and the knowledge of general lights and shades which we ufually call the claro- obscuro and tho according to the force of the words these two things seem to be the same yet they are very different because of the ideas we are used to entertain of them the incidence of light consists in know¬ ing the shadow which bedy placed on certain certain plane and exposed to given light ought to make upon that plane know¬ ledge easily attained from the books of perspective by the incidence of lights we therefore understand the lights and shades proper to particular objects and by the word claro-obscuro is meant the art of advantageoussy distributing the lights and shades which ought to appear in picture as well for the repose and satisfaction of the- eye as for the effect of the whole together the incidence of light is demonstrated by the lines which are supposed to be drawn from the source of that light to the body enlightened and this the painter must strictly observe whereas the claro-obscuro depends absolutely on the painter ’ imagina- tion who as he invents the objects may dispose them to receive such lights and shades as he proposes in his picture and in- troduce such accidents and colours as are most for his advantage in short as parti- cular lights and shades are comprised in ge- neral ones we much consider the claro- obscuro as one whole and the incidence of particular light as part which the claro- obscuro presupposes but in order to understand thoroughly the meaning of this word we must know that claro implies not only any thing ex- posed to direct light but also all such co- lours as are luminous in their natures and obscuro obscuro not only all the shadows directly caused by the incidence and privation of light but likewise all the colours which are naturally browii such as even when they are exposed to light maintain an obscurity and are capable of grouping with the shades of other objects of this kind for instance are deep velvets brown stuffs black horse polished armour and the like which preserve their natural or apparent obscurity in any light whatever it must be further observed that the claro-obscure which contains and sup- poses the incidence of lights and shades as the whole includes part respects that part in particular manner for the incidence of light and snade tends only to point out precisely the parts enlightened and shaded but the claro-obscuro adds to this precifenefs the art of giving objects more relief truth and apparency as have elsewhere de- monstrated but more plainly to discover the difference between the claro-obscuro and the incidence of light the former is the art of distri- buting advantageoussy the lights and shades both in particular objects and generally throughout the picture but it more par- ticularly implies the great lights and great shades which are collected with an industry that conceals the artifice and in this sense the painter uses it for setting objects objects in fine light and reposing the sight from distance to distance by an artful distribution of objects colours and accidents and these are the three ways which lead tothe claro-obscuro as we shall further illustrate the distribution of objects the distribution of objects forms the masses of the claro-obscuro when by an industrious management we so dispose thém that all their lights be together on one side and their darkness on the other and that this collection of lights and shades hinder the eye from wandering titian called it the bunch of grapes because the grape being separated would have each its light and shade equally and thus dividing the sight into many rays would cause confufion but when collected into one bunch and becoming thus but one mass of light and one of shade the eye embraces them as single object this in¬ stance must not be understood literally either as to the order or the form of bunch of grapes but only as an obvious comparison to shew conjunction of lights and also of shades the bodies of colours the distribution of colours contributes to the masses of lights and to those of shades shades whilst direct light is of no other assistance in this respect than as it makes the objects visible this depends on the painter ’ management who is at liberty to introduce figure cloathed in brown which shall remain dark notwithstanding any light it may be struck with and the effect will be the greater as the artifice will not appear the same management and effect may be under- stood of all other colours according to the degree of their tones and the painter ’ oc- casion for them accidents the distribution of accidents may be of service in the effect of the claro-obscuro whether in light or in-shade some lights and shades are accidental accidental light is what is but accessory to picture or proceeds from some accident as the light of window or flambeau or other luminous cause which is nevertheless inferior to the original light accidental shades are for example those of the clouds in landskip or of some other body- supposed to be out of the picture and giving advantageous shades but in the case of these slying- shadows we must take care that the sup- posed cause of them be probable these seem to me to be the-three ways- of practising the claro-obseuro but all li have have said will be to little purpose unless make the student sensible of the necessity of the claro-obscuro both in the theory and practice of painting but of the many reasons for this neces- sity shall chuse to mention four which seem to me to be the most important the first is taken from the necessity of making choice in painting the second proceeds from the nature of mhe claro-obscuro the third from the advantage which the claro-obscuro yields to the other parts of painting and the fourth is dravn from the general constitution of all beings the first proof taken from the necessity ef- making à choice in painting the painter seldom finds satisfaction in casual nature as being generally short of what he aims at he must by the help of art make as good choice of her as possi- ble in all her visible effects in order to bring her to some perfection now light and shade are the visible effects of nature as well as the outlines of an human body the attitudes the folds of draperies or any thing else that comes into composition all these require choice and therefore light does the same now the choice of light is nothing nothing but the artifice of the claro-obscuro wherefore the artifice of the claro-obscuro is absolutely necessary in painting the second proof taken from the nature of the claro-obscuro the senses in general have an aversion for every thing that disturbs their attention the eye is not satisfied with bare seeing it must also embrace its object with satisfaction and the painter must remove every thing that would make it uneasy now the eye will certainly be displeased when directing itself to its object ’ tis obstructed by others near it whose lights and shades are as apparent as that object itself and ’ tis as certain that the knowledge of the claro obscuro alone can give to the fight- peaceable enjoyment of this object for as we have said before it is the claro-obscuro which prevents multiplicity of angles and hinders the eye from wander- ing by means of the groups of lights and shades of which it gives the knowledge- wherefore the claro-obscuro is of the greazest consequence in painting the third proof drawn from the adcantage aehich the claro obscuro yields to the other parts of painting figures ought to be well set and distunced their draperies well cast and the passions passions of the soul finely expressed in word each object should be characterized by just and elegant design and by true and natural local colour but it is as necessary to support all these parts and give them good light in order to make them the more capable of attracting the eye and of agree- ably deceiving it by means of the force and repose which the knowledge of general lights gives to picture this shews what ad- vantage the parts of painting receive from the claro-obscuro and consequently establisnes the necessity of it the fourth proof drawn from the general constitution of all things it is certain that all beings tend to unity either by relation or composition or har- mony and this as well in things human as divine in religion as politicks in art as na- ture in the facultie of the soul as the or- gans of the body god is one by the ex- cellence of his nature the world is one- morality brings every thing within the com- pass of religion which is one as politicks makes every thing subservient to the govern- ment of state all nature preserves in all her productions an unity resulting from the many members in animals and parts in plants and art assigns various precepts for making one only work the several con- ditions ditions of men fit them for commerce and society as the several wheels of machine act for principal motion the faculties of the soul are at one time taken up.with one thing only in order to act well and the organs of the body can not satisfactorily en- joy more than one object at time for if you set many before them at once they will not fix upon any and this multiplicity will divide them and intirely take away the liberty of their functions if in publick assembly two or three persons speak at once in the same tone and with the same force the ear instead of receiving what is said will be stunned with confused noise in the same manner if we present to the sight many objects distinct and equally apparent tis certain that the eye not being able to collect all those objects at once will through their division have some pain in coming to determination thus as in picture there ought to be an unity of subject for the eyes of the understanding so there ought to be an unity of object for those of the body this unity is only to be procured by the know- ledge of the claro-obscuro and without it we can not view an object with any ease or satisfaction when ispeak of the unity of object in picture must be understood to mean such distance as tlie eye can reasonably take in without heing distracted by many distinct ob- jects as usually falls out in small number of figures pictures may be large and full enough of work to contain three groups of claro-obscuro and then thelights and shades of each group being sufficiently spread draw and fix the eye for some time giving it leave however to pafs from one group to another and yet these groups of objects and of the claro-obscuro in the same picture tend so much to unity that one of them ought to predominate for this reason the painter is obliged to bring into this group the prin- cipal figures of his subject as much as pos- sible this subordination of groups creates further unity which we call the aehole together but care must be taken that these groups neither range too much nor look starch nor confused nor be alike in shape for ’ tis indifferent to the eye whether the masses of the claro-obscuro be of convex or concave or any other figure we must only observe that tho in great works the masses of light and shade necessa- rily assist each other yet the masses of shade must not so forcibly contribute to the repose of the eye as to leave it in state of inaction with regard to the light masfes the painter should in this point imitate the orator who when he would fix the attention of his audience upon certain particular passage which he would illustrate and enforce be- gins with something of less consequence and and after having fixed the object in the mind of his hearers he refreshes them with speak- ing of something more temperate but with- out ever suffering their attention to flag in the same manner the painter makes luis lights to shine and supports them by masses of brown which repose the eye withoirt hindering its being entertained by objects less apparent we may even sometimes introduce single objects but it must be done with prudence and they must be brown in the light inasses and light in the brown either sor breaking through too great silence in picture or for loosening some figures or for taking away affectation from the work in word the whole should so appear as if every thing fell out by chance but must own that every painter has not the gift of thus conccaling the artifice of the claro-obscuro and executing it with in¬ dustry.. it requires as much reflection and delicacy as it starts new difficulties in every new subject the geniuses proper for it are such as pierce through every thing and know how to acquit themselves happily of what they undertake we might here add as afurther proof ofthe force and necessity of the claro-obscuro the praises which painters themselves always be- stow on the works where that artifice appcars and also on the authors of them in effect whoever will reflect on the advantages which all the parts of painting receive from the claro-obscuro must own that any picture be it ever so correct and ever so faithful in design and local colour- ing is without that artifice dull and taste- leis whereas another painting where the de- sign and the local colours are but tolerable if supported by the said artifice will not suffer the spectator to pass unconcernedly by it will even call to him and detain him for some time whether he have taste for painting or not what then would be the effect if the claro-obscuro was supported by fine performance in other parts and the work was viewed by good judge or skil- ful lover of painting thought it would not be improper to give here the principal explications of the effect of the claro-obscuro to let the reader at once into what has been said upon this subject fig plate ii proves the unity of an object as it has been treated in the discourse of disposition we see there also de- monstration of objects entering the picture in perspective both diminisn equally in foree as they recede from the centre of vi- sion their only difference is that the latter decrease in magnitude according to the rules of perspective as they go off from the said centre and the former which only extend to to the right and left of that centre grow fainter by distance without losing their forms or bigness fig ii of plate il sliews how to handle at particular object in order to give it relief which is to use in the fore-part the most- lively light and strongest shades always pre- serving the reflécted lights near the turning on the side of the shade fig iii of plate ii proves the necessity of-grouping for the satisfaction of the eye this was titian ’ great rule and ought still to be the rule of those who would observe in their paintings that unity of object which with skilful colouring constitutes all the har- nony of the art fig iv of plate ii shews the necessity of preserving unity of object in making groups according to the bignefs of the picture and the number of its figures for as we have said we must to please the eye six it by predominant group which by means of the reposes caused by à spread of rights and shades does not hinder the effect of other groups or subordinate objects for of the objects are dispersed the eye is at oss which to fix upon and is in the same ease with the ear when many persons are speaking at the same time much more might be said on the subject of lights and shades which indeed is of- reat extent but content myself with giving giving according to my notion an idea of the claro-obscuro and shewing the several methods of practising it together with its absolute necessity in painting those who would know more of it may consult my commentary on du fresnoys poem begin- ning at the verse and continued for seven or eight leaves following sculptors as well as painters when they have occasion may practise the claro- obscuro by the disposition of their figures or by the place where their work is to stand the cavalier bernini has left posterity some illustrious instances of this in some churches of rome where he has disposed the sculpture to the lights of the windows or else has pierced the windows for an advantageous opening when he had leave in order to let in such light as might produce an extra- ordinary cifect and awaken the spectator ’ attention but the skilful sculptor may go yet further by adding to the claro-obscuro the local colours if he understands them of this we have two wonderful examples at mons le hays in the grenelleestreet in the suburbs of st. germains they are in two cases one is the defcent from the crofs and the omet the adoration of the shepberds these two subjects are so profoundly and beautifully handled that believe the pub- lick will be pleased with their description and-tho have drawn it with all possible exactness exactness yet question not but the curious will find it far short of the sublime which the abbot zumbe the author of those works has attained in all the parts of his art it would here be proper to say something of the life of that illustrious man but have thought it would be more so to reserve it for second edition which is going to be published of my lives of the painters- wherefore ifhall here only give the descri- ption of these sculptures which have subjoined to the end of this work that the order of my present discourses might not be interrupted which ought to be observed in the study of painting most of the fkilful painters have taken great pains and spent many years in the search of knowledges which they might have attained in little time had they hit at first upon the right path this truth of which all ages have been convinced by experience principally concerns youth and it is youth especially who while they are greedily pursuing knowledge have need of light to conduct them orderly to the point they aim at painting may be considered as fine parterre genius as the ground or soil principles as the seeds and good understanding as the gardener who prepares the earth for receiving the seeds in their seasons and raises all forts of flowers both for profit and delight tis tis certain that the genius which gives birth to the fine arts can not lead them to perfection without culture that cultuze is impracticable without the direction of the judgment and that judgment is of no use unlefs grounded on true principles we must herefore suppose genius in all our under- takings which would otherwise be lame and imperfect it must be owned that all ages are not equally rich in producing real geniuses and that art grows weak for want of skilful men but this ought not to dis¬ courage such as endeavour to be as good as they can the earth yields according to its strength and the seed sown genius in the same manner by cultivating will always produce something more or less in pro- portion to its elevation and extent thus genius has its degrees and nature has fixed one for some things and others for others as may be observable not only in the several professions but even in the several parts of the same art or science in painting for nstance one may have genius for por- traiture or landskip for beasts or flowers but as all these parts meet in genius proper for history it is certain that such genius ought to preside over all the kinds of paint- ing and the rather because if it should succeed better than others this is the com- mon effect of its being more employd in this part of painting and because feeling talent talent for history it has embraced this- part with pleasure and had more frequent oc- this be said without derogating from those geniuses which after being inlarged enough to succeed in history have applied them- selves either occasionally or through taste to one part of painting rather than another for painting ought to be considered as long pilgrimage where in the course of the journey we discover several things capable of diverting the mind agreeably for while we consider the several parts of the art and stop in the way to it as traveller bates at an inn but if we make our abode at that inn because we find beauties there agreeable to our taste or suiting our interest and therefore are satisfied to view at distance or rather to hear talk of our journey ’ end we must never expect to finisn our pilgrimage and come up to the perfection of painting this is certainly the case of those who intend to be painters and yet passing thro ’ thé parts of the art are stopped by the charms of- some of them without considering that perfect painting arises only from the perfection and union of them all what is therefore of the greatest importance is the cultivation of that genius which ought to preside over all the parts of painting history demands its whole appli- cation and attachment and forbids it to en¬ gage in any disputes that may delay its pro- gress gress or in any affair that may divert or en- cumber it but pupil ’ disposition for instruction may possibly cause an aversion in master through fear of losing in small time the fruits of his long experience for by imparting his lights he may be either equalled or surpassed by his pupil to this answer that to bury one ’ knowledge in this manner is neither natural christian- like nor politick tis not natural because nature ’ property is to beget her like nor christian-like since ’ tis the part of charity to instruct the ignorant mean such as have talents to learn and ’ tis impolitick because the master ’ reputation spreads and is pre- served by that of his disciples who transmit to posterity the glory of their instructors if among the fkilful painters some of the youngest plead interest against commu- nicating their lights and secrets and it be thought sufficient reason yet we can not ex- cuse the more advanced in age nor those whose reputation is fixed because far from running any risque their good intentions will be à fatisfaction to themselves and procure them the praise of others for what do fuch masters they only find methods for removing difficulties shortening time and putting their disciples in way to perfect their taste and genius am aware that able painters mean in general may have taken different methods of study and therefore must lead their dis- ciples by different roads though all tending to the same point know also that there are some who after having studied without order and spent many years in the search of good method have not found it till very late and who after being better in- structed and having disabused themselves would be very capable of pointing out to youth the best methods of study but my surprize at the many years usually afsigned for this study obliged me here to give my thoughts upon the subject and upon the order could wish were observed in it shall not determine at what age one ought to begin study because in all pro- fesfions genius and application are half the work yet such as propose to be painters can not set about designing too soon for as their genius comes to shew itself by practice they may be suffered to go on if they have any or if they have none may be employd about things for which they may seem to be better turned but if their inclination for painting continues care must be taken during their first exercises in design to put them in method of reading and writing to advantage in order to prevent the general indifference people have for reading for want of its being familiar to them in their youth youth and as painters stand in great need of the helps arising from thence the first looks put into the student ’ hands should be such as are agreeable and fitting his age to give him taste for reading and afterwards i proportion as the mind forms itself no- thing will better teach him to think well than good books but at what age soever one begins painting every student advances more or less in proportion to his genius some are drawn by their genius and follow it others are dragged by force there are but sew of these last these make great progrefs in little time and no age is set for them but as we are laying down plan for study think the student should begin very young according to the usual custom of pupils pliny tells us that when alexander be great asfigned to painting the first rank mong the liberal arts he at the same time ordered that young people of condition should before all things learn to design alexander in so doing could have no other view than forming the taste of his principal subjects by that disposition to painting which design gives the mind in effect the first fruit of design is the exactness creates in the eye of the designer and its first use is to make general di¬ stinction in the characters of objects and then then to imprint on the mind the principles of what is good in the fine arts and at last the taste being formed by progrefs in these principles the designer thus becomes more capable of judging of the works both- of art and nature alexander who did not propose to make all those persons of condition painters commanded them however to begin de- signing betimes that they might thus be qualified all their life-time to judge of any object that offered paointers and sculptors have the greater reason to observe this law in their early youth as it not only enables them to give their opinions on the works of others but also to compose works of their own of which others are to judge the first thing which ought to be con- sidered in the pursuit of an art which we propose to follow all our life is to make proper distribution of our time and to allow each study as much of it as it requires in our younger years for instance when rea- son is weak and reflections unseasonable we ought to make advantage of the softness of the brain and purity of the organs which are then capable of any impression or habit we would have them take ie this be so there are but two exercifes proper for the student in his early years the one is to accustom his eye to exactuefs in faith- faithfully setting down on paper the di mensions of the objects he copie and the other to use his hand to the crayon and pen till he has got necessary facility in designing for exactness of eye and facility of hand are the two inlets to design tis therefore of the last consequence to young people in order to begin painting well and to make speedy progress in it not to discontinue these two exercises till they are perfect in them/ now if this point be of great importance to the student 't is more so to an academy for if they will but attend to ehri own sup port and advancement theyb must look upon it as necessary to admit no scholar who has not before sufficiently practised drawing after designs and pasters that is who has not acquired an exactness of eye and facility of hand in using the crayon and that in the judgment of the officers in exercise my reason is that when scholars are received too young and ignorant in to the academy-school they waste great deal of time there without maing any remarkable progress in their pretended studies and yet after some years relying more upon the time they have spent than the progress they have madethey rashly set up as competitors for the prize of which they are wholly unworthy afterwards it happens in consequence of this this that those who pretend to the prizes of painting being chips of the same block of ignorance yield the same fruit either bad or insipid the young student ought in the next place to learn geometry because as he is now advanced so far as to reflect and reason upon all the parts of painting with which it is necessary to be thoroughly acquainted and as geornetry teaches to reason and to infer one thing from another it will stand him in stead of logick and clear him out of all his doubts and perplexities then as perspective presupposes geome- try as the foundation of it it is natural to place it next and to apply to it with the greater attention as nothing can be done in painting without it by this time the student may be supposed to have got an habit of copying with ease all sorts of designs and of designing all sorts of pictures and yet this habit must not be con- sidered otherwise than as disposition ne- cessary for attaining design in this view the young student must con- sider the imitation of fine nature as his chief aim and be acquainted with the exterior characters of all the forms she produces and beginning with her master-piece man he must understand anatomy and human proportion because these two parts are the basis of design anatomy establisnes the solidity solidity of the body and the proportions form its beauty the proportions derive from anatomy the truth of their outlines and anatomy owes to the proportions tge exact regularity of nature in her first intentions/ in fine both these parts mutually assist to make design solid and perfectly correct tho those two parts seem to be linked together yet it is best to begin with anatomy as being the offspring of nature whereas proprtion is the product of arts and if pro portion arise from good choice goo choice owes its origin to nature in the study of the proportions the general ones must in the first place be well understood mean such as generally suit each part so as to make finished whole thus we must know how an head foot or hand ought to be made and in short the whole body in order to form perfect man but nature being various in her productions we must observe what she produces that is finest in the different characters of men arising from the diversity of their ages countries and professions nature indeed affords such variety as is infinit but as her riches have their allay 't is best at first to hase recourse to the antique for an exquisite choice in all the ages and conditions of life the antique figures not only contain every thing that is most most beautiful in the proportions but are in thémselves the very sources of grace ele- gance and expression and the study of them is the more necessary as ’ tis the path that leads to beautiful truth and this we must pursue without regard to the time it may take for since the antique is the rule of beauty we must persist in designing after it till we have formed just and strong idea of it that may help us to view nature in the best manner and to bring her back to-her first intentions from which she often departs as the finest pattern we have for this conduct are the works of rapbael ’ tis pro- per to copy them at the same time that they may serve to guide us in the happy mixture he has made of the antique with nature here by-the-bye we must observe that in the antique there is general taste diffused over all the works of those times and particular one characterizing each figure according to its agé and quality and this must be the subject of the student ’ care- ful reflections according to the compass of his improvement and penetration having spent the necessary time in the aforesaid studies we must now consider them as steps by whièh the understanding rises to the knowledge of the natural object both such as it is and such as it ought to be by these first studies we discern the defects of of our copy and how far ’ tis short of per- féction and our ideas inform as what must be added to or taken from the life to make as perfect as we think- it ought to be tis here therefore we ought to place the study of the model which with con- rast and ponderation completes the study- of ithe attitudes as in setting model ’ tis necessary to find in attitude that has natural contrast and shews its finest parts it is also necessary to five it relief and roundness but as the relief and roundnefs of one particular object is not sufficient in company of figures and as to please the eye and for the effect of the of lights and shades which is called the claro-obscuro it follows that this study- particular attention and ought to be-the more thoroughly mastered as the claro- obscuro is one of the principal grounds of painting as its effect calls to the spectator is it supports the composition of picture and as without it any pains bestowed on particular objects would be lost labour after this part of painting is well un- understood it is proper in order to root it deep in the mind to view attentively the rpints of those masters who best understood ilghts and shades and to go to the bottom of this knowledge in order to confirm the student- in that of the claro-obscuro he must also have general acquaintance with the prints and designs of the great masters to shew him how they managed both in composition and simple figures goop prints as well as good drawings are also proper to warm the genius and ex- cite it to produce the like we are made sensible of the character of each object by its different drawing and handling and having copied after good- masters we perceive that those fine touches and handlings are the soul of design these we must imprint in our mind in order to gain more disposition and facility to observe in nature the man- ner of expressing the character of objects the student must use all his endeavours to feed his eye with the sight of these fine things but to rivet them in his memory and understanding it will be convenient to copy and make extracts of their finest parts such as he most wants or his genius chiefly leads him to. tis in such cases that intelligent and sincere friends who often know our weaknesses and the bent of our-genius bet- ter than ourselves may asfist us with their counsels and knowledge if consulted thus far painting and sculpture have gone hand in hand ’ for suppose the sculptor to be used to designing on paper as desire the painter for his own profit to learn earn to model each of them must now take path of his own in order to arrive happily at his end which is the imitation of nature the sculptor must give relief to his matter and the painter use his colours on flat superficies but my present design is chiefly to direct the painter in order to bring him to the end of his career the method have thus far pointed out only relates to the study of design what have yet to say relates chiefly to colouring several painters think that the study of design implies that of colouring because say they several good designers having too ong enjoyed the pleafures and charms of design have so filled their mind with it that they left no room for colouring or having made too great progress in design they soon grew tired of colouring which was uneasy to them for which reason they returned to the pleasure they found in their abit of designing for ’ tis pleasure to do what we can easily do these reflections are certainly not groundless but to comply in some mea- sure with the weakness of men who do almost every thing by habit think that the student should in the course of design¬ ng sometimes handle the pencil and colours to make this part through early custom pleasure to him but if we go to the bot- tom of these inconveniences they will not appear appear to proceed from not colouring early but from beginning ill imean either copy-' ing at first after bad things or being tutored by master who had not the principles of colouring we naturally quit bad manner of de- signing as may be observed in those who design for they become more correct by practice and by change of object and model but it is very rare to exchange bad manner in colouring for à better say that it is not impossible but very rare raphael michael angelo leonardo da vinci juliò romano and other great-masters of those times followed the schools and the practice of the places where they were educated and spent their whole lives withoût truly understanding good colouring even in our own times voet ’ disciples tho numerous and men of good sense have not been able whatever they could do to shalce off their master ’ bad manner we have further instances of youngpainters who by beginning to copy pictures of trivial colouring have retained that manner in every thing they co- loured making it as glafs through which they saw nature coloured like their paintings from hence we may infer that young man who begins with copying an ill-coloured picture swallows ’ poison with which he himself will taint all his future perform- but solid judgment and goodeducation can surmount difficulties and correct bad taste where the understanding is docile there is no reason ’ therefore why we may not place here the study of colouring leaving every student at liberty to refresh himself sometimes by interrupting the order of study iam going to lay down the student ’ first care must be to begin with copying what he finds best coloured most finished and most freely penciled in the works of the great masters among whom titian rubens and vandyke are of the aarst rank vandyke chiefly with regard to be- ginners because his good colouring is joined with freedom of penciling as colouring is not farther valuable than it perfectly imitates nature the student after having obtained some habit from the best pictures must also copy after nature herself examine and compare it with the works of the great masters this practice will accustom his taste to an idea of truthi and his eye t see truth without any cloud or obstruction after having thus acquired good habit and put his taste in condition to fear nothing he may copy pictures of all manners if he finds any thing in them to entertain the activity of his genius but like the bees which gather their honey from several good flowers he should chiefly copy excellent excellent pieces such as are best for forming good manner he should do the same in the fine productions of nature whether figures beasts or landfkip of which he may make collection as well for common use in the way of his business as to keep up his taste or to feed his curiosity being come to this pitch and so fur- nished the young painter may fly with his obn wings and by reading or reflecting raise his thoughts and exercise his imagin- ation in composing variety of subjects adorning them with such choice of beauties as nature affords in abundance but let him remember above all things never to set about picture till he has first made slight sketch of it in colours where he may give loose to his genius and re- gulate the motions of it afterwards in the objects and in the effect of the whole toge- ther this sketch must be made as quickly as possible after he has fixed his thought that the fire of his imagination may not have time to evaporate and being only loose sketch as we suppose it he may afterwards alter add or diminish either in composition or colouring as he thinks fit anp now having brought things to his mind he must before he begins to dead- colour the great picture consult every thing he has by him that is most beautiful either in nature or the antique and proper for his subject subject and draw exactly after each of them in their proper places to save hmself the trouble and vexation of alterations and do- ing one thing twice in this point ranhael went further his method was to paste as many papers together as made the size of is picture and after having correctly de- signed and put all things an their places he transferred this cartoon to the ground he intended to paint on yet if after all those precautions it should still be necessary for the effect of the picture to make some alterations it will be prudent not to neglect them the trouble will not be great and there will besides be no room to reproach ourselves with any neglect the artist being now supposed to have brought his work to good forwardness he must consider what place it is to be hung in and at what distance from the eye and to regulate the force of his colouring and touches accordingly of all geniuses ibelieve there is not any which takes greater liberties than that for painting nor any which suffers the bridle more impatiently nay question not but several painters besides some extraordinary geniuses have without any order of study attained to considerable reputation though indeed not without losing much time for want of some method but as in ma¬ chine chine the bad disposition of the wheels retards the motion so the parts of painting disorderly studied confuse the understand- ing and memory and make things difficult either to be understood or remembred wherefore the best way is to put our studies into some order not inconsistent with dissertation whether poesy be preferable to painting tis not my design to majntain that painting excels poesy never doubted out these two arts go hand in hand and equally deserve the same honours have spoken of them accordingly when occasion offered and in this have only followed the sentiments of the most celebrated authors but as people do not always agree even in find there points that are most received are some persons of great distinction who have expressed their displeasure at my classing poetry with painting however much dis- posed may be to agree with them will examine this with all the application can for if imust at length come into their senti- nents they will not disapprove of my de- serring to do it till have disabused my- elf
