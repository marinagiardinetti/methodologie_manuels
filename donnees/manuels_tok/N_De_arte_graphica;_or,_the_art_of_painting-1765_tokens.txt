this construction but if mr. dryden had but caft his eyes on the latin text would be have suffered this to have passd the sense being if the inelt means any thing so great power and honour is in the divine arts which also is natural conclusion or inference from what had been said before and commendation of the arts that enbances their value for the respect person receives may be only proof of the

father who was an eminent apothecary in that city intending him for the profeffion of phyfic gave him as good an education as poffible during the firft year which he spent at the college he made very consider- able progress in his fudies but as foon as he was raifed to the higher claffes and began to contract tate of poetry his genius for it open ’ itfelf and he carried all the prizes in it which were propoted to excite the mulation of his fellow-ffudents his inclination for it was heightened by exercife and his earlieft perfor- mances thew ’ that he was capable of becoming one of the greateft poets of his age if his love of painting which equally poffels ’ him had not divided his tune and application at laft he laid afide all thoughts of the rudy of phyfic and declared abfolutely for that of painting notwithflanding the opposition of his parents who the reverend and learned dr. thomas birch having favoured the tranf lator with this life of the author mr. du frefnoy he takes this opportunity of making his acknowlegements not only for this but many other acts of kindness and humanity which during the courfe of many years acquain tonce he has received from him and fands indebted to him for the if of mol du fresney who by all kinds of feverity endeavoured to divert him from purfuing his paffion for that art the proteffion of which they unjuftly confidered in very contemptible light but the ftrength of his inclination defeating all the meafures taken to fuppress it he took the firft op- portunity of cultivating his favourite ftudy he was nneteen or twenty years of age when he be- gan to learn to defign under francis perier and having ipent two years in the fchool of that painter and of simon vouet he thought proper to take journey into italy where he arrived in the end of or the be- ginning of he had during his fludies applied himfelf very much to that of geometry he began upon his coming to rome to paint landlkips buildings and antient ruins but for the firft two years of his refidence in that city he had the utmoft difficulty to support himself being abandoned by his parents who refented his hav- ing rejected their advice in the choice of his profeftion and the little flock of money which he had provided before he left france proving fcarce fufficient for the expences of his journey to ltaly being deftitute there- fore of friends and acquaintance at rome he was re- due ’ to fuch diftress that his chief fubfiftence for the greateft part of that time was bread and small quantity of cheefe but he diverted the fenfe of his unealy cir- cumftances by an intenfe and indefatigable application to painting till the arrival of the celebrated peter mignard who had been the companion of his fiudies under vocict fet him more at eafe they immediately engaged in the rricteff friendship living together in the fame houle and being commonly known at rome by the name of the inpparables they were imploy ’ by the cardinal of lyous in copying all the beft pieces in the farnefe palace but their principal ftudy was the works of raphael vi the lif of mont du frefney raphael and other great mafters and the antiques and they were conftant in their attendance every evening at the academy in defigning after models mignard had the superior talents in practice but du frefnoy was greater mafter of the rules hiffory and theory of his profeffion they communicated to each other their remarks and fentiments du frefnoy furnishing his friend with noble and excellent ideas and the latter instructing the former to paint with greater expedition and eafe poetry shard with painting the time and thoughts of du frefnoy who as he penetrated into the secrets of the latter art wrote down his observations and having at laft acquired full knowledge of the subject form ’ defign of writing poem upon it which he did not finith till many years after when he had confulted the beft writers and examined with the utmoft care the moft admird pictures in italy while he refided there he painted feveral pictures particularly the rums of the campo vaccino with the city of rome in the figure of woman young wo- man of athens going to fee the monument of lover seneas carrying his father to his tomb mars finding la vinia fleeping on the banks of the tyber defcending from his chariot and lifting up the veil which cover ’ her which is one of his beft pieces the birth of venus and that of cupid he had peculiar efteem for the works of titian feveral of which he copied imi- tating that excellent painter in his colouring as he did carrache in his defigns about the year he went

late author of abrege de la vie des plus fameux peintres part edit par in fays that freinoy went to venice without mignard and that the latter being importun ’ by the letters of the former made vifit to him in that ciry the ife of monl du fresney vii his hay in that city painted venus for signor mark paruca noble venetian and madonna an half length thefe pictures thew ’ that he had not ftudied thofe of titian without fuccess here the two friends feparated mignard returning to rome and du frefnoy to france he had read his poem to the beft painters in all places thro which he pass ’ and parti- cularly to albano and guereino then at bologna and he confulted feveral men famous for their skill in polite literature he arrived at paris in where he lodged with monf potel greffier of the council in the street beau- treillis where he painted small room afterwards pic- ture for the altar of the church of st. margaret in the fub- urb st. antoine monl bordier intendant of the finances who was then finithing his houfe of rince now livry having feen this picture was to highly pleas ’ with it that he took du frefnoy to that houfe which is but two leagues from paris to paint the falon in the ceiling was reprefented the burning of troy venus is flanding by paris who makes her remark how the fire confumes that great city in the front is the god of the river which runs by it and other deities this is one of his beft per- formances both for difposition and colouring he af- terwards painted confiderable number of pictures for the cabinets of the curious particularly an altar-piece for the church of lagni reprefenting the affumption of the virgin and the twelve apoftles all as large as life at the hotel erval now armenonville he painted fe veral pictures and among them ceiling of room with four beautifullandskins the figures of which were by vlig nard as he underffood architecture very well he drew for monf de vilargeic all he defigns of houfe which that gentleman built four leagues from avignon as like- wife those for the hotel de lyonne and for that of the grand vin the of monl du fresney grand prior de souvre the high altar of the filles dieu in the street st. denis was alfo defign ’ by him tho he had finish ’ his poem before he had left ltaly and communicated it as has been already mention ’ to the left judges of that country yet after his return to france he continued ftill to revife it with view to treat more at length of some things which did not feem to him fufficiently explain ’ this employment took up no fnall part of his ume and was the reafon of his not having finithed to many pictures as he might otherwife have done and tho he was defirous to fee his work in print he thought it improper topublith it without french tranflation which he deferd undertaking from time to time out of diffidence of his own skill in his native lan- guage which he had in some meature loft by his lone refidence in italy monl de piles was therefore at laft induced at his defire and by the merit of the poem to tranllate it into french his verfion being revifed by du frefnoy himself and the latter had begun commen- tary upon it when he was feiz ’ with palfy and after languithing four or five months under it died at the houfe of one of his brothers at villiers-le-bel four leagues from paris in at the age of fifty-four and was interr ’ in the parith church there he had quitted his lodgings at monl potels upon mignard return to paris in and the two friends lived together from that time till the death of du frefnoy his poem was not publish ’ till three years after his death when it was printed at paris in with the french verfion and remarks of monl de piles and has been juftly admird for its elegance and perfpicuity de as notgmotguyt cucdgnogueg
