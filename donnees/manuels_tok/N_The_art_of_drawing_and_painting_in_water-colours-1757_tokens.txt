the proper materials for de wivc materials required in drawing are black lead-pencils crayons of black white or red chalk crow-quill pens rule and compaffes camel ’ hair-pencils and in- dian ink accuftom yourfelf to hold your pencil further from the point than you do in writing which will give you better command of it and con- tribute to render your strokes more free and bold the ufeof your pencil is to draw the firft sketches or out-lines of your fiece as any stroke or line that is amiss may in this be more eafily rubbed out than in any other thing and when you have made your sketch as correct as you can with the pencil you may then draw carefully the beft out-line you have got with your crow-quill pen and ink the ink made ufe of for this purpofe muft not be the common but indian ink being much fofter than the other and not running and mixing it with water it may be made to any degree of strength and may be ufed in pen like common ink afterufing the ink you may wipe out the pencil-lines by rubhing the piece gently with the crumb of htale bread having thus got your out-line difcharged your next work is to shade your piece properly as you shall be directed below either by drawing fine strokes with your pen where it requires to be shaded or by wathing it with the hair-pencil and the indian ink as to the rule and com- paffes they are never or rarely to be ufed ex cept in meafuringthe proportions of your figures after you have drawn them to prove whether they are right or not or in houfes fortifica tions and other pieces of architecture red lead and red or black chalk are ufed in the same manner as black lead white chalk and tobacco-pipe clay are ufed in heightening or giving firong lights and in drawing on coloured paper paftils or crayons are any colours mixed with tobacco pipe clay which while foft and in the confiffency of pafte is rolled up in pieces about the thickness of ouill and two or three inches in length and then dried they are gene- rally ufed on coloured paper and the colours are rubbed and wrought one into another in fuch manner that no strokes appear but the whole as if it was done with brufh anda in slj ch si ttss ap iii oflicht and shade is the artful management of light and shade that gives the appearance of subftance roundness and diftance to whatever bodies are reprefented by drawing draw circle on piece of paper fill it up with any even colour and it will appear to be body with round cir- cumference and flat sides but by colouring it hronger in the middle and caufing it gradually to weaken towards the circumference it will receive convex appearance like that of bail or globe- wherever the vivacity of colour that part of the object catches the sight firft and appears neareft to it whereas its weaknets and goings off are more and more bro ken and faint and seem to fly farther off from the sight in rounding the parts of any object the extremities in turning muft lofe themfelves inten- fibly and confufedly without precipitating the light all of fudden into the shadows or the shadows into the light but the pallage of the one into the other muft be common and impercep tible that is by degrees of light into shadow and shadow into light objects that are painted light muft have fufficient breadth of shadow to fultain them and dark bodies muft have fudden light behind to detach them from the ground or from thofe objects that are placed behind them otherwife they will appear confufedly as sticking upon each other whereas the opposition of shade to light object and of light to dark one gives projection and feparates them from other bodies there should be ballance preferved between the lights and shadows broad light ought not to be introduced into draught without large shadow the nearer any object is to the eye it is feen to much the ftronger and plainer the sight is weakened by diftances and the more remote any object is it is feen in more imper- feet manner therefore thofe objects which are placed foremoft to the view ought to be more finished than thofe that are caft behind and they should have fuch relative dominion over each other that as one object by its heightnings caufes others to retire more backwards to the same object muft be chafed and made to appear farther from the sight than others which are more ffrongly illuminated it is not fufficient that remote objects be only coloured in more faint and languid manner but according to their diftance the parts muft appear more or less confufed the eye not being able to difcover minutely what is far feparated from it pure and unmixed white either draws an object nearer or carries it off to greater diftance if it be accompanied with black the opposition oppofition of light and dark renders the object more fenfible and brings it neater to the advan- ced part but pure white being the lighielf of colours unless it be forced forwards and fup- ported by black will fly off to the remoteft view as for pure black it is the heavieff

of the colours may not interrupt your view but to that the light and your eye may fall equally and obliquely upon the piece to this end you are to confider from whatpoint and in what direction the light falls upon the objects according to which direction let all your lights and shades be placed throughout the work that part of the object muft be lighteft which has the light moft directly oppofite to it if the light falls fideways on your picture you muft make that side which is oppofite to it lighteft and on the contrary that side which is fartheft from it darkeft let the piece be placed at fuch diftance that upon opening your eyes you may view it all atonce and the larger the picture is it should be to much the more placed off at the greater diftance but right before you and little reclined draw all your out-lines at firft very faint with coal which may eafily be rubbed out again with the feathers of ducks wing or the crumb of bread and thefe outlines should be drawn true and agreeable to the pattern before you begin to thadow any part of the object the out-lines next the light should be drawn more faint and when you have drawn one feature it should be direction for you in fome meafure to draw another by obferving with your eye the dif tance from that to the next feature making mark at the place with your coal then draw it and to to the next till you have drawn the whole figure then observe the middle of the piclure you would copy and touch upon the paper with the point of your coal afterwards obferve the more confpicuous and uppermoft figures if there are more than one which you are to touch lightly in their proper places thus running over the whole draught you will fee as it were the skelefon of the piece you are to draw having made out thefe sketches

grown perfons the fame thing is to be observed as to fat and fiethy perfons and fuch as are very delicate and beautiful and in women fcarce any mufcles at all are to be expreffed or butvery little unless it be in some very forcible action and then too they are to be reprefented very faintly the like is allo to be obferved as to children the motion of the whole body muft be confidered in drawing

or both the shoulders or both the arms shewing the one leg and hiding the other or both of them after one manner at difcretion neither ought this to be obferved only in the whole body but even in every part to that in the legs when mufcle is raifed outwards on the one side that which is directly on the contrary side muft be drawn in and hid as it appears in the life the proportion of the

the forehead to the eyebrows from the eyebrows to the bottom of the nofe thence to the bottom of the chin but this proportion is not conftant thofe features in different men being often very different as to length and shape in well proportioned face however they are nearly right to direct you therefore in forming perfect face your firft bufiness is to draw complete oval as you fee in plate figure in the middle of which from the top to the bottom draw perpendicular line and through the cen- ter or middle of this line draw another directly across from one side to the other of your oval on thefe two lines all the features of the face are to be drawn as follows divide your per- pendicular-line into four equal parts the firft muft be allotted to the hair of the hlead the fe- cond is from the top of the forehead to the top of the nofe between the eyebrows the third is from thence to the bottom of the nofe and the fourth includes the lips and chin the line acrots the perpendicular ofr the breadth of the face is always supposed to be the length of fire eyes you muft therefore divide it into five equal parts and place the eyes upon it fo as to leave exactly the length of one eye betwixt them this is to be underftood only of full frontface for if it turns to either side then the diftances are to be leffened on that side which turns from you less or more in proportion to its turning the top of the ear is to rife parallel to the eyer brows at the end of the diameter or crots line and the bottom of it muft be equal to the bottom of the nofe the noffrils ought not to come out farther than the corner of the eye in any face and the middle of the mouth muft always be placed upon the perpendicular linc the mouth when thut is as large as an eye the following is an ingenious device which perhaps may fomewhat affift the young practition er in forming the face according to its different turnings and in placing the features properly thereon procure piece of mooth wood turned for the purpofe in the shape of an egg which is nearly the shape of the humanhlead draw line lengthwife quite round it as in the laft fig and divide this line into two equal parts by another line drawn directly across it at right angles the features being drawn on thefe twolines accord ing to the rules delivered above will produce fore-right face turn the oval fmall matter from the left hand

too lean it will be nearlyround touch the features lightly where the eyes nofe mouth and chin should fland then begin to drawthem more exactly and to proceed till you have finithed the face after which draw the hlair beard and shadows about it vou are to confi- all those chief touches which give life to face and that difcover the disposition of the mind thus the mouth extended and the cor- ners turning little up thews fmiling counte- nance coc you muft take care that the spa- dows be not made too dark where they should be light becaufe afterwards they can not be ren- dered more light and remember that they are to be more faint and light in fair than in complexion ch vii of the measures and proportions of the several parts of the body ahie antients commonly allowed eightlleads to

from the crown of the head to the forehead is the third part of the face the face begins at the loweft hairs which are upon the forehead and ends at the bottom of the chin the face is divided into three proportional parts the firft contains the forehead the second the nofe and the third the mouth and chin from the chin to the pit between the collar- bones are two lengths of nofe from the pit betwixt the collar bones to the bottom of the breaft one face from the bottotm of the breaft to the navel she face from the navel to the genitals one pace from the genitals to the upper part of the

from the shoulder to the elbow from the end of the elbow to the root of the little finger the bone called cubitus with part of the hand contain two faces from the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit betwixt the collar-bones one face if you will be fatisfied in the meafures of breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other to that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body you muft obferve that the boxes of the elbows with the humerus and of the humerus with the shoulder-blade bear the proportions of half face when the arms are firetched out the sole of the foot is the

perpendicular line from the top of the head to the sole of the foot and meafure our eight lengths of the head this line is of special ufe to direct you in placing the figure upright and in the action of the pof- ture where it falls in and where it fwells out one heads length from the chin you muft draw the breafts the third meafure reacheth navel the fourth to the privities the fifth to the middle of the thigh the fixth to the lower part of the knce the feventh to the lower part of the leg and the eighth to the heel and sole of the foot obferve in every meature whact fouches are of the mufcles draw that leg firhn on which the bodyftandss then draw the other and after that the arms and hands but draw at firft all the parts very lighilys with coal only becaufe there is leaft trouble in altering and rubbing out the coal as for the hands they are twice as long as they are broad and each of their parts has its length breadth and thickness the nail upon the finger is about half the joint it is upon the length of the foot is fixth part of the heighth of perfon and the length is five eighths more than the breadth the length of the face and hands ought to be exactly equal and makes but juft the tenth part of perfon ’ heighth the rules in drawing children are as follow some make child to contain five meafures of the head viz from the top of the head to the privities three and in the thighs and legs two more the breadth between the shoulders the length of head and half the breadth of the body above the navel the length of one head and the breadth of the upper part of the thigh is the third part of two lengths of the head the breadth of the knee is juft the meafure there is betwixt the eyes and the chin the small of the leg and the brawn of the rm are of the thickness of the neck in general let it be obferved always to begin with the right side of the piece you are cepyings for by fo doing you will always have what is done before your eyes and the reft will follow more naturally and with greater eafes whereas if you begin with the left side your hland and arm will cover what you do firft and deprive you of the sight of it by which means you will not be able to proceed with to much eafe pleafure or cer- tainty as to the order and manner of your pro- ceeding in drawing the human body you muft firft tkeich the head then the shoulders in their exact breadth then draw the trunk of the body with the arm-pits leaving the arms sill afterwards and to down to the hips on both sides being fure to observe the exact breadth of the waift when you have done this then draw that leg which the body flands upon and after wards the other which flands loofe then draw the arms and laft of all the hlands take notice alfo of the bowings and bendings of the body making the part oppofite to that which bends correspond in bending with it for inftance if one side of the body bends in the other muft fland out anfwerable to it if the back bends in the belly muft ftick our if the knee bends out the hiam muft fall in and to of any other jont in the body finally endeavour to form all the parts of your figure with truth and in juft proportion not one arm or one leg bigger of lets than the other not broad shoulders with thinflender waift nor raw and bony arms with thick and gouty legs but let there be kind of harmony and agreement amongft the members and an agreeable symmetry thoughout the whole figure but as the effence of drawing confifts in mak- ing at firft good sketch you muft in this par ticular be very careful and accurate draw no part perfect or exact till you fee whether the whole draught be good and when you have altered that to your mind you may then finith one part after another as curioully as you can in drawing the eyes ears legs arms hands feet great care study and practice are requifite this muft be learned by carefully imitating the beft prints of drawings you can get of eyes ears coc for as to the mechanical rules of drawing them by lines and meafures they are not only perplexed and difficult but alfo contrary to the practice of the beft mafters but the actions and poftures of the hand are fo many and vari- ous that no certain rules can be given for draw- ing them that will univerfally hold good and as the hlands and feet are difficult members to draw it is neceffary and well worth while to beftow some time and pains about them carefully imi- tating their various poftures and actions to as notonly to avoid all lameness and imperfection but allo to give them life and spirit in drawing labouring man you muft repre- fent him with frong limbs and raifed muscles swelling and ftanding out especially in bearing burdens drawing weights leaping walking combating or fuch like violent exercifes in reprefenting perfons affeep you muft carefully avoid giving any fuch poftures or actions in their lying as would not in all probability afford reft for great want of judgment would appear in reprefenting their limbs or bodies fupported br own force and not by the help of fome- thing elfe with regard to the reprefentation of the par lions mr de pites obferves that it is abfurd as well as impoffible to prerend giving fach particu- lar demonftration of them as to fix their expref- fion to certain strokes which the painter should be obliged to make ufe of as effential and inva- riable rules this fays he would be depriving the art of that excellent variety of expreftion which has no other principle than diverfity of imagination the number of which is infinite the same pastion may be expreffed feveral ways each yielding more or less pleafure in proportion to the painter underftanding and the specta- for ’ difcernment though every part of the face contributes towards exprefting the sentiments of the heart yet the kyebrow according to mr le bran principal seat of exprestion and where the paftions make themfelves moft known it is certain fays he that the pupil of the eyc by its fire and motion very well thews the agita- tion of the soul but then it does not express the kind or nature of that agitation whereas the motion of the eyebrow differs according as the paffions change their nature to express fimple paffion the motion is fimple to exprets mixt paffion the motion is compound if the paf- fion be gentle the motion is gentle if it be vio- lent the motion is fo too we may farther obferve fays he that there are two kinds of ele- vation in the eyebrows one in which the eye- brows rife up in the middle this elevation ex- preffes agreeable senfations and it is to be ob- served that then the mouth rifes at the corners another in which the eyebrows rife up at the ends and fall in the middle denotes bodily pain and then the mouth falls at the corners in laughter all the parts agree for the eyebrows which fall towards the middle of the forehead make the nofe the mouth and the eyes follow the same motion in weeping the motions are compound and contrary for the eyebrows fall towards the nofe and over the eyes and the mlouth rifes that way it is to be obferved allo that the mlouth is the part of the face which more particularly expreffes the emotions of the heart for when the heart complains the mouth falls ar the corners when it is pleafed the corners of the mouth are elevated and when it has an averfion the mouth fhoots forward and rifes in the middle the head fays mr de piles contributes more to the expreftion of the paffions than all the other parts of the body put together thofe feparately can only fhare some few paffions but the head expreffes them all some however are more peculiarly exprefied by it than others as humility by hanging it down arrogance by lifting it up languifhment by inclining it on one side and obkinacy with ftiff and refolute air makes it fland upright fixed and ffiff between the shoul- ders the head alfo beft thews our supplications threats mildness pride love hatred joy and grief the whole face and every feature con tribute fomething but more especially the eyes yet though the paffions of the soul are moft vifible in the lines and features of the face they often require alto the affiftance of other parts of the body without the hands for inftance an ac- tion is weak and imperfect their actions which are almoft infinite create numberless expresfions it is by them that partly we defire hope pro- mife call and fend back they are the inftruments of threatning prayer praife coc by them we in great meafure approve condemn refule admit fear alk express our joy and grief our doubts regrets pain and admiration but to fay how thefe parts muft be difposed for expreffing the various paffions is impoffible nor can any ckaclrules be given for it both becaute the tark would be infinite and becaufe every one muft be guided in this by his own genius and the particu- lar turn of his studies chap ix of drapery the art of cloathing your figures or cafting the drapery upon them with elegance and pro- priety many things are to be obferved however this art confifts chieffy in three points viz the order of the folds or plaits the different cuality of the stuffs and the variety of their colours as to the folds they ought to be to managed as that you may eafily perceive what it is they cover and diffinguith it from any thing elfe as forluftance that you fee it is an arm that is underthe drapery and not leg or leg and not an arm eoc again the folds ought to be large and con- traft should be obferved between them otherwife in the firft cafe they break and divide the sight too much and in the next place the drapery will be tooffiff as to the quality of the stufts it should be well confidered some folds being abrupt and harth while others flow more foff and eaty again the surface of some have luftre while others are flat and dead and some are fine and tranfparent while others are firm and folid the variety of colours when well managed makes the greateft beauty in painting some are not equally agree- able with respect to each other and some are never to be placed near certain others drapery muft never be made to adhere or stick too clofe to the parts of the body but it muft teem to flowround and as it were embrace them yet in fuch manner as that the figure may be eaty and have free motion great lightnets and motion of the drapery are only proper in figures in much agitation or expofed to the wwind the nudities of the figure should always be defigned before you proceed to draw the dra- peries draw the out-lines of the garments lightly then draw the great foldsfirft and

defign to draw this done place right before it piece of wood with hole in it fit for one eye to look through and as you meet any out lines of the object on the tranf- parent paper trace them over with

out-lines are drawn not at different times becaufe the sun inflantly changes them here obferve as in certain objects you will have fainter ftronger and darker shades in your re marks of them to take fuch memorandums as may direct you how to finith them with indianink or other colour when you fit down to complete your work to this end the beft way is before you trace out your object to prepare three shells or gallipots of indian ink mixed with common water viz one of very faint black one of middling black and one of an intenfe black numbering them and as youmake your obfervation on the shades of your object mark pon your draught the jame numbers as they happein to appear to that afterwards you may finith with certainty in this regard the tranparent paper is of great ofe for being laid upon any paper or print in loofe sheet all the lines will be feen to perfectly through it that you may copy them with the great- eft eafe and if the print or picture be done by good mafter you can fee which lines are ftrong which foft and how to imitate them there is yet another way to take views and landlkips which some prefer to the tranfparent paper and that is either with whice or black tiffany or lawn ftrained upon frame and used in the fame manner as the paper excepting that as the black-lead pencil is ufed to the paper on the white tiffany and on the lawn you muft ufe charcoal very foft and finely powdered but on the black tiffany very tender white chalk is be ufed ch kiii several ether curious and eafy metheds of taking vies copying draughts prints e the greateff degree of accuracy draught may be taken regularly from drawing on transparent paper as fot lows take piece of paper of the same size with that of the draught rub one side of it with some powder of black-lead till it be well and equally blacked to that finger touching it willhardly be tinged with the blacking then take the print and laying the paper underneath it with the black side downwards upon another piece of white paper of the same size pin the three together in two or three places afterwards take pin or needle fomewhat blunted at the point and trace it over the out-lines of your picture which with little preffing will direct the black paper to impress the white fo as to receive every stroke you draw this done you may carefully correct what errors you fee with your black-lead pencil cleaning the nnew-made draughts flightly with the crumb of hale bread as for the draughts taken on tiffany of lawn they are only to be laid on paper that is fuch as is drawn with charcoal upon white and thatdrawn with chalk upon black or blue paper and then giving each of them knock or two with hiammer the charcoal or the chalk will fall through them upon the papers directly in the lines they were drawn and give you the true reprefentation of the object drawn from the life in white lines upon the black paper and in black lines upon the white then firengthen thefe shadows of drawings with your black-lead pencil chalk or red cker upon the pieces of paper where they made the marks for otherwife the lines will eafily berub- bed out but it muft be obferved that this amend- ment is to be made foon after the lines becaufe those tender draughts will quickly vanith if care is not taken to ftrengthen them immediately you are to begin this operation at the bottom of the drawing another way is by taking thin piece of paper and holding it againft glass-window particularly fathed one becaufe the interruption of the lead in the smaller glazed windows will hinder part of the prospect then draw what you fee from the glass and afterwards the black-lead paper is to be ufed as directed before there is another way hill which may be more eaty to the hand or arm of perfon not ac- cuftomed to drawing upon paper or lawn placed upright which is by the fe of camera obicura tho to help the hand one may hold baguette or fuch stick in the left hand as the oil-painters ufe to reft the right hand upon or have fome other reft made for the right hand as may be eafily fcrewed up and down at pleafure but there is this difference flill between drawing piece of perspective or view on tranparent paper or lawn placed upright againft any object and drawing by the camera obicura that fuch piece will take in more of the view of object from greater diftance than the camera obfcura will the portable camera obicura will at firft be very eaty to the arm of beginner by reafon the objects appear on an horizontal plane fuch as table and the hand having reft will more eafily follow the line re- prefented on the plane with greater exactness the camera obfcura is machine or appara- tus wherein the lmages of external objects are re- prefented diftinctly and in their genuine colours either in an inverted or erect situation this ma- chine may be made as follows darken cham- ber one of whofe windows look into place fet with variety of objects leaving only one little aperture open in the window in this aperture fit lens either plane convex one or one convex on both sides fo as to be the portion of large sphere at due diftance to be determined by experience pread paper or white cloth on the wall unless the wall itfelf be whitened to as to ferve the purpofe and on this the lmages of the defired objects will be delincated invertedly in this cafe it is not more difficult to draw of rather co the objects though they are re- verfed than to draw or copy feveral things which we fee upright on the frames of tranfparent paper lawn or tiffany for to trace lines will be as eafily done one way as the other and though the objects falling on the paper or cloth will while you are drawing them be reverfed it is but turn- ing the paper or cloth upfide down when they are done and the drawing will be right to the eye but to obviate this difficulty let the paper or what is to receive the objects be placed againft the back of chair and let perfon look on the several objects reprefented thereon over the back of the chair and this will fet them right to the eyc or if you would rather have the lmages appearerect it may be done either by means of concave lens or by receiving the image on plane speculum inclined to the horizon under an angle or by means of two lenfes included in draw-tube inftead of one it is to be obferved that if the aperture does not exceed the bigness of pea the objects will be re- prefented thereon even though there be no lens at all to render the lmages clear and diffinet it is neceffary that the objects be illuminated by the sun and they will be still brighter if the specta- for firtt ray quarter of an hour in the dark care muft be likewife taken that no light elcape through any chinks and that the wall be not too much illugginated farther the greater diffance there is between the aperture and the wall the larger and more diftinct will the images be but the rays becoming thus too much dilated the brightness of the image is weakened till at length it becomes infenfible but the portable camera obicura is more proper for beginners as being more eaty for their arm befides the ob- jects appearing on an horizontal plane may of courte be drawn with greater exactness the conftruction of portable camera obicura may be asfollows provide wooden cheft in the middle of which raife little turret either round of quare open towards the object behind this aperture incline little plane mirror to an angle of which will reffect the rays upon lens convex on both sides included in tube at the end of the focus of the lens place table covered with white paper to receive the lmage and laftly make an oblong aperture to look through by means of this machine the images will be exhibited perfectly like their objects each cloathed in their different colours whereby any perfon unacquainted with defigning or drawing will be able to delineate any thing to the greateff degree of accuracy and juftnels and thofe even well verfed in painting will find many hints by it to perfect them in their art thus far we have fhewn how any perton may copy draught print or piece of painting of even make an exact reprefentation from the life but we shall yet add two other methods both eafy and entertaining not hithertomentioned for taking off draughts or drawings which are follow prick with pin the out-lines of the print or draught you defign to copy and then laying the fame on sheet of paper take pow- der-puff or tuft of cotton dipping it now and then in charcoal duff and beat it over the pricked lines through the picture by which means you shall have full directions marked on your cloth of paper fufficient to finith juft drawing the other way is by making such an im- preffion from the print as shall give juft copy of it and it is of great ufe when we want to carry every stroke of the engraver along with us which method if you are very careful will indeed but very little fully the print for this end take some white or green soap which mix with fuch quantity of water as will bring it to the confiffence of felly with this mixture rub the print and with wet sponge gently wet the paper defigned for receiving the impreffion then laying it on the print cover all with two or three other pieces of dry paper and rub it very hard all over with any thing that is fmooth and polifhed and thus the wetted paper will have upon it the reverfe of the print you rubbed it upon with every diftinct line in the original if you have been careful torub itequally xiv secrets for copying of drawings continued also for taking off medals various ways with several other curious .re cepts for tbe dse of painters statuaries founders to take drawing with fixed iwk thin sheet of paper and rub it all over withfreth butter as equally as poffible then dry it well by the fire and rub the buttered sidewitheither carmine lamp-black black-lead powder or blue bice finely ground till it is all equally coloured taking care in rubbing on any of thofe that the colour will not come off by very hlight touch of the finger then lay the co- loured side of this buttered paper upon piece of clean paper and lay the print you defign to copy upon the buttered paper afterwards with fine pin or needle blunted little at the point trace the out-lines of the drawing carefully by which means you will have good copy of it upon your white paper which may be touched afterwards with crayons or the like colour ii to take the impression of print with redivk mix some vermillion finely ground with lin- feed-oil but not to much but what it shall ftill be liquid enough to run or flow in pen with this trace the lines of your print and then with sponge dipt in water wet the backfide of the print and turn the printed side down upon piece of white paper foas to he fmooth then lay over that piece of dry paper and press it hard in every part and the lower white paper will receive the impreffion but if you have linnen-fress it is better to put your papers between two of the leaves and fcrew the press as tight as you can by which means you will have fine impreffion iii to take draughts writings with red loose ink take some vermillion finely ground and mix it with fair water in gallipot with some cotton in it to as that it may run very free in the pen with this mixture draw over all the strokes of your print imitating both the finer and fironger lines then with sponge dipt in gum-water wet piece of clean white paper and while it is wet turn the print upon it and preffing it well take off the print and you will find all the strokes remain on the clean paper and as foon as it is dry the vermillion will be fixed to it this sort of ink has been ufed frequently in writing any thing deligned to be engraved for by turning the writing side of the paper down upon copper-plate covered with bees wax and white ground rubbing it very equally the im= prestion will be upon the wax iv taking draughts with blue loose ink you may likewife make fuch sort of ink with blue bice and common water as will run very finely in pen and ferve for the same ufe as the former liik.. to take off drawing in standing red col.our by tracing take vermillion finely ground and mixing it with little fresh butter rub clean sheet of paper on one side with this mixture to that it may bear flight touch of the finger without leaving the paper then laying the coloured side of this paper upon clean shect lay your print upon the other side of the coloured paper and then trace every line you think proper as already directed in tracing draught with fixed ink but be fure to pin the three papers together at the corners to prevent their flipping which would inevitably fpoil your work this impreftion made by tracing will hold without rubbing or preffing the papers the cuills of swallow after they are thoroughly dry are very good for tracing by mixing carmine with some freth butter and colouring paper with it in the same manner you will obtain more beautiful colour and by co. louring paper in like manner with blue bice and butter you may have the drawing blue vi to take the natural or lively shape of any here or tree firft take the leaf you would copy and genly rub the veins on the back-fide of it with piece of lvory or some fuch like matter to as to bruife them little afterwards wet the same side gently with linfeed-oil and then press it hard upon of white paper and you shall have the perfect figure of the leaf with every vein in it juftly exprefted this impreftion being afterwards coloured will seem truly natural and may be ufe- ful to fuch as would remember plants vii another way of painting the le aves of plants so that the impression shall appear as black as if it had been done in printing-press is as follows when the leaf is dry take fuch ball as the press-menufe for blacking the types and rubbing at equally over with printer ink firike it gently four or five times on the back of the leaf till the veins are blacked with the ink then lay- ing the leaf on fiat board or the like with the backfide upwards clap piece of white paper well moiftened on the leaf and preffing it pretty hard but not to as to bruife the fibres you shall have fine impreffion but this may ffill be done to greater advantage by means of piece of wood in the form of about foot long and an inch and diameter the middle part about fix or eight inches long being covered with woolen cloth rolled three or four times round it with this cylinder roll the paper over the leaf four or five times backwards and forwards and you will have curious impreffion but where printer ink is not conveniently come at the following method may be made ufe of rub the back of the leaf as before directed with burnt linfeed-oil then ftrewing fome powder of black lead or for want of that fome charcoal or fmall coal-duft or the powder of burnt cork upon fimooth board to as equally to cover it stroke the powder gently over and oiling the backfide of the leaf clap it upon the board and then laying the white paper upon the back of the leaf prets or roll it as before if none of thefe ingredients are conveniently had take vermillion and mixing it with freth butter to the confiftence of printer ink cover your printing ball with it dawb it over the back of the leaf and take your impreffion as before where vermillion is ufed bice may allo be made ufe of either with butter or oil by grind- ing blue bice with some burnt linfeed oil and ufing it as before thus you may have finered or blue ink proper for impreffions of this sort but the blue is preferable in colouring leaves becaute it is an agreeable colour for the green sort it may be obferved that the reafon why the back of the leaf is the proper side to make the impreffion from is becaufe the ribs or veffels rife on that side above the flethy part of it and there- fore being coloured with any of thofe inks they are the fitteft to give an impreffion whereas in forefide of the leaf the ffethy parts rife and thefe fine fibres are funk between them to take off the le aves of plants in plafter of paris so as that they may afterwards be caft in meial.. thofe perfons who caft in metal have frequent occafion to ufe leaves of feveral sorts in order to embellish their work thefe are generally made from models done by the hand which take up great deal of time and even at laft are imperfect but the following way which is com- municated by gentleman from iioly is greatly preferable and much eafier soon after you have cropped the leaf you defire to take an impreffion from lay it between the leaves of book till once it shall lie flat then pon finooth board with ftrong guni-water smade of gum-arabic fix the forefide or front of the leaf to the board when this is done raife round it little wall of coarfe pafte half an inch high or if you can conveniently furround your piece of wood with pafte-board or card- paper to clofe as that it shall hold liquid for some time then oil the back of your leaf as directed below in the method for cafting of me- dals and pour on water and plafter of paris there directed which when it is dry will give you an exalt impreffion of every vein of the leaf and from which you may eafily make mould to caft in as you fancy ix an expeditious methed of taking the impression of any butterely in all its colours having taken butterffy kill it without spoil- ing the wings which contrive to pread as regur larly as poffible in flying pofition then with small bruth or pencil taking piece of white pa= per wath part of it with crum-water alittle thick- or than ordinary to that it may eafily dry after- wards laying your butterffy on the paper cut off the bodyclofe to the wings and throwing it away lay the paper on finooth board with the fly upwards and laying another paper over thats put the whole preparation into screw-press and screw it down very hard or otherwife press it letting it remain under that preffure for the space of an hour afterwards take off the wings of the butterffy and you will find perfect impref- fion of them with all their yarious colours marked diffinctly remain upon the paper when this is done draw between the wings of your impref- fion the body of the butterffy and colour your draught of the body after the life to take off the impression of wedals this may be of ufe to fuch as would preserve to themfelves good specimens of fine draughts of curious medals especially as it is eafily executed and but triffing expence one way is as follows take hinglass and breaking it in pieces diffolve as much of it over the fire in quantity of water fufficient only to cover it taking care to keep it firring till the whole is diffolved this done with hair brush ftroke some of the glue over the medals whofe impreftion you would take after placing them as horizontally as you can and when you have covered them perfectly all over let them lie till the glue is hardened and afterward with the point of pin or needle raife the edge of the glue from each medal and the whole impreffion of the medals in glue will fy off as hard as hforn with all the fine sharp- nnets of the medal as it was struck this glue may he made of whatever colour you pleafe by mixing the colour in the water the glue is boiled in.. the impreffion muft be dried immediately but very regular and not in hot sun nor in any damp place ii you ufe ifing glats without any colourmixed with the water you may as foon as you take the impreffions from the medals breathe gently on the concave side of them and then lay them upon the thickeft fort of leaf-gold which will rtick to them and by fhining through the iling glats will appear like gold medal but if we would imitate copper-medal we should mix carmine with the water that we diffolve our -slats in hing although water may do very well for diffoly- ing the ifing-glats in for this purpofe yet brandy or spirits of wine will give the glue much greater strength to as not to be subject to foften in damp air xi to take the impression of large medals firft rub the medals gently over with tuft of fine cotton moiftened or greafed with sweet- oil then having some melted brimftone enough to cover the medal half aninch thick put hoop of card-paper round the edge or it and pour the melred brunffone on it but not too hot as foon as it is fixed and hardened take off the hoop of paper and the impreffion on the brmfone will come clean from the medal which shall ferve for charp and correct mould wherein you may call another with plaifter of paris bur brini hone should not be ufed on silver-medals be caufe it will effectually change their colour there- to take silver-medals off bind them round after oiling them with hoop of some riff paper as before and mixing little plaifter of paris with water fill the hoop with it then immediately fill the cafe in sprinkling man- ner with the same plaifter till it hardens and when it turns dry take it off from the medals but from thofe moulds caft in brimffone that are concave you multagain caft fuch medals in plaiffer of paris and they will be convex oiling the mould and ufing the plaiffer of paris as before by this me- thod you may take off any medal or fine eass- relief with great exactncts even to as to form medals from them in any fort of mctal xii another way of takine of medals is as follows procure some thin pieces of lead and placing the medal horizontally on the top of firm poft or any heady place lay piece of harder me- tal flat over the lead and place piece of round turned stick over that fuch as is ufed in the staff of houfe-bruth faw off about five or fix inches in length and holding that right wich the left hand on the lead and flat piece of metal hrike the top of the stick fmart blow with large fiammer and it wil give the lead perfect impreffion of the lmage of the medal but this mut be done by one fingle elow to render the impreffion perfcel xiii various ways of taking off medals take the shavings of paper and boiling them till they are tender pound them well in mortar to as to reduce them into pafte then boil them again in spring-water with little gum-arabic let this mixture fland some time to fettle then pour off the water ftraining it through sieve or linnen-cloth and the remaining part of this mixture will be an excellent ingredient either to press into any mould or upon any medal for when the pafte is dry it will come off very sharp some mledals that are under-wrought can not be taken off this way therefore in fuch cafe you should take common glue and melung it fix hoop of pafte-board round the edge of the medal and pour on the glue hot the sfc dal having been firft oiled with tuft of greated cotton wthen the crlue is dry and hard take off the hoop and the clue will fy off from the edges and it wiil as being funycet to bend and oive way which the things formerly mentioned are come very cafily off but the giue ought to be made frong and should be poured on one third part of an luch thick when an impreffion has been taken by this means you muft then hoop your mould of glue with either card-paper or pafte-board as befire taking care to oil it to that no bubbles or bliffers may be feen then you may caft your plaifter of paris in it and you will obtain by thefe means good copy of the medal when this is dry the glue will fly off or may be broken off will remain good pattern to caft and there from alfo putty may be made of lin feed-oil and fine-ground starch which being well worked together into pafte will take good impreffion from any medal by means of thefe moulds you may caft good medals of bees-wax but they will come off much charper if the mould be in brimftone than if it be in plaifter of paris but then your wax should be as well blanched of whicened as if it was ufed for wax-candles how- ever it will be neceffary to greate the mould be- fore the wax is poured in and though white tax is here recommended yet it will not be beft that the copy of the medal be white becaufe the darker colours thew the medal much better if you would have your copy of red colour mix vermillion with the wax while it is melt- in and if you would have it blue put in stone- blue well beaten or ground into the melted wax as foonas thefe wax-medals are cold enough to take off you should lay some leaf-gold upon them prefting it down genly with piece of cotton without rubbing it backwards and forwards and that will gild yourmicdal whenyou caft mledals i plaifter of paris to make them look like steel or metal rub them over with tuft of cotton lightly greated with oil then ftrewing over them some powder of black lead rub them well with such bruth as is ufed for the feeth till the whole is equally covered and this will give them fine meral-gloss you may make thefe me- dals in plaiter of paris look like box by boiling them in linfeed-oil and this will harden them to fuch degree as to hear the brusk to clean them when they tarn foul or dirty if you would have thefe medals look of yellow colour boil litle pearl-athes in pint of water til it makes firong lixiwium then put in half of pint of french-berries boil this till the liquor is of firong yellow and ufe it with your plaifter of paris infread of common water if you would have the medals look green the fine tranfparent gum of verdegreafe mixed with the plaifter of paris will give them that colour and for silver-colour leaf-filver or tin-foil may be ufed in the jame manner as the leat- gold for the gold-colour for the copper-colour german leaf-copper may be ufed xiv to take off impressions in plaiffer of paris from copper-pl ates oil the plates little and binding them about either with card or other pafte-board paper pour on them fome of the fineft plaifter of paris and water and finithing the work with plaifier till it becomes dry and hardens you will have fine imprestion or draught of the lines on the platg in the plaifter which you may make ufe of to draw from as you may have occafion xv totake off the fine engravings from watch- cases snuff-bckes eic hold them over the smoke of candle till they are quite black then wiping off the blacs with the foft part of the palm of your hand lay piece of white paper little wetted with sponge over the engravings and over that clap thin piece of flannel or brown paper preffed down very hard which being rubbed the paper

into an impalpable pow- der fo foft as to feel like grounds of starch or hair-powder this is by fome called pearl-white and will mix well with any colour but if you ufe white lead firft rectify it with white-wine vinegar which caufing fermentation the white will foon fettle after which pour off the vinegar and wath the white with common water the method of wathing it is thus put the powder into glats of water ffir it about and prefently pouroff the water while it is white into fome other clean glats or veffel then letting it fettle pour off the water from it and shall have an excellent white to which when it is fettled you are to put as much gum water as is neceffary to give it glazc it is obfervable that white lead will turnblack if mixed with water that comes from iron or clay that is in the space of month or two you may perceive thofe places where it lies thick- eff tinged with black and if it be mixed with any other colour it will foon change or alter it some recommend the powder of egg-shells of the brighteff colour and well cleaned and wathed as very good to be ground with gum- water or you may put twentieth part of clean white sugar candied to grind with it in water it muft be ground as fine as poffible that is to the state of an impalpable powder and then ule it some lay it is better if rectified spirit of wine be poured on it which will clear it from any dross that may be in it this it is probable muft be poured off when the spirit of wine has done its work and then the parts left behind muft be mixed with gum-water again but it has been found by experience that eoo- shell powder is of very great service as white in water-colours and that itfelf and the oyfter- shell powders well rectified and mixed with the white of an egg well beaten will make an ex- traordinary mixtureinothercolours and will cor- rect them from changingor altering their qualities as to white for illuminating of prints the clear white of the paper is to be left uncoloured and if it happens that the paper is apt to fink or to pread any water-colour that is laid upon it more than is neceffary then the way to correct it is as follows fix the paper in fuch station asthet it may only receive the colouryoulay on to slaze juft as far as you defigned it then take fome starch boiled and prepared in wiater of middle strength and with large painung-bruth firoke it over the back of the print and after it has been well dried in the air or sun put the print in book with weight upon it to take out the crumplings which it may receive by wetting of it and thus will any print be rendered fit to receive water-colours which will be prevented from running further than one would have them fine whire for water-colours is made by diffolving filings of fine silver or silver-leaf in qua-fortiss then evaporating the aqua-fortis till it looks like cryftals in the bottom of the glass de- cant the other part of the aqua-fortis and wath the silver five or fix times in common water till it is freed from the aqua fortis which may be known by talting it then dry it for ufe it muft be ufed with gum-water and little water of sugar-candy an incomparable fine white lead-colour is made by grinding choice white lead well upon porphery with vinegar to that it turns blackith then take pot full of water and wathing the white lead in it very well let it fettle and pour- ing off the water grind it again with vinegar repeat this once or twice more and you will have excellent white both for water-colours and painting in oil to make good white for the ground for water or oil-colours

upon tinc- ture of gamboge or any of the former vellows nextto this may be reckoned the tincture of saffron in common water only which affords bright reddith fellow fuch as would be required for an orange-colour in covering the fhadowed parts of print and when saffron is infuled in rectified spirits of wine there is nothing higher but then it will fly unless it be loaded with cum- arabic sfor

colour of the liquor is as ftrong as you pleafe which may be difcovered by dipping slip of white paperinto it when this colour is as you would have it pais it when cooled into linnen-cloth and bottle it up for ufe and if you would bring this colour to body take ox-blood and dry it till it can be reduced powder which being done mix it with the liquor and it will communicate colour to it little

prints ec is prepared as follows put thirty or forty grains of bruifed cochineal into gallipot with as many drops of fartar-lye as will juft wet it and make it give forth irs co- lour then immediately adding to this mixture half spoonful of water or more if the colour be hill too deep you will have delicate purple- liquor or tincture then taking bit of alum fcrape very finely with knife small

colour that will always look exqui- fitely fine if it is foon made ufe of but will decay indian if it flands long indian red next to thefe is the indian red which though it is colour of body yet is ufeful for black ground for flowers at diftance when ufed with gum-ater there is alfo an earth brought from the hle of wight which has been found to mix ex- tremely well with cum-water though being of vifcous nature it requires less gum than moft other colours and as it is naturally fit for ufe without grinding and is vifcous fo it will no doubt mix with oil as well as with water thereis one thingvery extraordinary in this earth which is that if you rub deal-board with it it will make the board exactly of the colour of mahogony-wood and ftain it to deep and with to much flrength that it is hard to get it out with wathing ap vii of purple fine tranfparent purple may be made either redder or nearer the blue as you would have it by boiling four ounces of rafped brafil- wood in pint of htale beer with half an ounce of logwood or campeachy-wood till the liquor is heightened to the colour you defire which may be known by dipping piece of paper in youfinditfoored addan ounce of logwood to the brafil-wood which will make it much near- ct to the purple than the former and by this me- thod you may humour it to any degree of purple by putting in either more or less logwood to the former compofition and fixing the colour with afum ric this will- produce fuch clear purple as no nixture of folid reds and blues will do and the receipt has been for long time kept secret it is faid that the beft purple colour that can be made may be compoted between the carmine and indigo to ftrengthen which on the red fide you may add lake between the ligher and darker part and to lake when it is ufed in the fame way on the foregoing purple or the liquid crim- ion produces very fine effect the colour may be varied and made either redder by putting more carmine or bluer by ufing more indigo which being mixed on white dutch title will thew itfelf fine purple colour may be made of the grots part of sediment of lake-columbine both for oil and water-colours as follows take the sediment of lake-columbine which falls to the bottom of the vial in which is the bone of the cuttle-fith let it dry and grind it there will be no lake to fine as this and it you mix it with lake it will give it better body befides more strength and vigour chap viil of bive ie ultramarine-blue is not only the firft but the beft fort of bright blue we have as it gives spirit to all paintings where blues are uted the colour is made from the lapis lazuli divefted of its gold and ground into an impalpa- ble powder which is done as follows take half pound of lapislazuli and putting it upon red- hot coals let it ftaythere until it is red-hot then quenching it in very hrong vinegar and grinding it upon porphery or any fuch hard stone with rectified brandy to an impalpable powder make paftil with which the lapis is to be incorporated for the making of this paftil take bees-wax tur- pentine rofin and infeed-oil of each quarter of pound and melting the whole together over flow fire when it begins to boil pouritintoa glaz- ed por this is the pafte of ultramarine takeof this pafte quantity equal to that of the lapis knead them together upon the marble and being well incorporated let them remain for one night afterwhich to bring out the ulramarine that is in the pafte pour clear water upon it and knead it with your hands as pafte is kneaded and the u will comeour forthereceiving of which place porringer or other proper vellel under your hlands and let it fertle in this water till you tee the ultramarine at the bottom of it iyour colour feems to be clammy or nafty you may correct it thus add thereto tartar diffolved in water as much as will drown it and let it reft for one day at leaft then wash it in warm water and you will by that means have it cor- fect and well purified ulramarine prytt be chosen of high colour and well ground which may be known by putting it between the feeth for if it feels gritty it is sign that it has not been well ground to know whether it be pure and unmixed put little of it into crucible and hearing it red hot if the powderdoesnot change its colour after trial it is certainly pure but on the contrary if there be any change or black specks in it then it has been adulterated the pruffian blue is next to ultramarine in beauty if it be ufed in oil though it is not agreed on whether it will hold to well as the other par- ticularly asnot having the body of the ultramarine the pruffian blue does not grind well in water becaufe there is fuch an oily quality in it that it does not mix kindly with water and at the beft will change as it is now prepared in the common way attempts have been made to make it blue inc which indeed has held the colour for monthortwo but then turned to muddyyellow and when you put your pencil with gum-water into shell of this elue you will find that where the water preads the blue will turn yellowiff till the body of the colour is well ffirred up and after all that can be done with this colour in wa- ter it will only ferve to fhade ultramarine with b in oil it may ferve very well for the prefent to fupply the place of ultramarine blue-bice is colour of good brightness and is the next to the praffian bluc it alfo is colour of body and will flow prerty well in the pencil especially if it be well wathed as is directed to be done of the whites and mlinium saunders-blue is allo of very good ife and may ferve as shade to ultramarine or the bluc- bice where the shades are not required to be very deep and is of itself pleafant elue to be laid between the lights and shades of fuch flower is of mazarine-blue the laemus or litmus-bluc is another colour and will run in pen as free as ink being made of laemus or as fome terni it litmus which is fold at moft druggifts hops but as this colouris never to be met with prepar- ed for water colours we therefore all give the following method of preparing it according to mrs mliriona take an ounce of lacmus and boil it in about pint of finall beer-wort till the colour is as ftrong as you would have it then pour off the liquor into calipot and let it coel for ufc it will foon become jelly and by degrees will grow hard but this colour is to be opened again and made liquid by water to as to be ufed in ink and will be either paler or darker as it is made thicker or thinner his affords bright colour and has extraerdinary effects for it is not only beautiful hi holding colour this colour if it be touched with aqua fortis immediately changes into fine crimfon little inferior to carmine and finks quite through the paper to as not to begotout to that when it is ufed as blue it is beft to keep it from aqua-fortis or fuch ftrong acids it is good shade for ultramarine or blue-bice where the ftrongeft shades should not be extremely deep and for colouring of prints it is very good as it is tranfparent colour and goes great way indigo blue makes the ftrongeft shade for blues of any other and is foft warm colour when it has been well ground and wathed with gum-water by means of stone and muller it is made of what lightness joupleafe by putting more gum-water to it and by how much the less cum-water is put to it the darker it will be before you ufe it upon print it will be proper to try it upon duich tile for it runs warmly in the pencii and to perhaps may otherwife prove too frong for your defign which is always to be taken care of when flowing colouris to be laid over the dark shade of print which shade will much heighten its blackness and even make it appear quite black fine blue from mr boyle take of the blue leaves of rue and beating them little in stone-mortar with wooden pef- ile infule them in water juice and all for four= teen ways or more wathing them every day till they they are rotten and at laft beat them and the water together till they become pulp and let them dry in the sun this will produce as good blue as indigo and be much fofter but in order to keep it long tune when you beat it the laft time add litle powder of gum-arabic to it of which you may put more or lets as you would have it more free or tenacious in the working this is an excellent blue for fhading has good body and runs warm in the pencil transparent blue from mr boyle equal to tliramarine this is beautiful blue the chief ingredient of which is the cyanus or blue cornbottle-ffower this flower has two blues in it one of pale er outward leaves the other colour in the larg of deeper colour in the inner leaves or mid- dle of the flower both thefe will do being teparated from the burtons and cafes they grow in but the deep blue leaves in the middle pro- duce by much the beft colour this may be ob- served by rubbing the leaves while they are freth to hard upon piece of good writing paper press out the juice which will yield an excel- lent colour that will not fade for feveral years this part of the flower is therefore the principal and what may be depended on and should bepicked from the reft of the flower-leaves the same day it was gathered or as foon afterwards as poffibly can be good quantity of these middle-leaves being h procured press out what juice you can fromm them and adding little alum to it vou will have lafting tranparent elue of as bright sland- ing colour as can be defired fcarce inferior in beauty to ultramarine and very durable as for the outward flower-leaves which are much paler it is not certain that they will antver the end but some trials may be made whereby that may be knownalfo let the flowers be ga= thered about the beginning of june or in july or uguft but the preparation of the colour by picking out the middle deep blue flower-leaves and preffing out the juice muft be done with all the expedition poffible or elfe they will lofe their perfection it is probable that if the leaves of thefe blus cornbottle-ffowers were cured in the same man- ner as saffron is they would produce tuch great- body of colour from which inctare might be drawn with more eafe than if preffed raw of fieth from the field in order to do this fuch kiln muft be prepar- ed as is ufed for curing of saffron in which may be made fmall charcoal fire that may communi- cate heat to the top of the kiln which is to be covered with hair-cloth upon this should be laid four or five sheets of white paper fuch as is ufed in curing of saffron afterwards parcel of the picked flowers are to be laid on to the thick- nets of two or three inches laying them clofe and hat with knife and prinkling them with some .wii- then the cake of flowers is to be covered with two or three sheets of paper and with small weight laid on for few li- nutes after which the board is to be taken off and the cake of flowers to be turned on the kiln taking hold of all the papers with both hlands and when it has been rightly placed take off the upper papers and prinkle the cake second time with some gum-water then fettling the cake again with knife let the papers be laid on as before with the board and weight for minute or two after which let the papers be turned again and again till the cake of flowers becomes united and of the thickness of cake of saffron in this operation you will find the flowers row darker and darker every time they are turn- ed till at length the gake will look of deep blue tending to black from whence tincture may be eafily drawn during this operation great care should be taken that the fire does not fcorch the flowers but that it be as confiant and entle as poftible which will be fure way so bring the cake to good colour but it will not be improper for any perfon who shall undertake the curing of this colourto confult the niethods of curing saffron of which they may be informed either in treatife of the method of curing saffron written by mr dowglas or in another by mr bradley in his treatife of agri- sulture hulbandry and gardening chap h hap ix of black proper black for water-colours is ivory-black which if pure and well ground is of ufe in painting in miniature but it is not proper for colouring prints being too heavy colour and hiding the beautiful strokes of the graver unless done with great care however if it be neceffary to ufe black for darkening print tather choofe ffrong tincture of good india ink than the lvory-black but to colour pieces in mi- niature ufe the lvory-black prepared as follows grind the lvory-black well in gum-water till you perceive kind of oily liquor fertle to the bot- com this liquor mix with as much of the ivory- black as you think will be proper to make it flow freely in the pencil and it will bear an extraor- dinary gloss and if the object is fhining fuch as the wings of some beetles mix with some of it little white upon dutch glazed tile till you find it light enough to receive the shade and then make another lighter mixture of the same which being uted on the brighter part of the subject will preduce the effect you defired mc ... greens allowed by all to depend upon the yellow and blue and any green co- lour whatever you pleafe may be made with them gamboge is one of the firft fellows which may be made to produce five or fix greens with verdegreafe according as the gamboge is in the greater or leffer proportion if it abounds it will make tolerable oak-green and being mixed with greater quantity of verdegreafe it will make fine rafs-green but the fellow which some prefer before all others is made of french-berries as already described under the yellows which is either deeper or fainter as the liquor they are boiled in is more or less ftained with them if it be very thin it makes good glaze all over the verde- greafe and as it approaches nearer to duich-pink or gall-fone commands almoft any colour we want being agreeably mixed with the tranfparent verdegreafe and is fill tranparent in like manner yellow drawn from the roots of barberries and allo that drawn from the roots of the mulberry-tree will in great weafure produce the like effect being mixed with the tranparent verdegreafe as for the verdegreafe itself it produces fine bluith green flows eaty in the pencil and may even ferve asann ink to write with the way of preparing the tranfparent ver- degreafe is as follows take fix ounces of com- mon verdegreafe the diftilled verdegreafe not antwering this purpofe fo well break it into lityle pieces and boil it genly in quart of whiter wine-vinegar keeping it continually ftirring and when you perceive it to boil add little tartar broken and continuing flill to fiir it till you find the liquor of fuch colour as you would have it that is till it is of fine tranfparent greeff with bluish caft which you may know by dip- ping in bit of white paper then pour it through linnen-cloth into an open veffel and fet it to cool and when it is quite cold bottle it up for afe remember to cork the bottle clofe for being exposed to the air it will dry however it may be reduced again by common water this liquor should be touched upon part of the lights and shades of print and the shades afterwards coloured with sap-green in the making of this green remember that it be ftrong enough becaufe it can not be ftrengthen- ed afterwards without the trouble of boiling it afreth but may at any time be rendered as faiit as you pleafe by rhixing common water with it sap-green is colour like that of an oak- leaf if it be uled thin with common water for this as well as the former wants no gum but if it be ufed flrong it will produce as dark green as any it will be proper to try the colour firft upon white dutch tile and by thinning it with water you may render it of what ftrength you pleafe and may brighten it very much by the ddition of very little verdegreafe there nere ae twe ways of making sap-green viz cake the flowers of biuc flag-iris or flow- or de luce and press them while there is any since to be got fom them boil this genly in glazed pipkin till it grows thick adding latle alum to it and it will make very ufeful and laking green vou muft obterve this that in the boiling of any juice coc of the colours before mentioned you should always do it in an earthen pipkin for if it be boiled in veffels of metal they will often- times change it from the colour intended the second way to make sap-green for the wathing and illuminating of prints is to take the juice of buckthorn-berries and tho that juice simply will yield only dark purple of very bafe hue yet either of thefe colours will mix with the liquid verdegreafe above mentioned and will make delicate shade for it there is befides thefe another green which is admired by some perfons that carries good body with it and degree of tranfparency too as it may be made but as it is commonly ufed colour of full body and fit only for painting in miniature this is made by mixing duich pink with indigo to what degree of colour you pleafe but the high preparation of french-berries with indigo is much to be preferred to dutch pink especially as this anfwers all the intentions of dutch pink and carries tranfparency with it which the dutch pink has not chap .. xi the use and nature of dry colours dlue-bice is the moft excellent blue next id to ultramarine which is too good to wath withal wherefore we leave it out here becaute blue-bice may do very well inftead of it and in- deed both may be left out fince smalt may be ufed inftead of them however it will not work to well as blue-bice which without doubt is too good to ufe upon all occafions only when you in- tend to beftow fome coff and pains upon your work otherwife you may ufe no other blue in your piece than blue-verditer with which you may make very good shift without any other blue that is in any ordinary work indigo is dark blue that is ufed principally to shade with upon other blues indigo and yellow berries mixed together make dark green to shade other greens in the darkeft places blue-verditer is very bright pleafant blue and the cafieft to work in water it is fomewhat inclining to green and being mixed with yellow berries it makes very good green this is the blue moft ufed verdegreafe is good green but subject to decay when it is dry upon the paper it will be of lighter colour than it was when firft laid on therefore to preferve it from that fault put some sap-green among it to diffolve in it which will make it keep its colour there is diftilled verdegreate to be bought at the shops that is far better green than the other but it is fome- what dearer and the other may ferve inflead of it verditer-green is light colour feldom ufed in any thing but in colouring landlkips and those places that should appear afar off and it is good for fuch purpofe becaufe it is fomewhat inclining to blue but you may make shift to do any thing well enough without it for little blue-verditer mixed with copper-green and little white make juft fuch another green sap-green is dark dirty green and never ufed but to fhadow other greens in the darkeft places or elfe to lay upon some dark ground be- hind picture which requires to be coloured with dark green but you may do without this green for indigo and yellow berries make juft such another colour copper-green is an excellent tranfparent green of fhining nature if it is thickened in the sun or upon genle fire and it is the moft used of any green in wathing especially in colour- ing of the grass ground or trees for it is al- moft grats-green vermillion is the moft perfect scarlet-colour you need not either grind or wash it being fine enough iffelf only temper it with your finger in gallipot or oyfter-fhell with cum-water and it will be ready to ufe if you put little berries among it it will make the brighter colour this is principally ufed for garments lake is an excellent crimfon-colour with which you may fhade vermillion or your yellow garments in the darkeff places and being mix- ed with white you may make sky-colour with it or fleth-colour by mixing white and red lead with it and it is an excellent co- four of itfelf for colouring garments of the like indian lake is the beft lake but it is too good to be ufed in wathing prints with unless you intend to beftow great curiofity upon your work for the beft sort of ordinary lake will ferve well enough for ordinary ufes and this allo will be fomewhat too coftly therefore inflead thereof you may ufe red ink thickened upon the fire which may ferve your purpofe very well better even than lake unless it is very good obferve that if you would make light sky- colour of your red ink or if you would mix it among your fleth-colour you muft not thicken it but hade your vermillion rather with spanifh- brown than thick red ink as it may ferve very well for that purpofe but is not altogether fuch bright and clear colour red-lead is the neareft to an orange-co- lour and putting little yellow berries into fome of it will make perfect orange-colour but if you defire to make fleth colour of it you muft put no yellow in it this colour is ufed in co- louring buildings or highways in landskips after being mixed with little white befides this is the only bright colour to fhade yellow garments with in order to make them look like change= able taffecy it is good allo to colour any light ground in picture taking only the thin water of it and to for feveral other ufes as you shalf fee occafion yellow berries are moft ufed in wathing of all other colours they are bright and trantpa- rent fit for all ufes and will be fufficient without the ufe of any other yellow saffron is deep yellow if you let it fland good while it is of ufe principally to fhade yellow berries with inflead of red lead and it is fomewhat of brighter shadow but you may make shift well enough without this colour for red lead and yellow berries make juft fuch another colour mafficote is light yellow juft like yellow berries and white and therefore you may do well enough without it only for faving you the labour to mix your yellow berries with white when you have occafion for light yellow then you may make ufe of it to colour light ground in pic- ture in which cafe fhadow it with the water of burnt umber or red lead that is the thin- neft part of the colour cerus is the beft white if it be good and im anely ground or for want of it white lead picked either of thefe will ferve well enough for either of them being mingled with another co- four will make it lighter and the more to in pro- portion to the quantity of either mixed with it spanish-brown is dirty brown colour and of no great ufe to colour any garment with unless it be an old man ’ gown or to shade vermillion or lay upon any dark ground behind picture or elle to fhade yellow berries in the darkeff places when you want lake or thin red ink it is the beft and brighteft colour when it is burnt in the fire till it be red-hot though if you would colour hlare horfe dog or the like you ms it not burn it but for other ufes it is beft when burnt for inftance to colour any wooden poft bodies of trees or any thing elfe of wood or any dark ground in picture it is not to be uted about any garments unless you would co- lour number of old men ’ gowns or caps flanding together on account they muft not be all of one colour therefore for diftinction and variety ’ sake you may ufe umber unburnt for some of them printer black is moft ufed becaute it is eafieff to be had and ferves very well in wathing you muft observe that you are not to put any black among your colours to make them dark becaufe it will make them dircy neither should you fhade any co. our with black unleis it be spaniffi- browny when you would-colour an off man crown or the like that requiresso be dome mt ofa fad colour ivory burnt or inftead of that burnt bone is the beft black and is thus made take ivory or

water- then pafting it through fine sieve or piece of muflin bottle it for ufe and as you have oc- cafion to ufe it pour out little at time re- membering to keep it clear for if it should prove dirty or foul it will spoil your colours by add- ing little coloquintida to the solurion of the gum toc it will prevent the flies from spoiling your work if it should chance to be expoted or cum-water may be made thus pour quart of pure spring-water into jar-glats and haning in it tied up in fine woolen rag suficient quantity of pure white gum-arabic bruifed let it hang till the gumis diffolved then putting your fingers into the water if you find them stick together as if they were glued your water istoo ftrong or full of the gum and there- fore you muft put more fair water to it and if you find it too weak you muft put in it more cum adding if there is any occafion for it the coloquintida as before with this water moft of the colours are to be tempered and with to much of it as that being touched when dry the colour will not come off it is to be observed that if the colour gliffers there is too much gum in it to make alum-water boil four ounces of alum in pint of fair wa- ter till the alum is diffolved or thus to two quarts of springor well-water put half pound of powdered roch-alum diffelving it well by boiling then filtering it through brown papers keep it up for ufe wet your paper with this water before you lay on any of your colours and it will prevent them from finking in and will befides add luftre and beauty to the colour laid on but you muft take notice that if the paper is not good it muft be wathed over four or five times with large brush or pencil remember alfo that alum taifes flanding colours and preferves them from fading if you defign to varnith your prints after they are coloured then wath them all over equally with white starch before you colour them and that being dry lay on your colours to make lime-water take some unllacked lime and covering it an inch over with fair water and to letting it re main for twelve hours pour off the clear part of the water and keep it for ufe by wathing with this water you may change your sap-green into blue
