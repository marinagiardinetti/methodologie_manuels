of his cotemporaries and coun- trymen of the fame prefeffion it was the duke of buckingham that recommended him to the governor of the netherlands as proper perfon to refide at the court of england as the king of spain minif- ter and it was here that he performed feveral of his beft pieces and acquired the character of statefman which no doubt was confiderable ad- vantage to his reputation as

the earth have any of its acrial character except fmooth waters and poliffd bodies which are lufceptible of the oppofite colours as well celeftial as terref- trial the clouds should be well chofen well touch ’ and well plac ’ the the art of painting perspective should be very regular and yet with feeming negligence in colouring which comprehends two things the local colour and the claro obfcuro the paint- or should inform himfelf very well of both the one and the other this only will diftinguith him from thofe artifts who underfland meafure and proportion as well as he and this will render him the more faithful and more perfect imitator of bature the local colour is nothing elfe but that which is natural to each object in whatever place tis found which diftinguithes it from others and which perfectly marks its character the claro obfcuro is the art of diftributing lights and fhadows advantageoully as well on par- ticular objects as on picture in general on par- ticular objects to give them convenient relievo and roundnels and in the picture in general to expofe the objects with pleafure to the view of the spectarors by giving the eye an occation to reft which is done by an ingenious diftribution of great lights and great fhadows which lend each other murual affiftance by their oppofition thus great lights are repofe for great fhadows as great tha- dows are for great lights tho as has been faid the claro obfcuro comprehends the art of placing all lights and fhadows well yet tis more particu- larly underftood to be the knowledge of rightly difpoting great lights and great thadows their distribution in this laft fenfe may be made four ways firtt by the natural fhadows of the body secondly by croupes that is by dif- pofing the objects in fuch manner that the lights may be join ’ all rogether and the fhadows the same as one may imperfectly perceive in grape whofe grains on the fide of the light make mats of brightness and on the oppofite fide mats of art of paintin darkness yet all together form but one groupe and are as one object this muft be done fo arti- ficially that no affectation may appear in it the objects muft feem fo fituated naturally and as by chance thirdly by the accidents of suppoted light and fourthly by the nature and the body of the colours which the painter may give to his objects without altering their character this part of painting is the beft and fureft way for painter to add force to his works and to render his objects as well in general as in particular don find that the way of the claro obfcuro was known in the roman school before polidoro da caravagios time who difcovered it and made it one of the principles of the art of painting and wonder the painters who came after him did not perceive that the great effect of his works on the spectators proceeded from the reft which he gave the fight in grouping his lights on one fide and his shadows on another which he did only by the knowledge of the claro obfcuro wonder fay how they could let fo neceffary part of their art elcape without taking notice of it however the claro obfcuro is to be found among fome of the roman painters yet tis not to be efteemed as any thing more than happy effect of genius or chance and not as proceeding from an eftablifh ’ principle of the art andrew bofcoli florentine painter had right notion of the claro obicuro as may be feen by his works but the re-eftablishment of this principle is owing to giorgione whofe competitor titian perceiving it made ufe of it ever after in flanders otho veniuslaid it down as funda= mental in painting and communicated it to rubens his pupil the latter rendered it more fenfible to the spectator and shew ’ the neceffity of it fo ap- arenily that the beft flemish painters follow ’ him in the art of paintin in it and have recommended their paintings by this part of perfection for without it all the care they have taken to imitate the particular objects of nature with the utmoft faithfulness had not been worth our confideration in the distribution of colours there ought to be an agreement or harmony which has the fome effect on the eye as mufick has on the ear if there are feveral groupes of the claro obfcuro in picture one of them should be more fenfible than the reft and be predominant over the others that there may be unity of object as in the compofi- tion there should be unity of fubject the pencilling if poffible muft be bold and light but whether it feems all of piece like that of corregio or unequal and uneven like that of rembrant it ought always to be foft and caty if painter be forc ’ to make ufe of the licen- ces they should be imperceptible judicious ad- vantageous and juftifiable the three firft forts belong to the painter art and the laft to hiftory whatever painter is mafter of his art in all the parts we have mentioned he may depend upon it he is arrived to great degree of perfection and pictures will infallibly be fine yet not enturely perfect if beauty be not accompanied with grace grace muft feafon the parts we have fpoken of and every where follow genius grace fupports and perfects it but it is not to be fo thoroughly acquired as by any rules to be demonftrated painter has it from nature only and does not know that he has it nor in what degree nor how he communicates it to his works it furprifes the spectator who feels the effect without penetrating into the true caufe of it but this grace does not rouch him otherwife than according to the difpo- lition aet of painting wherein he finds it we may define it thus se tis what pleafes and gains the heart without concerning itfelf with the underitanding grace and beauty are two different things beauty pleafes by the rules only and grace without them what beautiful is not always graceful but grace join with beauty is the heighth of perfection we have given this idea of perfect painter in as few words as we could that we might not be tedious to thofe who are in no doubt about the things it contains but for thofe that defire proofs of it we have endeavoured to fatisfy them in the following remarks in which both the one and the other will find we have treated of fuch things as naturally prefented themfelves to us and perhaps will not be indifferent to them the following remarks anfwer in chapters to the feveral parts of the idea of perfect painter of which we have spoken in the foreroing treatife and the reader in all the chanters should by his nemory lupply the parts where we have treated of them to explain them dnsi ie it art of pain nc hap remarks and instructions on the preceding ide of gen in vain for men to endeavour with all their might to reach the point of perfection in the art of painting or any other art if they are not born with particular talent for the fcience they profefs they will always be uncertain of at- taining the end they propofe to themfelves rules and examples may shew them the means of reach- ing it but that is not fufficient if thefe examples and rules are not eafy and agreeable to them they will never be fure this facility is only found in thofe who before they learn the rules of art or fee the works of other men have confulted their own inclination and examin ’ whether they were put upon the choice of their profeffion by fome inward light which is indeed genius and is what guides them by the neareft and eafieft way to perfection render- ing them infallibly hap both in the means and in the end genius therefore is that light of the mind which conducts us to the end by the moft eafy means prefent which nature makes to man at the hour of his birth and tho the commonly gives it for one thing only the is fometimes fo liberal as to make it general in one perfon there have been feveral men on whom the has beftowed this pleni- tude of influences who have with eafe perform ’ wwhat- art of painting they attempted and always fucceeded in what they undercook particular genius tis true does not extend its force to all forts of knowledge as general one does but then it penetrates far- ther into that over which tis predominant painter in the firft place should have ge nius but that genius muft be corrected by rules reflection and induftry he muft have seen much read much and ftudy ’ much to direct his genius that it may produce things worthy pofterity but fince he can not fee or fludy every thing he would defire to know in the way to the perfection he aims at he may without fcruple make ufe of and ther man udies ap ii that man may without scruple make use of anotber mans studies impoftible for painter to reprefent well not only all the objects he has not feen but alfo thofe he has not defign ’ if he has not feen alion he can never paint one and if he has seen one he will always paint it imperfectly unless he firft defigns it after nature or after another man' wotks for this reafon we ought not to blame painter who having never feen or fludy ’ the object he is to reprefent makes ufe of another man htudies ra- ther than draw fomething falfe out of his own head tis neceffary he should have his examples in his memory or his table-book his own fay of thofe of another man when painter has furnish ’ his mind with ima- ges of the beautiful things he has feen he adds to of the art of painting i diminithes them according to his gout or as his judgment directs this change arifes by compa- ring the ideas of what he has feen one with the other and chufing that which he thinks beft for example raphael in his youth while he lived with his mafter perugino had only the ideas of the works of that painter in his mind but afterwards com- paring them with thofe of michael angelo and with the annque he chofe that which feem ’ beft to him and our of it form ’

the works of another if painter has neither time nor opportunity to fee nature yet has fine genius he may fludy af- ter the pictures the defigns and the prints of thofe mafters who knew how to choofe their subjects well and to draw them with judgment he who would draw landlkip and never faw or never made fufficient observations on the countries proper to be painted for the oddness or agreeable- nets of the prospect will do well to make his ad- vantage the art of paint in of the works of thofe who have ftudy ’ thofe countries or who in their landskips have reprefented the extraordinary effects of nature he may look on the productions of thofe able painters as fafely as on nature herfelf and by them affift his invention in fome future production to ftudy at firft the works of the beft mafters will be two ways ufeful to him one is he will fee nature free from many things which man is oblig ’ to throw afide when he copies after her the other is he will by this method learn to make good choice of nature to take nothing from her that is not beauti- ful and to mend what defective in her thus genius well regulated and fupported by the theory of an art not only makes ufe of its own audies but alfo turns thofe of other men to its own advantage leonardo da vinci writes that the fpots which are to be feen on an old wall forming confus' ideas of different objects may excite genius and help it to produce fomething some perfons fancy this affertion is an injury to genius without giving any good reafons for their objecting to it for tis certain that on fuch wall or fome other fuch like potted things theres not only room to form out of it ideas in general but each painter may con- ceive different ideas according to the difference of his genius and that which is feen in confus ’ manner only may produce fomething clear and form an image in the mind of the artift who fees it according to his particular tafte by this means one man shall fee fine and rich compofition be- caufe his genius is fruitful and his taffe good and another on the contrary shall fee nothing but what is poor and of an ill tafte becaufe his ge- nius is barren and his tafte bad let the minds of the painters be of what cha- racter they will each may difcover enough in such tbe art of painting an object to excite his imagination and help him to produce fomething of his own the imagi- nation growing warm by degrees becomes at last capable by the fight of few figures to conceive great number and to enrichthe fcene of his subject with certain objects of his own thus he may as it were beget extraordinary ideas which otherwife he had never thought of we have thewn that the faying of lconardo da vinci concerning genius does it no injury on the contrary that tis often of great service to it as well to thofe who have much as to thofe who have little of it shall only add to what he faid that the more man has of genius the more things he will perceive in thofe forts of pots or confus ’

which may be confidered two ways when the acts of herfelf or by habit to pleafe others the actions that are purely natural are thofe which men would do if from their infancy they had been left to themfelves and the actions which are the product of habit and education are fuch as men do by the inftruction or example of others of the lat terkind there are as many different forts as there are nations and they are to mingled with the ac- tions purely natural that in my opinion tis very hard to difcern the difference pet this is what the painter ought to aim at for he muft often treat of subjects aet of paint ing subjects where he ought to co pure nature in the whole or in part and tis neceffary there to know the different actions in which nature is fet out by the chief nations of the world but becaufe the differences of them proceeds from affectation veil which difguifes truth it should be the ftudy of painter to diftinguith one from the other and to know wherein the fidelity the beauty and the fim- plicity of nature confifts whole graces are all owing to her purity vifible the ancient fculptors fought after this natural fimplicity and that raphael borrow ’ from them thofe

this reafon tis said that in the arts we are always learning by experience and reflection we are continually difco- vering fomething new in the effects of nature which are without number and always

are few who are able to difcern all the delicacy that is to be found in the ancient fculptures becaufe to do it the artifts should have mind art of paintinc mind proportionable to thofe of the fculptors that made them they should have fublime gufto quick conception and an exact and lively per- formance they gave their figures proportions conformable to their character and defign ’ their divinities by contours more eafy more elegant and with greater gour than thofe of ordinary men they made refin ’ choice of beautiful nature and found out excellent remedies for the impotence of the maiter they work ’ with hindring them to imitate all things painter therefore can not do better than en- deavour to find out the excellence of thefe pieces that he may know the purity of nature the better and defign the more learnedly and the more ele- gantly neverthelefs fince there are in fculpture feveral things that do not agree with painting and fince the painter has befides the means to imitate nature more perfectly he ought to regard the antique as book which is to be tranflated into another language wherein tis fufficient he keeps to the fenfe and meaning of the author without tying himself fervilely to his words li ch vi of the grand gusto has been thewn by the definition have given of the grand guito as it relates to the works of the painters that tis not to be accommodated to ordinary things mediocrity is not allowable but in the arts which are neceffary for common ufe and by no means in thofe that are invented only for ornament and pleafure wherefore in painting there mult the art of painting be fomething great and extraordinary to fur- prife pleafe and instruct which is what we call the tis by this that ordinary things are grand guito made beautiful and the beautiful fublime and wonderful for in painting the grand gulto the sublime and the marvelous are one and the fame thing language indeed is wanting but every thing peaks in good picture ap vii of the essence of painting have faid that painting is an art which by means of defign and colours imitates all vifible objects on flat fuperficies tis thus or very near it that all who have fpoken of this art have defined it and no body has yer had any thing to fay againft the definition it contains three parts compofition defign and colouring which are the effence of painting as the body the foul and reafon are that of man and as man by thefe three parts of him only thews feveral pro pricties and agreements that are not part of his ef- fence but the ornament for example the fciences and virtues fo tis only by the effential parts of his art that painter thews an infinity of things which heighten the worth of his pietures tho they are not of the effence of painting such are the proprieties of instructing and diverting upon which one may alk this confiderable question ch the art of pai nc viii whether truth history be efential in paintings plain that compofition which is an effen- tial part of painting comprehends the ob- jects that are to be met with in hiftory of which truth is the effence and by confequence this fide- lity ought to be effential in painting and the painter on all occafions oblig ’ to conform him- felf thereto to this it has been antwer ’ that if truth of hiffory be effential in painting there could be no picture in which it should not be found whereas there are feveral which reprefent no hiftory at all fuch as allegorical pictures landskips beafts fith fruits ffowers and feveral other things which are the pure effect of the painter fancy norwith- standing all this tis certainly true that the painter ought to observe an exact fidelity in the hiftory he reprefents and that by curious fearch after the circumftances which accompany it he should en- creafe the beauty and the value of his picture yet this is not an obligation on him which is of the effence of painting tis only an indifpentible decency as virtue and fcience are in man thus as man is man ftill let him be never fo vicious and igno- rant to painter is still painter tho he be igno- rant of hiftory yet as the virtues and fciences are the ornaments of man to tis undeniably true that all the works of the painters wherein hifto- rical subjects are reprefented are to much the more valuable by how much the more the truth of hiffory is preferv ’ fuppoling that there is nothing art of paintin as to the imitation of nature which is ef fential in painting painter may be very fkilful in his art and yet know nothing of hiftory there are almoft as many inftances of this as there are pictures of ti tian paolo veronefe tintoret the balfans and feveral other venetians whofe chiefeft care was about the effence of their art that is in the imita- tion of nature and who very little apply ’ them felves to things that might or might not be with- our altering its effence tis in this fenfe the curi- ous judge of the pictures of the painters have men- tion ’ or they would not buy them by their weight in gold nor would their works be otherwife among thofe that have the firft place in their cabinets and yet tis not to be difputed but that if this effence of the art in the pictures of the venetian painters had been accompany ’ with thofe orna- ments that certainly render fuch things more valu- able mean the truth of hiftory and chronology they would have been much more eftimable even than they are now we muft however confels by this effence only that the painters ought to instruct us and that we ought to prefer the imita- tion of nature in their pieces to all other excellencies whatfoever if they instruct us to much the ber- ter if they don we shall sill have the pleafure of viewing kind of creation that will both divert and rove iis when would learn hiffory would not go to painter for it he is an hifforian meerly by acci dent would read thofe books that treat of it exprefly and inform myfelf by thofe whofe effen- tial dury it is not only to relace events but to do it truly neverthelefs after all have said on this subject will not pretend to excufe painter where he thews himfelf bad hiftorian for man is always blame the art of painting in ill performing what he undertakes if painter is about to treat of an hifforical subject and knows nothing of the objects which should be part of his compofition to render it true he ought carefully to inform himself either by books or from men of learning and if he is negligent in this matter he is without doubt inexcufable except fuch as have painted pieces of devotion where they have incroduced famts of different ages and countries not out of choice but out of forced complaifance for the perfons that fet them to work whofe weakness incapacitated them to reflect on thofe additional things that might con- tribute to the ornament of painting invention which is an effential part of painting confifts folely in finding out objects proper to enter into the compofition of picture as the painter' imagination guides him whether in things true or falfe fabulous or hiftorical suppofe then painter should imagine alexander the great was dreft as we dress at this day and should reprefent that con- queror with hat and perriwig he would doubt- lets do very ridiculous thing and be guilty of an unpardonable error but his crime would be againft the truth of hiftory and not against painting if the reft of the things he painted were according to the rules of art burtho nature is the effence of painting and hi- rory only an accident yet this accident is not lefs worthy of the painter confideration than the ef- fence in cafe he would pleafe every body especially the men of letters and fuch as judge of picture more by their underftanding than their eyes and whofe opinion it is that

who have clear idea of painting even among the painters themfelves feveral of whom place the whole ef- fence of their art in defign and others think tis in the colouring only the greater part of thofe bred to the profeffion of learning have no notion of painting but as it relates to the invention of the painter whofe fancy is the chief thing they look on they examipe this invention narrowly they diffect it and as it appears more or lefs ingenious they praife or difpraife the picture without confidering the effect or to what degree of perfection the painter has carry ’ his imi- tation of nature in this fenfe it was that saint auftin faid ce the knowledge of painting and the cc fable is fuperfluous and at the same time the holy father commends the profane sciences in vain did titian giergione and paolo ve- ronefe exert themfelves to excel in the effence of their art the imitation of nature in vain were they at fo much pains to imitate her to per fectly as they did and the critics have in vain regarded their pieces as the moft perfect copies of nature if that is not in the firft place to be con- fidered they gave themfelves the trouble of painting to no purpofe fince correct prints would juffice to exercife the judgment of fuch crities and fill up the extent of their knowledge to return to saint auttin if he had had true idea of painting as it is only an imitation of

entirely unknown to them and in both the colouring of objects in particular which we call the local colour and in the knowledge of the claro obicuro they were abfolutely ignorant and knew nothing at all of the harmony of them both together they made ufe of colours tis true but the way they took was trivial and did not help them to much to reprefent the truth of objects as to call them to our remembrance they were bred up in fuch ignorance of colour- ing as to have no conception of the power of that charming part of their art nor to what degree of height ir could raife their works they took their matters words which were oracles to them and having as they thought nothing to do put to tread of ai the art finc in the paths in which they led them all their hudy was about invention and defign at laft after feveral years the good genius of painting rais ’ up fome great men in tulcany and the dutchy of urbin who by the goodness of their talent the folidiry of their underftanding and the affiduity of their fudies elevated the ideas of the knowledge which they learnt of their mafters and produced fome things to perfect that they will al- ways be the admiration of pofterity thofe to whom we owe this perfection moft are lconardo da vinci michael angelo and raphael but the latter who excell ’ all of them acquired fo many parts of his art and carried them to to high degree that the great praifes which have been given him have made it to be believ ’ he was wanting in nothing and have in his perfon center ’ all the perfection of painting it being neceffary in this art to begin with de- lign and certain that the fource of good talte and correctnels is to be found in the ancient fculp- cures and the works of raphael who took out of them what was moft valuable moft of the young painters in fucceeding times never fail ’ going to rome to ftudy and continue fo to do now -days from whence they bring the general efteem of thofe pieces which are admird there and tranfmit it to all that hear them thus great number of the curious have preferved on the faith of others or the authority of authors the firft idea which made an impreftion on their minds to wit thar all the perfection of painting is to be found in the works of raphael the roman painters have alfo for the moft part remain ’ of this opinion and have infinuared it into ftrangers either out of love they bore their country or out of neglect of colouring which they never underftood well or that they preferr ’ the other art of .aiw ting parts of painting before atx which being many in number took up their whole lives to rudy- and acquire wi tat for thefe reafons therefore they minded nothing but what depends on invention and defign and raphael invented very ingeniouly though he delign ’ moft corectly and elegantly though he expreft the paftions of the mind with infinite ferce and grace thoughhedrew his subjects with all poffible decorum and nobleness and no painter has disputed with him the advantage of fuperiority in the multi- tude of the parts of his art which he was mafter of tis however undeniable that he did not penetrate far enough into colouring to render the objects very true or very fentible nor to give an idea of per- feet imitation and yet this perfect imitation and tenfation make the effence of painting as have prov ’ tis compos ’ of defign and co- louring and if raphael and the painters of his time had but an imperfect notion of the latter the idea of the effence of painting which is produced by their works muft neceffarily be imperfect as well as that which has been introduced into the minds of tome perfons fince thofe days otherwife of good judgment works of titian and thofe other painters who have thewn their thoughts with the advantage of faithful imitation ought one would think to have deftroy ’ thofe evil remainders which we are ipeaking of and have fettled the ideas of the art as nature and reafon require from an underftanding that is juft but the youth of the fucceeding times fince raphael going from rome to venice preju- diced in their fight and their judgment and feldom staying there long fee as it were en paffant the beautiful pieces that might give them juft idea and are very far from contracting good habit of colouring which would make their hudies at rome more art of .ain tin fa valuable and render them without reproach hirall the parts of their profettion but what is moft aftonifhing is that fome cer- tain curious perfons who have the remainders of this falfe idea and are themfelves charmed with the venetian paintings buy them up with good reafon at high prices though thofe pictures have almoff no other merit than their colouring one part of the effence of painting which have here eftablith ’ cim ch ap ai tbe rt part tinc we have only us ’ the word invention to fignity the firft part of painting several confounded it with genins others with fruitfulness of thought others with the dispofition of objects but all thefe things are different from one another wherefore am of opinion that to give clear idea of painting it should be call ’ compofition divided into two parts invention and difpolition invention only finds out objects for difposition places them -right tis true thefe two parts are different and yet they have fuch relation to each other that they may be com- prehended under the fame name invention is form ’ by reading hiftory and the fable tis the pure effect of the imagination in metaphorical subjects it contributes to the truth of hiftory as well as to the clearnels of allegories and in what

fort of affectation the folds should fall about the members as by chance they should leave enough of them naked to thew what they are and by careful artifice contraft them in showing them and if may fo express it carels them by their tender windings and foft touches the ancient fculptors who had not the ufe of different colours becaufe they work ’ the fame thing on the fame matter have avoided the large preading of the folds left furrounding the mem- bers they should attract the eye and hinder their feeing the naked of the figures with as much eafe as they would have had them for their

the mem- bers it furrounds themore fenfible they have com- monly obferv ’ this merhod in their baffo relievo and which way foever they managed their drape- ries they placed their folds in wonderful order the painter who by the diverfity of his colours and lights should diftinguith the members from the draperies may govern himfelf by the good order of the antique folds without imitating their num- ber and may vary his ftuff according to the cha- ratter of his figures thofe painters who did not know the art of ir inc. what liberties they were allow ’ in this mat- ter have been as much in the wrong in copying the ancient fculptures as the modern fculptors have been in imitating the painters the reafon why the folds ought to difcover where the limbs of apicture are is becaufe painting is on flat fuperficies and he muft annihilate fome things by deceiving the fight and leave nothing equivocal to be feen in his piece wherefore the painter is oblig ’ to obferve this order in all his dra- peries of what nature foever either coarfe or fine rough or plain and he muft always prefer the ma- jelty of the folds to the richness of the stuff which muft be fuiced to the age and fathions of the hiftory that is reprefented as the painter ought to avoid all manner of ftiff- nets and hardness in his folds and be careful that they don ’ fmell of the lay-man as we commonly fay fo he should alto ufe his flying draperies with difcretion for they canonly be agitated by the wind in place where one may reafonably fuppofe it blows or by the compreftion of the air when figure is fuppos ’ to be

thing without perspective in all his operations and that he does not draw line nor ftrike flroke with his pencil which has not share of this in it at leaft habitually it regulates the meafure of forms and the gradation of colours in all places of the picture the painter is forced to know the neceffity of it and tho his practice of it is or should be confum- mate yet he will often be expofed to make

vermilion fearf on blue drapery as well to loofen her from his ground which was blue fea as be- caufe the was one of the principal figures of his lub- ject upon which he defired to attract the eye paolo veronefe in his marriage of cald becaute chrift who is the principal figure of the subject is carry ’ fomewhat into the depth of the picture and that he could not make him be taken notice of by the brillant of the claro obfcuro has dreft him in blue and vermilion thereby to conduct the light to that figure ch ap xxi the pencil he term pencil is fometimes taken for all the parts of painting as when we fay that raphael transfiguration is the finelt picture that ever came from his pencil and fomerimes tis to be underftood of the work irfelf for example when we fay of all the painters of antiquity apelles pencil was the moft learned in this place the word pencil fignifies fimply the exterior manner he obferved in employing his colours when thofe colours don' seem too much agitated or as one may fay too much formented by the motion of heavy hand d the art of paint ing but on the contrary when the movement appears free ready and light we fay the piece is of good pencil yet this freedom of the pencil is of little worth if tis not guided by the head and if it does not ferve to thew us that the painter underftands his art in word fine pencil in painting is like fine voice in mufic both the one and the other are valued according to the proportion of the great effect and the harmony that accompanies them ch xxii of the licences toahe licences are fo neceffary that all ares admit of them they are literally againft the rules but when we come to explain ourfelves we shall shew they affift them if they are made ufe of propos every man of fenfe thinks they are to the purpofe when the piece in which they are employ ’ has the greater effect by them and when by their means the painter reaches the end he aims at which is to impofe on the fight but tis not every painter that can make an advantageous ufe of them there are none but great genuiss who are above rules and who know when to make ufe ingeniouly of the licences either in the effence of the art or in hiftory the latter is the more diffi- cult work and requires our attention we shall speak further of it in the following chapter the art of painti xxiii by what authorit the painters bave repre- fented under buman figures things divine spiritual and inanimate ipture tells us in feveral places of god ap- pearing to man either by the miniftry of his angels or in dreams and vifions there is fine delcription of god under the form of an old man in the feventh chapter of daniel and the ninth verfe the fame holy writ informs us of feveral apparitions of angels under human forms for this reafon the church in the council of nice made no fcruple to allow painters to reprefent god the father under the figure of venerable old man and angels under human figures painters are alfo juftify ’ on the fame account to give life to inanimate things when they follow exactly the idea the fcripture gives us of them the spectator should not prefently be fcandaliz ’ if he fees facred things mixt with poetical fictions as if fiction and poetry were indifpentibly profane the book of job the plalms of david the apocalyple are all poetical and full of figurative expreftions without reckoning all the parables which are in the other parts of the cripture iwas in copying the facred text that raphael painting the paffage of jordan gave that river human figure and drew him puthing back his waters to their fource he was warranted to do this by holy writ which to pro- portion its expreffions to man underftanding often reprefents divine things in the shape of human and for the instruction of the faithful makes ufe of the moft palpable and fenfible comparifons and ideas we have paffage relating to the subject of the art of paintin rivers in the pfalm where it is faid ce let co the floods clap their hands letthe hills be joyful ce together the painter who has the fame inten- tion to instruct and to edify can not follow ber- ter pattern pouffin in his picture of the finding of mofes has obferved the same conduct in reprefenting the river nile for which he has been blamed by some perfons who alledge thefe reafons againtt him they fay that painters should not mingle falfe gods with things relating to our religion that rivers are falfe divinities whom the hleathens worthiped and whom we ought not to introduce in facred hiftory and further that painter may well enough repre- fent river as river but not do it under hu- man figure to all this one may eafily antwer that as the holy fcripture when it introduces rivers under human figures had no intention to speak of thote the pagans adored and tho it might have exprets ’ itfelf fimply and naturally yet it makes ufe of figurative ftile without fearing to feduce the faithful to alfo chriftian painter who ought to imitate the fcripture is very far from endea- youring to alter the truth of hiftory he rather strives conforming himfelf to his original to thew it more livelily and elegantly not to an infidel but to chriftian as he is who being prejudiced againft the falfe divinities ought not to find out another meaning than that of the holy scripture but with respect to pagan divinities which are introduced as fuch and with the characters that thew what they are tis more difficult to admit them in fuch kind of compofitions the learned have handled that matter by its relation to poefy and the caufe remains still to be decided however the painter who has no other way to express him- pfal xcvil art of painting than by thefe forts of figures inttead of being blamed will always be commended by the beft judges when they find them brought in prudently and ingenioutly for the falfe divinities may be confider ’ two ways either as gods or as fymbo- lical figures as gods the painter muft never re- prefent them except it is in subjects entirely pro- fane and as fyribolical figures he may incroduce them with difcretion on all occafions where he thinks them neceffary rubens who of all painters mmade ufe of thefe fymbols the moft ingenioully and the moft learn- edly as may be feen in the book of the cardinal infant entrance into antwerp and by the pictures of the gallery of raixemburg has been cenfured for if he should not fay they have brought allego- rical figures into his compofitions nor have mixed table with truth fs to which we may antwers tuai as rubens has managed it he has not confounded fable with truch he rather has employ ’ the fymbols of the fable to exprets the fame truch in the picture of the birth of lewis xliith on the top of it in clouds at diftance he has reprefented caffor on his winged horfe and on the fide apollo in his chariot mount- ingon high to thew that the prince was born in the thorning and that his mother ’ delivery was happy from whence we may infer that the painter had thoughts of reprefenting the gods as gods but caftor only as conftellation that render ’ events fortunate and the chariot of apollo mounting up- wards to mark the time of the morning if the painter with an intention to express himfelf the better has thought it neceffary or convenient to reprefent the diviniries of the fable among hifto- rical figures thofe fymbols muft be look ’ upon as invifible and as not there any otherwife than by their fighification d art of painting in this fenfe the fecond council of nice authoriz ’ in what they did by the scripture allowed the reprefentations of god the father and the angels under human figures for there would have been greater inconvenience in painting the perfons of the holy trinity and the angels than in introducing pagan divinities in picture if the fenfe that the former should be taken in were pot explain ’ chriltians being fufficiently prepoffeft againft thefe falfe appearances which are intended only for their instruction to profit by them should have the fame notion of them as the painter and look upon them a not there the authority for painting the angels with wings is taken from the ark of the covenant and from the chapter of daniel the verfe however thefe paftages do not indifpenfibly oblige paintersto draw angels always with wings they may do it or not do it as their art good fenfe and the inftruc- tion of the faithful require the reader will easity perceive tis papift that argues thus for the idolatrous cuftom of representing the boly trinity and the angels under buman figures be argument is so mean it deserves no answer and the per- on so weak it needs no antidote or we might quote against him the verse of the pfalm the same be has quoted above where are these words ce confounded be all they that ferve graven ima- cc

commonly feek after oc- cafions to thew the naked to gain efteem and di- ainction for which they are certainly praife-worthy provided they keep themfelves within the bounds of the truth of hiftory of verifimility and modetty there are some subjects in which man may more reafonably reprefent nakedness than in others as for example in tables when the fcene lies in hot coun- tries and we know nothing of the modes of the people or when the labourers of the firft ages are reprefented cato the cenfor as plutarch relates worked naked among his labourers when he came from the fenate and st peter was naked when our saviour appeared to him after his refurrection and found him fithing with the other apoftles nakednets may alfo be made ufe of in the reprefentation of allegorical subjects the pagan gods or hero in thort on all occafions where we may fuppofe we look upon fimple nature where cold or impudence is not predominant for clothes were only invented to keep men from cold and fhame there are at this day great many people in feveral parts of the world who go ftark naked either becaufe they dwell in hot countries or that cuftom has taken away the indecency and shame of hakednets in word the general rule which should be obferved in this cafe is as we have al ready faid that there be nothing againtt modefty or verifimility the painters draw moft of their figures with their heads and feet naked wherein they follow the the art of .ainting dictates of fimple nature which eafily accultoms thofe two parts to nakedness we fee examples of this kind not only in hot countries but in the midft of the cold mountains of the alps where even the children go with their feernaked in fummer among the ftones and flints and in winter over the ice and fnow but with regard to the truth of hiftory though nakedness be licence which painters are poffets ’ of and wfe to the advantage of their aft yet they often abufe it went except either ra- phael or pouffin they have reprefented the apof- tles with their feet raked centrary to what is pofi- tively faid in the gofpel where our saviourordering them to take no care for what they should put on commands them to be content with the shoes they have on their feet without carrying others with them and in the acts of the apoftles when the angel dilvers st peter he bids him put on his gir- dle and tie his shoes from whence we may con- clude they were commonly worn the fame with mofes who in the viftion of the burning bufh was warned to leave his shoes and yet raphael paints his feer naked in all the other actions of his life as if wofes had never any thoes on but when he was keeping his father-in- law theep might here give many more in- rances wherein raphael and feveral other painters after him have drawn their figures without thees and flockings againft hiftony and verifimility did not think what have faid fufficient obferved that the grecian culptors more commonly made their figures paked than the romian but know no other reafon for it than that the crecks chofe subjects more agreeable to the defire they had to have the depths of their art admird in their reprefenting the conftruction and union of the parts of man body in their ftatues they re- prefented gods rather than men and in their baffe tc- the art of paint in eacchanals and facrifices rather than hifferies the romans on the contrary who by their ftatues and baffo relievo armed at tranfmit- ing the memory of their emperors to pofterity were neceffarily obliged to de nothing againtt the truth of hiffory but to dresstheir figures according to the mode then in fathion hap xxv of gr ae ee ffyhie necefficy of grace in painting generally peakings is thing that needs no proof there is only one difficulty in the matter te wit if this grace be neceffary in all forts of fubjeus in bactels as well as feftivals in foldiers as well as women grant it is and my reafon for it is that tho' grace thews infelf firft in the face yet it is not in part only that it refides it confifts chiefly in the turn the paipntergives his objects to render them even fuch are inanimate from whience it follows that there may be ggrace in the fiercrness of foldier by the turn which may be given to his air and his pofture and even in drapery or any thing elfe by the manner in which it may be dif pofed having given this idea of perfect painter and proofs of the feveral parts that go to the forming one there only remains an application to the works of the painters and to put them as it were in the fcale not to reject entirely thefe that have not all the qualities which we have eftablished but to value them according to their weight this the art of painting idea may help us to judge of the defigns of different mafters mean of the degree of their goodness for tis almoft impoffible to write with uftness of the originality of defign or the name of the author or to lay down rules how he may be known ch xxvi of designs ahie defigns of which we intend to fpeak here are thofe thoughts that painters com- monly exprets on paper for the execution of fome work they are going about we should place among defigns the hudies of reat mafters that is thofe parts which they have defigned after nature as heads feet and entire figures draperies animals trees plants flowers and in thort every thing that may enter into the composition of picture for whether you confider good defign by its rela- tion to the picture of which it is antidea or by rela- tion to fome part of which it is the htudy it always deserves the attention of the curious tho the knowledge of defigns be not fo efti- inable nor of fo large extent as that of pictures it is however delicate and pleafant becaufe the great number of them gives thofe that love them more opportunity to exercife their criticifins and the work is all the production of the mind defigns denote beft the character of the mafter and thew if his genius be lively or heavy if his thoughts are elevared or common in thort if he has good manner and good gout of all the parts which may be expreft upon paper painter who would finish picture endeavours if one may fo fay to go out of the art of painting himfelf that he may acquire praife for fome parts of his art which he knows very well he is not pof- feft of but in making defign he gives loofe to his genius and thews what he is for this reafon it is that in the collections of the great we find the deligns of the beft mafters preferved as well as the pictures and yet there are few perfons who are curious about deligns and among thofe few if some know the manner fcarce any one knows the end the half crities have no inclination towards this curio- fity becaufe having no fufficient notion of the meaning of defigns they have no relifh of the per- formance and take more pleafure in prints carefully engraved from good pictures which may be occa- fioned fometimes thro fear of being deceived and of taking as it often happens copies for originals for want of experience there are three things in ge- neral to be obferved in defigns learning fpirit and freedom by learning underfland good compo- fition defign correct and of good gont with laudable knowledge of the claro obfcuro by the word spirit comprehend lively and natural ex- preffion thro the whole work of the subject in ge- neral and the objects in particular freedom is no more than habit which the hand has contracted to express readily and boldly the idea in the painter' mind and as there is more or less of thefe three things in defign tis the more or less valuable though free defigns are generally accompanied with good deal of fpirit yet all the defigns that are made with freedom are not for all that fenfibly touch ’ and if the learned defigns are not always free they are thofe generally which have the moft pirit in them might here name abundance of painters whofe defigns have great deal of freedom without any spirit whofe bold hands produce nothing but ramb- ling the art of paintin petformances might alfo name feveral able men whofe deligns appear fliff though otherwife and fentible becaute their hand was re- ftrained by their judgment and they rudied above all things to make their out-lines correct and their expreftion juft avoid naming them not to offend any body let every one judge as he thinks fit this muft be faid of freedom tis to agreeable that it hides and often excufes great many faults which in fuch cafe are rather attributed to an impetuofity of genius than to infufficiency but we mult own alfo that freedom of hand does not seem to be freedom when tis confined within the bounds of great regularity thus in the moft correct defigns of raphael there is delicate free dom which is only vifible to the eyes of the learned in word there are fome deligns which are not over correct and which yet are not without their merit having good deal of fenfe and character of this fort are the defigns of william baur rem- brant benedetti and fome others defigns that are butjuft rouch ’ and not finith ’ have more pirit and pleafe more than thofe that are perfected provided their character be good and they pur the idea of the spectator in good way the reafon is that the imagination fupplies all the parts which are wanting or are not finithed and each man fees it according to his own gout the defigns of thofe mafters who have more genius than learning often give occafion to experience the truth of this affertion but the defigns of excellent mafters who join folidity to fine genius lofe no- thing by being finith ’ and fuppoting every thing elfe is antwerable deligns are to be efteemed ac- cording as they are finith ’ though we ought to value moft thofe defigns wherein moft parts are found yet should we not re- jeet thele wae there is no more than one pro- vided the arf of pain ting tis of fuch manner that it shews some prin- ciple of the art or carries with it any fenfible fin- gularity which pleafes or instructs neither ought we to reject thofe that are but fketches by which one fees very faint idea only and but an eftay of the fancy fince tis curious to remark how skil- ful painters at firft conceived their thoughts before they digefted them and tkerches thew us further what touches great mafters make ufe of to charac- terife things with few strokes to tatisfy one' curiofity therefore it would be well if one had de- figns of all kinds of the fame mafter to wit not only of his firft second or laft manner but even his lighteft kerches as well as his moft finithed defigns confess however the curieus who are purely spe- culative don fo much find their account in it as thofe who knowing how to prabtice are more capa- ble of relifhing this curiofiry there is one thing which is as the falr of defign that feafons it and gives it its relifh withour which ifisworth little or nothing and which canr exprets better than by is the word character this character confifts then in the manner in which the painter thinks things the feal that diftinguithes his works from thofe of other men and which imorints on them the image of his mind is this character that agitates our imagination and tis by this that ikilful painters after having ftudied under good mafters or after the works of others feel themfelves con- ftrained by sweet violence to let their gemis loofe and fly with their proper wings exclude out of the number of good defigns all that are infipid of which there are three forts firft thofe of painters who though they produce great compofitions and are exact and correct yet pread over their works certain coldnels which freezes the fpectator secondly thofe of painters who having more menmory than genius are always playins art of painting the plagiaries and working by the ideas they have ftored up from other mens productions which they have feen or elfe make ufe of fuch as are before them with too little induftry and too much fervility and thirdly thofe of painters who tie themfelves up to their mafter manner without ever quitting or enriching it the knowledge of deligns as well as of pictures confifts in two things viz to find out the name of the mafter and the goodness of the delign to know that defign is of fuch mafter man muft have viewed with attention great many others of the fame hand and have had in his mind juft idea of the character of his genius and of the character of his practice the knowledge of the character of genius requires great extent and great clearnels of mind to keep the ideas without confounding them and the knowledge of the cha- racter of practice depends more on great habitude than great capacity and for this reafon tis that the moft ikilful painters do not always decide this point the mott juftly to know if defign be fine if it be an original or copy great deal of deli- cacy and penetration is requifite togetherwith much exercile that way and question whether it can be done withour fome knowledge of manual practice and yet after all man may be deceived it feems to me tis eafy to infer from what has been faid that the comparifon of the works of the painters with the idea we have eftablifhed of per feet painter is the beft way to know what efteem is due to them but fince man has not always great number of pictures at his difpofal nor enough finished defigns to exercife his judgment and fo to acquire in short time habit of judging well good prints may ferve inftead of pictures for excepting the local colour they are fulcepriple of all the parts of painring and befides that they will shorten the time the art of painting and are very proper to fill the mind with the knowledge of an infinity of things the reader hope will not be difpleated to find here what have difcovered in this matter ch xxvii of the ufefulness and use of prints is born with defire to know and a nothing to much hinders his informing him as the trouble of learning and the eafiness of for- getting two things of which the greateft part of mankind complain with great deal of reafon for fince the arts and fciences have been fought after and to penetrate far into them an infinity of volumes have been publifhed at the fame time was brought to light an object terrible enough to frighten us from looking into them and capable to thock our minds and dit- hearten our memories however we have more reafon than ever to exercife both the one and the other or at leaft to find out means to help them in their feveral functions that which we are about to treat of the invention of prints is very power- ful one and one of the happielt productions of latter ages they are in our age arrived to to high degree of perfection and good gravers have given us fo many on all forts of marters that it may truly be faid they are the depolitories of all that is fine and curious in the world their origin was in the year and arofe from one mufo finiguerra goldfimith of florence who graved his plate when cafting fome of it in melced fulphur he perceived that what came out of the mould was marked with the same prints as his plate the art of paintin by the black which the fulphur had taken from his graving he tried to do as much on filver places with wet paper by rolling it fmoothly with roller which alfo succeeded this novelty tempted baccio baldini goldfmith of the fame city to try whether he could do the same and his fuccess occafioned him to engrave feveral plates of sandro boricello invention and delign and upon this andrew mantegna who was at rome at that time fet about engraving fome of his own pieces the knowledge of this invention getting into flanders martin of antwerp then famous pain- ter engraved abundance of places of his own inven- tion and fent feveral prints into ltaly which were marked thus vafari in the life of marco antonio painter gives an account of the greateft part of his fubjects of which there was one among the reft the vifion of st anthony that pleated michael angelo then very young to well for the invention of it that he coloured it after martin of antwerp albert durer began to appear and gave the world an infinite number of fine prints as well in wood as in copper all which he fent to venice to be fold marco antonio who happened at that time to be there was fo ravithed with the beauty of thefe prints that he copied fix and thirty of them which reprefented our saviour paftion and thefe copies were received at rome with fo much the more admiration by how much the more they were finer than the originals at the fame time hiugo du carpl an italian painter of mean capacity but of wit apt for invention found out by means of feveral plates of wood the way how to make prints retemble deligns of claro obfcuro and tome years after the invention of erching was difcovered which parmeggiano foon made ufe of thefe art of paintinc thefe firft prints drew the admiration of all that faw them for their novelty and the skilful painters who worked for glory were willing to ufe them to pread their works over the world raphael among others employed the famous marco an tonio to engrave feveral of his pictures and defigne and thofe admirable prints were fo renowned that they carried the name of raphael through the world valt number of gravers have made them- felves famous fince marco antonio in germany italy france and the low-countries and have pub- lifhed as well by graving as etching an infinite number of prints on all forts of subjects as well hiftories fables emblems devifes medals animals landskips flowers fruits as in general all the vifible productions of art and nature there is no body of what condition or profeffion foever but may profit very much by them di- vines monks devout men philofophers foldiers travellers geographers painters fculptors archi- tects gravers lovers of the fine arts all that are curious in hiffory or antiquity and in thort all who having no particular profeftion but that of men of honour would adorn their minds with the knowledge of thofe things that might render them the more worthy of efteem it is not pretended that perfons are obliged to fee all the prints that have been publifhed to know how to profit by them the infinite number of them prefenting at once to many different ideas to man view will rather confound than inform him thofe only who are born with great and clear genius who have been ufed for fome time to the fight of to many different things can make them profitable to them and fee them all without confulion every particular man may choofe thofe subjects that are moft proper for him that may either re irefn t art of painting freth his memory or rrengthen his judgment in which he should be directed by the inclination he has for things of his own goit and profeffion as for example nothing is more fuitable to di- vines than prints which relate to religion our holy myfteries the facred hiftories and every thing which difcovers the exercifes or the persecutions of the primitive chriftians the antique baffo re- lievos which in many places inform us of the cere- monies of the heathen worship in thort any thing that has relation to our own whether it be facred of profane for thofe devout subjects are moft proper which raife the foul to heaven and continue it in the love of god for monks the facred hiffories in general and what concerns their order in particular for philofophers all the demonftrative figures which relare not only to the experiments of phy- fic but all that may encreafe their knowledge in patural things for thofe that are bred up to war the plan and clevation of fortified cities the order of bartles and books of forrification of which the demonftra- tive figures are the greateft part for travellers the particular views of palaces of cities and confiderable places to prepare them for the things they are to fee or to preserve the ideas of thofe they have feen for geographers the maps and charts neceitary in their profeffion for painters every thing that may ftrengthen them in the feveral parts of their art as the antique pieces and thofe of raphael and caracci for the good goit correctness of defign the dignity of manner for the choice of the airs of the head the pallions of the mind and the attitudes thofe of corregio for grace and delicacy of the expreftions thofe the art of paintin of titian baffano and the lombards for the character of trath for the fimple expreffions of na- ture and above all for the goit of landskips thofe of rubens for the grandeur and magnificence of his invention and the artifice of claro obfcuro in short thofe that though they may be defective in fome particular part of them may yet have fome- thing in them fingular and extraordinary for the painters may draw confiderable advantage from all the different manners of thofe that have gone before them who are as fo many flowers from whence like the bees they may fuck juice which incorporating with their proper fubltance will bring forth fuch works as are ufeful and agreeable for fculptors ftatues baffo relievos medals and other antique works thofe of raphael polidoro and the whole roman fchool for architects the books that concern their pro- feftion and that are full of demonftrative figures of the invention of their authors or copied from the antique for gravers collection of pieces of different manners as well graved as erched this collection should alfo ferve to thew them the progress of graving from albert durer to the gravers of our own times which will include the works of marco antonio cornelius cort the caracci sa- delers ponrius bolfvert colrius muler vofter- man vifcher and great many more that have not named who had particular character and who by different ways ftrove all of them to imitate either nature when they did fomething of their own invention or pictures of different manners when they only aimed at the faithfulness of imitarion in comparing thus the works of all thefe matters they may judge which of them underffood beft the ma nagement of their tools of light and the utefulnets of tones as it relates to the claro obfcuro which art of painting them in their operations reconciled delicacy and force beft and in their productions were moft fen- fible and exact that making good ufe of thefe lights they may have the laudable ambition to equal or furpats thefe skilful mafters for the curious in hiftory and antiquity every thing that has been engraved belonging to facred or profane hiftory the fabie the antique baffo relievo the trajan and antonine pillars the books of medals and ftones engraved and feveral prints that may help them in the knowledge of thofe things they would know or to keep thofe they know already in their memories in thort for thofe that to be more happy and more gentleman-like would form their gout by the hudy of good things and have reafonable tincture of the fine arts nothing is more necelfary than good prints their fight with little reflection will rea- dily and agreeably inform them of every thing that may exercile their reafon and ftrengthen their judg- ment they may fill their memory with the moft curious things of all times and all countries and in learning the different hiftories learn the feveral manners of painting they will judge readily by the facility with which they may open few leaves and to compare the productions of one mafter with thofe of another and by this means in iparing their time they will pare their expence alfo for it is almoft impoftible to put the pictures of as many mafters together in room as will fuffice to form perfect idea of the work of each mafter and when at valt charge man has filled large chamber with pictures of different manners he can not have above two or three of each which is not enough to enable him to make nice judgment of the character of the painter or the extent of his capacity where as by means of prints one may eafily fee the works of feveral mafters on table one may form art of painting idea of them judge by comparing them one with another know which to choole and by practif- ing it often contract habit of good tafte and good manner especially if we do it in the company of any body that has difcernment in thefe things and can diftingith what is good from what is but indifferent but as for the critics in and lovers of the fine arts we muft prefcribe them no rules all things if we may ufe the phrafe are subjected to the empire of their knowledge they entertain themfelves by their fight fometimes in looking on one thing and fometimes on another becaufe they reap profit by it and take pleafure in it among other things in feeing what has been engraved from the moft famous mafters of painting they perceive the origin pro- grets and perfection of their works they follow them from giotto and andrea mantegna down to raphael titian and the caracci they examine the different fchools of thofe times they fee into how many branches they have been divided by the mul- tiplicity of difciples and how many ways the mind of man is capable of conceiving the same thing what imitation is and that as many different man- hers have come from her as countries ages minds or nature by their diverfity have produced among all the good effects that may arife from the ufe of prints we shall content ourfelves to name fix by which we may eafily judge of the reft the firft is to divere us by imitation in reprefent- ing vifible things to us by their painting he second is to instruct by more forcible and ready manner than by peech things lays horace that enter at the ear go more about to come at us and touch us less than those that enter by the eyes which are the more sure and more faithful witneffes the third is to fhorten the time we employ in thofe things that have efcaped art of painting and to refreth it with glance of the eyc the fourth is to reprefent abfent and diftant things as if they were before oureyes which other- wife we could not fee without troublefome voyages and great expence the fifth is to afford us by this means an eaty way of comparing feveral things together prints taking up to little room that we may make ufe of to great number and to different and the fixth is to give one tafle of good things and tincture of the fine arts which no gentleman should be ignorant of thefe effects are general but every one may ima- gine the particular ufes and benefits

to do in this what feems to him to be ufeful and agreeable though one may at any time and in any age be nefit one felf by the fight of prints yet youth is more proper for it than any other part of man' life becaufe memory is the gift of childhood and while perfons are young they ought to make ufe of it as of magazine to lay up things that can con tribure towards forming their judgment but if the ufe of prints be profitable to youth it is pleafant and agreeable entertainment to old age which is the proper time for repofe and re- fection and in which our thoughts being no longer diffipated by the amufements of our firtt years we may with the greater leifure relifh the pleafure that is to be received by prints whether it be by their informing us of fomething new or bringing fome thing to our minds that we knew before whether it be that having gufto for the arts we judge by them of the different productions which the painters and gravers have left us or having no knowledge of thofe things we flatter ourfeives that we shall acquire it or in thort if we aim at nothing by it but to pleafe ourfelves by agreeably exciting our attention in obferving the beaury and fingularity of the prints that we meet with for there we fee countries towns and all the confiderable places that we have read of in hiftory or have feen in our travels in fuch fort that the great variety and the great number of rare things which we find there may ferve inftead of travelling and this may be done with eafe by the curious who have no ftrength leifure or convenience to travel it is certain therefore from what we have faid that the fight of fine prints by which youth is in- strueted and the knowledge of old perfons revived and confirmed muft be ufeful to all the world wve the art of painting do not think it neceffary to enter into detail of all the feveral things that might recommend the ufe of prints we believe we have faid enough to in- duce the reader to draw confequences from it con- formable to his views and his occafions if the ancients had had the fame advantage in this as we have and if they had by the means of prints tranfmitred what they had done that was fine and curious to poftericy we should have diffinctly known abundance of things of which we have but confuled ideas in hiftory we should fee the ftately monuments of memphis and babylon and the temple of jeru- falem which solomon built with to much magnifi- cence we should make judgment of the buildings of athens corinth and old rome with more ground and with more certainty than we can now by the poor remains that are left of them paufa nias who has made fuch an exact description of greece and who leads us though all places as it were by the hand would have accompanied his difcourfes with demontrative figures which might have been handed down to us and we might have seen with pleafure not only the temples and places as they were in their perfection but we should alfo have inherited from the ancient workmen the art of vitruvius whofe demonftrations good building are loft would not have fuffered us to be ignorant of all the inftruments and machines which he has de- scribed and we should not find in his book to many obfcure places if the figures had been preferved by prints for in arts thofe figures are the light of dif- courfe and the true means by which an author can communicate his meaning it is for want of thefe means that the machines of archimedes and the el der hiero are loft and the knowledge of diofcori- des plants as alfo of feveral animals and of great many of the curious productions of nature which the ftudies and meditations of the antients dit the art of paint ing difcovered but not to trouble ourfeives any longer in grieving for the loss of things which we can not re- cover let us profit ourfelves by prints that we have amongft us the idea which have given the world of per- fett painter may in my opinion affift the curious in making judgment of painting bowever since to know pictures perfectly requires something more thought my self obliged to add what has appeared to me necesfary in that matter kxviii of the knowledge of pict ures wviiere are three feveral forts of knowledge relating to pictures the firft confifts in dif- covering what is good and what is bad in the fame picture the second has respect to the name of the author and the third is to know whether it is an original of cop know what is good and what is bad in pic ture firft of thefe two fores of knowledge is without doubt the moft difficult to be ac- quired it fuppofes penetration and fineness of wit with the principles of painting and on the meafure of thefe things the knowledge of the art depends penetration and fineness of wit ferve to make judg- ment of the invention of the expreftion of the fub- ect in general of the paftions of the foul in parti- cular the art of painting of allegories and of what depends on cof- tume and poefy the knowledge of principles helps one to find times and places out the caufe of the effects that we admire whether they proceed from good relifh from the correctness or elegance of defign or whether the objects appear advantageouly difpoted or the colouring lights and fhadows be happily managed thole that have not cultivated their minds by the knowledge of principles or at leaft have fome speculation of them may however be fentible of the effects of fine picture but can never give reafon for the judgment they make have endeavoured by my idea of perfect painter to affift the natural light of the lovers of paintings however do not pretend to make them penetrate into the detail of the parts of the art that is rather the bufiness of the painters than of the curious would only put their minds in good way towards knowledge that they may in general be able to know what is good and what bad in picture the lovers of the art only who have genius and inclination are permitted if we may fo fay to en- ter into the fanctuary and acquire the knowledge of this whole detail by the lights which they infen- fibly gain by ferious reflection the gout of the arts was to much in fathion in the time of alexander the great that to know the bot- tom of them little young gentlemen were taught to defign by this means thofe that had talentcul- tivared it by exercife they made ufe of it upon oc- cafion and diftinguithed themfelves by the luperio- rity of their knowledge irefer thofe acleaft who have not any experience of this manual practice to the idea have given of its perfection term of art which ignifies manners art know who is the author of picture tii knowledge of the names of the authors is got by long practice and the fight of great many pictures of all the fchools and of the principal mafters that compofe them there are fix of thefe ichools to which we may give particular name as the roman the venetian the lombard the ger- man the flemish and the french and after having by much application acquired diftinct idea of each of thefe fchools if we would find out to which of them picture belongs we muft compare it with that to which we think it has the neareft affi- nity and when we have found our the fchool we muft apply the picture to that painter whofe man- ner agrees moft with that work but to know this particular manner is in my opinion the greateft part of the difficulty there are some curious men who form an idea of mafter by the fight of three or four of his pictures and who after this believe they have fufficient authority to decide what his manner is without confidering what care the painter took about them and what age he was of when he drew them it is not from particular pictures of painter but from his works in general that we judge of his me- rit for there is no painter that has not made fome good and fome bad pictures according to his care or the motion of his genius there is none alfo that had not his beginning his progress and his end that is to fay three man- ners the firft he took from his mafter the second he formed by his gotir in which his capacity and genius are to be found and the third commonly deze- art of painting degenerates into what we call manner for pain- ter who has long time ftudied after nature is willing without any more trouble to make ufe only of the experience he has got when curious perfon has well confidered the different pictures of mafter and has formed par- feet idea of his stile he may then judge who is the author of picture without being condemned for rathnels though critic who has talent and has udied and practifed the art may fometimes be deceived in the name of an author yet he will at leaft never be deceived in the juftness and folidity of his fentimentsiz therevare pictures made by disciples who have copied their mafters very exactly in their judgment and their manner some painters have followed the golt of another country and not their own and there are fome who leave one manner for and ther and who have by this means made fome pictures which will purzle the beft judges to guets the name of their author neverthelefs this inconvenience is not without for fuch ias not fatisfying themfelves in knowing malter hand have penetration enough to difcover the character of his mind.. skilful man may eafily communicate the manner in which he executes his defigns but not the delicacy of his thoughts it is not to find out the author of picture enough therefore to know the motion of the pencil if the curious can not penetrate that of the mind and though it is very much to have juft idea of painter golt in his delign yet it is ne- ceffary to enter into the character of his genins and the turn which he is capable of giving to his con- ceptions do not pretend however to ftop the mouths of thofe lovers of painting who have not seen nor examined this great number of pictures by talking of it they may acquire and increafe know- the art of paintin knowledge would only that every one should give us the fenfe in which he speaks by the mea- ture of his experience modefty which is to be- coming in beginners agrees alfo with the moft ex- perienced especially in difficult cafes iii if picture be an original or copy is not my intention to difcourfe here of in= different copies which the curious will find out at firft fight much less of bad ones which are thought to by all the world fuppofe then copy made by good matter which deferves ferious reflection and makes one doubt for fome timerat leaft whether it is copy or an original there are three forts of fuch copies the firft is done faithfully but fervilely the second is light eafy and not faithful the third faithful and eaty the firft which is fervile and faithful includes the defign the colouring and the touches of the original but the fear of pafting beyond the bounds of this exactnets and to err againft fide- lity makes the hand of the copift fliff and if it is never fo little examined thews it to be what it is the second is more likely to impofe on the spec- tator becaufe of the lightness of the pencil but the unfaichfulness of the contours or our-lines unde- ceive the beft judges and the third which is faithful and eafy made by learned and light hand and above all in the time of the original purzles the greateft critics and often hazards their pronouncing againft the truth though it may be agreeable to verifimility as there the afr of painting are fome things which feem to favour the ori= ginality of piece to there are others that feem to deftroy it as the repetition of the fame picture its having been forgotten long time or cofting little money but though thefe confiderations may have weight they are fometimes very trivial for want of being well examined that picture is forgot proceeds often from the hands into which it falls the place where it is put the perfons that fee it or the little value that the owner has for painting the cheapnets of it proceeds commonly from the neceffity or ignorance of the feller the repetition of picture which is more spe cious caule is not always fubltantial reafon there is fcarce painter but has repeated fome one of his works either becaufe he was pleafed with it or be- caufe he was defired to draw one like it have feen two madonnas of raphael which being out of curibfity placed by one another would perfuade the crities that they were both originals tirian has repeated the fame picture feven or eight times as play that fucceeds is played great many nights together and we fee feveral pictures of the beft mafters of lialy repeated which dispute with their other pieces for goodness and originality there have been fome that have deceived the moft skilful painters among many examples of this kind shall think it fufficient to relare one which is that of julio romano and is taken from valari frederic duke of mantua going through flo- rence towards rome where he went to pay vifit to pope clement vil in the palace of medici over one of the deors faw the picture of leo between the cardinal of medici and cardinal di roffi the heads were of raphael the drapery of julio roma- no and all together admirable the duke looked upon it earneltly and became fo in love with it hit the art of paint ing that he could not forbear begging it of the pope when he came to rome his holinels very graci oully gave it him and ordered his secretary to write to octavian di medici to put the picture up in cafe and fend it to mantus octavian who was great lover of painting and lothe to deprive flo- rence of fuch rarity invented an excufe to defer tending it pretending that the frame was not rich enough and he would get one fitted up for it this delay gave octavian time to have it copied which was done by andrea del sarto who imifated even the little fpots that were upon it this piece was fo like the original that octavian himfelf could hardly diftinguith the ope from the other and that he might not be deceived he put private mark upon the copy and few days after fent it to man- tua the duke received it with all poffible fatis- taction not doubting but it was the work of raphacl and julio romano the latter who was then in the service of that prince had no fuspicion that what was his part of the picture was not done by him- felf and had thought it his own doing as long as he lived if vafari who had feen the copy while it was drawing had not difabufed him for coming to mantua he was mighty well entertained by julio romano who shewed him all the duke rarities that the fineft thing was still to be feen naming the picture of leo done by raphael it is very fine and shewing it him vafari faid romano looking co but it is not raphaels how is it not on it more attentively replied ce raphael ’ do not know my own work in it co do not fee the strokes of my pencil and remet antwered co fou ber the ftriking them do not oblerve it clofely enough affure you law andrea del sarto draw this very picture be- cc hind the canvas you will fee mark which was upon it to diftinguith it from the original julio the art ef paintin romano turning about the picture and per- ceiving it was matter of fact held up his hands with aftonishment faying oc value if as much as if it was raphaels and even more for it is very to fee fo excellent mafter fo well imi- tated as to deceive ofe now fince julic romano with all his skill after having had notice given him and examined the picture paffionacely perfifted in the deceit of his judgment as his proper work we muft not think it rrange that other painters lefs ikilful should tometimes be miltaken about the workss of others for the truth may ve thus hidden to the profoundeff knowledge and though man may be out as to the fact he may not always be out in his judgment however let picture be never to well copied good critic will perceive exterier tokens enough upon it to juttify his faying boldly what he thinks without running the rifque of cenfure of rafhnels if he does not lay it down in politive tone but as an opinion founded on folid knowledge it remains for me to fay fomething of thofe pictures that are neither originals nor copies which the italians call paltici from pafte becaufe as the feveral things that feafon pafty are reduced to one tafte fo coun terfeits that compofe paftici tend only to effect one truth painter that would deceive in this way ought to have in his mind the manner and prin ciples of the mafter of whom he would give an idea whether he takes any part of picture which that mafter has made and puts it in his own work or whether the invention is his own and he imitates lightly not only his touches but even his gout of defign and colouring it often happens that thefe painters who propofe the counterfeiting another' manner aiming to imitate fuch as are more skilful than themfelves they make better pictures of this the art of painting kind than if they were to do fomerhing of their owin among thofe who took delight in counterfeiting the manner of other painters shall content my- felf with naming david teniers only who has de- ceived and ever will deceive the curious who are not prepoffeft of his dexterity in transforming him- felf into baffano and paolo veronefe there are some of his paftici made with fo much cunning that the eyes of the moft judicious are furprized by them at firft fight but after having examined them near- er they foon diftinguith the one colouring and the one pencil from the other for example david teniers had particular ta- lent in imitating the balfans but the light and eafy pencil which he employed in this artifice is the very proof of his deceit for his pencil though eafy and light is not fo lively nor to proper to characterize objects as that of the baffans efpecially as to ani- mals it is true teniers underftood the union of co- lours but there was certain grey predominant in his and his colouring had not the vigour and fweet- nets of giacomo baffano it is the fame with all paftici and if we would not be deceived by them we should examine their gont of defign their co- louring and the character of their pencils with the originals from whence they were taken dnancn he of eminen the orioin of paintinc for gh the authors who have efn any thing of the origin of paint- have differed among themfelves re they agree however in this that shadow gave the firtt occafion to the birth of this art upon which pliny tells us ftory of one corinthia girl of sicyone who being in love with certain youth and finding him afleep near lamp that was burning the sha- dow of his face which appeared on the wall feemed fo like him that the was incited to draw the extremities of it and thus made portrait of her lover if as it is likely fhadow was the rife of the invention of painting imitation is fo natural to mankind that they would not have ftaid till the tile ves of of corinthia without drawing figures after thadow which is as old as man himfelf but not to enlarge on this thought or feek after to uncertain fource as is that of painting we may with good grounds aver that this art and fculpture had their birth at one and the fame time the one and the other having the fame principle which is defign and ever fince the days of braham when fculpture was in ufe painting was confequently practifed in the fame degree it has appeared and difappeared according to the revolutions of ages war is an art that deftroys all others and painting is to much the more exposed to it by how much the more it is done for pleafure however the fine arts are like the phoenix they revive out of their athes wherefore we have feafon to believe that painting was feveral times extinguished and renewed again in the firtt ages though it was in very poor degree and that thefe to whom we attribute the invention of that art were only the renewers of it but to peak like orher authors after having compared them one with another we shall in the main find that gyges the lydian invented painting in egypt euchir in greece and bularchus brought it out of greece into italy in the reign of romulus this painter reprefented the bartle of the magne- fians to well in one of his pictures that candaulus king of lydia thought it worth prodigious fum and to purchafe it covered it with gold by which we may conclude that painting was highly in efteem in thofe days it were needlets to relate in this abridgment the little that has been faid by the antient authors of the firtt rainters who lived before the declention of the empire there being none of their works left no man has much curioficy to know any thing of them or to trouble himfelf ro remember their names we mult however except tome of them who are cele- brated eminent pa int er by fame and of whom it would be fcanda- lous not to know fomething six of them pamphilus timanthes apelles and pro- togenes lived at the fame time with alexander the great when the fine arts were in their vigour and though we have none of their productions we may notwithflanding judge of the perfections of them by the fculptures of the fame age which are pre- served to this day and by the price that thofe anti- ent painters had for their pieces tamanthes and after him apelles having had roo talents near pounds of englith money for one picture it is true there are fome small remains of the old painting hill to be feen but we know not when they were done or who did them the moft con- fiderable is at rome in the vineyard of aldobran- dino and reprefents marriage this work thews great gout of defign and much of the grecian sculpture and baffo relievo fer it is dry and there appears in it no knowledge of groupes or the claro obfcure but we muft not believe that all the pieces painted in greece were of this fort becaufe what we read of zeuxis and parrhafius that by their pencil they deceived even animals and painters them- telves is enough to convince us that they penetrated farther into the principles of their art than the au- thor of that picture we confels they did not ufe oil yet perhaps they might have fome other fe- cret of which we are ignorant that gave to much rrength to their colours as is reported of apelles pliny rells us he made ufe of certain varnith which invigorated his colouring and preferved it be it as it will we can not reafonably fland out againft the evidence of all the antient authors who have poken of the painters of chofe times from whofe writings we ought to infer that painting was in high degree of perfection and that the number of f li of mafters was great shallheremention only some of the chief of them an abridgment of the lives of the six principal painters of greece eux is native of hleraclea in macedonia and learned the firft elements of painting in the olympiad years before the birth of chrift he followed his ftudies very affiduoutly and his fuccess being anfwerable to his induftry he was enabled to undertake feveral bold things that got him reputation he was skilful in defigning and underffood colouring better than any painter of his time pliny fays apollodorus who firft found out the principles of the claro obfcuro and of colours opened the doors of painting to eeuxis and that the fame apollodorus complaining of he had entered to far within that painter faid co them that he had carried out with him the whole the confideraple works which cc art of painting he was employed about brought him in vait fums of money and having got riches enough he gave away his pictures becaufe as he faid he did not fee how they could be rated at their full value the

could not forbear telling the painters who came er admire it that they might praife it but could not imitate it neyerthelefs parrhafius disputed with him the honour of being the beft painter of the age to decide the controverfy they agreed that each of them should make picture and let the world judge whofe performance was beft ecuxis painted fome grapes and parrhafius curtain zeuxis work being

latt piece wwas of was the picture of an old womans which when he had finifhed he was fo pleafed with that he laughed himself to death at the fight of her comical figure but though one can hardly believe this yet the event is not without example qcuxis competitors were timanthes andro- cides eupompous and parrhafius tv born at ephefus was the fon and dif ciple of evenor and the cotemporary of we have feen in the life of the latter that they painted pictures as trial of skill between them they were both looked upon as the greateft mafters of their age which was the age of matters and quintilian informs us they raifed the arr of painting to very high degree of perfection par- thafius in defigning and leuxis in colouring all authors who mention the former agree in giving him the glory of defigning very correctly and very elegantly and in reprefenting bodies not as nature had produced but as the might have pro- duced them and it was according to this great idea that he wrote of the fymmerry of the body among other things he was excellent in expref- fing the paffions of the foul quality that can not be enough commended in adjufting the head- dreffes in diftriburing the hair and in the graces of the mouth he had great genius and elevation of mind but the praifes which were given him and which he thought he deferved made him extremely proud he talked contemptibly of all others and of himfelf as if he had brought the art to the laft perfection he very frankly ftiled himfelf the mafter and prince of painting and was magnificent in every thing about him yet it was withour affectation or conftraint there eminent was fomething of enthufiafim in his pro- ductions he never went to work but he expected to find pleafure in it and when he was at it he ufed to fing to

reign of king philip he was enpompus difciple and apelles mafter he had fo high an idea of his art that he believed no man could be skilful in it without fludying police learning and geometry of which

gave him that fum which bede fays was fomuch year and not for the whole time it was by his advice and credit with alex- ander the great that the young men of quality of sicyone and afterwards of all greece were com- manded to learn firft to defign and by his means painting was reckoned fuch an honourable profeffion that all who were not noble were by an edict forbidden to exercife that art whence we may infer that if painting was fo much efteemed by the policeft people of antiquity it is not without reafon that the moft judicious princes at this time love and proteet it and men of wit value

drawing fimple lines but to accuftom himself to correct defigning in the same manner we should underfland the word subtittas not to give an idea of very de- licate line but of the exactnets and finenets of de- lign thus the fubtlety is not in the line con- sidered fimply as line but in the intelligence of the art which is thewn in the lines of defign confels however that the word tenuitas which is in the fame place of pliny may create some diffi- culty in this explication which believe is not unan- twerable for by that word the fineness and exactnets of an out-line may very well be underftood befides will maintain it would be nonfenfe to think that the victory in the difpute between aplles and proto- genes depended only on htriking line one more delicately than another and if pliny who is ill co- emnent nt in this place meant it as thofe who to con- strue him weald have him he knew little of the fine arts though one may eafily perceive elfewhere that he was paffionate admirer of them envy which is fooften met with among perfons of the fame profeffion never entered into the foulof apelles and if he endeavoured to raife himfelf it was wholly by the affiftance of his art which he knew to be of great extent and was fond of the glory of poffefting it. he was as folicitous about the advantage of his emulators as about his own and being fentible of the capacity of protogenes he recommended him to the rhodians who upon his character of him gave him price for his works incomparably greater than that painter was ufed to receive for them before apelles was circumspect but ealy in his produc- tions the elegance and grace which is every where to be feen in his pictures was no obftacle to the truth which painter owes to nature and he drew his pieces with to much likeness that some aftro- logers made ufe of them to draw the horofcope of the perfons he had painted alexander who often vifited apelles delighting in his converfation and manners commanded him to talk to him freely and had very great kindness for him an inftance of which was shewn upon the occafion of his drawing the picture of campaipe which he had drawn by his order campaipe was very handform and the moft beloved of all alexan- der ’ concubines who perceiving that apelles was in love with her gave her to him by which lays pliny he not only shewed the affection he had for his painter but that after having evercome many nations he knew htill how to overcome himfelf continues the fame author by his courage but more great by the dominion he had over his paftions apelles es often drew the picture of alexanders atsd this monarch not thinking it convenient that his irmage should be profaned by the hands of the igno- rant publifhed an edict forbidding all painters whatfoever to make his portrait except pelles and by the fame edict he permicted pyrgoteles only to engrave his image on gems and precious flones and lyfippus only to caft his ftatue in brass though apelles was very exact in his works he knew how far to carry his exaciness without fa riguing his mind one day talking of protogenes he faid he was great mafter but he often spoiled his pieces by endeavouring to make them perfect that he did not know when he had done well that man may do too much as well too little and that he was truly fkilful who knew what was fufficient one of his difciples thewing him picture to have his opinion of it and telling him he had done it in little time apelles replied ci fee it plain ehough and wonder that in the time you have made great many fuch pictures another painter shewing him the picture of an hellen which he had drawn with care and adorned with abundance of jewels apelles told him since you could not make her handfome perceive friend you have made her rich as he spoke his mind freely to he took in good part what was faid to him and to avoid flattery he expofed his works to the publick and hid himfelf behind them to hear what paffengers faid of them with an intent to turn their obfervations to his advantage fhoemaker coming by one day took the liberty to criticife on fandal which he had painted and it was immediately alcered but pafting by the same place the next day and being proud to fee that his criticifn was taken notice of he paft his cenfure on leg which had nothing eminent faulty in it upon which apelles came from behind the canvas and told the thoe-maker his judgment went no higher than fandal which afterwards grew into proverb do not know whether there are many apelles in our days but am confident there are more thoe-makers than ever nother fign of the ingenuity of apelles was his acknowledging that amphion underftood difpolition better and lcleprodorus the regularity of delign but he gave place to no body for grace which was his particular talent when he viewed the works of the great painters he admired the beauries of them yet he frankly faid he did not perceive that grace in them which no body was fo much mafter of as himfelf for without vanity he might fay it was his own peculiar excellence apelles never painted on walls nor on any thing that could not be faved in fire he would have had the works of the beft mafters carried from one country to another and could not endure that picture should not be capable of having more than one mafter becaufe painting he faid was com- mon good to all the world pliny has given us description of apelles fineft pieces and one may judge of their excellence by the price that was paid for them fomerimes one hundred talents fometimes fum without counting and with profution to ene rotogenes was native of caunus city of caria subject to the rhodians we know not who was his father or his mafter it is likely enough he had no other mafter than the publick pieces that he faw and probably his parents being poor could not be at any fuch expence for his education in the art as was given at that time himfelf was forced li ve of firft to paint ships for his livelihood his ambi- tion was not to be rich but to be mafter of his profeftion for this reafon he lived retired life that he might not be difturbed in thofe fiudies which he thought necelfary for the perfection of his art he finished his pictures with too great care apelles faid of him he knew not when he had done well or how to get away his work and by dint of labour leftened its beauty and fatigued his mind he was more for truth than verifimility in painting by which in exacting more of his art than he ought to have done he drew less from her than he might have done the fineft of his pieces is the picture of jalifus feveral authors have mentioned it without giving any description of it or telling who this jalifus was some perfons fuppofe him to have been famous hunter for feven years that protogenes worked on this picture all his food was lupines mixed with little water which ferved him both for meat and drink he was of opinion that this fimple and light nou- rifhment would leave him the freedom of his fancy apelles feeing this piece was fo struck with ad- miration that he could not speak word having no exprestion to anfwer the idea of the beauty of the picture which he had formed in his mind it was this fame picture that laved the city of rhodes wiien king demetrius befieged it for not being able to attack ir but on that fide where protogenes worked which he intended to burn that it might fer fire to the reft of the town he chofe rather to abandon his hopes of conquest than to deftroy fo fine piece as was that of jalifies protogenes work-houfe was in garden in the suburbs of khodes near the camp of the enemy yet the norle of arms could not diftract him in his labours co with the king fending for him and alking him of what eminent what affurance he could work in the fuburbs of city that was befieged he replied that he un- ce derftood the war he had undertaken was againtt the rhodians and not againtt the arts the king was to pleafed with this answer that he ordered tome soldiers to be his guard and was glad that by this means he could fave to skilful hand aufus gellius reports that the rhodians during the flege fent ambaffidars to demerrius to pray him to lave the picture of jalitus reprefenring thit it he was victoriotus it might ferve to adorn his friumph and if he was forced to raife the fiege he might be blamed for turning his arms againtt pro- togsnes when he could ner cenquer the rown the king hearing them out liked the meffage to well that he drew off his army and by this means faved bogh the picture of jalifus and the ciry of khodes will not here relate the memerable conteft be- tween apelles and protogenes the reader may fee it in the life of apelles shall only add that the latter alking protogenes wharprice he had for his pictures and protogenes naiming an inconfiderable fum ac- cording to the fad forrune of thofe who are obliged to work for their bread apelles concerned at the injuftice done to the beauty of his protuctions gave him fifty ralents for one picture only telling it abroud that he would make it pats and fell it for his own this generofity opened the eyes of the rhodians as to the merir of protogenes and made them to get the picture apelles had bought out of his hards prying down much greater price for it than he had given pliny fays protagenes was fculptor as well as painter confult this author if you would know more of his works of which he fpeaks as well as of thefe of other skilful painters shall only relate here paflage our of uintilian which thews the particular talents of lix famous painters protogene tays ie excelled in exactnels pamphilus and melanthus in li ves of the difpofition antiphilus in eafinets theon the samian in fruitfulnels of ideas and apelles in grace and ingenious conceptions pliny writes that the mafters of theart of painting in his time made ufe but of fourcapital colours out of which they compoted all the others this is not place to argue on that nor to make comparifon between the ancient and modern painting shall content myfelf with faying that if painting in oil which has been in ufe about years has great advantage over the diftemper for the facility of painting and union of colours the ancients had vernish which gave force to their brown colours and their white was more light and fhining than ours by which means having greater extent of the degrees of the claro obicuro they could imitate certain ob- jects with more force and truth than we can in oil titian knew this advantage and tried it in fome pictures where he made ufe of white in diftemper but the diverfity of thofe two fathions in ufing colours was flavery which foon difgulted titian and took him off from the practice of it shall conclude with one word more of the pain ters and fculptors of thofe days who knowing there was no work to compleat to which fome perfection might not be added observed always in putting their names to their works to express that they were not finished though they had done what they could do to them we fee examples of this upon the greekftatues on which we find written glicon of thens would have made this work praxiteles would bave made this work athenodorus lilip- pus exc would have made this work and not did make it great many in our days are not fo scrupulous and are very far from believing that any thing which comes from their hands is not perfect the eminent paii dd the roman and florentine l ok iii tn ci ma bue ii fine arts having been excinct in ever fince the irruption of the barbarians the fenate of

fciences made him apply to them he exercifed himfelf abour them fome time but the ar- rival of thefe grecian painters roufed his inclination and decermined it entirely to painting the con- fiderable progrets that he made in that art encou- raged him in the ftudy of it and got him fuch re- putation that when charles of naples paft through ve of he vifited cimabue and thought himfelf very well entertained by the fight of his works he painted according to the cuftorm of thofe times in trefee and in diftemper painting in oil being not then found out he underftood architecture and died in the yoth year of his age anno dom was his ditciple ndr florence made himfelf taken notice of by anew fort of painting he left florence and went to venice whither tome greek painters were come as well as to florence they were doing mofaic work in st mark church andrea be- came acquainted with them especially with apol- lonius whom he carried with him to florence and learned of him the merhod and secrets of this fort of painting which had the charm of novelty and was the more curious becaufe it was fo lafting they did together feveral ffories out of the bible in se john church by which they acquired great deal of reputation but he did one himfelf that was very much to his hoour and advantage it was the picture of chrift feven cubits long about which he took much pains and care the praifes that were given him did him mischief for finding himfelf etteemed by all the world he neglected his rudiess and minded nothing but getting of money of which he was very greedy his works raifed emulation in gaddo gaddi and giotto and were as to much feed that brought forth feveral painters in uicany he died at years of age ad do addi florence applied himfelf alfo to mofaic work which got him efteem in rome and florence becaufe he defigned better than all the other eminent in er other painters of his time after having made fe veral great pieces in divers places he retired to florence where he did some little ones as it were to reft himfelf after his great labours to this end he made ufe of egg-shells which he ftained with feveral colours and bufied himself about it with much pacience he

riched the chapel where the marble ftatue which he had made was fet up with feveral pictures he wvas years old when he died born in village near florence and very much to the progress of painting his memory is preferved not only by the great picture of mofaic work which is over the gate of st peters church in rome and was done at the command of pope benedict but allo by the praifes given him by the poers of his time and the ftarue of marble which the florentines erected for him and which is over his tomb the ltalian proverb tu sei pin rondo che di giotto which as ufed to express little wit is founded on an acci- dent which happened to him benedict ix being willing to try the capacity of the florentine painters li ve of fent perfon thither to bring him defign from each of them this

the picture of mofaic work which we mentioned before as alfo st peter bark toft by the tempeft which piece is known to all painters by the name of giortos veffel the ftory of the circle shews us that

which are engraved in the claro obieuro in nine theets and which for their beauty may be called the triumphs of mantegna pope innocent vill having invited him into his service before he went to rome

goldfmith afterwards graver of coims and medals in which he was excellent but his genius finding itfelf too much confined in that exercife turned to that of painting to which his inclination led him the facility he found in it gave him fo much courage that by conftant application and rudy he became one of the greateft mafters of the art in his time he drew feveral pieces for feveral places in italy chieffy for the duke of urbin raphael reputation made him defirous to fee his works but his age would not fuffer him to take journey to rome wherefore he contented himfelf to write his mind to his friends who telling ra- phael of it it began friendly correspondence be- tween thefe two painters the latter having heard talk of francia'smerit and raphael was then painting the picture of st cecilia for church in bologna when he had finished it he fent it to francig and by letter prayed him to place it for him and to be fo kind as to correct its faults francia was tranfported at the opening of the ler- ter he took the picture out of the cafe admired it and was fenfibly touched with it yer at the same time his heart failed him to much upon the fight of piece to far above his own

to exactly that their works are often taken the one for the ther luca was an artful deligner and michael angelo effeemed him to much that he made no tcruple in his piece of the day of judgment to borrow fome things from that of luca which he painted at orvicto with great deal of fancy and capacity he painted alfo at loretio cortona and rome his fon who was handfome young man and one of whom he had great hopes was killed at cortona the news of his death was terrible affliction to him but arming himfelf with con- ftancy he ordered his corps to be carried into his work-houfe and without shedding tear drew his picture to preserve the memory of him finding no confolation but in his art which gave him what death had ravithed from him he went afterwards to rome whither pope sixtus iv had

eager about his bufipess that he would eminent often forget to ear or drink he was to fearfoul of chunder that great while after the clap was over he would be found thrunk up in corner and wrapt up in his cloke nothing was more un- ealy bo him than the noife of children crying he hated alfo to hear thote cough that had cold the ringing of bells and monks finging plaimis he delighted in rain above all things and died delirious of paralepfy in the goth year of his age anno e bonar do da inc of anoble family in tufcany and did not degenerate from the henour of his arr ceftors his morals were good and his body and mind beautiful he had fo many talents for all the arts that he knew the very bottom of them and practifed them with care and exactness firs great variety of knowledge inftead of weakning that which he had of painving frengthened it to tuch degree that there never was painter before him that came near him and there never will come any after him who will not look on him as foun- tain from whence feveral good things are to be drawn.. he and pietro ferugino were difciples to- gether of andrea verrochio who gave him an op- portunity to awaken his talent for the mafter and the fcholar were both born with the fame genius except that leonardo was the mere extentive he painted at florence at rome and at milan and great many of his pictures are disperted up and down throughout all rurope among other things he drew picture of our saviour laft fupper for the refectory of the dominicans at mlilan which is of exquifite beauty.. he did not finith the head of chriff becaufe he could not find our model antwerable to the image he had formed in his mind before hi the war broke out in that dutchy and obliged him to leave milan he did the fame by judas alfo but the prior of the convent being im- patient to fee the piece finished prefted leonardo fo carneftly to have it done that he drew the head of the importunate frier and put it upon judass shoulders he was inceffantly bufied in reflections about his art and fpared for no care or htudy to arrive at perfection in it which he at laft attained he was chiefly folicitous to express the paftions of the foul which he believed the moft neceffary thing in his profeffion especially for thofe who would have the approbation of men of fenfe the duke of milan made him director of an academy of painting erected by him in the capital of his dutchy it was in that city he wrote the book of painting which was printed in paris in and for which pouffin made the figures he wrote feveral other treatifes that are loft when francis took mi lan lconardo retired to florence where he painted the great hall of the council and found michael angelo sreputation very welleftablifhed which raifed mighty emulation between them leonardo going to rome at the election of pope leo michael angelo did the fame and their jealouty grew to such height thar leonardo left ltaly and went to paris where he was very well received by francis by his prefence and works he fupported the reputation he had acquired and the french king gave him all poffible tokens of efteem and friendship the king had fuch particular kind- nets for him that going to vifit him in his latt ticknets lconardo would have raifed himfelf up to thank his majefty for the honour done him and the king embracing him to oblige him to hie down in his bed again he was taken peechlets in the very moment and expired in the arms of that monarch in the year of his age anno er on the works of eonardo da vinci thie pictures of this painter which are to be feen in the cabinets of princes and private men contain but very few figures and confels that have not feen clearly enough into what re- mains of his great compofitions to judge of the ex tent of his genius however what hiftorians have written of his works which are now almoft entirely ruined is fufficient to inform us that his vein was rich his movements lively his fenfe folid adorned with variety of knowledge and his inventions very beautiful we may fee that by his defigns which are sill in the hands of the curious and what we have left of his productions thews that he was great painter his defigns were very correct and of great golt though he feems to have formed it rather from nature than the antique yet fo as the antient fculptors did that is by judicious enquiries into the effects of nature and attributing to her not fo much her common productions as the perfections of which the is capable lconardo da vincis expreftions are very lively and fenfible have in my cuftody defign of his own hand of the famous fupper which he painted at milan which defign only is fufficient proof of his having penetrated far into the heart of man of his vivacity and with what variery and juftnets he reprefented all kinds of actions but rather than peak my own opinion in this matter it will be more to the purpofe to give the reader rubens on the merit of this great man he tb writes thus of him in laim manuscript the eriginal of robicb have by me and which have faithfully transtated as follows da vinei began by examining all ce as things according to the rules of an exact ce theory and then applied them to nature as it ot was for his purpofe he obferved decorum and all affectation he knew how to give every object the moft proper the moft specula- and the moft agreeable character that was cc poffible and exalred that of majefty even to di- ce vinity the order and meafure of his expreffions ce were managed fo as to fet the imagination at sc work and to raife it by the effential parts rather se than fill it by the minute in which however was neither prodigal nor coverous he was fo ec careful to avoid the confulion of objects that he sc chofe rather to leave fomething in his works to be ie defired than to furfeit the eyes with fcrupulous but his chiefeft excellence was as we sc have faid to give every thing its proper character ce and to diftinguith them one from another he oc began by confulting feveral authors our of whofe co writings he made common-place of what was oc moft remarkable and nothing efcaped him that to the expresfion of his subject and by so the heat of his fancy as well as by the folidity of ec his judgment he raifed divine things by human underftood how to give men thofe different that elevate them to the character of cc herees the beft of the examples which he has oe left us is our lord supper which he painted of at milan wherein he has reprefented the apoftles e places that fuit with them and our saviour in moft honourable the midft of all having no sc body near enough to press or incommode him co iis of his attitude is grave his arms are in loofe and oe free pofture to thew the greater grandeur white if the apoftles appear agitared from one fide to the other by the vehemence of their inquietude and in which there is however no meannefs nor indecent action to be feen in thort by his profound speculations he arrived to fuch degree cs of perfection that it feems to me impoffible to co speak fo well of him as he deferves and much to imitate him rubens after this enlarges on leonardo skill in anatomy he adds particular relation of his studies and of all the defigns that he made which rubens had feen among the curiofities of pompeio leoni at are he talks of the anatomy of horfes and the observation that lconardo had made on phifiognomy of which rubens had alfo feen his defigns and ends his difcourfe by the method which this painter took in meafuring human body if may be allowed to add any thing to what rubens has faid would take notice that he has not poken of leonardo colouring becaufe having carried his remarks no farther than to things relating to the perfection of his profeftion and finding no- thing good in leonardo colours he paffed by that part of painting leonardo carnations have too much of the lees-colour in them and the union in his pictures is too much tinctured with the violet which is there predominant this in my opinion proceeded from the painters of his time not know= ing well enough the ufe of oil and from the negli- gence of the florentines in the part of colouring pietro pe rug ino or at peroufa his parents were poor and ad put him at firft to painter of that town who taught him very little and ufed him very ill. his poverty made him parient and his defire to get fomething to bring him out of his mifery put him upon deligning night and day to advance himfelf as foon as he found he was able to ger his living he went to florence to find out better mafter and placed himfelf with andrea verrocchio lconardo da vinci was his difciple at the fame time peru- gino became kilful and acquired graceful man- ner in the airs of his heads which his mafter practifed especially the heads of women he drew great many pictures and almoft all of them for churches and convents one day as he was working in frefco for the monks at florence whofe mo- naftery is near the pindane gate the prior who fup- plied him with azure or ultra-marine would give him no more than he ufed in his prefence peru- gino feeing him fo miftruftful dipped his pencil in pot of water even before the prior himielf and wathed off the ulra-marine which funk to the dottom the prior wondered to fee his azure go away to faft and fearing he had not enough to hold out was going to get more but perugino empty- ing the water out of the pot and drying the ultra= marine that was at the bottom gave it to the prior taying co he should not another time miftruft of honour neverthelefs he was himself very covetous and miftruftful and being alfo very labori- ous he got money at florence and rome where he worked for pope sixtus iv and retired to pe- roufa in which city he made abundance of pictures by the help of raphael and his other difciples pe- rugino had very handfome wife by whom he drew all his pietures of the virgin mary he loved her paffionately but he loved his money no less and when he ufed to walk in fome fields which he had purchafed near peroufa he always carried the box with him in which he kept his gold rogue perceiving it robbed him of his treafure and pe= rugino emment pa in te was fo grieved at it that he died of forrow in the year of his age anno phael an born at urbin on good-friday in the year his father was an ordinary pain- ter and pietro perugino his mafter his chief works are in frefco in the hall of the varican and his cafel-pieces are difperted up and down in feveral parts of europe having an excellent underftand- ing he knew that the perfection of painting was not confined to perugino capacity and therefore he went to siena to feek out fome other means of advancing himfelf here his friend pinturrichio got him to be employed to make the cartoons for the pictures of the library but he had fcarce done one before he was tempted to remove to florence by the great noife which lconardo da vinci and michael angelos works made at that time as foon as he had confidered the manher of thofe two illuftrious painters he refolved to alter his own which he had learnt of perugino he returned to peroufa where he had opportunity enough to exer- cife his pencilz but the remembrance of leonardo da vincis works put him upon second journey to florence and after having worked there fome time to rrengthen his hand he went to rome where bramante his kinfman prepared the pope by good opinion of his merit for his favourable recep- tion and he was fet at work to paint the vatican raphael began by the picture which is called the chool of athens the dispure of the holy sacra- ment and the other pieces which are in the cham- ber of the apoftolic fignature his pains and care were incredible and they were fuccessful anfwerable to his induftry for the reputation of his work car- ries the name of raphaelthroughour the world he formed the ve of the delicacy of his gout after the antient statues and baffo relievos which he defigned long time with extreme application to this de- licacy he added grandeur of manner with which chapel at once in- the fight of michael angelo' spired him it was his friend bramante who brought him into the chapel concrary to the general order michael angelo had given him when he trufted him with the keys befides the pains that raphael was at in working after the ancient fculptures he hired people in greece and italy to defign for him all the antique pieces that could be found which as op- portunity offered he made ufe of it is obfervable that he has not left many if any at all of his works imperfect and that he finished his picturestoa nicety though he did them very quick he was extreme ly careful to give them fuch perfection that there might be nothing to be faid againft them and on this account it is that we fee still some drawings of pieces of pictures as hands feet and bits of dra- pery which he has defigned three or four times for the same subject and our of which he chofe that for his purpofe which was moft perfect though he was very laborious yet there are few pictures to be feen done by his own hand he spent moft of his time in defigning that he might find bufiness for the pietro bellori in his book intitled defirittione delle imagi- ni da rafacle nelle camere del vaticano demes this fory with all his might and pretends that raphael did not owe his great goat to any thing but his hudy of the antique yet vafari who knew michael angelo and raphael and was never contradicted by any author of thofe times on the contrary three other authors who have particularly writ the life of michael angelo have con- firmed what he fays affirms that he learned it of michael an gelo and what renders it very probable that raphael made his advantage of michael angelos works is defign that have of his own hand on the back of which is crawing of his defigned after one of the figures which michael angelo painted in the pope chapel t ii number of difciples that executed his defigns in feveral places chiefly in the lodgings and apart- ments of the vatican in the church of our lady of peace and in the palace of chigis which were all done by his pupils after his defigns except the gal- lery and one angle only where the three goddeffes are painted which was done by himself his good nature got him the love of all people especially of the popes his cotemporaries cardinal bibiano of- fered him his niece in marriage and raphael was engaged to her but pope leo having given him hopes of cardinal ’ cap he made no hafte to marry her his paftion for the fair fex deftroyed him in the flower of his age for one day after he had aban doned himself to women with excels he was taken very ill of burning fever and the phyficians from whom he concealed the true caufe of his dif- temper having dealt by him as if he had pleu- rify quite extinguished the little fire that was left in his body he died on the same day that he was born good-friday anno in the thirty fe

genius was fublime his thoughts fine his vein fruirful and would have appeared much more fo had it not been moderated by the nicety with which he finifhed his pieces he was rich in his inventions and his manner of difpoting of the things he invented was very deli- cate if his figures were not grouped by lights and thadows they were fo ingenioutly done by their actions that the groupes were always viewed with pleafure his attitudes are noble according to their condition contrafted without affectation expreftive natural and fuch as always expofe the beautiful parts his defigns were very correct

the airs of his heads which he copied from nature the mother of diverfity and always accompanied with noble how character in defign emment er expreffions are juft ingenious elevated and touching they are moderate without coldnets and lively without exaggeration the manner of his draperies was poor at firft but had great gollt at laft and were fetwith beauty and artifice the order of his folds are fine and shews the naked where it appears to the beft advantage and chieffy about the oints however he may be blamed for drefting almoft all his figures in the fame ftuffs whereas he might have changed them with reafon and for the orna- ment of his fubjects speak of hiftorical ones for as to fabulous and allegorical in which divinities are introduced the painter ought to have more regard to the majetty of the folds than to the richness of the ruffs raphael being nicely careful to defign correctly and it we may fo fay jealous of his our-lines he has marked them fomewhat too hard his pencil though light and united is however dry his landlkips are neither handfome nor of great goiit his local colours are neither fhining nor thock- ing they are neither very true nor very falfe but his fhadows are little too black he never had clear understanding of the claro obfcuro though it appears by his laft pieces that he fought after ir and endeavoured to acquire it as may be feen in his sapettries of the acts of the apoftles and in his pictures of the transfiguration but whatever ra- phael wanted in colouring was over-looked in the abundance of the other parts of painting of which he was mafter and he has even done fome portraits with respect to lights and colours to well that they may enter into the comparifon with titians as well as the st john in monfieur the prefident cabiner which for all the parts of painting deferves to be reckoned the author ’ mafter-piece pouffin tbe live of he was an angel pouffin faid of raphael ce compared with the modern painters but an afs in comparifon of the ancients hisjudgment of him relates only to his thoughts his gollf his juttness of defign and his expreftions the thoughts of the ancients are fimple fublime and natural fo are ra- phaels the antique defign is correct varied ac- cording to decency and of great goit raphaels is the fame the antique way of the collocation of the mufcles is learned exact and delicate in their offices raphael was not ignorant of this part yet we muft confels that thofe who have frudied anatomy as it relates to painting may obferve more exactness in the antique and more delicacy in the actions of the mufcles in the ancient pictures than in not only raphaels but in any other modern painter ’ whatfoever allow that this great juftnets and great deli- cacy in the action of the mufcles regulates the ex- altness of the out-lines but do not fee that raphael was to much out of the way as to be reckoned an ass in comparifon of the antiques it is true ra- phael formed the grandeur of his gout from the fine ftatues of antiquity and that when he came from his mafter perugino they put him into right way he followed them implicitly at firft but at laft perceiving that the road of painting was dif- terent from that of fculpture he took from them no more than was jutt proper for his art and as he grew older and wifer he left off the reft this difference is eafily to be perceived in the pietures which he painted at different times the latter of which came neareft the character of nature on the contrary pouffin and annibal caracci quitted their character of nature according as they grew more and more fond of the antique they should have done as raphael did do one and not omit the other for this excelient man not only retained eminent the good godt of the antique its grandeur and beauty but alfo fpied out one thing which neither pouffin nor the caracci ever faw and that was grace which gift of nature was given him fo plentifully that he pread it over every thing that came out of his hands and no body can dispure the preference with him in it except corregio who wanted his regularity of defign raphael made ufe of grace to fer off all the other parts of painting which he poffeft the poffeffion of which acquired him the reputation of the beft painter in the world girolomo geng urbin was disciple of pietro perugino at the fame time with raphael he parti- cularly applied himfelf to architecture and died in the year aged romano the favourite difciple of raphael as well on account of his skill in painting as for the agreement there was in their manners he en- tirely followed his mafter golt not only in the execution of the defigns he gave him but alfo in thofe he made himfelf raphael treated him like father and left him his heir jointly with gio- vinni francefco penni il fattore after raphael' death thefe two painters finifhed feveral pictures which their mafter had left imperfect julio ro- mano was not only an excellent painter but alfo un- derfood architecture perfectly well the cardinal di medicis who was afterwards pope clement vil employed him to build the palace which is at this day called la vigne madame and when he had finished the archicecture he did the painting and other decorations the li ve of death of leo was blow to julio ros mano for had his fucceffor adrian vi reigned bove year the fine arts in rome would have been extinguished and all the artifts had starved but clement vil fucceeding him painting and painters began to revive as foon as he was cholen pope he fer julio romano at work to paint the hall of conflantine where raphael had begun the hiftory of that emperor which he had defigned this work being finished he drew feveral pictures for churches and private perfons his manner began to change at laft his colouring into black and red and his defign into the fevere frederico di conzaga marquits of mantua hear- ing of julio ’ capacity inviced him to that city his good fortune directed him thither for having made the defigns of twenty lewd prints which marc antonio engraved and for which arctine made the inscriptions in verfe he had been feverely punished for it had he stayed in rome as the treat- ment marc antonio met with fufficiently proves he was thrown into goal where he fuffered great deal and it had coft him his life if the intereft of the cardinal di medicis and baccio bandinelli had not faved him in the mean time julio romano followed his bufinets ar mantua where he has leit eternal proofs of his great ability he built the palace and made the city of mantua finer rronger and healchier than before as to his painting we may affirm it was at mantua chiefly that julio romano genius took wing and he shewed himfelf to be what he was he died there in the fifty fourth year of his age anno to the great grief of the marquits who loved him as his brother he had fon and daughter who fur- vived him the fons name was raphael the daugh- ter married hercules malarcica among his dif ciples the beft are prunaticcio who came into france emnent and one of mantua named rinaldi who died young reflections on the works of mano tlio romano was the firft the moft learned and the moft perfevering difciple of raphael his imagination which was as it were buried in the execution of the defigns of his mafter as long as he was his difciple when the faw herfelf free took wing at once or rather as forrent that being penned up breaks over its banks and runs with an impetuous courfe fo julio romano after having pro- duced feveral cafel-pieces and painted great works in the vatican-hall from raphael defigns before and after the death of his illuftrious mafter pre- fently changed his manner when his genius was at liberty and fuffered it to take its rapid courfe as is to be feen in his paintings at wantua however it was not that graceful vein nor that foft fire of fancy which though borrowed before yet made it doubr- ful to decide whether fome of the pictures were his or his matters when he was entirely free and the piece all his own he animated it with ideas more fevere more extraordinary and even more expref- five but lets natural than the works of raphael his inventions were adorned by poefy and his dif- pofitions uncommon and of good goit his ffudies of police learning were of great service to him in his painting for in defigning the antique tculptures he drew thofe proofs of learning which we observe in his pictures it feems by his works that his thoughts were wholly taken up with the grandeur of his poetical ideas and that to execute them with the fame fire that he conceived them he contented himfelf with the practice of defign which he had chofen with- out li ve of varying the airs of his heads or his draperies ir is vifible alfo that his colouring which was never very good became worfe at laft for his local colours which were compofed of brick-colour and black were not supported by any inrelligence of the claro obfcuro his fierce way of defigning and his terrible expreftions became to habirual to him that his works are eafy to be known this manner is very great it is true being formed after the antique baffo relievos which he had care- fully ftudied and especially the trajan and anto- nine pillars which he defigned throughout yer thefe fine things which are fufficient of themselves to make skilful fculptor muft be accompanied with the verities of nature to form great painter the draperies which commonly contribute to the ma- jefty of figures are the shame of his being poor and of an ill gout there is little variety to be feen in the airs of his heads that which is to be found in his works confifts only in the different kinds of objects of which his compofitions are full and in the adjutt- ments which enrich them and proceeds from the univerfality of his genius for all fores of painting he did all well alike landskips and animals by which means his productions for what they contain will always be admired by the judicious giovanni francisco penni surnamed fattore iils laft name was given him for his good hulbandry in managing raphaels expences when he lived with him which was to the time of his death julio romano being his fellow difciple he was very skilful especially indefigning he has done great many things from raphael thoughts which eminent in pats for raphael own doing particularly in the palace of chigi as one may obferve by examin- ing them with artention hle had particular in- clination for landfkips which he painted very well and cnriched them with fair buildings after his mafters death he affociated himfelf with julio romana and pierino del vaga thefe three together finished what raphael left imperfect as well the hiftory of conftantine as other works in the palace of belvedere they feparated on occa- fion of copy that the pope would have done of the picture of the transfiguration which was de- tigned for the court of france and fattore went to naples intending to work for the marquits del vafto but his conftitution was fo delicate that he did not live long for he died in the fortieth year of his age anno giovanni francifco brother whom we have been speaking of he worked while with pierino del vaga his brother-in-law at ge- nod and other places of ltaly he went thence into england where he did feveral things for king henry vill and for fome merchants he was alfo employed by francis at fontainbleau and at laft applied himfelf to graving andre del artc florence was taylor fon his father put him to goldfmith with whom he lived feven years during which time he minded defigning more than his own trade from the goldfmith he re- moved to an ordinary painter called giovanni ba- rile whom he foon left to go to florence and enter himfelf with pietro cofimo while he lived with birl him he fet apart all sundays and holidays to delign after the beft mafters especially lconardo da vinci and michael angelo which in few years taught him his art he thought his own mafter too flow in the execution of his works for which reafon he left him and became acquainted with francifco bigio they lived together and painted feveral things in florence and thereabouts for the monafteries he drew great many madonna he is cenfured for making ufe of albert durers prints in piece which he did for the carmelites baccio bandinelli would have learned to paint of him but andrea puiting him upon difficult works at firft it difgulted bandinelli to that he applied himfelf wholly to iculpturc andrea reputation increating he made pictures for feveral places and among others one which got him the praifes of the judicious and is one of the beft things he ever did mean st sebaltian for the church of st gal he came into france upon the invitation of fran- he painted feveral things there and though he had begun the picture of st ferom for the queen he left that work and got leave of the king to re- turn to florence precending to fetch his wife from whom he faid he had received very prefting letter to come to her but inftead of recurhing at the time apponned he spent the money he brought out of france and even that he had received of the king to buy pictures at laft having worked fome time with francifco bigio for fubfiftance he died of the plague at florence abandoned even by his wife and his friends in the year aged years hie left leveral pupils viz giacomo da

had defired that prince to give him the original he did it with to much juftness that julio romano who drew the drapery of that piece under raphael took his copy for the original and told vafars who difabuted him ce do not fee the firokes that co struck with my own hand but vafari thewing him del sarto mark he was convinced of his mif- take giaco mo da pantor mc tufcany was at thirteen years of

skies pan- torimo was never fatisfied with what he did but the praifes that were given him kept him in heart he did feveral things at florence that got him reputa- tion having undertaken to paint the chapel of st laurence for the duke of florence and aming in that work which lafted twelve years to excel all others he on the contrary came thort of himfelf he was man of honour and very humble he had one quality and the moft commendable one in the world which is rarely to be met with in his pro- feftion which was that he would never fuffer any one to peak againft thofe that were abfent all his pieces were done in florence where he died of droply anno aged years bacc ve baccio bandinelli sborn at florence his nname was barte- lomeo hich was turned into the diminu- tive baccio his father was geldfimith and his mafter glovannr francifco ruftico good fculp- for whom lconardo da vinci ufed often to vifit for ruftico was bred up by andrea verroechic as well as leonardo verrocchio being fculpter painter and architect and underftanding the mathe- maties very well though baccio bandinelli had gone through all the ftudies neceffary for an excel- lent painter his pictures were not liked on account of the colouring which was worth nothing his ill success occafioned his abandoning painting and fol- lowing fculpture in which he became very skilful he had to great an efteem for his own works that he compared them with michael angelos whofe reputation was great grief to him his produc tions are at rome and florence where he died in the year of his age anno da caravag called from the place of his birth village of that name in the dutchy of milan he came to rome at the time when pope leo was railing some new edifices in the vaticah and knowing not how to get his bread otherwife for he was very young he hired himself to carry flones and mortar for the mafons who were at work about that build- ing he did this till he was eighteen years of age at the same time raphael employed feveral young painters in the fame place to execute his defigns polidoro who often carried them the mortar with which they made their frefco was touched with the fight of the paintings and folicited by his genius to turn painter he at firft tied himfelf to the works of giovanni odine and the pleafure he took to fee eminent that painter work firred up the talent which he had for painting he was very officious and complai fant to the oung painters and made an acquaintance with them to whom communicating his intention they gave him leffons which emboldened him to pro- ceed he heartily fer himfelf to defigning and ad- vanced fo prodigioully that raphael was aftonished and fome time after fet him to work with the other young painters but he diftinguished himfelf fomuch from all of them that as he had the greatelt fhare in executing his defigns in the varican to he had the greateff glory the care which he had feen his mafter take in defigning the anique fculptures shewed him the way to do the like he spent whole days and nights in defigning thofe beaunful things and stu- died antiquity to nicery the works with which he has enriched the frontilpieces of feveral buildings at rome thew the pains he took in fludying the an tique he did very few eafel-pieces moft of his pro- ductions are in frefco and of the fame colour in imitation of the baffo relievo in this fort of painting he made ufe of the manner called foratch- cd confifting in preparation of black ground on which is placed white plaifter and taking off this white with an iron bodkin we difcover through the holes the black which ferves for fhadows scrarched work lafts longeft but being very rough is unplea- fant to the fight he affociared himfelf at firft with maturino and the conformity of their genius' made them companions in their fludies and bu- finess they lived together like brothers and their friendship lafted rill the death of marurino who died of the plague anno polidoro after having by maturino affiltance filled rome with his pieces thought to have enjoyed his cafe and the fruit of his labours when the spaniards in the year befieged that ciry and all the men of ve of art were forced to fly or elfe were ruined by the miferies of war polidoro refolved to retire to na- ples where he was obliged to work for ordinary painters and had no opportunity to make himself taken notice of for the neapolitan nobility were in thofe days more folicitous to get good horfes than good pictures seeing himfelf therefore without bufinefs and forced to spend what he had got at rome he went to sicily and underftanding archi- recture as well as painting the citizens of meffina employed him to prepare the triumphal arches for the reception of charles coming from tunis which work being finifhed polidorofinding nothing to be done there anfwerable to the grandeur of his genius and having no temptation to stay but the careffes of woman he loved he thought of return- ing to rome to that end he drew his money out of the bank of meffina which his man underftanding the night before his intended departure he confe- derated himfelf with other rogues feized him in his bed strangled him and stabbed him after they had committed this murder they carried the body to the door of his miftrefs that it might be thought he was killed there by fome rival yet god in his providence to ordered it that the murder was difcovered the affaffins fied and every body pitied polidoro untimely fate his man who did not fear any one miftrufting he had hand in his mafter death came to make his lamentations over him as well as the reft sicilian count one of polidoro ’ friends obferved his grief was not at all natural and futpecting him to be concerned in the crime had him apprehended he defended him- felf very ill he was put to the torture confeft all and was condemned to be drawn to pieces by four herfes the cirizens of meffina were mighty forry for pelidoro death and honourably buried him their cathedral church he was in his eight and fortieth year when this fate befel him anno on the works of polidoro dolidoro as defirous as he was to learn thought he could not do berter than tread in his mafter' reps and knowing raphael had formed his goiit of defign after the antique ftarues he affiduoully ap- plied himfeff to ftudy them and the principal bufi- ness of his life was to imitate them as may be feen by fome beautiful remains of his works on the fron- tifpieces of feveral houfes in rome were he has painted fome baffo relievos of his own invention his genins which was extraordinary lively and fruitful and his fudying the antique baffo re- lievo made him incline to reprefent battles facri- fices vafes trophies and thofe ornaments which are moft remarkable in antiquities but what is altogether furprizing is that not- withttanding his great application to antique fculp- tures he perceived the neceffity of the claro obicuro in painting and was almoft the only painter of the roman chool who made it principle of the art and put it in practice indeed the great maffes of lights and fhadows which are in his pictures thew he was convinced that the eyes of the spectator wanted repofe to view picture with eafe it is from this principle that in the frezes which he painted with whice and black his objects are grouped fo artfully that it is impoftible for any to be more beautiful his love of the anrique did not hinder his hudy- ingnature and his gout of defign which was very great and very correct was mixture of the one and the other his hand was ealy and excellent and the airs of his heads bold noble and expreffive his live thoughts were fublime -his difpoficions full of attitudes well cholen his draperies well fety and his landskips of good gout his pencil was light and foft but after the death of raphael who employed him in the paintings of the vatican he very feldom coloured his pieces applying himfelf altogether to work in frefco with the claro ob= icuro polidoro genius was very much like julio ro- manos their conceptions were lively and formed after the gout of the antique their defign was great and fevere and their way new and extraor- dinary the difference between them was that julio romano animated his poetical compofitions by the impetuofity of his vein only and polidoro al- ways made ufe of the contralt as the moft powerful means to give life and motion to his works poli- doro genius appears alfo to be more natural more pure and more regulated than julio romanos ndr cos mo mortvo da pel ere the firft that brought ornaments in ufe in the modern painting they were both very skilful and worked in the claro obfcuro in the manner which the italians term fgrafitti feratcht-work andrea lived years and mor tuo for want of bufiness turned foldier he was killed in battle between the venetians and the turks at years of age born at florence and had no mafter to reach him the art of painting he ap- plied himfelf to the ftudy of michael angelos wotks in er eminent but formed to himfelf particular htile his genius was fervile and his manner of defigning though learned was little wild he did feveral things at rome and peroufa in raphael time his misfortunes brought him into france where francis gave him penfion and the fuperinten- dency of the buildings ar fontainbleau he was alfo made canon of the chapel-reyal and by the king favour and his own merit acquired great reputation we may fee what mafter he was by his performances in the gallery of fontainbleau roffo was handfome and had improved himfelf by the knowledge of the fciences but he fullied all his rare qualities by his death which he shamefully brought on himfeif for having caufed his intimate friend francefco pellegrino to be apprehended on sufpicion of having robbed him of confiderable fum he was delivered over to the magiftrates who put him to the rack which pellegrino endured and was declared innocent being cleared he publifhed pamphlet againft coffo who thinking he could never appear afterwards with honour fent to elun for poiton pretending to want varnith and taking the dofe it killed him at fontanbleau in the year in the year of his age francesco ma megiano rom the place of his birth he was born in the city of parma anno he learne painting of two of his coufins and by the vivacity and readinets of his wit in little while advanced greatly in the art the character of raphael and michael angelo works incired him to go to rome at twenty years of age he audied the beft things and tbe li ves particularly raphael painting with great car- neftness he drew feveral pieces which got him re- putation and the favour of pope clement vil he minded his bufiness fo ftrenuoully that the very day on which the spaniards entered rome and pillaged it the foldiers found parmegiano working quietly as protogenes was of old at the fiege of rhodes this fecurity furprized the spaniards who firft entered his houfe and they were to touched with the beauty of his painting that they left him without doing him any harm but fome of their comrades came afterwards and took away all he had upon this he returned into his own country and paffing through bologna was stopped there good while by bufiness that fell in his way which having finifhed he went to farma and painted there very much he played well on the lute and often spent more time on it than on his painting he was jultly blamed for giving himfelf over fo much to chymiftry that he not only left off his profeffion but alfo the care of his perfon and became perfect lavage he engraved fome of his defigns in wood with the claro obfcuro and fome he etched being the firtt that practifed that fort of graving at leaft in italy he kept one antoniofrontano graver in his houfe whorobbed him of all his plates as well of copper as of wood and alfo of all his defigns which made parmegianorun almoft mad though the beft part of them were recovered at laft he fo abandoned himself to chymiftry that he walted his time his money and his health and died in miferable condition of diarrhcea accompanied with fever in the g year of his age anno .. on the works of parmegiano armegiano genius was altogether gay and ele- gant and though he invented things with cale yet he did not strive fo much to fill his compofi- tions with agreeable objects as to defign his figures with graceful air and to give them attiuudes which might show the beautiful parts and infufe life and action into the whole.. but his understanding being of no great extent his intentiveness to finith every particular figure leffened very much the beauty of his exprestion in general his thoughts were befides too common and we do not find that he had perietrated very far into the heart of man or underffood the paffions however though the grace of his works is but fuperficial yet it neverthelels furprifing and charming his invention was ready his attitudes were very graceful to were his heads and it is vitible that he endeavoured more to pleafe this way than by the juft expreftion of his subject he did not confult nature much who is the mother of variety he reduced her to habit which he contracted grace- ful it is true but it was his own and funk into what we call manner the painter who looks upon nature as his object ought to confider her in the variety as well as in the number of her effects and if we forgive him any reiteration in the fame piece it muft be only in his defigns for which there is no need of confulting nature to exactly nor to take the fame care as in picture know alfo that whatever drafts the painters in their ftudies make after nature their particular gout confines them to certain things which they fall upon infen- fibly it can not be denied but parmegiano has often reiterated the fame airs and the fame pro- portion yet his choice is to fine that what has pleated the li ves of us in any one of his works will always pleafe us whereever we meet with it his goit of defign is loofe and learned but has too much of idea and manner in it he affected to make the extremities of his members delicate and fomewhat lean his attitudes are noble lively and agreeably contrafted his airs of the head rather graceful than of great gufto his expref- fions general and without character his draperies light and well contrafted it is true the stuff is al- moft always the fame and the folds are very carelefs yet being but few they give godt of grandeur to the parts they cover they are often loofe and flowing which adds great deal of motion to his figures but the caufe of it is not always juft notwithftanding the vivacity of his wit and the agility of his pencil he drew very few pictures spending moft of his time in making defigns and engraving them upon plates the little have seen of his painting gives me clear idea of tole- rable claro obfcuro but his local colour is very or- dinary and common it was this parmegiano who by the means of two copper plates found out the secret of printing on mezzotinto paper the black and white and thus to give more roundness to his prints yet he did not continue the ufe of this in- veation long it requiring too much care befides his ordinary prints were fo much valued by every body and even by feveral able mafters of painting that he did not think it worth his while to be at the trouble of making others pierino del born in tufcany where he was poorly bred and was hardly two years old when his mother died his father was foldier and his nurfe the-goar he came young to florence and wvas eminent put to grocer who afed to fend him to the painters with colours and pencils he learned of them at times to defign and in little while be came the moft fkilful of all the young painters in florence an ordinary painter whole name was vaga took him with him to rome and from his living with him he was called del vaga for his right name was buonacorfi at rome he worked half the week for painters and the other half to- rether with all sundays and holidays he spent in hudy and defigning he had fomething of every thing that was good in his compofitions fome times he might have been found among the ruins feeking after the antique ornaments or defigning the baffo relievos fometimes in michael angelo chapel and fomerimes in the halls of the vatican he alfo ftudied anatomy and other fciences necet- fary to his profeftion he got fo much knowledge by his induftry that he was foon known to the beft mafters and raphael employed him jointly with giovanni udine and others to help him in the execution of his defigns of all his cotemporary artifts none underftood the ornaments and decora- tions of painting to well as he nor more boldly fol- lowed raphael ’ guito as is to be feen by the pic- tures in the varican lodgings which were per- formed by him viz the paftage of the river for- dan the fall of the walls of jericho the barcle in which johhna commanded the sun to fland htill our saviour nativity baptifim and laft fupper ra- phael friendship for him procured him other con- fiderable works in the vatican and pierino thewed his gratitude by his particular affection to him but the plague driving him out of rome he returned to florence where having painted fome pieces he went back to rome raphael being dead he joined with julio romano and franceico il fattore to finith the works in the vatican which were left ive of imperfect by their mafter and to confirm their friendship he married franceico fifter in the year yet they were feparated two years afterwards when the spaniards befieged rome pierino was taken prifoner and forced to pay large fum for his ranfom he went to genoa where he was employed by prince doria to paint palace which he was then building in this work he made ufe of cartoons the convenience of which he difcovered to one geronimo trevifano painter who had laughed at them and to others who came to him to learn the advantage of them from thence he re- moved to pifa intending at his wife request to fettle there but after he had drawn fome pictures he returned to genoa and worked again for prince dorid he then went second time to pifa and from thence to rome where pope paul and cardinal farnefe gave him to much work that he was forced to commit the execution of it to others and conrent himfelf with making the defigns at the same time the pope fent for titian to rome which made pierino to jealous and grieved him fo much that he did what he could to oblige him not to stay there long and to haften back to venice in which he fucceeded the multiplicity of pierino bufinels and his vivacity in his perfor- imances drained his pirits in the flower of his age at two and forty years old he spent his time wholly in vifiting his friends and lived pleafantly cill his forty-feventh year when he died of an apoplexy anno on the works of ier ino del a fall raphael difciples pierino del vaga kept the character of his mafter longelt mean his exterior character and as we fay his manner of delign- emment for he wanted very much of the fineness of raphael thinking he had particular genius for the decoration of places according to their cultoms his invention in this kind of painting was very ingenious grace and order are every where to be met with and his difpofitions which are ordinary in his pictures are wonderful in his ornaments fome of them he has made little and tome great and placed them both with to much art that they fet off one another by comparifon and by the contralt his figures are difpofed and defigned according to raphaels gufto and if raphael gave him at firft fome light skerches of ornaments as he did to giovanni udine he exe- cuted them to admiration and by the habit he con- tracted and by the vivacity of his wit he acquired in this fort of painting an univerfal reputation the tapeftries of the feven planets in feven pieces which pierino defigned for diana de poitiers and which are now at monficur the firtt prefident is fufficient confirmation of what have faid ciot anni .udin as to called from udine in friuli where he was born anno when he was very young he went to venice and his inclination leading him to painting he pur himself to gior- gione whofe disciple he was feveral years from thence he went to rome where balthazar cafti- glioni secretary to the duke of manrua prefented him to raphael giovanni dine did figures very well yet his mafter-piece was animals efpe- cially birds to the ftudy of which he particularly applied himfelf and wrote treatife of the latter he carefully examined the antique ornaments and took delight in painting after nature thofe inani- mate objects that ferve for the decoration of pictures ve was the eafieft and readieft way to glory for this reafon raphael employed him about the orna ments of his pictures especially thofe in ftucco which he underftood very well the mufical in rruments in raphael picture of st cecilia at bologna were done by duudine as alfo all the de- corations of the paintings of the popes lodgings and thofe of la vigne madame we are indebted to him for reviving the art of ftucco and the way of uling it he found out the true matter which the antients made ufe of in this fort of work being compofition of lime and marble powder very fine which the modern artifts have ever fince put in practice he was in hopes that pope leo who was very well pleafed with his labours would have rewarded him bur feeing himfelf difappointed by his holiness death he took diftafte to painting and retired to udine some time after he quitted his profeftion he had mind to go to rome out of devotion and though he was difgiited like pilgrim and mingled among the rabble vafari meeting him by chance at the pauline gate knew him and per- fuaded him to paint for pope pius iv for whomm giovanni udine afterwards did the decorations of feveral pieces he loved fports fo well that he is thought to have been the inventor of the

re- turned to siena did feveral pictures in oil and dif- temper and fome confiderable pieces in frefco which brought him into credit but what fupport- ed his reputation long time was his work of the pavement of the great church in siena this per- formance was of the kind of claro obfcuro and was done by means of two forts of ftones the one white for the lights and the other brown for the fhadows and thefe fones being thus joined in the dimentions agreeable to the claro obfcuro of the objects which were to be reprefented the artift by making deep holes and filling them up with black pirch

fe- veral of his deligas in wood was good sculptor and founder of which he gave fufficient proofs in genoa whither he went towards the latter end of his life and having left many proofs of his induftry and capacity died there in the year of his axe anno baltha ar peru the fame city of siena was famous at the fame time he painted in the palace of ghigi in the churches and on the frontifpieces of several houfes in rome.. he underftood perfectly the mathematies and architecture and revrved the ancient decorations of the liage as he thewed in reign of leo when cardinal bernardo da bibiena had the play called la callandra one of the beft italian dramatic pieces reprefented for the entertainment of the pope balthazar made the feenes and adorned them with fo many places firects

chirlandaio the pro- gress he made raifed the jealouty of his fellow-dif- ciples to much that forngiano one of them gave him blow on the nofe the marks of which he carried to his grave he thought the beft way to be revenged on him was to overcome him in his pro= feffion and by his fudies and productions to put an end to the competition of his companions and acquire the efteem of perfons of the beft quality and intereft which he did effectually he erected an academy of painting and sculpture at florence under the protection of lorenzo de me- live who was lover of the fine arts he was bellowing his care and application upon it when the troubles of the houfe of medicis obliged him to remove to bologna from whence he went to ve- nice and from thence returned in little while to florence it was about this time he made an image of cupid carried it to rome broke off one of its arms and buried it keeping the arm by him he buried it in place which he knew was to be dugup and the cupid being found was fold to the cardinal of st gregory for antique michael angelo difcovered the fallacy to him by shewing him the arm he had preferved for that purpofe the works he performed at rome and braman tes advice whom raphael had intligated to it put the pope on painting his chapel and employing mi- chael angelo about it michael fent for feveral florentine painters to affift him among whom were graunachio bugiardino and giuliano di san gallo the latter underftanding frefco very well which michael angelo knew little of the painting being finifhed moft of the painters and particularly ra- phaels expectations were baulked for he had never defired his friend bramante to procure that em- ployment for his competitor had he not thought the talk greater than he could gothrough with bra- mante as we have faid in the life of raphael was entrufted by nichael angelo with the key of the chapel and an order to let no body whofoever fee his work however he once admitted raphael who found the painting to be of fogreat gufto of delign that he refolved to make his advantage of it and indeed in the firft picture which raphael produced afterwards and that was the prophet haiah for the church of st auftin michael angelo immediately difcovered bramante treachery this paltage is the greateft praife that can be given to michael an gelos works and is at the fame time proof of raphael' emnent love of his art that he would make ufe of what was good even in the works of his ene- mies not fo much for his own glory as forthe glo- ry of his profeffion upor the death of julius ii michael angelo went to florence where he made that admirable piece of fculpture the tomb of the duke of flo- rence he was interrupted by the wars the ciri obliging him to work on the fortifications of the city but forefeeing that their precautions would be ufeless he moved from florence to ferrara and thence to venice the doge gritti would fain have entertained him in his service but all he could get out of him was defign of the bridge rialto for michael angelo was an excellent architect as one may fee by the palace of farnefe by his own houfe and by the capitol which is an edifice of great gout when he returned to florence he painted the fable of læda with jupiter turned into swan for the duke of ferrara which piece being not nough effeemed he fent it by minio his difciple into france together with two boxes of defigns the beft and greateft part of his thoughts francis bought the lxda and put it up at fontainbleau and the defigns were difperted up and down by the fudden death of minio the amorous paftion of this lx da was reprefented fo lively and folasciviouly that monficur de noyers nunifter of ftare ordered it to be burnt out of fcruple of confcience by the command of paul iii michael angelo painted his famous piece of the latt judgment which is an inexhauftible ffore of fcience for all thofe that would dive to the bottom of it the defign is of great gufto he took an incredible deal of pains to reach the perfection of his art he cc loved folitude and ufed to fay that painting was jealous and required the whole man to her- selt being alked why he did not marr he was his wife and his works children michael angelo had great ideas which he did not borrow from his mafters flis rudying after the antique and the elevation of his genius inspired him with them.his defigis were learned and correct and the gufto if may ufe phrafe terrible and if tome perfons can not find in them the elegance of the anuque they muff al- low that his gufte is rich and that common nature in comparifon with it is poor raphael as we have gbterved was obliged to him for the altegation of his manner which he learned at the fight of pope sixtus chapel for before that he had still too much of perugino in his compo- there are feveral perfons who though they confels michael angelofs thoughts are great yet not allow them to be natural and think they afe fomerimes extravagant they fay alfo that his defigns are learned they are overcharg ed that he has taken too many licences againtt the rules of perspective and that he did not understand colouring of which we shall fay more in our refter sions on his works it is enough to let the world know that this great man was beloved and efteemed by all the fovereign princes of his time and that he will be sill the admiration of pofterity he died at rome anno at years of age colmo di medicis ordered his body to be secretly unburied and brought to florence where he was interred in the church of santa croce in which magnificent obfequies were performed for him and his tomb is to be feen in marble confifting of three figures painting sculpfure and architecture all of his own hand re- .. on the works michaee el.. il ichaee angel was one of the firlt that baniffed the little manner and the remainders of the gothic out of iraly his genius was of valt extent and his temper made his guito incline to feverity and caprice yet among his capri- cious imaginations if there are fome things extra- vagant there are others fingularly beautiful and of what kind foever his thoughts were they were always great the crities of that age preferring the excellence of defign to all the other parts of painting mi- chael angelo ftudied it with incredible affiduity and arrived to great knowledge of that art as may be feen by his pictures and fculptures yet he did not join the purity and elegance of the contours or out-lines to his grand gufto for having made his observations on the body of man as it is in its greateft force he drew the members of his fi- gures t powerful and as we fay loaded his de- lign not that he neglected the antique but he was not willing to be indebred for his art to any thing but himfelf he alfo examined nature whom he looked upon as his object more than the antique fta- tues which he did not think fit to copy he un- derftood perfectly well the knitting of the bones the joining of the members the origin infertions and offices of the mufcles and indeed he was fo confcious of his own skill that he took too much care to let the spectator fee it for he expreft the parts of the body fo ftrongly that he feemed to forget that there was fkin above the mufcles which foftened them however he has obterved this more in his tculpture than in his puinnings flis tbe ve af attitudes are for the moft part difagrec- able the airs of his heads fierce his draperies not open enough and his expreffions not very natural yet as wild as his productions are thereis elevation in

drynels which he learnt of pictro pe- rugino michael angelo knew very little of colouring his carnations have too much of the brick-colour for the lights and of black for the shadows though it is not certain whether he coloured his pictures himself or whether he employed fome florentine painters whom he fent for to help him in his great undertakings the pictures which fra baltiano drew after michael angelo defigns are not like the others the colouring is better and has fomething of the venetian gufto to return to the defigns of michael angelo which are the moft valuable part of his productions if they are not entirely perfect there is fo much fcience in them that his works will contribute great deal towards making ftu- dents mafters if they have difcernment enough to ufe them as they ought nevertheless it would be matter of wonder if michael angelos reputation had lived till now in cafe his knowledge of fculp- fure and of civil and military architecture had not been more celebrated than his skill in painting sebastiano da venetla commonly called fra bast iano del pio mbo ook his name from an office given him by pope clement vil in the lead-mines he was born ar venice

justify the choice fra baltiano had made of him for his mafter rather than ra- phael for the painters of rome were at that time divided fome were for raphael and some for ni chael angelo fra baftiano would not only not make choice of raphael for his mafter but he fer up for his competitor to which end he drew the picture of the transfiguration at the fame time that raphael made his for francis in this picture he reprefents the refurrection of lazarus the piece is at norbonne after raphael ’ death fra baftiano by his own merit and the protection of michael angelo be- came the chief painter in rome julio romano only disputed that title with him certain it is fra baltiano manner was grand and it is enough to fay that his works were like michael angelos for the defign and like giorgione for the colour- ing he was long time about his pictures which was the reafon he left many of them imperfect there is very fine one of his the vifitation of the virgin in the chapel royal at fontainbleau fra baltiano notwithflanding his preference of michael angelo to raphael quarrelled with the former who was angry with him for actempting to paint picture in oil contrary to his opinion hlis mafter

horfe in brafs which is in palace royale at paris this horfe was intended for the ftatue of henry ii but daniel had not time to finith it.his extraor- dinary application to his bufiness and his melan- choly humour haftened his death which put an end to his labours in the year of his age anno primaticcio as of noble family in bologna his friends perceiving he had violent inclina- tion to defign permitted him to go to mantua where he was fix years difciple to julio romano he became fo skilful in that time that he made bartles in ftucco and baffo relieve better than any of the young painters

civil and military he firft shewed his capacity at rome and acquired repir tation there but whatever fuccess his works had the workman was very unfortunate either for that he did not know what price to fet on his pieces or that he could never be contenred he was fo cha- grined at his ill fortune that he would often be moan it and one day pope gregory kiil going out at the gate angelies to take

cholen by the citizens of mi- lan to be fuperintendant of the building they were about to add to their cathedral church from thence philip ii invired him into spain to direct the painting and architecture of the efcurial he painted very much there and fo pleafed the king that he gave him one hundred thouland crowns and honoured him with the title of marquits pel- legrino loaden with riches and honour returned to milan and died there in the beginning of the pon- tificate of clement viil being about threefcore and ten years old francesco salyiati florentine was at firft difciple of andrea del sarto in whofe houfe he became acquainted with vafari who was alfo andrea del sarto dif ciple they both of them left andrea to place themfelves with baccio bandinelli where they learnt more in two months than they had done before in two years francefco being grown mafter car- dinal salviati rook him into his fervice and it is on that account that he had the name of salviati given him his manner of defigning came very near raphaels and he performed well in frefco diftem- per and oil he went to paris in the year li ve of and did feveral things for the cardinal of lorrain who was not over well pleated with them which difgufted salviati as much as the favour and reputa- tion of roffo at whofe works he had it feems railed plentifully when fearing the confequences of it he returned to italy where having finished fe veral pictures at rome florence and venice his reftless plenetic inconflant humour threw him into diftemper of which he died in the sgd year of his age anno orn at agnolo in vado in the durchy of a urbin was the fon of an ordinary painter who knowing his own weakness and preterring the reputation of his fon to his own profit at fourteen years old carried him to rome to learn of the beft painters but he was ill recommended for he placed him with giovanni pietro calabro whofe wife almoft flarved taddeo and by her coverouf- nets forced him to look out for another mafter however he went to no other contenting himfelf with hudying raphaels works and the antique sculptures which added to his own genius foon rendered him mafter of his art he was eaty abounding and graceful in every thing he did and tempered the vivacity of his wit by great prudence he never worked out of iealy living moft part of his time in rome and capraiola where he left many things unfinished being taken away in his prime the year of his age anno his brether frederic perfected his pieces after his death gtor eminent vasare dorn at are in tufcany was at firft dif- adciple of william of marfeilles who painted upon glats afterwards of andrea del sarto and at latt of michael angelo one can not fay of him as of tome other painters that he was hurried on to painting by violent inclination for it is moft like- ly that he made choice of that profeftion through good fenfe and reflection which led him to it more than his genius when the troubles of florence where over he returned into his own country where he found his father and mother dead of the plague and two brothers and three fifters left upon him whom he was forced to maintain by the profits of his labour he painted in frefco in the towns about florence but fearing he should not get enough by painting to maintain his family he quit- ted his profeftion and turned gold mith which was no more beneficial to him than his own art for this reafon he again applied himself to paint- ing with an earneft defire to become mafter he was indefatigably diligent in defigning the antique tculptures and fludying the beft pieces of the moft noted mafters and though he very much improved his defign by copying entirely michael angelos chapel yet he joined with salviati in defigning all raphaels and balthazar da siena works and not thinking the day-time enough for him he spent good part of the night in copying what he and salviati had defigned he thought after all this pains and care he was qualified to undertake any thing and to perform it with fuccels he did not mind colouring havingno trueides of it and though he was an artful defigner his works were never in the reputation he expected they would be which proceeded from his not underftanding colours or l li ves of the fofiness of the pencil but his great ufe of defigning made it very eaty to him and by this means his performances were very numerous he was good archirect and underftood ornaments very well the works which he finished at flo- rence as well in architecture as painting procured him the favour of the houfe of medicis by which he got money and married off two of his fifters he was very moral man and had fuch polite qua- lities as acquired him the efteem of perfons of the higheft rank the cardinal of medicis was his par- ticular patron and engaged him to write the lives of the painters which he publifhed at florence in three volumes about the year work in the opinion of hannibal caro written with great ex- actnets and judgment he is taxed with flattering the mafters of his own country the florentine pain- ters but be it as it will painting is indebted to him for an eternal monument in having tranfinitted to pofterity the memory of to many fkilful men whole names would have been forgotten had he not taken fuch pains to eternize them befides his lives of the painters he publifhed reflections on his own pictures of which the chief are at rome flo- rence and bologna he died at florence in the year being fixty four years old his body was carried to are where he was buried in chapel adorned with archirecture which he had builr in his life-time frederico sborn in the durchy of urbin in village called agnolo in vado his parents car- ried him to the jubilee at rome in the year put him to his brother taddeo who was then one of the moft famous painters in italy frede- fico not liking his brother ’ corrections and finding he eminent fn was lrong enough in his art to sland by himself fet up for mafter painter they both did great deal of work at capraiola and frederico finished the pieces which his brothes who died in his thirty-fe- venth year had left imperfect pope gregory kili employed him about his paintings in whofe service having difference with fome of his holiness offi- cers to be revenged on them he drew the picture of flander engraved afterwards by cornelius cort wherein he reprefented all thofe that had offended him with affes ears he expoted it publickly over the door of st luke church on st lukes day and left rome to avoid the popes wrath he worked in france for the cardinal of lorrain and in the efcurial for philip without giving content to either the one or the other he was more for- runate in england where he drew the picture of queen elizabeth and did fome others pieces that were very much commended at laft returning into ltaly and having worked some time at venice pope gregory recalled and pardoned him soon after making his advantage of the pope protection he fet up the academy of painting for which his holinets had given him brief he was chofen prince of the painters and out of love to his art was at the charge of building houfe for them to meet in he went afterwards to venice to print some books he had written on painting from thence he paft on to savoy and in journey to loretto died at ancona at years of age anno da rheg the fon of

frederico luc= chero under whofe difcipline he was fcarce year before he made such wonderful progrets in his art that he was almoft equal to his mafter he did fe- veral fine things in the vatican at santa maria magiore and other places of rome he was fair and handfome and it is faid that falling in love with young women his paftion was fo violent that it killed him he had companion whofe name was paris whofe affifted him in his works .ic har native of la breffo was one of the painters £ whom raphael employed under him in the vatican and who was not much talked of for any thing elfe having on time made picture for the florentines church wherein he reprefented pon- fius pilate thewing jefus chrift to the people he alked of raphael which of the heads he liked beft tuppofing he would have antwered that of chrift but raphael replied it was one that was in the hindmoft part of the picture by which he meant that all his expreffions were not proper to the subject he reprefented though his heads were otherwife good frederico barocci orn at urbin went to rome in his youth ad where he painted feveral things in frefco for pope paul iii and then returned to urbin living there the reft of his days he was one of the moft graceful judicious and ikilful painters that ever was he drew vaft number of portraits and hiftory pieces and his genius was particularly for religious subjects one may in his works perceive great inclination towards corregios manner and though he defigned more correctly his out-lines are not of fo grand gufto nor fo natural as cor- regios eminent in he expreft the parts of the body and defigned the feet of child after the same manner as he would have done thofe of man he made his firft drawings generally in paftello and with the fame stile that he drew his pictures he drew his madonna after fifter of his and the infant chriff after child of hers he erched feveral of his pieces himself and died at urbin in the year at years of age vanni was his ditciple francesco vanni siens was disciple and not inferior to barocci he had an extraordinary talept for religious fubjects and died in the year of his anno t inn called by contraction from giofeppe ar pino caftle of that name in the kingdom of naples where he was born in the year his father mutio polidoro was to ordinary painter that he had nothing to do but to paint ex votos of the village for the country people giofeppino went to rome where he learnt light and agreeable manner of defigning which in practice degenerated into fomething that neither bordered on the an- tique nor on refined nature having great deal of wit and genius he became in favour with the popes and cardinals from whom he had bufiness enough but he had warm competitor in caravagio whofe manner was quite oppofite to his his battles in the capitol are the moft efteemed of all his pieces in his other pictures he is fuperficial and has not dived to the bottom of his art he died in the year at fourfcore years of age moft of the pain ters of his time followed his manner the reft imi- fated caravasios pa- ve dela marc only named here becaufe he made fuch pro- grets in painting in one year that he is looked upon as prodigy

him to vifit rome he went thither in pilgrim habit and not being well enough verted in the profeftion he was defirous to follow he lived miferable to the laft degree spending his time in defigning the ruins hatues and pictures at rome sandrart rells us that meeting him one day defigning the ruins about rome in wretched condition having fcarce where- withal to cover his nakedness he took pity of him carried him to his houfe cloathed him fed him and empleyed him to defign feveral things in the gallery of juftiniano after which he recommended him to other mafters who fet him to work he was fuch man-hater and fo wild that sandrart could hardly have any of his company he had defigned the antiques to often that he had them by heart but his genius was to fiery and licentious that all the pains he took ferved him to little pur- pofe and the trouble he gave himfelf about his pic- tures fucceeded as ill as may be feen by the few pieces that are left of his by the little value that is fot onthem through his bad colouring and the hard rcis eminent of his pencil indeed he was only commen- dable for his deligns and prints of which he en- graved part himfelf part was done by cefare tefta and the reft by other gravers there is great deal of fancy gaity and practice in them but little intelligence of the clare obicuro little reafon and little juftnets being on the banks of the tiber defigning prospect the wind blew off his hat into the river and as he was endeavouring to regain it he accidentally fellin and was drowned about the year ro berett in cortona in tufcany was bred up in the lo houfe of sachetti at rome and proved to be one of the moft agreeable painters that ever was his genius was fruitful his thoughts full of flowers and graces and his execution eaty his talent being for grand compofitions and his imagination lively he could not put that conftraint upon himfelf as to finith picture entirely for which reafon his little pieces when they are examined nearly feem to want very much of the merit of his great produc- ions he was not correct in his defigns exprestive in the paftions or regular in the folds of his drapery but every where mannerift yet there is gran- deur nobleness and grace in all his works not that grace which was the portion of raphael and cor- regio which touches the minds of men of fenfe to the quick his was general grace that pleafed every body and that confifted rather in habit of making the airs of his heads always agreeable than in fingular choice of expreffions furtable to each subject for as have faid he did not care to look back upon what he had done nor to enter into detail of each thing in his pieces he endeavoured only iv of only to make them fine all together and was highty applauded for the magnificence of his works in the churches and palaces of rome and florence he has given undoubted proofs of his capacity in the new church of the fathers of the oratory at rome in the palaces of barberini and pamphilio and in other places there was nothing ill in his colouring especially his carnations which would have been better had they been more varied and more fiudied as for his local colours he never went out of the roman ichool but in giving them union among them- felves and that agreement which the italians call sage the ornaments of his works were ad- mirable his landlkips of good gufto and he un- derffood painting in frefco better than any one who went before him his temper was mild his converfation agreeable and his manners fincere he was charitable offi- cious good friend and poke well of every body he was to laborious that the gout with which he was very much troubled could not hinder his painting but his fedentary life and too much ap- plication to his bufiness increafed the diftemper fo far that it killed him in the both year of his age anno eminent pa in the th £ mid a iv venice was difciple of gentile fabri- and competitor with that dome- who was affaffinared by andrea del fesian he is

highnets which were extremely liked especially his portraits and as the turks have great veneration for st john baptift gen- tile painted the decollation and shewed it to the emperor to have his approbation of it but the grand fignior found fault that the skin of the neck which was feparated from the body was too high and to convince him that his criticifin was juft he ordered flave to be brought to him and com- manded his head to be immediately struck off in the prefence of bellino that he might fee that pre- fently after the head is feparated from the body the skin of the neck

finished it titian did it for him and added fine landskip to it as skilfal as this his disciple was he had fuch respect for his mafter that te give him all the glory of the picture he wrote on it thefe words tohannes bell inus mccccc xiv giorgione was his difciple at the fame time with titian bellino died in the year aged his and his brother portraits are in the king cabinet refections on the works of iova nni bel n and gentile bellino had an ill gufto in defigning and painted very drity but giovanni having learnt the secret of painting in oil managed his pencil with more foftnels and though there appears great deal of driness in his produc- tions yet he did better than his predeceffors of the profeffion and deferved to be diftinguished from them not only becaufe he tranfmitted freely to the pginters that fucceeded him the ufe of oil in painting but alfo becaufe he was the firft who en- deavoured to join union to the vivacity of colours the latter being till his time the greateft part of the merit of the venetian painters but in giovanni' we fee at once propriety of colours and the be- ginning of an harmony which was enough to rouze the talent of giorgione fo famous for his colour- ing the wonderful progress of this disciple as well as titian opened even the eyes of their mafter for bellino manner in his firtt pieces was too dry the li ves and that of his latter pictures is good enough both for defign and colouring for which they are admitted into the cabinets of the curious and there are fome at vienna among the emperor collec- tions which have fomething of the boldnels of giorgione lights and colouring the gufto of bellino defigns is little gothic his attitudes are not well cholen but the airs of his heads are noble there are no lively expreftions in his pieces and the fubjects of which he treated being for the molt part madonna gave him no occafion for them however he did his utmoft to copy nature exactly and finifhed his pictures fo fervilely that he had not time to apply himfelf to give them great character tbe do os ferrara made themfelves famous by the good gufto of their colouring and especially by their landlkips which are very fine alphonfo duke of ferrara employed them very much and honoured them with his favour they were not fo in the court of francefco maria duke of hapi urbin who fet them to work in frefco in the new palace which the architect genga had built for him but that prince not being fatisfied with their painting deftroyed it it is true it deferved the leaft commendation of all their productions what ever care they took about it fo certain it is that let man be at never to much pains in the execu- tion of his work he shall not fucceed if the firtt conception of it was bad they kept up their re- putation notwithflanding this difgrace and pro- duced feveral beautiful pieces the elder of them being grown old and his eyes bad was not fit for bufinels wherefore the duke of ferrara allowed him pention for his fubfiftance he died at great age and his younger brother whole name was bar= tifta furviving him performed many good pieces after the death of his elder brother gtor tone called by reafon of his courage and noble af= pect was born at caftel-franco in trevifano province in the flate of venice annd and though he was but of indifferent parentage yet he had great foul he was gallant loved mufic had an agreeable voice and played well on feveral inftruments at firft he applied himfelf induftris oufly to defign the works of leonardoda vinci and then placed himfelf with giovanni bellino to learn to paint but his genius having formed guito superior to that of his mafter giovanni he culri- vated it by the fight and ftudy of nature whom he afterwards faithfully imitated in all his produc- tions titian was extremely pleafed with his bold and terrible gufto and intending to make his ad- vantage of it frequently vifited him under pre- tence of keeping up the friendship they had con- tracted at their mafter bellinos but giorgione be ing jealous of the new manner he had found out contrived an excufe to forbid titian his houfe as handfomely as he could upon which titian became his rival in his art and was to careful to copy the life exactly that by his care and reflections he ex- celled giorgione in difcovering the delicacies of nature however giorgione was ftill in reputation for gufto to which no body had hitherto arrived the moft part of his performances are at venice and having painted very much in frefco and not living long enough to do many other pictures his cabinet pieces are extremely rare he died in the year when he was carce years of age reffec- liv on the works of gforgfone being but thirty two years old when he died and having done few grand compofitions one can not well judge of the great- ness of his genius the beft of his performances is at venice on the front of the houfe wherein the german merchanes have their meetings on that fide which looks tewards the grand canal he did this piece of painting in competition with titian who painted another fide of that building but both of thefe two pieces being almoft entirely ruined by age it is difficult to make right judgement of them or of gforgione talent by that performance to we muft reft fatisfied with few cafel-pieces and fome portraits that he drew every man painting himfelf in what kind of picture foever he employs his pencil about we may perceive by thofe of gior- zione that he had facility of understanding and vivacity of imagination his gufto of defign is delicate and has fomething in it like the roman fchool though it is not fo much exprefted as is neceffary for the perfection of his art he always being more careful to give roundnels to his figures than to make them correct his gufto was grand picquant and his hand eaty he was the firft who found out the admi rable effects of flrong lights and fhadows and made ufe of bold colours and it is matter of wonder to confider how all of fudden he foared from the low manner of bellino colouring to the fupreme height to which he raifed colours in his art by join- ing an extreme force with an extreme fweetnels he underffood the claro obfcuro very well and the harmony of the rout enfemble or the whole-to- gether of picture for his carnations he ufed four capital colours only the judicious mixture of which made emment all the differences of ages and fexes in his pieces but in thefe four colours we ought not to comprehend either the white which ferves inftead of light nor the black which is the privation of it it appears by his works that the principles of the art which he had found out were fimple that he was perfect mafter of them and that his greateft artifice was to thew the value of things by compa- tifon the guft of his landskips is exquifite both for the colours and the oppofitions and befides giving force to his colours unknown before his time he had way to keep them freth especially his greens titian obferving to what degree of elevation gior- gione had carried his art thought he had paffed beyond the bounds of truth and though he imitated in fome things the boldness of his colouring yet as one may fay he tamed the fierceness of his co- lours which were too favage he tempered them by the variety of tints to the end that he might render his objects the more natural and the more palpable but notwithftanding all his efforts to excel his rival giorgione htill maintained his post of which no body has hitherto been able to dispoffees him and it is certain that if titian has made feve- ral painters good colourifts giorgione firft shewed them the way to be fo it ano ec el sborn at cadore in friuli province in the ftare of venice anno he was of noble extraction being defcended from the ancient family of the vecelli at about ten years old his parents fent him to one of his uncles that lived at venice who taking notice of his inclination to paint- ing put him to giovanni bellino he ftudied moftly after nature whom he copied fervilely with ve of without adding to her or taking from her but in the year rgo obferving the great effect of giorgi- one works he followed his manner to far that without making lines he imitated the living bequ- ties of nature whom he looked on with other eyes than before and ftudied her with extraordinary ap- plication yet this did not hinder his defigning carefully at other times by which he alfo became an able deligner giorgione perceiving what progress titian had made in his profeffion by following his manner broke off all correspondence with him and ever after they were profeffed rivals their jealouty of each other lafted till death took off giorgione at thirty two years of age and left the stage clear to titian in his eight and twentieth year he publiff- ed his print of the triumph of faith in wood wherein are reprefented the patriarchs the prophets the apoftles the evangelifts and martyrs this piece gave vall hopes of him and it was faid upon it that if he had leen the antiquities he would have furpaffed raphael and michael angelo he painted portico at vicenza in frefco repre- fenting the hiftory of solomon he painted

made some other pictures and pieces of painting which were eminent admired by michael angelo and vafari who lays he pitied the venetian painters in that they minded defigning no more than they did tirian performed great number of pieces both public and private as well in oil as in frefco befides an in- numerable quantity of portraits he drew the em- peror charles vs picture three times and that

coming from poland to france couldnot go through venice without vi- fiting titian and all the poets of his time fung his praifes his eafel-pieces are fcattered up and down throughout enrope the fineft of them are at venice in france and spain there never was painter who lived fo long as titian nor to eafily and happily excepting only his jealouty of porde- hone which neverthelefs turned to his advantage he was univerfally beloved and efteemed and full of years honours and wealth he died at laft of the plague anno being fourfcore and nineteen years of agc he had great many difciples the chief of them were his brother francefco vecelli his fon horatio vecelli tintoret and other venetians befides whom he had three flemish difciples that he valu- ed viz john calcar diteric barent and lambert luftrus who all died young reflections on the works of ti ia hough titian genius was not brilliant and lofty it was however fruitfulenough to treat of great subjects of all kinds there never was more univerial painter nor one who knew better how to give each object its true character he was ve up in the school of giovanni bellino where his education his frequenting giorgione company his refolure fiudy of nature for ten years together and above all the folidity of his underftanding and reflections difcovered to him the myfteries of his art and made him penetrate farther than any other painter into the effence of painting if gieorgione thewed him the end that he ought to aim at he laid the way to it on folid bafis wherein all that have followed him have acquired efteem and are indebt- ed to him for their fcience and reputation had there never been titian there had never been balfan tintoret paolo veronefe nor abundance of painters who have given glorious marks of their capacity in all parts of chriftendom vet though titian was very faithful in his imita- tion of nature he wanted fidelity in his reprefenta- tions of hiffory having hardly done any thing of that kind wherein he has not committed some fault or other there is not it is true much fire in his dispofi- tions yet they are well filled and very regular he was very exact in giving thofe attitudes to his fi- gures which might thew the moft beautiful parts of the body he was to careful to have the whole-together of his pieces judicioutly concerted that he often re- peared them to fave himfelf the trouble of think- ing again thus there are feveral magdalens of his feveral venus and adonis wherein he has only changed the ground to have it believed that they were all originals we may fuppofe that he was helped fometimes by his difciples elpecially the three flamands who were excellent painters and of whom diteric barent was his favourite afterthefe difciples had done their beft to make their copies like the orignials and their mafter had touched them over again with freth views why should not they eminent be valued as much as if they had been all of tirian hand and why are not the copies as efti- mable as the originals titian formed his guft of defigning after nature he did as polyclerus of old fearch after what was fine in her and he fuc- ceeded in women and children he defigned theim with delicate gufto he imprinted on them no- ble air accompanied with certain pleating negli- gence of the head-dreffes the draperies and orna- ments of habits that are wholly peculiar to him he was not fo happy in the figures of men which he did not always defign with correctnets or elegance however in this he did like michael angelo he propofed in his guft of defigning them to imitate nature in her greateft vigour and made the mufcle- ing flrong to give the greater character to his figures the difference between him and michael angelo is the latter was more profound in his de- figns and mingled fenfible expresfion of the muf- cles with guft of the antique whereas titian neg- lected the anrique and in his works rather increaf- ed than diminithed the tendernels of nature whom he only imitated there is no exaggeration in his attitudes they are fimple and natural and in his heads he feems to bufy himself rather in faithful imitation of ex- terior nature if may be allowed the phrafe than in lively expreftion of the paftions his draperies are fometimes mean and favour of little gufto and if he has imitated the htufts per- fectly he has often difpoted of them ill the folds seem rather to fall by chance than to be fet by good order and good principle of art all the painters allow that none of their profeftion ever came up to titian for landlkips his figures are compofed of few objects but thofe are admirably well chofen the forms of his trees are varied their touches light mellow and without manner but he .ive of he carefully obferves in all his landlkips to thew tome extraordinary effect of nature and moves one by its fenfiblenets fingularity and truth his co- louring in all parts of it is wonderful and though he is not quite fo bold in it as giorgione he is more exact and more delicate he was very faithful in his local colours and placed them always fo as to raife the merit of one object by comparing it with another and thus he in fome meafure by the force of his art fupplied the defect of colours which of themfelves can not anfwer to all the effects of nature the truth that is to be found in his lo cal colours is to great that they leave no idea of the colours which are on the pallet and when we look on his pieces we ought not to fay his carnations are made of fuch and fuch colours but rather that they are really ffeth and that his draperies are the real htuff fo nicely does every thing maintain its character and not one of the colours in the compo- fition of them all is to be diftinguithed from the other we can not deny but that titian underftood the claro obfcuro and when he did not thew it by groups of light and shadows he did it fufficiently by the nature of the colours of his draperies and the diftribution of his objects whofe natural colour al- ays agreed with the place where it was laid whe- ther forward or backward or wherever he thought it molt advantageous to place it his oppofitions are at once bold and fwect and he learnt of nature the harmony of the colours ra- ther than from the participation of the claro and the brown as paolo veronefe did he finithed his piecesextremely and had no very particular manner in the managing of his pencil be- caufe his ffudies and the care he took to temper one colour by another took away the appearance of free hand though his hand was really free it is cer= tain cain the fenfible marks of that freedom have their merit they are gay and pleafant to the fight when they are the refult of refined habit and warm imagination but there are in titian works fuch lively touches fo agreeable to the character of the objects that they flatter the rafte of the true critics much more than the fentible strokes of bold hand titian had in his time four manners the firft that of giovanni bellino his mafter the second that of giorgione his competitor third which was very much ftudied and was properly his own and fourth which degenerated into habit and was always folid his firft manner was little dry his second very bold as is to be feen by his picture of se mark which is at venice in the veftry of the la salute by that of the five saints in st nicho- las church and by others his third manner con- fifted in juft and beautiful imitation of nature and was very much laboured by his exactnets in touching his pieces over again here and there and fometimes with virgin tints in the lights and fometimes with glazing in the fhadows hismanner on account of thefe things as trival as they are feemed the less free but it was the more ftrong and the more finished the fourth was free manner which he prac cifed towards the latter part of his life either not being able to fatigue himfelf fo much as he could before or believing he knew way how to pare himself the trouble and do as well without it of this laft manner are his pictures of the annuncia- tion and the transfiguration which are at san sal vador the st james of san lio the st laurence at the jefuits church the st jerome of santa ma- tia nova the pentecoft of la salute and feveral others there art fifty pictures to be feen in public at venice in which titian has thewn all the man- ners have poken of to ves of to conclude if the painters of the roman fchool furpaffed titian in vivacity of genius in grand com- pofitions and in gufto of defign no body will difpute with him the excellence of colourings and he has been always in that part of painting guide all true painters franc vecell titlans brotber at firtt foldier in the italian wars but peace being reftored to italy he went to his brother titian at venice where applying himfelf to painting he became to great mafter of defign that tician grew jealous of him and fearing he might in time eclipfe his reputation he fet him againtt his profeffiohn and put him upon taking up another he fell to making of ebony cabinets adorned with figures and architecture which how- ever did not hinder his painting portrait now and then for friend his firft pictures and thofe which alarmed his brother titian are of giorgi- one gufto and pats for his even with feveral men of fenfe horatio vecelll itlans jon painted portraits after his fa- ther manner he did very little being more taken up with chymiftry than painting he died of the plague in the flower of his age and in the same year with his father anno mo ro bu st al int et to ecaute dyer fon the quicknets of his wit dd was vitible in his youth by his performances in painung and biutic but paincing being what he cook cook moft delight in he refolved to apply himfelf wholly to it michael ngelo was his guide for delign and he learnt colouring of titian he did not lofe his time whilft he was with his mafter for he penetrated fo far into titian principles that he raifed his jealouty his ditciple perceived it and left him he got particular manner by his continual exercife in his profeftion which had very much of michael angelo guft of defigning and titian way of colouring tintoretto conti- nuing with great deal of warmth and applica- tion the ftudy and exercife of painting became as it were prodigy in his art as well for his extraor- dinary thoughts as for his good tafe and for dif patch in his bufiness he did his pieces to fatt and folicited work to much that there was little for any one elfeto do he worked very cheap taking what was given him for pictures without making words about the price by this means venice was filled with his productions and as there are some among them which muft needs be in fuch num- ber that are but indifferent there are alfo others that are excellent his pieces are finished or unfi- nithed according to the price that he had for them the fine crucifix of his which is in the chamber of the school of st roque was made on this occafion the brotherhood of st roque being willing to have crucifix of the beft mafter hand giofeppe salviati frederico qucchero paolo veronefe and tintoretto were each to give them defign in con- currence day was appointed by the brother hood for receiving their defigns but tintoretto inttead of defign brought the picture quite done and very frankly hung it up in the place where it was to hang it was to no purpofe for the other painters to complain of this or to fay they were not required to bring picture but defign the picture was in its place and there was no more for them the ve of to do but to be fatisfied with it the bro- therhood of st roque were willing to have piece of another manner than that of tintoretto and ce that if he did not take it down fold him so they would never pay him for it very well re- plied tintoretto then prefent it to you to the picture remains there to this day.. it is wonder that tintoret who worked fo hard should live fo long as fourfcore and two years for he was of that age when he died anno the diftemper which at laft carried him to his grave was pain in his ftomach occafioned by his over-great application to his bufinefs he was buried in the church of ma- donng del horto ar venice reflections on the works of tintoretto one of the venetian painters can be com= pared to tintoretto for fruitfulness and fa- of genius he had penetration enough to comprehend all titian principles which he prac- fifed induftrioutly but had too much fire to do it exactly from the inequality of his mind came the incquality of his productions upon which ilannibal carrach writing to his brother lodovico at venice fays of tintoret that he is fometimes equal to ti- fian and at other times inferior even to himfelf out of love to his profeftion he ftudied every thing that could help to make him mafter of it his carefulness to defign after the beft things and particularly michael angelo works taught him good gufto of defigning but through the vivacity of his imagination he is often incorrect his atri- tudes are almoft all contrafted to excels and fome- times extravagant thofe of his women excepted whofe attitudes he always painted graceful in the difpofition of his figures he rather minded to give motion to every thing than to follow pature and eminent nt verifimility which he on certain occafions prac sifed with fuccess his subjects are for the moft part well enough characterized his heads are defigned with great gufto but his expreffions are feldom fine and piquant he underftood the neceffity of the claro obfcure which he ufually performed by reat gleams of lights and fhadows that difentangled themfelves by op- pofing one another the caufe of which is fuppofed to be out of the picture this is great help in grand compofitions provided the tranfition of the oppofites are managed with underftanding and their extremities are sharp his local colours are good and his carnations in his beft pieces come up very near to titian in my opinion they are of better character than thofe of paolo veronefe mean more true and more languine he drew abundance of pictures of different merit according to the time he spent about them or the money he received for them the beft of them do not fall very thoft of tirians his penciling is very firm and very vigorous his work eaty and his rouches lively in word tintoretto is par- tern for thofe young painters who would have good guft of colouring and an expeditious manner mar ia int or et tintoret daughter as taught to paint by her father and drew great number of portraits both of men

to lofe her in the thirtieth year of her age when the died anno of cagliari veronese as born at verona in gabriel cagli- aris fculptor was his father and anto- nie badile his uncle his mafter whofe manner was not bad he drew his firft pieces at mantua and some other cities of ltaly but meeting with more employment at venice he fettled there he ftudied and imitated nature very much and did what he could to regard her with the eyes of titian as he knew where to have patterns for his carna= sions when he wanted them to he had ftufts of dif- ferent forts which he made ufe of opn occafion moft of his public pieces were painted in concurrence with tintoret and the erities were divided in their opinion of the excellence of thefe two mafters pro- ductions however it was always allowed that there was more force in tintorettess and more grace and magnificence in paolo veronefe his pictures are to be feen all over europe there being valt number of them there is fcarce church in venice which has not tome piece or other of his but the main proofs of his capacity are in st mark palace at st george and at st sebaltian the fenate fending geronimo grimani procura- for of st mark to rome to be their embaffador in his holiness court paolo waited on him thither but did not stay long there having left feveral pic- tures at venice unfinithed he was an honeft pious civil friendly man faithful to his word and careful in the education of his children magnificent in his mien and his dress and though he had got great deal of money his only ambition was to be mafter of his art titian loved and efteemed him very much philip ii king of spain spain fent for him to paint the escurial but paolo excuted himfelf on account of his employment in the palace of st mark and frederico qucchero was fent to spain in his place he had great ides of his profeffion he ufed to fay it was gife from heaven that to judge of it well man ought to underftand abundance of things that no painter would ever do any thing perfectly if he had not nature prefent before him that none but mafter pictures should be placed in churches becaufe admiration only excites devotion and that the fovereign quality of true painter is probity and integrity of manners he died of fever at years of age anno his tomb and statue in brats are in the church of st sebaftian reflections on the works of ron et painter genius be never fo fine and his ad vein never to abounding let him execute his thoughts with never to much facility if he does not ferioully confider the subject he is to treat of and warm his fancy by reading good authors he will often produce trivial things and fometimes even such as are impertinent paolo veronefe is lively inftance of this affertion he had marvellous talent he worked eafily and his genius was fufficient to have produced rare things if it had been seconded by care he did an infinity of pieces and according to the places or perfons for which he worked he the more or the less ftudied his compofitions st mark palace at venice the high altars of the prin- cipal churches and fome noblemens houfes pre- ferve ftill what he did that was moft fine but for the altars of the common churches and the pieces he did for privace perfons who were fond of having tomething of his in their houfes inftead of being careful tbe ve to maintain his reputation by taking the ne= cellary pains about them one would think he mind- ed only to get them out of his hands as foon as pof fible by which means his inventions are fomerimes flat and fometimes ingenious he had particular talent for grand compofi= tions he performed them agreeably and gave them fpirit truth and motion whatever his ima- gination furnifhed him with that was grand he brought it into his performances as alfo every thing he could think of furprizing new and extra- ordinary in short he was more ftudious to adorn the feene of his picture than to render it agreeable to times cuftoms and places he often introduced architecture which was painted by his brother be- nedetto and the magnificence of thefe buildings gave grandeur to his works he does not thew any great incelligence of the claro obicuro in his difpositions he did not un- derfland it as principle of his art and fucceeded well or ill in it according to the different motions of his genius the fame thing might be faid of his attitudes which are for the moft part ill cholen nevertheless there is great deal of fire and ta- mult in his grand compofitions but to examine them nearly we shall find little delicacy in his ex- preffions either of the subject in general or of the paftions in particular and it is rare to fee any thing very moving in his productions he had the com mon fault of all the venetian painters who walted their time and application in imitating the exterior part of nature his draperies are all modern and according to the fathions in vogue in his time or elfe according to the modes he faw in the caftern people there being great numbers of them always at venice of whom he made ufe for the airs of fome of his heads as well as for the dreffes his drape- ties eminent in are generally of different forts of ftuffs and the folds large and regular and indeed they are good part of the beauty of paolo veronefe pictures he was to careful to imitate the ffuffs from the natural cloch filk or linen that he acquired fuch habi- cude in his draperies as would make one believe he drew all of them after the real stuffs though he liked parmegiano defigning and en- deavoured to fall into the fame manner his own is of an ill gufto excepting that of his heads only whofe airs are fometimes great noble and graceful his figures look well enough together under their cloaths but the our-lines of the naked have litrle gufto or correctnels especially thofe of the feet yet he feems to be careful to defign women ele- gantly according to his idea of beautiful nature for as to the antique he never knew any thing of it never faw any confiderable lankskips of paolo veronefe he has painted the heavens in fome of his grand compoficions and has done them admira- bly well but his diftances and his earth have an air of diftemper he did not at all comprehend the art of the claro obicuro and if it is fometimes to be found in his pictures it is the happy effect of his genius and not the product of any principle but as for the local colours he underftood them well and made them valuable by the comparifon of one object with ano- ther though his inclination led him to loofe and lightfom manner though he often made ufe of trong and dark colours and his carnations are natural they are however neither to freth as tirian nor to vigorous and languine as tincoretto and it leems to me that great many of them have incture of the lead yet notwithflanding all this there is in general harmony in his colouring chieffy in his draperies which are brilliant diverfi- tied and magnificent the harmony of his colours pro- tbe ves of commonly from glazing and broken co. lours which he made ufe of and which imparting their mutual influence one to the other infallibly produces union yer there are fome pictures which are faid to be his wherein the colours are rough and unharmonious but will not warrant that all the pieces which are attribured to paolo veronefe are really his for he had brother and fon who imi- tated his hile we fee every where in his works great capacity his execution is firm his pencilling light and his reputation in feveral parts of his art fufficient to maintain his rank among the firft order of painters muft not omit to relate here that his picture of the marriage at cana in the church of st giorgio maggiore at venice is to be diftinguithed from his other works for it is not only the triumph of paolo veronefe but it wants very little of being the tri- umph of painting itfelf benedetto cagliare painter and sculpior as paolo veronefe brother and helped him confiderably in his works for he was very laborious his stile in painting was like his bro- thers and being not ambitious of fame his pro- ductions are confounded with paolo he died at threefcere years old anno and gabriela cagllari lre paolo veronefe fons- the elder had very fine genius for painting and at of age had done fome rare pieces it he would have excelled his father had he lived but being of render conftitution and ap- plying himfelf to his profeftion with too much in rentuess he contracted an impottume in his breaft and died of it in his year anno his brother eminent gabriel exercifed himfelf in painting but having no extraordinary talent he quitted the pro- feffion of painter and turned merchant how- ever in the intervals of his bufinels he made confiderable number of portraits he died of the plague anno aged years giovanni antonio regillo da pordenone born at pordenone in friuli miles from udine he was defcended from the ancient family of the sacchi and his true name was licinio but the emperor having knighted him he took the opportunity to change his name out of harred to one of his brothers who would have affaf- finated him for which reafon he called himfelf re- gillo his love of painring was his only mafter and his genius together with his fludying the works of giorgione his friend and comperitor guided him to that perfection in his art to which he arrived after he had learnt as much as he could from gior- giones works he like him fet himself to imitate the beautiful effects of nature which joined to the force of his genius and his amibition to excel in his profeffion rendered him one of the moft celebrated painters in the world he difputed the fuperiority with titian and their jcalouty of each other was to great that pordenone fearing to be infulted by his rival was always upon his guard and when he painted the cloyfter of st stephen in venice he worked with fword by his fide and buckler tied about him as was the fathion of the bravo in his time he had fruir- ful vein good guft of defigning and manner of colouring not far inferior to titians he pro- duced feveral pieces in frefco he worked with facility and gave great force to his productions ve of his principal public pieces are at venice at udine mantua vicenza genoa and friuli he was fent for to ferrara by duke hercules ii to finith fome defigns for tapeftry which he had begun at venice but he was fcarce arrived

to rome and worked with taddeo tuc- chero he there defigned much after the antique and good pictures and made confiderable num- ber of portraits he finithed the defigns of the baffo relievos of trajan column which julio romano began he had them graved and ciaconius affifted him in it pope gregory kill employed him and it was out of favour to him that his holiness founded the academy of st luke at rome which was confirmed by brief of pope sixtus though muriano underftood hiftorical painting he was more fond of landlkips and was more mafter of them his manner had lomething of the flemith in it

difciple here he copied titian and parmegiano works after which he returned to baf- fano and followed the natural bent of his genius that inclined him to draw every thing after nature whom he had always before him in the execution of his pieces though he defigned figures very well he particularly applied himfelf to the imitation of bealts and landskips becaufe thofe things were more com- ion and more advantageous for painting in the place of his abode than others accordingly he succeeded in them to perfection especially in tub- fects that treated of the fields and if there are not to much noblenets and elegancy as one could with in his hiftory-pieces there is at leaft great deal of force temper and fidelity his love of his art and his tacilicy in his performances made him pro- duce

arts by the characters which make her moft fenfible and mott to be known he fiudied her with great application in particular objects and then compoted pietures of fingular worth if his talent was not for the heroic and hifforical kind which require dignity he has treated his paftoral subjects well and all fuch as was proportionable to his genius for of whatever manner his objects were he knew how to difpofe of them advantageoutly by the good effect of the whole-together and if fome particular things are ill adjufted and ill rurned he has at leaft rendered them like and probable his defigns were not noble or elegant neither did the moft part of his fubjects require them to be fo but he was correct in his way his draperies were dull and there was more of exercife than truth in the

arrive at perfection on fudden it reached it by degrees the difciples al ways added fomething to the progrefs their mafters made in it before them and there is nothing in this which commonly does not

favour or protection or going from home for it in the midft of poverty and tbe ve of without any other helps than the contemplation of nature and the affection he had for his bufiness has produced works of fublime kind both for the thoughts and the execution his chief pictures are at farma and modena and his cabinet-pieces are very fare raphael fame tempted him to go to rome he confidered attentively the pictures of that great painter and after having looked on them long time without breaking filence he faid co anch jo all the fine co fon pittore iam hilla painter pieces that he had

for the airs of his heads for his madonnas his faints and little chil- dren add to this the union that appears in his wworkss eminent nt and his talent of moving the heart by the delicacy of his

placed here is put among the roman painters page alfo polidoro caravaggio parmegiano pellegrino of modena and pri- maticcio the reafon of our placing them there was becaufe we confidered the manner they followed more than the country where they were born and perhaps the reader will not be difpleafed to fee raphael ’ difciples coming after their mafter the carrachs viz lodovico augustino and annibale he three carrach who acquired fo much reputation and glory by their pictures were all born at bologna lodovico came into the world in the year was cofin-german to augultino and annibaler being elder than they and painter before them they were his disciples his mafter was profpero fontana who difcovering but little fire in his painting would have diffcaded him from it and reproved him fo roughly that lodovico left his school his ralent kept him in heart and he re- solved to have no other mafter but the works of the great painters he went to venice where tinto- retto feeing fomething of his doing encouraged him to proceed in his profeffion and foretold he should in time be one of the top of it this pro- phetic applaufe animared him in his refolutions to acquire the mattery of his art he fiudied ti- lan tintorers and paolo veronefe worksar ve- nice t ves la paffignano and andreo del sarto at florence parmegiano and corregios at parma and julio romano at mantua but of all thefe mafters he who touched him moft fenfibly was cor- regio whofe manner he ever after followed augustino was born in the year and an- hibale in their father name was antonio taylor by trade yet he was very careful to give his fons good education he bred augusting icholar his inclination feeming to lead him to learn- ings but his genius afterwards carried him away more violently to the arts wherefore antonio put him to goldfmith whom auguttino quitted in little while and went home to his fathers where he bufied himfelf about the knowledge of feveral things indifferently he gave himfelf up to every thing that pleafed his fancy to painting graving poe- try mufic dancing and the mathematics with other commendable exercifes which adorned but divided his underftanding on the contrary all annibale thoughts ran upon painting he ftudied it in company with his bro- ther but the difference of their tempers made them quarrel perpetually and hindered the fruit of their rudies augultinowas fearful and hudious anni= bale bold and venturous augultino loved the com pany of men of fenfe and quality annibale was always for converfing with his equals and avoided the society of thofe that were better born than him- felf auguftino pretended to domineer by his right of feniority and the variety of his learning annibale despited it and minded only defigning augulting was very folicitous to profit by his udies and not to let any punctilio of fcience efcape him annibale was more lively and made his way every where eafy thus it being almoft impoffible to make them gree their father parted them and fent the elder to carracci who would alfo have his brother annibale emment .. with him when by the expmple of his zeal to reach the perfection of his art by inspiring them with the same love for his profeffion by pro- mifing to comfmunicate all he knew of it to them and his knowledge was now very well poken ofs and in thort by the sweetness of his deportthent and his prudence he mederaced the antipathy that was naturally between them and their ambision to excel in the art encreating every day they all three entered into very strict friendship forgetring every thing but their care to become mafters however augultino udies of painting were often interrupted by thofe of graving which he learnt of cornelius cort not being willing to quit an exercife which he had thewn genius for ever fince he was fourteen years old yet though he ac- quired an excellence in graving his love of and his talent for painting recalled him always to this art to his center annibale who never wandered from his profeffion to inform himself of all things neceffary to it went through lombardy to venice he could not con= tain his raptures at the fight of corregio works in parma he wrote to lodovico and prayed him to excite his brother auguftino to come and fee the wonders he had feen at farma faying co he could find out better fchool that neither ti gicolini nor even raphael in his st ce ce cilia had done any thing comparable to the ex- things he faw in corregio pictures all was great and graceful that augultino he should with pleafure fiudy thofe beautiful and live lovingly together from lombardy annibale went to venice where the new charms which he found in the works of tician tinrorer and paolo veronefe put him up- on copying the pictures of thofe great men with care at t ve of laft thefe three painters having made the ut moft advantage of their reflections on the works of others united themfelves fo perfectly that they continued almoft always together lodovico com- punicated his difcoveries to his cofins and they received them with all poffible eagernets and gratn- tude he propoted to them to unite all their fen- timents and their manner and upon their objecting to him it would be difficult to penetrate into all the principles of to profound an art and to be enlight- ened in all the doubts arifing in to copious fcience he antwered that there was no likelihood that three perfons who fought after the truch and had feen and examined thoroughly fomany different manners should be deceived they refolved therefore to purfue and augment the method they had begun they had performed feveral things in feveral places which in spite of the open and under-hand dealing of thofe that envied them got them reputation and friends and thus finding their credit to encreafe they laid the foun- dation of that celebrated fchool which ever fince has gone by the name of the carraccis academy hither all the young rudents who gave great hopes of their becoming mafters reforted to be in- strueted in the rudiments of painting here the carracci taught freely and kindly thofe things that were proportionable to the qualifications of their difciples they eftablifhed certain models well cholen for men and women lodovico charge was to make collection of antique ftatues and baf- to relievo they had defigns of the beft matters and curious books on all fubjects relating to their art one antony de la tour great anatomilt taught what belonged to the knitting and motion of the mufcles with reference to painting there were often disputations in the academy and not on- ly painters but men of learning propoted difficult questions eminent to be decided and lodovico ’ judgment was in all cafes their oracle every body was well received and youth being excited by emulation the young men fpent whole days and nights in hudy there for though hours were allotted to treat of dif- ferent matters yet at all times they might im- prove themfelves by the antiquities and the defigns which were to be feen there the conde di mal- valia fays oo that the principles of lodovico the of augustino and the zeal of annibale supported this academy the revutation of the carracci reaching rome cardinal edvardo farnefe who was going to have the gallery of his palace painted fent for annibale to rome to execute his defign annibale was the more willing to go thi- ther becaufe he had great defire to fee raphaels works with the antique statues and baffo relievo the guito which he took there for the ancient sculpture made him change his bolognian manner which had very much of corregios in it to fol- low method more learned and more expreft but more dry and less natural in the defign and in the colouring he had occafion to put it in practice in feveral works which he performed there and mongothers in the farnefegallery whither auguiti- no came to affift him both in the difpofition and in the execution but annibale either uneafy at au- guftino pretending to direct the work or willing to have all the glory of it could not endure to have his brother continue with him or be further con- cerned in the performance of it though augulting was very fubmiffive and would have done any thing to bring him into good humour cardinal farnefe perceiving the mifunderttand- ing between them fent augultino to parma in- tending to have him employed by duke ranuccio his brother he painted one chamber in the dukes palace the li of but had fuch frequent vexations given him there that he could not bear them fo he retired into monaltery of capuchins to prepare himfelf for death which he was fenfible was approaching and it happened in the year r he being no more than years ald he left natural fon called antonio of whom annihale took care fer him to ftudy and inttructed him in the art of painting this antonio has given to many proofs of his capacity even in the few pieces which he left behind him in rome that it is thought he would have furpaffed his uncle if he had years of age anne lived longer he died at conde di malvafia writes that annibale had great deal of reafon to repent of his treating his brother to ill at rome for having some pictures to do afterwards wherein his brother advice and learning were neceffary for him he would have been embarraffed without the affiftance of his cofin lodovico carracci but this is not probable for aguechi who always affifted annibale with his ad- vice in all the compofitions he made would not have failed him on this occafion and the fruitfulnels and beauty of his genius are to be feen elfewhere by his deligns augultino was buried at bologna with extraordi- nary pomp the particulars of which may be feen in the conde di malvafia description of his funeral in the mean while annibale continued working in the farnefe gallery he rook incredible pains and care about it and though he was perfect matter of his art he did not do the leatt thing without con- fulting nature nor paint the leaft part of his figures till he had made model of it on the fcaffold and had exactly defigned all the attitudes boncontl one of his difciples being aftonished at his uncommon care and the little noice that was takenn emnent of it among other things wrote to his fa- ther that annibale had but ten crowns month notwithflanding his performances deferved thou- fand that he was at work from

and shorrened his days his melancholy did not hinder his amours and his debauches at naples whither he was retired for the recovery of his health helped him forward to his grave in the goth year of his age anno annibale worked at rome lodovico was courted from all parts of lombardy especially by the clergy to make pictures for their churches and we may judge of his capacity and his facility by ve of the great numbers of pictures he made and by the preference that was given him to other painters in the midft of his occupations annibale folicit- ed him to come to rome and affitt him with his advice about his work in the farnefe gallery and he entreated him to earneftly that lodovico could not put off the journey he arrived at rome and after having corrected feveral things in that gallery and painted himself one of the naked figures which tupports the medaillon of sirinx he returned to bologna making very short hay at rome when he had eftablifhed and fupported the reputation of the

painting when the former who defign ’ ill got great many pupils on account of his being an ex- cellent colourift and the latter fell into manner for expedition withour gufto and exactness the good genius of painting raited the fchool of the carracci for the fupport of fo fine an art which was in dan in of falling into decay both in compofition and defign nature gave the carracci wonderful ardor for their profeftion as well as furnifhed them with fine genius they followed it by their talent and perfected it by the affiduity of their ftudies by the indefatigableness of their labour and by the doci- lity of their underftanding the fame principles on which they founded the celebrated fchool we have mentioned were their guide in the execution of all their works.. their manners refemble each other and all the difference that is to be found in them proceeds from the diverfity of their tempers lodovico had less fire but more grandeur more grace more fweetness than augustino or annibale augultino had more gaity and nnibale more boldness and fingularity of thought than either of the other two his defigns were more profound his expreffions more lively and his execution more firm the carracci took from the ancient fculptures and the beft mafters of their art as much as they could to form good manner but they have not drained the fountain dry they have left more in the antiquities in raphael in titian and corregio than they have taken from them though annibale character was more for pro- fane than pious fubjects he has however treated some of the latter kind very patheticly especially the rory of st francis but lodovico fucceeded in thele pictures better than annibale he gave grace- ful airs to his madonnals after corregio manner annibale genius inclined him rather to fiercenets than delicacy and more to gallantry than modefty as for augultino his ffudies of painting were often interrupted by thofe of graving of which he was perfect mafter he alfo diverted himfelf with other exercifes by which means he made few pieces of li ve painting and the greateft part of thefe he did make pats for his brother annibale having ftudied very little and applying himfelf wholly to painting he in his grand compo- fitions frequently made ufe of his brother auguiti- no affiltance and that of monfignior aguechis by the instructions they gave him informing and con- firming his genius all the three carracci defigned with good guite annibale gufto mended and increafed by his abode at rome as one may fee by his performances in the farnefe gallery the defign is loaden we muft confels but that load is to fair and fo learned that it pleafes even thofe who condemn it for his guf- to is compofition of the antique of michael an- gelo manner and of nature his affection for new beauties making him forget the old ones he quitted the bolognian manner for the roman the former was foft and mellow and according as he encreaf- ed his guft of defigning he diminished that of co- louring thus the defign of his laft works came to be more expreft but his penciling is not fo tender and agreeable as in his firft this fault is cammon to almoft all the painters that defigned conrectly they imagined they loft the the fruit of their labours if they did not let the yorld fee how far they were mafters of that part of their art and that the spectators would forgive them for what they fell short in other parts fatif fying themfelves with the regularity of their defign they were afraid it should be overlooked and to prevent it havemade no fcruple to offend the fight by the crudity of their out-lines annibale had an excellent genius for landskips the forms of his trees are exquifite the defigns that he made of them with pen are wonderful for their character and fenfe his touches are well chofen they confift of few hrokes but thote that eminent in er are there exprets great deal and what have said of the landikips agrees with all his defigns in all his vifible objects of nature there is character which diftinguithes them and makes them appear more tentibly to be what they are annibale knew how to take his character and has made tife of it in his defigns with equal fenfe and judgment notwith- standing he had great efteem for titian and cor- regios works his colouring is not extraordinary he did not underftand the doctrine of the claro obfcuro and his local colours are not much to be valued thus if there is any thing good in the colouring part of his pictures it is not fo much the inove- effect of the principles of art as the happ ment of his genius of the remembrance of titian and corregio works however there never was painter who was more univerfal more eafy and more certain in every thing he did nor that was more generally approved than annibale

figures in each picture and every picture he valued at one hundred roman crowns by thefe high prices guido found himself in little while very well at eafe and lived nobly till an immoderate love of gaming feized him.. he was unfortunate and his loffes reduced him to ne- cefficies that he could not go through his friends ufed all imaginable arguments to diffcade him from play but he would not give it over he fent his pictures to be fold under-hand at forry rate and took it for fuch as he had before refuled large fums for as foon as he had got the little money he had for them in his pocker he immediately went to look out for his gamefters to have his rewenge at laft as one paftion weakens another his love of gaming leftened that of painting fo far that he never thought of his reputation in what he did but only to rid his work and get fubliftence-money his chief pictures are in the cabiners of the great he performed alike well in oil and frefco the glolt noted of his pieces is that which he painted in concurrence with domenichino in the church of st gregory except his vice of gaming he was mmai eminent nt of good morals and could he have corrected that fault would have been an accompliffied per- fon hedied at bologna anno in the of his age on the works of guid hough there appears no great capacity in gufs do productions yet one may fee by them that his making but few grand compolitions was rather for want of opportunity than genius how- ever it muft be owned that his talent was not equally proper to treat of all fors of subjects fuch as were devout and pathetic faired beft with his temper grandeur noblenets fweernets and grace were the character of his mind he has pread them to much over all his works that they are the principal marks which diftinguith him from other painters his thoughts are delicate and the difpofition of his objects in gehneral and of his figures in particu- lar is good guido being the firft and favourite disciple of the carracci he for while imitated their guito of delign and their manner but at laft he formed one of his own which was neither fo firm to ex- prelt nor fo learned as annibales yet it came nearer to nature especially in the extremities be- ing the head feet and hands he had particular render strokes for certain parts which he defigned in particular way as the eyes great the mouth little the noftrils fomewhat clofe the hands and feet rather plump than fen- fibly articulated he made his feet too thort and the toes top clofe it was not that he did not know what he did which was the occafion of his not ex- preffing exactly the articulation of the members but to avoid kind of pedantry which he faid there the li es of was in specifying them toe muck however there was mediut berween the que and the other esteme which he ought to hase observed as for his heads they yield no manner of prece- dence to thofe of raphael either for correctnels especially the of exprettions of defign or delicsc upper part of them

affectation there are no landikips of his to be feen and when he treated of subject which required any ex= rent he made ufe of another hand his colouring is like that of the carraccis in the pictures he drew after his firft imanner he has allo but painted fome in the manner of caravag finding there was too much labour in it and befides that it did ot pleafe every body he took to ano- ther manner which the italians call vaga.. of this kind he drew feveral agreeable pieces in which there is great union of coloers though they ate weaker than in his other manners for being by little and little accuftomed to his weakness he neg- lected his carnations or perhaps endeavouring to make eminent nt them more delicate he gave them certain grey call which often fell into livid colour lewassbfolutelyignorant of the claro obicute as was all the fchool of the carraccis yet like his chief mafter lodovico he fomerimes practifed it more through the greatness of his guito than any princi- ples of art in rerrenching from his objects all thofe which divide the fight iis pencil was light and eafy and he was fo well latisfied that freedom of hand was neceffary to pleafe that he

regios gutto and fweetness he aimed allo at giving the whole grace to his imitation not confi- dering of dering that nature who is the difpenter of it had given him but small portion of it his ideas in- ar deed are fomerimes great enough for the greateff performances and his genins could not ftoop to cor- rect them by which means they are often unfinith- ed.. his eafel pieces are not fo much efteemed as what he painted in frefco vivacity of wit and free- dom of hand being very proper for that kind of painting lanfranco guft of defigning refembled his maf rers that is it was always firm

colouring was not fo well ftudied as that of nnibale the tints of his carnations are trivials and his fhadows are little too black he was ig horant of the claro obfcuro as well as his mafter though as

born at bologna in the year his father who was mercer would fain have had him follow his trade but albanis inclination leading wholly to paintung he was put at firtt to denis calvert of whom guido was then learning the rudiments of the art and being far advanced in the knowledge of his profeffion taught his com- panion the principles of defigning when he left his mafter calvert he took him with him to the chool of the carracci having made confiderable progfets there albani went to rome where by hudying the beft things he became one of the moft learned and agreeable painters of italy returning to bologna he married second wife who brought for her portion great deal of beauty and good humour by this means he had quiet at home and perfect model for the women he was to paint she had very handfome children by whom he ufed to draw little cupids playing and dancing in all the variety of poftures imaginable and by his wife he drew all his naked venus and nymphs he made ufe of his knowledge of the belles lettres ingeniouly to adorn the subjects he treared of with the fictions of poetry he is cenfured for not varying his figures enough and for giving al- moft all of them the fame air and the same likeness occasioned by his defigning them after the same mo- olels with the ideas of which his mind was filled there the ve of are few great figures of his drawing extant and painting ufually in little his pictures are dif- perfed all over europe and valued as to many jew- els he was well paid for them especially in his latter days they became very much in fathion and being learned and agreeable every one was taken with them he lived peaceably and happily four- fcore and two years and then changed his life for better in the year his moft famous difci- ples were francefco mola and giovanni battifta his brother refections on the works of ni f being pleafing to the greateft part of man- kind and albanis pictures infpiring that pat- lion they were as well received on that account as for their ingenious thoughts his talent fupport- ed by the ftudy of polite learning enabled him to enrich his compofitions with the ornaments of po- etry his vein was fruitful and eafy and he has done great number of pictures full of figures he underffood defign well and drawing always by the same patterns he fell eafily into the fault of repeat- ing chieffy in the airs of his heads which were very graceful by this means albanis manner is the eafieft to be known of any mafter the subjects he treated of did not give him oc- cation to thew how he could exprets different paf- fions thofe that he has touched tend all to joy and his expreftions are not over delicate we may be bold to fay the grace which we meet with in his pictures is not to much the effect of genius as the habit of his hand his attitudes and draperiesare well enough chofen he was univerfal painter and his landlkips which are more agreeable than learned are like the airs of his heads of the fame defign and the fame touch his eminent colouring is freth and his carnations of fanguine tint but not very much studied he was very unequal in the force of his colours having drawn fome of his subjects in the open field fome with very ftrong colouring and others with very weak as for the claro obfcuro and union of co- lours though he did not know them to be principles of his art yet good fenfe or chance fometimes di- rected him to the ufe of them his works feem to be finithed to the latt degree and though his pictures were drawn with facility yet there are very few free touches to be feen in them prancesco barbieri da cento commonly called born near bologna anno and learned the principles of his art of bolog- ian painter whofe capacity was not extraordinary he left him and others afterwards to enter into the academy of the carracci where he defigned with great manner and great facility but rather with natural than with an ideal guft when he was about to form to himself manner of defigning he ex- amined thofe of the painters of his time guido and albanis feemed to him to be too weak and without cenfuring theirs he refolved to give his pictures more force and come nearer to caravag- gi hile with which he was more pleafed than er- ther with albanisor guidos hethought painter could not imitate the relievo of nature without the help of frong thadows and flrong colours never- thelefs he was guido very good friend and would never live at bologna as long as guidelived to pre vent their compention or rivalship for which rea- fon he always refided at cento cill the death of his .es of he painted for long time after this frong manner but in the declention of his age he alcered his stile not out of his own judginent but as he said to pleafe the ignorant and get money for guido and albanis reputation had drawn the mul- titude after their manner indeed of all the carrac- cis difciples he was the leaft agreeable in his ftile and it is to be withed that to the fierceness of his manner he had joined more noblenels in the airs of his heads and more truth to his local colours his carnations have too much of the lead in them though in general they do not want harmony and whatever there feems to be wanting in his pictures he will always be reckoned great painter by the critics he was as much to be efteemed for his moral vir- tues as for his skill in painting he loved work and folitude he was true to his word an enemy to railing humble civil charitable pious and eminently chafte when he went abroad he was always accompanied with feveral painters who fol- lowed him as their matter and respected him as their father for he affifted them with his advice his credit and his purfe upon occafion though he was very humble there was nothing mean in his behaviour and joined to the uprightness of his mo- rals noble boldness which made him be beloved by the great being laborious he got abundance of money which he laid our for the public ufe and diverfion he gave large fums to build chapels and founded feveral fair hospitals at bologna and elfewhere he died at threefcore and ten years of age anno and made two of his nephews his heirs having lived fingle and chafte lite re in er on the works of guercino vwer cino rudied while in the fchool xt of the carracci yet it does not appear that he has any thing of their character in his works his gufto was fingular his genius eafy but not elevat- ed neither were his thoughts fine it is rare to meet with noblenets in his figures and his expref- lions are not over moving his gufto of defign is grand and natural but not very elegant his inclination led him always to hrong colouring at firft he was very willing to follow his friend guido htile but feeing that painter quitted one which he had then for another more clear and as the italians fay more loofe he immediarely took to caravaggios manner which he tempered as he thought fit he gave union to his colouring by the unifor- mity of his red fhadows but his carnations were not very fresh and yet his gufto naturally inclined him to imitate life which he has often done with fuccefs though fometimes too fervilely and without choice he drew his lights from above and af- fected to make ftrong fhadows to attract the eyes and give the greater forca to his works this is more remarkable in his defigns than in his pictures which keep up their reputation by the ftrength of the shadows the harmony of the colours by the great guft of defign by the fofiness of the pencil and by character of truth which reigns every where through all of them michael angelo merigl commonly called michaee angelo da caravagg born at caravaggio village in the milanefe in the year and made him- telf famous by manner in painting extremely arong ves true and of great effect of which him telf was the author he painted every thing he did in room where the light defcended from on high he followed his models to exactly that he imitated their defects as well as their beauties hav- ing no other idea than the effect of nature prefent co that thofe pictures before him he ufed to fay ss which were not drawn after nature were but as co to many rags and the figares of which they were compoted but as painted cards his manner being new was followed by feveral painters of his time and among others by manfredi and valentine frenchman we mult own the likeness of this manner is very furprizing and has very powerful effect on the moft judicious spectators he drew after him almoft the whole fchool of the carracci for not to name guercino who never left his inanner guido and domenichino were tempted to follow it but it was accompapied with fuch an ill gout of delign and the choice of his lights being the fame in all forts of subjects they fell off from it in very little time his pieces are to be met with in moft of the cablners in europe there are feveral of them at rome and naples and one picture of his drawing is in the dominican church at antwerp which rubens ufed to call his mafter he often brought himself into danger by his con- temptible difcourfe of his cotemporaries especially of giofeppino whom he had made jeft of public- ly one day the ditpute between them ran to high that michael angelo drew his fword and killed young man called tomafino who being gioleppino friend would have parted them up- on this michael angelowas forced to fly to the mar- quis juftiniani to prorect him while he lived in his houfe he drew the picture of st thomas un belict eminent and cupid two admirable pieces for the marquis suftiniani obtained his pardon and reproved him severely for being to outrageous but michael an- gelo as foon as he was at liberty being not able to command his paffions he went to giofeppino and was him the latter antwered ce knight and would not draw his fword againtt his nertled at this antwer inferior haftened to malta performed his vows and exer- cifes and received the order of knighthood as ferving-brother while he was there he drew the decollation of st john baptift for the great church and the portrait of the grand-mafter de vigna-court which is in the king cabinet being dignified with the order of malta he re turned to rome intending to force ciofeppino to fight him but happily for his competitor fever took him and put an end to the dangerous difpute with his life anno on the works of michael angelo da caravagg avagg ideas were like his tem- per very unequal and never lofty his dif- politions were good and his defigns of an ill gout he had not underftanding enough to choofe well or to correct nature all his application was to co- louring and he fucceeded wonderfully in it his local colours are very much ftudied and by the great knowledge he had of lights joined to the ex- alt variety with which he mingled his colours on his pallet without breaking or as we fay cortur- ing them with his pencil the truth that appears in all his works is equally perfect and furprizing his attitudes have no choice in them his dra- peries are like but ill fet and his figures are not agreeably li ves of greeably adjutted nor as becomes their characters he knew nothing of grace or noblenets and if ei of them are to be met with in his pieces it was not done out of choice but by chance however he drew feveral pictures which deferved the name of grand compofitions and he finifhed them with extraordinary nicecy if he was not ma- rer of all the parts of painting we muft own that his portraits at lealt are not to be cenfured his exprestions are not very lively by his works one may eafily perceive he did not fo much confider what would contribute to make his pictures agreeable as what would render his objects fentible in which he was fuccessful by the claro obfcuro by an excellent gufto in colouring by terrible force an agreeable tweetnels and the melloweft pencil that ever was bartholomeo manfredi mantua was caravaggio difciple and imi- tated his manner very exactly the subjects of his pictures are generally perfons playing at cards or dice he died young pagnol native of valentia in spain was caravaggios £ difciple and like his mafter had ftrong manner imitating nature very faithfully but his pencil was not fo mellow as michael angelo spagnoletto delighted in painting melancholy fub- eits his works are disperfed over all enrope but chicny ar naples where he lived long time and drew abundance of fine pieces he ai of the jl rwihl gnd il.. wlinhi vi hubert and ohn fanete natives of maffeyk on the meufe were the firft painters in low-countries that did any thing taking notice of for which we may reckon them the foun- ders of the flemith fchool hubert was the elder brother he bred up john and the latter ftudied to affiduoully that he equaled his maf- ter and elder brother hubert they had both of them genius and skill they worked together and became famous by their performances they drew feveral pictures for philip the good duke of bur- gundy that which was fet up in st john church st gaunt was univerfally admired philipl king of tbe ve of spain not being able to obtain the original got copy of it which he carried into spain with him the subject of this piece was taken out of the reve- lations where the old men adore the lamb this picture is to this day looked upon as wonder and there being great deal of care taken to pre- ferve it it is still very freth it is covered and never expoted to view but on holidays or at the de- fire of perfons of the firft quality after huberrs death which happened in the year his brother john removed to bruges and living altogether in that town he was thence called john of bruges it was this john who in fearching after varurth that might give more force to his colouring found out that linfeed oil mingled colours had very good effect without spak- him the art of varnifh at all ing ufe of any ai painting is indebred for the perfection to which it is arrived by means of this new invention and thus john of brugess works encreafing in beauty were bought up by the great and had one of the firft places in their cabinets the picture which he fent to alphonfo king of naples was the occafion of the difcovery of the fe- cret of painting in oll in italy we have thewn john of bruges in the life of antenio da mieffina was efteemed as well for the folidity of his judg- ment as for his skill in painting the duke of burgundy had t good an opinion of his merit that he made him counfellor of ftate he died in bruges anno and was buried in st donatus' church his fifter margaret would never marry that the might be the more at liberty to exercife her- felf in painting which the paffionately loved albert eminent be rt ur er born at nuremberg on good-friday anno the same day of the year which gave birth to raphael urbin albert durer cu- rious jeweller and goldfmith of that town was fa- ther of albert whofe life we write and taught him his own art and that of graving at fifteen years of age he put him to michael wolgemuth good painter in nuremberg van-mander being in an error when he fays he was martin schon ’ difciple it is true albert would very fain have had him for his mafter but martin death prevented it after having spent three years with michael wol- gemuth he travelled to flanders and from thence through germany to venice at his return he mar- ried being then near three and twenty years of age about that time he began to publith fome of his prints he graved the three graces fome deaths- heads and other bones of dead men and hell with diabolical spectres after the manner of irael of mechlin above the three graces there is globe on which thefe three letters are to be feen ii as much as to fay in the german congue gort hurel god defend us from enchantments he was then about years old for it was in the year that he graved this piece having put his genius in motion he applied himself to the ftudy of defign and became fo great mafter of it that all his cotemporary countrymen of the profeffion made his works their rule and even feveral italians bene- fited themfelves by his prints as they have done fince though with more addrefs and difsuife he was careful in all his plates to put down the year in which they were graved very commend- able thing for the curious may judge by that how old the ve of he was when he did them in the picture of cur saviour paffion he difpofes the lord fupper according to the opinion of occolampadius that of melancholy is his fineff piece and the things that enter into the compofition of his subjects are proof of alberrs skill his madonna are fingular ly beautiful albert put down alfo on his pictures the year in which they were painted and sandrart who faw more of them than any ope elfe fays he did not fee any one of an older date than the year by which he gives us to underfland that albert did rothing of that kind till he was thirty-three years of the emperor gave durer for the arms of painting three crowns two in chief and one in point the character of man of honour which he al- ways maintained his good fenfe and his eloquence gifts beftowed on him by nature procured him feat among the counfellors of the ciry of nuremberg his genius was fo univerfal that he followed the bu- finess of his profeftion and at the same time with cafe minded the affairs of the public he was labo- rious of sweet difpofition and his fortune to good that he might have enjoyed pleafant repofe if his wife had not disturbed his happinels she was of fuck covetous greedy temper that though they had no children and were rich enough yer the was always teazing him to get more her clamours were to troublefome to him they diftracted him in his lnbours and made his life uneafy to get rid of her he went into the low-countries where he con= tracted clofe friendship with lucas of leyden his wife trouble her tears and promites to behave herself better for the future prevailed on his friends at nuremberg to advife him how much the was al tered and to invite hum to return he was perfuad cl pa in eminen by them to try her once more but the foon grew as bad as ever and though he was one of the moft prudent and beft natured men in the world the ifed him to ill that he broke his heart with forrow in the fifty-feventh year of his age anno himfelf wrote his fathers life four years before he died sandrart has given an account of it after that of albert the fon who wrote moft of the things himself which we have faid of him he talks very freely and with great deal of hu- mility of his father poverty how hard it was for him to get his bread and of the mifery he lived in while he was young the moft furprizing thing in his whole life is that he could work fo much and finith fuch vaft number of pictures when his circumftances were to low as they were at firft and his wife fo great shrew he wrote treatife of scometry perspective fortification and the pro- portion of human figures several authors have poken of him with honour and among others erafmus and valari reffections on the works of albert durer man ever shewed to valt and univerfal for the arts as albert durer after he had rried almoft all of them and exercifed him- felf in them fome time he at laft refolved to con- fine himfelf to painting and graving though by di- viding his time between the one and the other art one would think it would have hindered his perfec- tion in either yet he maftered them both by an ex- traordinary application and became perfect in both graving and painting bur example and the firft things that prefent themfelves to ours eyes when we apply to any profeftion being apt to incline our gout to the same way and to give the fame turn to our thoughts albert fuffered for want of being put ve into right method at firft by the fight of the moft beautiful pieces by good education and by the ftudy of the antique his vein was fruitful his composition grand and though the gothicguito prevailed in his time and country yet his produc- tions afforded matter enough not only for the ger- man painters but even for the italians to learn by he was bold in the execution of his deligns he did whatever he fet himfelf about and was fo clean and to exact in all his performances that one may perceive he was entirely mafter of the prin- ciples of his art which he had laid down as fuch in his mind and which related chiefly to defign how- ever it is furprizing that having been at fo much pains to know the structure of human bodies he should make fo little ufe of it for in moft of his orks except his virgins and virtues which accom pany the emperor maximilian triumph his defign is poor and of an ill gufto he imitated nature on- ly according to his own ides of her and was fo far from encreafing her beauty or feeking out the graces that may be found in her that he very rarely copied thofe beautiful places which fortune often furnifhes painter with he was more happy in the choice of his landskips which are generally fet off with agreeable and extraordinary prospects in short his performances as much as they were admired by his countrymen and cotemporaries do not deferve now to be examined according to the rules of the feveral parts of painting for if there is one good property in them there are great many bad ones neverthelefs we muft do that ju- rice to albert memory to own that though his defigns were of gothic guito they were learned and the novelty of his prints acquired him great deal of reputation upon which vafari faysof him cc if this excellent and exact artift whofe genius was univerfal had been bornin tufcany as he was cc er in germany and had had the opportunity of ftu- dying the beautiful pieces that are at rome as the of reft of us have done he would have been the beft co painter of italy as now he is to he reckoned the rare and moft celebrated genius of the fle- school eor nuremberg hudied raphaels works very much and underffood the art of graving on copper as well as that of painting he affifted marc antonio in divers of his performances and when he returned to his own country he drew many pictures and graved feveral plates on subjects of his own invention which are to many proofs of the beauty of his genius and of his skill he put down the letters of his name on his pieces thus and was an artiff very famous in his time et er nd it munich was man of skill he painted al- moft all the palace of munich for maximi- lian duke of bavaria who had taken him into his service he drew the defigns of the hermits of ba- varia which were graved by raphael and john sadeler as alfo feveral other things of his defigning the four doctors of the church which he defigned were engraved by giles sadeler at the fame time flourifhed matthew grunewale who painted after the manner of albert durer corneltus engel bert leyden was cotemporary with candito and grunewalt several very good pieces of his drawing drawing are to be feen at leyden and utrecht he had two fons who imitated his manner very exact- ly cornelius cornelie and lucas cornelis the latter finding there was nothing to be got by paint- ing to little was it encouraged in his time and country was forced to turn cook but his genius would not let him abandon an art in which he might eafily arrive to perfection fo he returned to his firft profeftion and became mafter he went to england and was employed by henry viil who took him into his favour as well a into his service na vahn bruffels was painter to margaret gover- ness of the low-countries for whom he did feveral fine pieces as alfo for the churches in that and other cities in brabant and flanders when he drew any picture of confequence he laid some leaf- gold for his ground and painted upon it which kept his colours freth and in certain places added luftre to them especially in celeftial light which he painted in picture of the day of judgment that is in the chapel of the alms-houfe at antwerp he drew great many defigns for tapeftries by order of the emperor charles and the chief of the tapeftry- work which was done for the pope and other princes at that time after raphael ’ defigns was committed to his care to fee them well execured he was one of raphael urbin ’ difciples mic hael co mechlin learnt the principles of his art of bernard van orlay after which he went into italy was raphael difciple and generally made ufe of his ideas in the pictures he drew for his own invention emment was barren and brought forth with diffic culty his defign and colouring were of raphacls golt when he returned to flanders he had the inanagement of the execution of fome of raphaels defigns for tapeftry he died at antwerp anno being fourfcore and fifteen years of age lvcas et den as taught the firft principles of painting by his father but nature had beftowed on him to many advantageous qualities for the art that at nine years old he began to engrave and at four- teen publiffed leveral plates as confiderable for their beauty as their number his knowledge of paint- ing was as forward as that of graving and his per- formances in both were exact and clean he fol- lowed the ftudies neceffary to his profeffion with ex- treme diligence and if the time he spent in look- ing after the effects of nature had been employed in rudying the antique what was faid of albert du- rer on the like occafion might have been faid of him viz that his works would have been admired in all ages he was magnificent in his way of liv- ing dreffed well and spent his money freely lucas and albert carried on friendly correfpon- dence together and were emulous of

him moft was that he could not work at eafe however he had fuch love to his art that ill as he was he could not forbear working -bed and being told that his application to it in the condition he was in be it fo would haften his end he replied co will have my bed to be bed of honour and ce can not die in better pofture than with my pen- was fcarce forty years old co cil in my hand when he departed

maintain her- felf while he was at his mothers friend of his coming to fee him by chance shewed him print which frier had juft then given him at the fight of it he felt within himfelf violent inclination to copy eminent pa it which he did with some fort of fuccels and this begot in him defire to learn the art of paint- ing he began to ftudy it and finding himfelf as it were in another element both natural and plea- fant he grew well and made confiderable pro- grets in his new profeffion an accident happened foon after which quickened his zeal to arrive to perfection in the art he fell in love with pain- ter'sdaughter who was very handfome and belov- ed by painter much more mafter than he was love and emulation puthed him on in the profecu- tion of his ftudies and made him leave nothing un done that might contribute to render him more kkilful in order to fupplant his rival this ftory is told in another manner by some who will have love to have been the fole agent in the matter and that cupid took the hammer out of his hand and put the pencil into it this is the com- mon opinion and his epitaph is much to the fame purpofe as alfo feveral epigrans written on the fame subject there are great many pictures of his drawing at antwerp and among others defcent from the crofs in our lady church he generally did half figures and portraits by which means his works being to be removed with eafe from place to place are difperfed throughout all europe his manner was fingular and had nothing in it like that of other painters it was finithed and his co- louring ftrong he lived long time and died anno of calcar or calker ative of calcar town in the dutchy of cleves was very excellent man but his un- timely death hindred his thewing himfelf to the world as otherwife he

deceived and it is pro- bable many more will be fo from venice he went to rome where having made himfelf very well acquainted with raphael manner he staid while and then proceeded to naples in which city he died anno it was this calcar who defigned the anatomical figures for andreas vefalius book of phyfic and anacomy as alfo the portraits of the painters that are before the lives written by

turks to reprefent any figure he spent his time in defigning the parti- cular prospects in the neighbourhood of conttanti- hople and the manner of the turks living of which he has left many wooden
