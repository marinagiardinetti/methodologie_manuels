ra he translators preface to the reader th vy +he author ’ known abilities and great reputation in having juftly recommended him to the esteem of the most knowing there thought it very proper to make him speak englith and the ratker to uje his own rea- son for that the many excellent authers hove writtin on painting yet in bulk they seem rather to cry up the art and artiff than lay down solid rules for attainment to which may add that those authers are moftly useless to an englifuman and few or none copious enough to answer general purpole nor at beft are of absolute service in england where fresh and fair natureis preferr ’ before the brown and warm colouring of some other countries especially italy where the beft books have been written on the subject but princi- pally for that think nothing has been publissed here so learned full and compleat and so well explained by plates and examples as tbe auther will be found to be ner perhaps wherein portraiture branch which england mightily affects is so copioufly bandled the author learned the rudiments of his art under his father and at amkterdam whither be came toung from lurtich the capital of bishoprick of that name in

copies of verfes penn ’ by the beft peets of that time and prefix ’ to each of his thirteen books which have omitted in the translation as being of no significancy to an englith reader the aforefaid remarks and observations were originally in french and in compiting the auther made several additions to them even while the sbeets were printing off which may possibly make the work seem in some places less smooth than otherwife it would be the certainly the better for them judging with piato non chim txdet bis dicere quod bene dicitur he tells us that if connexion in general be not so well observed as might be wished it was occason ’ by his doing the work prece-meal and taking things as they arese and that if he be thought to speak too freely and censure otber nens works too rably it should be considered that as man he has bis failings in common with others nevertheless if his reasons be impar- tially examin ’ be questions not an acquittal for says be if any works be read without love and impartialiry the labour of inftruction is loft wherefore he who would reach fundamentally and well mult avoid prepoffestion wergh duely what feems odd to him and inquire and reafon throughly before he fix either his thoughts or opinion of things he also says that if he be any where found to preseribe rules which he has not aleays followed tis oxing to his dark condition where in his memory and ideas became more rigerous bright and intent and coh- sequently his judgment more sirong acure and refined by continual re- fections on the art than wben he had his sight and was bussed in his imployment for further satisfaction in this point see chav vilts of st book of colouring now remains to be obferved that as his chief talept lay pifiety the nobleff branch of paiating and allowing the greateft freedoms to the heat of his zeal and the many inconveniencies attending portrainure might possibly indace him to spedk little too ireely of the latter in dook vii however hope he will be

dvantage above theig ther that being accuses alle gncts he can eatily execute the bold and light manner in rangataerrife difficutt to bring the hland to neat painting the reafon of which is that ot being ufed to confider and imicate the fullnets of small objects be muff therefore be stranger to it befides it is more eaty to leave put some things which we are mafters of than to add others which ye have not fiudied and therefore it muft be the artiffs care to finith pis work as much as poffible tis ridiculous to hear the disciples of great maffers boat that copying great things they certainly obtain great and firm wianner and of penciling second tint and beauty book and fat and bold pencil and therefore are induced to difrelith every thing that is neat and elaborace but after all they can fay tis cer- tain that he who would handle beff muff rudy that manner which moff exactly exhibits the different narures of the objects which he is to reprefent for thereare no other flandlings of advantage to paint- er than the two before mentioned but further to convince any one that great and bold handling contribures nothing to the art let us place piece thus painted at due dillance and then fee whether the penciling makes it took more natural his advantage it may perhaps have it may bring in more money fince to happy mafter can difparch double the work of nother through the bent of an imagination firted to the expedition of his hand each branch has peculiar handling adapted to the narure of the objects to be reprefented as the landskip-painter in the leafing of trees the cartle

advantage of the arriff only the art being theory of the mind and the handling manual praltice confitting of penciling in an orderly and decerminate matter for reprefenting an object certainly and quickly and without muddling many are of opinion that this is cift of natme peculiar to some only and tho can not incirely dilown it yer muft fay that it lies more in pratice and tho we fee many painters in the decline of their lires fall into an hard and muddy manner yet that argues not againtt my polition fince it happens either through in-lination or want of better foundation in their vourh how offen do we fee mafters known by their disciples little and flovenly mafters never bring upneat and curious painters tho it fome times happens that neat matter may rear flovenly dikciple and the reaton is plain for good inftrultion is not alone fufficient without doe and perfet apprehention of it carelessnets being the ulual pa- rent of bad pilture and to infelting an evil will continue as long as the artiff remains in this lgnorance it is certain then in order to obtain good handling that right and early apprehention of instruction and thorough sight of faults of penciling second tint and beauty are ablolutely neceltary when thefe points are gained the artiff mult endeavour at the three following effential qualitications boldaets of hland in the dead colouring more care circumspection and labour in the second colouring nd thorough pacience and attention in the re-fouching or finithing pilture the nigher to perfection the more care thefe three qualities are as effential to painter as the three graces t venus our firft work then mutt be to lay both lights and shades bold with broad and full coloured pencil one by the other even and without muddling and then gently moving the pencil to and fro up and down as the nature of the object requires we thereby unite the colours and fetch out the relief wich this caution neverthelets that the lights mull not be fcumbled too much into the shades or the shades into the lights thus the work will have good effect by proceeding in this manner we shall perceive no very particular handling in our work and therefore

perceive in land skip of other within door painting and whether the shades should be ftrong or not fince it certain that the objects whether great or tmall have different efects in thefe two inftances and now if the perspettive be also well managed and the colours laid fresh and proper and well bundled by gently uniting them with large pencils the piece will be good if this hindling and meling of

and worn ones which to muddle the work and fill ir to full of hairs that it will bear fcraping this evil is to ftealing that ar latt it be comes habirual and then the painter neither minds or fees it

fingle figure no bigger than the life how shall we manage in order to give this latter picture the same force as the former antwer that force and warmth he in the colouring not in the roughness of

second diltance and then work to the off part of the picture now in order to proceed with certainty we muft take care that general harmony of parts be well obferved that the tints and colours be justly managed according to the laws of depth and diltance to that nothing appear offentive to the eyc and then the work will be in fit condition for second colouring with little trouble many painters indeed err in not knowing where to begin rightly and only confulting what objects they like beft heedietly tall on them firft for inftance if it be gold vafe they begin with that and then proceed to blue drapery then red one toc others begin with the nudities and to run thro all the nakeds in the picture by which ftrange disjunction the work becomes mif hapen and the paint- or made more uneaty

have done and falve all by laying the picture is but dead coloured on finishing it shall be tberwife what is now too light shall be brought down and what teo dark beigbtened — but all this while the

and its requifiies piece be well deadcoloured and have good harmony and decorum we certainly render the secend colouring the more eaty for then we can unbend our firfl general thoughts and apply them folely to lay neatly and finith particular parts and to to work on the former good ground but to do this in the bell manner we mull as laid begin from the greateff lointain the sky and werk forwards from thence by this means we have always wer ground to mell in with the outlines of the forward figures which otherwife they would not have befides another pleafing advantage that the piece goes forward all parts well supported and good harmony in the whole whence the rye mult be fatisfied and the mind concinually spurr ’ this manage ment is one of the prime qualities of painter for what can encou= rage him more than an affurance that he works on fure bafis and which he finds without feeking it but unhappy is he who works diforderly for muddling on one thing as long as his fancy for it lafts and then thoughtlefly proceeding to others and dwelling on them in the same manner he miffes the necellary becoming air of his piece and at laft all appears out of joint and difrelithing having come thus far we proceed to the manner chap of retouching or finishing the french call it recov- cher we revile fure painter is having got thus far let experience and his own reffection be judges for the figures having their pro- per dillances strengths and effects and all parts due harmo- ny and keeping nothing remains but to give the piece the laft force of light and shade todo which well rub your piece or to much as you think you can paint of it at one time and before the vernith grow dry with good thin pifture-vernis mixed with some fat white oil then work on this wet ground by clapping your lights on the lightef parts and by secend tint and beauty book by ventle scumble unite them with the wet ground aforefaid ann the tenderncts of the nudities and draperies in foch degrce as is neceffary for each then put in the vellow or glow of the reffecti- ons if after all the lights of the nudicies should be here and there too frong reduce them by mixing little light oker vermilion brown red lake or afphalcum according as the colour is tender or rrong under the vernith glazed thinty over them then heighten upon this with fuch colour as you thirk fir do the same by the draperies thus the work will fucceed and the colours be prevent- ed from going in in drying chap vi of the secend tint and the relief it occasions her are many who whatever pains they take can not be brought to relith thing in which they find to much diffi- culty they who have long practifed after nature are vexed to fee the works of other mafters beter coloured and more pleating than their own infomnch that with difficulry they re-affume their profeffions and thea eagerly hoping to do wonders find their old veration fill return would thefe menrightly fearch the caute their trouble would end for tho we are narurally better pleated with great maffers works than our own becaute of our inferiority in knowledge yet we muff not be therefore difcouraged but as faid fludy where the fault lies let us then make good reffeltions on neat piltures in order to profit by them and alfo converfe with better mafters than ourfelves tis to be lamented that thefe men fomerimes fee fine things in another mafter but can give no reason for it becaufe they work ra- ther by accident or chance than on fure principles as was the cale of young painter some vears ago who shewing me fome of his pieces faid — this piece painted fix tears age this four and thot less yet can perceive no difference between them in goodness now tho the difference was vilible the laft pieces appearing hetter managed in all parts than the former yet he would not believe me trying thar notwichilanding all his endeavours his pictures were grey and muddy when others were clean and pleafant and their lights broad —ilay on my colours tays he fine and warm as they do and then expediciously scamble thew into eack other now pray tell me what mus p mast tint and beauty chap of penciling then eccason this foulness — teld him —certain painters with whom you daily converfe spoil you and as long as you follow them all woy advice is to no purpose as jor your thoughts and ordennances like them very well but dislike your handling you de not lay on your second tint clean enough by the secend tint mean that which is laid on the light parts cowards the out line by means of which all relieved or round parts are forced to unite with the ground and to go off round ing this you mult lay on clean and beautiful in the same colour as that of the light but it mult not be muddy and like sbade for be- ing alfo lighted by the day the darknels and its grey can have no effelt upon it relief or roandness being nothing elle than light receding or geing of which ought to partake more or lets of blue in proportion to the colour of the carnation which if yellowifh the second tint mult be greenith if red the tint mult be violet and if whice colour the tint is medium between the two co- lours aforefaid from all which premifes tis ealy to apprehend that this second colour is to be got and mixed with bine but not with foul colour becaute it then lofes it fleshiness — here he asked me in what manner then he should make it darker antwered that as the diftance of objects caules faintnels in colouring and what we call ir makes bluiss interposition between us and them to he mult mix nothing with his tint but fine blue or small in proportion to such diftance this is colour if may fo fay which gives no co- lour or does it without much alteration this conduct relaces not only to nudities but allo to landskips grounds stones draperies and in fine to every object having either roundnels or diftance moreover another perfection neceffary to this tint is that we muft not let it be too dark upon the relief becaute broad light looks ma- jeflic and fipne when between it and the broad shade tender diffe- rence only appears —he returned me thanks and went off there are many who know not the importance of the things they rlight and in comparifon with others think them of no great mo- ment as was the cafe of another painter who copying piece of poutin obleryed nicely the colouring tempering even the half shades and tender tints exactly on his pallet but having finithed the piece he in other pictures fell again into his old road he himfelf law very well great difference between this piece and thofe others and was forry for it but the mifchief lay in not retaining the manner which of penciling second tint and beanty book which he had before imitated with to much pains and this occafion ed his stigbtness we find even painters who believe that the second tint mult upon excremines be quite dark mixing in it the colour of the ground and fay the great mignard did so which intirely deny it is true that once read fmall trearife written by the famous bofe ehti- iled le peintre converti or the converted painter in which among other things he precends to prove that mignard made his secend tist too dark on the extreminies of his objects but fay that it muft not be underftood from thence that he muddled the tint with foxter groundcolour but rather that in proportion to the lightnets or darknels of the ground he made it either lighter or darker with- out uting any red vellow or black in it as they prerend moreo ver we know the vall difference between foreright face and afore- chortened one that the one on the near side grows larger than the ther as the faces in plate plainly thew which by observing or regleding gives the painting either great elegance or indecorum the greateff difficulty fome painters meet with is that one of the quanties of good picture lies in broad light this they ima- gine to confift in fiarness reafoning thus if it be truth that pic ture with fuch lighes is beft more round ones mult needs be worle very loofe argument certainly since narure and daily experience of round objects teach us the contrary especially when it is not sun thiny weather have faid before that the contour or out line ought to wwite in the tints of the groand that going off from the more enlightened parts ii say sof appear to much as the others to illultrate which we ex- hibir here in placel aforefaid round pillar againtt ground half light half shade to that the light side of the pillar is fer off by the shade of the ground and the shade of the pillar by the light side of the ground now it muft needs follow in order to ovtain the relief that the shade of the pillar ought to be made lighter on the excremity that it may round off towards the light ground therwife it would be but semicircle on the oppolice side tis the tame except that the light does preferve itfelf and its own colour becaute the air which interpofes caules the our-lme to recede and fall back and in the shade the fame with this difference only that there fn chap of penciling second tint and beauty if there it is deubled by the lighiness of the back-ground partaking more of lefs of its colour if this be not well apprehended let the next example explain it place globular body againlt light yellow ground as in the said plate then viewing it at some diltance you will perceive the out- snderly to melt into the ground without any line on the haded hardnels this relates to the roundaets only now let us obferve how much the colour partakes of if this ball be of blue colour the extremities will be greenith apainn the vellow if the ball be violet they become purplith and if the ball be vellow as well as the ground they will be more yellow in the shade as we have already taught in treating of the naked the fuperficial roughness or smoochness of the ball caufes litle alle- tation except with respect to its nearness to or dillance from the ground looking now on the light side of this ball we shall find that if the ball be lighter than the yellow ground the colour of the ground can not then have fo much force on it fince the fuperficial colour of the ball can not be overcome by leffer colour than it and therefore the yellow ground can not add to its colour whence it happens that the meer interposstion of the hir caules the relief or the ourline to round and go off again were the ground darkith or black yet the diminishing of the coloar cauted by the interposition of the air will be nither less nor more but will be more or less fet off by the ground and feem lets round arcifls err in thinking that the balf tint which is laid next to the excremity on the light side and called mezzo-fint is the fame with that placed between light and shade under the name of middle tinr for this laft is whole tint and the other but an half tint and not to broad as the mezzotint which more than half mixes with the shade and confequently is olser altho ’ some give it upon the edge of the light side another colour more like shade than the colour of the objecl the mistake of which we have already thewns bur when the light is froncing or comes directly from before then this merzoint is half mixed with the middle tint let me not here be mifunderflood for speak not of the side light which bainters generally wtc from of penciling second tint and beauty book from all which premifes his plain that this tiat though called mer of broken tint can not be confidered as shade fince it partakes of the light again it happens frequently that in the fame piece of painting than athers tome objects are rounder or darker upon the may gdid till da she point which ought to be fo when by means of of sight we can difcover more than the semidiameter of their round- and but semidiameter or less in others as in the dets two pillars in the plare aforefaid for if the point of sight be in the middle of the piece and the light fall in it obliquely from the right side then the objects on the right side will have broader shade and thofe on the left broader light as thefe two pillars plainly evidence but if now on each side of thefe two pillars were fome other pillars placed alike diltant from the point of sight and both cut from top to borrom through their centers parallel with the horizon it is certain that at the proper diftance we thall fee not only the in ward splitting but alfo some purt of the hindermoft half as in pil lar now obferre as the pillar to the left thews that the part which is feen beyond the half on the light side rounds off fo much the further and confequently becomes darker than where the main light rounds off on the contrary viewing the light side of the right hand pillar you fee as much less of the foremolt diameter or half as more of that on the shaded side wherefore

full se- nate of the death of cato or the nuptials of stratonica with an fiectus or the reception of the qucen of sbebs with her retinue of ladies by solemon cc becaule different pustins are to be

graceful modelfy and auchoriry and now who will not agree with me that the two former sub- jeltsought to be handled with frong and sirp lights and the two latter with joft and more tender ones this effect lies alfo in the very na- tures and qualities of lights themfelves fome producing strength and sharfnes others sweetness softness and pleasure but contra- manarement renders things fulje and contradistory becaute then our two former examples may be called graceful confussm and the two latter fevere amour wherefore conclude that figure well proportioned and ditpoted having graceful motion and sway and light agreeable to its out-line and motion may be called perselt figure chap viii of the motion of the members et us proceed now to the second of the parts wherein beauty contifls namely the motion of the mfembers this depends chiclly on contraring or oppesstion of all the members of the bodr and on their lights and skaass which give figure morion and life and this is chiefly obtained by winding s as when the face is froncing the body mult turn little fidewars and the legs again fronting see fig plare vii lecond obfervation is contraft in the inclining poise of the bo- from hend to

beauty the right knee or foot rifing again and the contrary on the op pofite fide of the body third obfervation is that when the right arm and left leg at vance the left arm and right leg fall back but this motion doubles when the right shoulder is feen fronting for then the head and under part of the body muft be the fame fame figure thews when the breaft rifes the headought to fink and the contrary see fig the head mult always meline to the upper shoulder as in fig in an erect pofture the feet mult make rectangle to wit the heel of the one with the inward ancle of the other as in fig hunds mult always have contraping motion if one be seen inward- ly the otherought to be ourward if one hang down the other should be railed up the under purt of the arm being forethortened the upper part should be feen direct if the thigh be forehortened the lee should be direct as in fig the motion of the legs is almolt like that of the arms comparing the upper part of the arm with the thigh and

proceeding from the fame members to wit the simple the active the paftive and the violent the simple is when the members move naturally as in walking one foor is fer before the other in drinking or

penciling second tint and beauty the three conditions of an bealthy and fick person and dead body applied to child man and woman the child being in health is of roly colour the man of warm and glowing colour and the woman of fair colour but in sickness the child inclines to yellowith pale the man to dark pale or fallow and the woman to milkith or yellowith white colour being dead the child is violet the man more grey yet fome- what yellowith and the woman like the child but more beautiful as having the whiter skin the reafon of which is that the child having thin skin and being full of blood mult appear ruddy the man being more yellow and his skin thicker mult appear more grev fince the blood can thine less thro it and the woman having white and fmooth skin mult therefore thew herfelf fomewhat ruddy hence it is that child in its tender parts is more violet man more grey and woman blue yet more upon the green than the violet all this is demontirable by the colours themfelves for mixing blue and red it becomes violet for children blue red and vellow make grey for man and yellowith white mixed with very lirle red and blue gives greenness for woman now in order to hrike the right colour for each take thefe for the child whice and vermilion it being prety ruddy for the man the lame with the addicion of fome yellow oker which makes it more warm and alfo more fiery for the woman take whire lirtle vermilion and some yellow oker and to know perfectly the proper tint of the tenderness of each of thefe three perfons you murt in finithing take some small or ultramarine alone

academy-figures take an arm out of one lee eut of another here face there drapery and out of another body in order to make of the whole an ordonnance but towhom does the honour belong has fomebody uted an ordonnance of poufin is the delign that perfons or poufins this is like duck-eggs harched by an hen and we are puzzled to know to whom the praile is due but its certain that if the true owners of fuch borrowed goods were each to take his own from fuch painters fear their genuine offspring would be but fmall it would even fare with them as with eresmnss cuman ass who with the lion skin look ’ terrible but his ears difcovering him he was sript of his borrowed cloaths and feverely bantered by every one but another mifchief attending this method of proceeding is that it makes them flight the life nay oftentimes forget it whereby and the neglect of rules they never become good deligners the necelfary ufe of prints confills herein that next to what has been laid in the preceding chapter and the skerch fetrled we in- form ourfelves what great mafters have thought and done in the fame subject how they chofe their objects and with what by-works of namented this will improve our thoughts the next thing we hre to obferve is the grace of their actions faces lights and shades and if any thing be for our purpofe sock it in the life or if draper fies take them from the layman thus we may call the work our own but above all we mult make ule of academy-figures of our own do= lign especially thofe done in private no figure muft be painted twice in one ordonnance without urgent necefficy but the following ornaments whether our own or others we may lawfully ufe fuch as trees stones tombs fountains urns statues ruins all sorts of architecture and other ornaments as much as we pleafe he who goes further bigots himfelf fo much to prints and other mens thoughts that he thinks himfelf under necoffity to exprets every thing their way but it certain our im in viewing prints is twe fold firfl to footh and pleafe the eye next to enrich our thoughts when we are about compofition of our own for then they prove of the greaseff advantage to tyro in giving him not only fine thoughts bit alfora pleafant and beautrful manner agreeable feffures gracefid actions well-call draperies and whats above all quickness of thought of ordennance or composition book ii and warmer iaclination as is more amply thewn in my drawing-book chrp of probability and what is painter- like in an orden nance of few or many figures robabil it as operating on the mind and imagination by the helo of sight ought chiefly to be obferved in the par- fition and representation of hiftories and is next in confideration to the three branches wherein beaury confifts of which we have al ready fpoken it ought to appear not only in general but in each single object and we mull take care to rejell every thing repugnant to it in order to it contider what charafters the subjett confifts of whe ther of people of fathion or ordinary people or of both mixt let this appear in their carriage shape graceful motion and pleafant colouring as being people of education if the figures be ruffical let rufficity be vifible in them not on- ty in dress bu in their behaviour colour and motion and if therein fome agreeableness appear let it hill favour of rufficity by this means and what follows your thoughts will appear natural and likely to wit by giving mere or less beauty to pertons of condition and more or less simplicity to meaner perfons one may be thort ano ther tall one fquab and corpulent another thin and flender one fomewhat crooked another of brown or pale complexion one of quick another of flow motion nay in three or four figures there ought to be at leaff one quite unlike the reft might fay that hardly any two ought to be alike among or one at leaft should be hunch back ’ and tho this may feem to contraditt what we have before faid touching beauty yet it gaintays it not in reference to condition fince an hunch back wry shoulders difforted hips bigger or lets head have as good an agreement with the other mem bers as the moft handfome-made if it be asked what would be wanting if the figures were all well proportioned yet some inferior to others in beauty antwer that thele laft but in fome meafure partake of the agreeablenets of the others and one in lets degree than another and as it is truth tha of ordennance or composition chap great people are subjelt to deformity of body as well as firtle ones to their deformity is not to vifible as in meaner perions hence think my opinion not ill grounded that chieffy in refor- tual compoficions fuch as plays divine services courts of juflice and concourfes of all sorts of people all sorts of shapes are to be introduced as crooked thort tall awry fat and lean and even fome same and crippled as occation requires but then they mult be to diffected that without offence to the eye they do by comparifon infentibly fet off other figures near them which is main proof of the likelihood or probability of an hiffory but to make this point the plainer shall thew the difference between one old perfon and nother and one young perton and another each in lets or greater degree of beauty and confirm it by examples as for the handling of fables and emblems thefe leing not falts but fictions confifting moftly of virtues and vices require quite different management for in reprefenting virtue no blemith muft ap- pear and in vice no perfection as to deities who ought to be perfect in every respect we shall as occafion offers write more at large and treat of them throughly in felect chapter and in the mean time thew here fome different hlandlings of the fame thing in perfons of different conditi- ons as in plate xii ekample no shews the different grace in taking hold of glass the one takes it with full fill no takes it lower with some manners no is princess holding cup with the tips of her three fingers drawing warily and agreeably the little finger from it no isa lady ’ woman who fearful of spilling holds the glats handily yet lels agreeably than the other no prince holds it handily and cautioully below on the fgot ekample here you fee again the effelts of edncation between people of condition and more common perfors very worthy painter' votice non of ordennance or composition book ii shews clownith pealant and how greedily and diforiterly he eats out of his porrenger he fits and leans with both elbows on the table embracing his dith with both arms felt fomebody should take it from him he helds the spoon with his thumb and fingers under the porrenger his mouth ever the dith and his chin advanc es to meet the spoon his head is funk in his shoulders and he bends forwards with his upper parts no sits upright and being better bred holds the porrenger by one ear and the spoon with three fingers by the end of the shank he opens his mouth but litle again appears difference in no reprefeating gentlewoman holding the spoon with the tips of three firgers and the hand over the shank in very greeable manner and in no vou fee lady managing spoon with lets grace than the other this pleating air is admirably obferved by the great rapbael and correggio and particularly by barocci as we may fee in find print afier one of his paintings where mary is reprefented with spoon in her hand taking some spoon meat out of dith held by an angel in order to give it to the child ixsus who half fwaddled flands in her lap this print is in my judgment to admirable for grace and to natural modeft and great that nothing could be bet ter exprett tho the two preceding examples might be fufficient to thew all ther handiings and the difference of action in particular conditions of persons we shall nevertheless add third ekample iii shews how attentive the two peafants fland liftening the one with an high back advances his chin and ftares at the speaker as if hei look thro him he hugs himfelf and refts on both legs which witt the toes are fradling the knees fomewhat bent and the feet tun ed inwards the other flands freight poiting his body moftly off ofn leg has one hand by his side and with the other takes hold his garb on his breaft the other leg little turned is fomewha more forward and his belly fomewhat slicking out his whole car more agrecable than thar of the other again we fee lrepumble gendewoman of lnottell gace he carriage lofty and agreeable one hland refts under the breaft colfard of ordonnance or composition body the intide of the hand turned upwards fingers loofe

heel turned towards the inward ande of the other foot now on comparing the other woman flanding by her likewife liftening we may fee what difference education makes in people attions both her hlands

fwell not in tuch obfervations as thefe confiff the very nature and grace of compotition be it of many or few figures in reference to persons and therefore can not too much enforce the enquiry into to important point fpeak here of grand majefic and most agreeable action for the contrary is naturally and daily to be found in us and tho ma- ny would be better thought of yet they thew the contrary by daily converlation with mean people whereby they slip the opportunity of getting better ideas of genteel carriage contenting themfelves with thooting at random only however they excule themfelves by fay- ing that they have no opportunity of getting into fine company weak shield to defend their sloth do not the church the playhoule and the park give them hlandle enough to fee fine people and to ob- ferve how they behave as for me before had the happinets to which we may fometimes arrive by the smiles of friends mift no opportunity of making obfervations and noting them in my pocket- book which an hiltory-painter ought always to have about him wherever he soes and with good reafon for thoughts are often fo volatile and llippery as to be retained with difficulty as have before intimated in the firff chapter about ordennance nay when faw an handlome gentlewoman walking in the street made it my bulinets to enquire into the recson of ber grace and in what it contifted and wby she appeared more agreeable than others and on the contrary why ych refealches as thefe we come to the lothers are less agreeables and tas well by the one sort of knowledge of what is people as the other but beft by fludging what is mofl fublime and rand let me then perfuade the arcift to this method not as whink it the only true one or to diffuade him from any other but as inlet to to ufeful knowledge and by which we obtain the finell thingss no ii of ordonnance or composition which as have faid when once loft may perhaps never be retrieved many miltake who think that magnificent garb and rich ornaments as jewels pearls gold and filver stufts cc are infallible marks of the greatness and power of people but can the moft difcerning certainly conclude them to be fuch by thefe tokens without enquiring whether their education be equal to their grandeur even then allo they may be deceived fince fome mean people have naturally or by imitation fuch an air and carriage that were their dress anfwerable they would be taken for great ones the reafon of which is that at firtt sight there appears uttle difference between falfe jewels and true tho' on nice enquiry may be found as in the jewels fo in their altions and behaviour fuch difference as points out their true character again if thefe different conditions depended only on rich cloaths nothing would be more ealy to painter than this difficult part of rt fince at that rate there could be no fathion or broom-sick might become lady hood nevertheless there have been and sill are painters enough infelted with this opinion and follow it as law thinking that drvid solomos and abasucrus would not be known for kings did not their crowns thew it thefe forfooth they mult always have wherever they are and as well in the bed-chamber as on the throne and the sceptre as well at the table as at the head of an army fay nothing yet touching their royal robes he who duely weighs what have been faying muft allow that state and carriage are two fuch excellent qualifications that picture cant be faid to be good without them nay think them the very soal of geed piftare but as noble soul in well-haped body without the addision of ornaments vifibly shews itself to of courte tirch are needlets in exprefting true greatness indeed when ornaments are introduced with judgment and caution they add to the splendor of pixture but nothing to charafter nor can cause any passions fee in raphael pouffin deminichine and barecir who far from approving it have by the very simplicity of their figures thewn the extraerdisary greatness have been peakipg of if any object that rapbait himself has not obferved this condult in his story of bathsbeba where he reprefents duvid in window with crown on his head or where abrabam courts his sarab in sun thiny weather which afar off is feen by abimelech leaning on balluftrade as for the firtt composition mult fay if may speak mind that do not over like it or indeed apprehend it buu father of ordennance or composition chap believe it to have fard as some faulty things did with me which being done in my apprenticeship am ftill under some conterr for but by the incroduction of the sunfhine his thoughts may poke fibly be finer than they appear at firft view becaute had not the sium thone on that amorous couple abimelech could not at his distance from them have feen their courthip and if he had reprefented them in any other corner of the room than that where they were they could not have been ficting however fince great malters have their failings tis probable that raghaets bible-prints were fooner or lat- er either deligned or painted by his beft ditciples viz tulie romano gie francesse penni or pierine del vaga from his skerches and after- wards retouched by himfelf fince tis impoffible that one mafter could disparch to much work in fo short time tho he had quick pen cil befides his cuftom was to keep his works long by him for the fake of improvements and to give the laft hland and the urmoll per- feltion to them but as for this bible if it be obferved with attenti- on there will be found great difference between one ordonnance and another tho in some the greatness and likelibood are well pre- served but to conclude the matter of this chapter mull lay that my precepts ought not only to be obferved in an ordonnance of many but of few figures alfo fince it is very difficult to bring them all into one story but if the subject be courtly as of solemen abaswerus or fuch-like it muft be known that the perfons to whom majetty and grace are moft proper ought to exceed in it viz the king mong his courtiers the queen among her ladies governour among citizens and thus the greater above the lets according to his quality office or dignity this caules proper diltinction of superiority and exalts the prime perfon above the reft even peafants who are little converfant with the towns and know tomewhat of good manners are obferved to turpals others worfe carriaged than they in their difcourfes holiday-mirths and church-ceremo nies but clownithness mult appear in them tho with respect to the paffions some may appear to excel others except that if burgo- mafter or topping citizen be mingled amongft them he mull appear tuperior to them all by his handsome carriage and city-behaviour ordennance or composition book ii vi of the difference between touth and age in both sexes he artiff ought not only to mind nicely the actions but allo the difference of the perfons who are to compofe his ordounance and he mult have great regard both to univerful and parti- uler differences as well in the sexes as their ages children alter commonly every three vears and till they are fix vears of age have always thort necks and round fingers the difference between boys and girls is vifible in their outward parts without opening their legs as tefa does in the imall members the difference is not very vifible tho girls are fomewhat thinger have fmaller ears and longer heads their arms are likewife more round next and above the wrift and their thighs thicker than thofe of boys but the upper part of boys arms is thinner and fmaller thofe of francefco quefneyare incomparably fine to paint after nay nobody has attained his perfeltion we fee his often reprefented either without hair or but very little whether he thought it more beauti ful or it was his choice in making models can not determine yet methinks boys may very well fomerimes be allowed hair and that frequently curled girls may have theirs twifted and wound on their heads with flying locks ferving not only for ornament but diftinc tion of sexes boys of or years old may have hair finely curl ’ girls more thick and diplayed another difference in the sexes may be this that girls hair is more foft and long boys more curl ’ and short children of or more vears old ought feldom to be reprefented with clofe mouths their upper eye-lids are generally hid under their fwelling brows they have commonly quick look voung damfels have vigilant and lively look raifed forehead nofe little hollowed small but almoft half open mouth round ps and small chin in which as in the cheeks is small dimple tney have no under chin virgins we lee feldom open -mouth ’ their eyes are more fedate and compoted than the others old of ordonnance or composition chap women ought to have more fet and heavy look and hollow eyes their upper eye-lids large and loofe yet little open the un- der lids vifibly fwelling noftrils fomewhat contracted mouth clofe and fallen in and when they are very old and without teeth their under lip comes over the upper they allo have rifings under the cheeks on each side of the mouth long but little crooked nofe fuits them but in men more crooked one is proper people in uchority become grave look forchead fomewhat raifed and large heavy eyelids and thofe half open their aspect fettled and calm their faces turned little fideways the nofe alike with the forehead and eyes mouth thur and double chin it is necellary to take particular notice of the different make and form of persons to far as they are defcribed in hiffory in order to exprets the better the nature of the matter as alexander and he- phestion in the tent of darins wherein hephetion ought to be taller than alexander in saul and david the former tall and the latter less and ruddy and thus of any other circumftance of hiftory we should here have brought in some examples of phyfiognomy but as there is lately publifhed on that subject fine treatife written by mr. le brun and trantlated by de kaarfgieter we think it not necellary to fay any thing about it but refer to the book fince its of service not only to painters statuaries and engravers but allo to po- ets hifforians and others in the obfervations about taking and bolding any thing have taken notice that infants are very fickle and harmlets in it and becaute their members are very feeble and commonly ply any way they all as if half lame their hands are always fquab and therefore moll open toung girls are wanton in their taking and holding as in the man- rer of goltzius virgins and payed women are modelt and mannerly in their taking and holding as have shewed before but aged people have fiff and dry hands for which reafon they are moft times thut and they can not extend their fingers altho ’ different accidents caule an alteration in the face and polture thole alterations are neverthelels very unlife each other therefore each ought to be handled in diftint manner chieffy when any par- ticular passion moves us to this or that action whereby the features and lincaments of the face are deubled by the faid unlikeness suppotes of ordennance or composition book ii for inflance that all faces were call in one mould and euch governed by particular passion as sorrew gladnels hatred envy anger madnels coc hence its certain that they will be very unlike and different as well as the actions of the body and if now you give each particular make and lincament this will ang- ment their difference this obferration is of great ule to face and hiffory-painters and the contrary as ufeful when nature and circumflances induce us to make fue or three to be like each other in one compofition name- company of figures all of one family who therefore may well take after one person in likeness as the sons of tacob the ho rotis and caracis for thus we evince the truth of the story again in handling the fuble where the daughters of gecreps open the basket in which was ericbtonins here we are obliged to make their fares alife to thew that they are sifters for otherwife who would know them to be fo tho reprefented alike beautiful and it would be asked how the affinity appears feeing tis not enough to tay they are sifters or that pallas is tupiter daughter or the long bearded esculagins the son of young apello but if you give thele three sifters one and the same aspect yer to each diffintt passion they will then differ very much for inftance let the youngeft who opens the basket with surprize flart back as if the were laying good god what is this the fecond full of fear runs away calling out dear siffer face me from this monfter and the third being elder and more ftayed fepring back with amazement fays what this is monfer thus proceed three different motions from one aspect of likeness for tho the retemblance is fomewhat alcered yet the same proportions and features hill remain the cafe is the same between parents and their children for in france if the father have crooked nofe or that of cafar the child will in some degree have nofe fomewhat longith and rifing has the mother long and rreight nofe the daughter will have the fame except that in tender vouth tis lets or more bending as in old age tis thicker and broader but little different in length as expe fience thews we fee in the twelve heads of the roman emperore their natures and inclinations well expreffed and agreeable to the hiffories of their lives yet doubt whether they all agree with the true aspects of thote emperors or whether the cotemporary mafters who were well-skill ’ in phyfiognomy have not thus alcered them according to their char of ordennence or composition natures father to reprefent their innate faculties than their outward appearances it is admirable to contider how our senfes are furprized when all the particular aspects are well oblerved according to the passions which they reprefent methinks we thereby difcover mens inmoft secrets that this perfon fings an high tune that low one that one bellows with pain another inwardly laughing the teeth of one chatter with cold another parched with heat and thirf thus fmall line can let you into whole countenance less or more fatness alto much al ter face but for the artiffs benefit think proper to thew him way of finding out all sorts of aspects after certain and ealy manner ler him take looking-glats and draw himself by it in fuch paston as he defires as joyful forrowful painful piceful cec and imagining himself to be the figure be wants to reprefent draw this nicely with red or other chalk on drawing-paper obferving nicely the knitting of the brows look of the eyes swell of the cheeks contraction of the noftrils clofenets or openness of the mouth jurt of the upper of under law -bone according to his pofition whether rreight or bending then let him take plaifter-face and make mould from it of lead or other hard matter in order to make af- terwards as many impreffions of clay as he pleafes thefe let him al- ter to the before mentioned drawing either with his fingers or mo- delling sticks as he thinks proper taking away fomething here and adding fomething there but full preferving the general likeness thus they will ferve inftead of the life chiefly when the face on which the mould was made comes to be like the drawing that by the alterations the rtift can allo fee how much the features likewife alter.. thus all sorts of paffions may be moulded with little trouble and the moulds ufed in as many different manners as he pleafes whether they are to be viewed from below or above or in profile he who is provided with store of such models will find great helfe from them fince we can not be furnished with them from the life it- felf nor from our own perfons otherwife than in lingle and fronting in lookingglats.. as for knowing how to make them few days and little inftraction will teach us as much as is neceffa- hy if we can draw well.. if to thefe the arriff add mould for ar khild and womas the sett will be the more compleac fra of ordonnance or composition ii ere we conclude this chapter is neceltary to fay fomething of the disposstion of both sexes in sketch of capital ordonnance as in concourfe of all sorts of people at an offering play coc where we fee that thofe of sex get together and vouth to touth age to age men to men and women to women bur voung women our of curiofity are observed to crowd under the peopie and tho notwichllanding they join themfelves to their sex yet they are afraid of mithap and therefore for protections lake

cildren of zor tears old run into crowds without mother brother or elder sifter to guard and hold them by their hlands in places of publick pleadings firm and high places should always be affigned to women as againtl stone-work walls and the like becaule their bafhrfulness makes them timorous and their repurations ought to make them cover rather old mens than young mens com pany to guard them from

chapter shall infiff on an obfervation which in my judgment is worth the artiffs notice as being for his advantage as well as his diverfion it is in affigning the reafon why many make to little progress in their studies now imagine it to proceed from their inconflancy and inkewarm affection which tie up their hands unless neceffity drive them to work they often fay — was to lucky as to do it or —it fell out better than expected — as if the buliness depended on fate not on marhematicks but its quite otherwife with thofe who puth on with zeal and good will and confider ear pelily of

furchered in the art by it and cor fider if they were to do the fame again what lteration and im- provement they could make in it fince its certain that tho we ir prove by practice yet by shorter ways we can artain perfect know- ledge and in lets time too our own faultsmake alfo deeperimpref fion on us when dilcovered by ourfelves than if obferved by others be caule we naturaily hate reproof

vears ago had mind to paint in little the story of stra tenica paying antiechus vifit took abundance of pains in it and it was extremely liked some vears after an opportunity offered of my doing the same thing again but fix times larger did not think it proper to govern mytelf by my former thoughts tho much approy- ed but diigently confulted the beft writers on the subject rejelting the trivial ones and then proceeded as carefully to finith my work which got me more reputation than the former becaule executed with more simplicity and less pempous circumfances it reprefenting only king selencbus stratenice antrecbus and the phyfician whereas in the other had introduced train of courtiers about them and in fine every thing could think of to make it look pompous and gaudy thus out of fingle flower we may by care and induflry produce one as was the cale of another picture of scipie and the young bride which is in the apartment of the states of holland at the rague this picture was of my firft thoughts but handling the same subject second time this latter as better compoled got the preference tho done but years after the other which fubmit to any one judgment who compares them

asked why introduce capid who in nasos description is not mentioned and give this reafon that he being the eldeft of the gods and according to hefsod brought forth of chaes and the earth by him

perfons as the elements againt each other virtues againft vices and to forth lis therefore of the greateff confequence for painter staruary poet or orator to know thefe things thoroughly and keep them in memory which praltice will make eaty remember that when was under my father inftructions and rudying delign my gulto was for emblems which collected from his and other mafters works and then made intire compofitions of them which tho triffing becaute of my vouth and inexperience yet furprized many who advifed my father to let me purfue that kind of study but whether he thought me too young or that ra- ther inclined to hiftory he diverred me from it as much as poffible especially fince it drew other mafters disciples to fee my odd producti- ons which he much difliked but when my eldeft brother brought me out of iraly cafur ripr ’ book aforefaid which hitherto we were strangers to or elfe was locked up as secret then my flame for emblematic learning broke out again by the help of this book produced many and rrange deligns which for their singularity were accounted as prodigies of dreams by fome out of spite againtt me others thro ignorance however my proficiency was fuch that it jielded me an annual profit becaute the tefuits scholars yearly be- ipoke of ordonnance or compositian book ii of me the embellithing of above of their potfions or theses with emblems hiffories or fables in watercolours. `` judge now whether thefe my studies tended not tomy advantage and improve- ment and whar honour was thewed me in preferring me to the imploy before my cotemporaries and fellow-ditciples and what lictle skill they mut have in heroglyphrical learning tho doubilets then made many miltakes let us return to our subject and illuftrate bur leaving digreffians it in the story of didgs death which we shall handle two different aatural embaratical in the firit manner we reprefent the queen in defpair and pal hopes on pile of wood and after sacrifice ftabbing hertelf when iris cuts off the fatal hair her sifter attends the solemnity in tears anl lamentacion all is in confution and every one affected thus far virgil with sorrow in greater or less degree in the lecond mlanner we thew how defpair accompanied by rage is drasging love to the grave with this inscription —didg death and to deligned for the fronciffiece of monfieur pets tragedy on that subject now irs eaty to fee why in the former manner neither rage despair nor love attend the princets and in the later why neither princels by-handers alcar nor pile of wood are introduced fince in the firtt manner no aid is wanting becaute each figure fufficient ly acts its own part and thews every thing which its paffion natural ly leads it to wherefore it would be redundant nay obfcure the story to double all the feveral motions with the fame paffions and senfes by thefe figures whence it is that they can have no place but where the subject is purely emblematic and emblematic figures the principil characters as in the fecond mianner they muft come into play becaute each figure then expreffes its natural quality in order to clear and illuftrace the sente of the storr without the addi tion of any body elfe in this manner apelles contrived his piece on his being accuted by antiftilas wherein he reprefents innocence purfued by rage vice lies and slander and dragg ’ by them before an ignorant judge thus many things are couched under fingle allegory but when ny pirticuler perfon man or woman and their charalters shapes countenances cr are burlefqued in this manner then fuch delign may be called pasquil chap ii of ordennance or composition is without difpute that every man has but one predeminant past on at time which moves and governs him wherefore prudent generous and valiant man when he is doing prudent alt may be accompanied by generofity and valour but not with prudence becaute that quality appears in his act again if in an attack he perform valorous action such mult appear in his perfon and prudence and generofity only must accompany him if he thew his generolity as in re- roring captives without rantom prudence and valour are sufficient to attend him without the addition of generesity the cafe of famous mafter is the same for he being pofieffed of feveral good qualities as judgment affiduity quick conceptions coc if he be reprefents ed employed at his eafel these characters may all illuttrace him ex= cept assduity which thews itfelf by his motion and pofture if phir lolopher do foolith thing all other good qualities should ornament him except folly becaute he is committing it such obfervations as thefe are worthy of notice and without them an emblens can not be good this part of the rt is very lable to cen- hire but yet few underfland it becaufe the falts being always couch- ed under uncommon appearances are secrets to the vulgar with- out explanation nevertheless they should be to handled that people of judgment at lealt may know their meanings and the arrift not be re- proved remember to have feen piture of bocchus and ariadne wherein obferved miltake in placing sorrow and defpair about the princels the latter was feen flying from her which in my opinion was right and proper in the mafter but our difpute was whether the figure of sorrow had any bufiness there he juftified it by very plautible rea- ons laying that altho by the prefence of the compaffionate god her sorrow was at an end yet it abaced nor luddenly becaute the was to give him relation of her difaffer and then to wait for favourable anfwer and to long sorrow mult be with her have lays he reprefented her with forrowful look and tears in her eyes pointing towards the sea at the perfidious thesens the occation of her sorrow baccbas is attentive whofe upper garment is opened by cupid and becaute frisdne knew not whom the had with her man or god love difcovered his godhead and made her fentible of his power this piece was in my judgment fine yer think sorrow should have been left out of the compofition becaute according to our poli tion no pasfion can aft in two places at ence for tho the princelss no ordonnance or composition book ii fufficieatly thewed it yet as being overcome it is taking its flight have feen more fuch mistakes but tis no wonder for we are not born wife in the ufe of hieroglyphic figures for expresing the passions con- fider in an especial manner whether thofe paffions work internalty or externally mean whether the action and metion of the body alfo shew fofficiently irs predeminant passion for good natured fedate man needs no auxiliary action to thew he is fuch becaute his countenance does it effectually but when we defire to make known love and sorrow which are internal affections of the soul thefe mult be exprefted by means of hieroglyphic figures and yet if the body be difturbed and moved by thole paffions the afting passion may be clearly perceived without the help of hieroglyphies notwichftanding the necefficy of this knowledge in all who have any relation to painting yet many young statuaries imagine that being generally concerned in carving fingle figures only it does not affect them but they mistake for suppofe they should be required to fet off figure with emblems whether on pedefisl or in niche in bats or whole relief in order to blazon the qualities and virtues of the perfon it reprefents they would be at sland and the rather as we fee painters exhibir moft of their emblematic figures in stone-work in order to make an hiffory clear now the statuary not able to truff to his own sirength relies on the painters aid to defign him fuch and tuch thoughts to which he fets his model and to proceeds to work chap xil of the order or succesfion of the motians proceeding from the passions er having fuffxiently fpoken how figure ought by irs form to express the palfions we are led to fay fomewhat touching the order or succeffion of it aftion for tho in sw ry the one oftenrimes proceed from the others and revert and fal back again yet especial care mult be taken that they be not expresed and skean all at the same inflant of time but that each wait for it pro per turn and serfon as if gentleman should order his servant beat any one three motions arife from hence which can not be per formed at once becaute the order mult precede the hearing and per forman of ordonnance or composition chap i be the confequence again yis prepofterous that prince should fland in commanding potture at the same time as his sate vants are executing his commands it would be as unnatural to frame the story of the woman catch ’ in adultery in this manner cbriff is writing in the dull while the people are fneaking away difcontent- ed and athamed and which is fill worfe some provided with baskets of stones either waiting on the fecond ground for the iffue or departing out of the temple tho our saviour had not finished his writing by which thole paltions were to be raifed the incom- parable pouffin poffefted this condult in an high degree as may be feen in his picture of this story when general is spiriting his army each soldier obferves silence and attention while the ha- rangue

drawn sword the table is overturned and the drinking velfels difh- es and other table furniture lie broken to pieces about the floor and the wine fpilt at their feet and yet made the women keep their randing holding the head to re-confider this story tis natural to think that in the reginaing the tyrant fat quietly ar the table ig- norant of what was doing afterwards the women entered the room thewing him the childs head cut off accended with speeches proper to the occation which put him firft our of countenance and then piercing his heart he furioully arofe from table and overturned it and drawing his sword in order to purfue them he puthed down every thing in his way notwithllanding all which rage and difturbance the women remain in the fame pofture and station as when they came in vou may ealily perceive my overight and improper handling this story tis true indeed that all the different motions were fudden and quickly fucceffive yet the kept the head too long in her hand to throw it on the table after it was overturned in all likelihood at the end of her speech the mult have thrown down the head and taken to flight as foon as tereus made the leaft offer for rifing and then

virtuous and decent manner to as at once to delight and infruct thus the art gains its lufire the abase appears in treating oblcene and vicious subjects which ditquiet the mind and put modefty to the

have doy ble ufes and which have fingle suppote four kinds viz hifforical peetic moral and hieregl ghre the firft is fimple and true fall the second double ficti off is of ordonnance or composition exhibicing fabulous stories or mixture of deities and mortals the third has threefold moral teaching our duty to god our neigh- bour and ourfelves and the laft is fourfold as couching under thort and myfterious senfe the three before going handling virtue and vice for the benefit of soul and body and thewing the happinels and immortality of the one and the corruption of the other in hiffory the poet or painter ought intirely to confine himself to tratb without addition or abatement his ornaments tho borrow ed from poety mult be fo reftrained that nothing ferving for ii- inttration create improbability for inflance not to reprefent day- break by the poetic figure of aurera or the night by dians or the sea by neprane which is needlefs and an error becaute thofe things can be naturally expreffed by colours as day-break by its appearance of vellow red and blue or by the sunrays appearing on the horizon the night by irs darkness and by the moon and stars the sea by its waves and billows rocks montters and shells on the shore allo the nile by it crocodiles coc or any thing proper to the sea or rivers the poetic tables differ from the hifforical in this that inflead of true story they confider fictions only intermixing deities with mor- tals as we have faid and thereby fignifying nothing elfe but the courfe of the wolld hme the four elements as air earth fire and water and tho hifforically handled yet each is fimple figure hav- ing myftic meaning either in name or shope and often in both scylla atlas ledu cyclops and many others and thus the fable being both philofophic and moral in one and the iame manner pre- fcribes virtue and decries vice as we gather from ovid virgil and thers it is necelfary therefore in deligning fuch an ordonnance to keep intirely to the fable as before is laid without any addirion of hicroglyphic figures as temperance prudence nger jealouty coo which are fo improper here as hereafter shall be thewn that they deftroy the very incent of it for there are others which tho in dit- ferent manner willexpretsthe fame paffions as cupid inflead of love pallas inflead of wifdem and many others as we collect from the poets the moral

further than kiffing and that endymion begot go daughters on the moon others affirm that the yielded to his pleafure on condition he made her prefent of some white sheep tho all be fabulous yet it carries some probabi- lity for pausumas concludes that endymion was the firft who obferv- ed the phafes and courfe of the moon pliny alfo reflifies that endy mion firft obferved the motions of the moon and learned her narure and qualities which gave rife to the fable that the fell in love with him alexander apbrodifius likewile writes in his emblems that endysion had great skill in aftronomy and becaute he flept by day to fit himself for night obfervations it was teigned that he had carnal knowledge of her and alfo wenderful dream by which being philolopher he got that knowledge others fay that he was poor shepherd as seneca in his tragedy of huppolifus tho king' son and that he dwelt on mountains and in colitary places the better to observe the moon motions the learned gattrucharthus has it — the fable fays he reffifies that diang fell in love with the no ordonnance or composition book ii shepherd endymion who for too great familiarity with june was by tapiter condemned to eternal sleep but the hid him in mount in order to fereen him from her conforts wrath the truch is that endymion obferved nicely the moon motions and therefore uted to pats whole nights in colitary places in the contemplation of her which circumftance gave rife to the fable let this fuffice for the story the parts and ordonnances whereof follow tible or ordennance of diana and endymion ethlius endimion son of king of elis beautiful and well-haped vouth is lying afleep on his upper garment on near mount on the right side of the picture under his arm is tacob ’ staff crook near him and at his feet large celeflial sphere and some books and papers whereon appear charalters and diagrams he is in profile his upper parts fomewhar raifed and he leans with his left ear little forward on his left hand his right leg is extended and the left lifi ed up he is all in the shade of the trees except his right leg and half that thigh and receives frong reffexions from the woon di one little off not in her hunting habic or fitting by him and kiffing him with the half moon on her hlead as ufually reprefented naked defcends from the clouds with full moon behind her as big as herfelf and furrounded with stars with the attendance of love or capid the is in fronting poficion bending litde forward with her left knee on low cloud her arms wide open as if about to embrace the vouth and in her lefr hand is siprum her aspect is beautiful and gay and full of defire being lighted by sun-fet as well as cugid who is defcending with her on her right side with his face towards her and holding in his right hand behind him his bow downwards and in his left which comes forwards an arrow with which he points at the feeping vouth he ffies fomewhat oblique with his upper parts from her with his legs feen hindward thro' the cloud boy flanding on endymion right side looks to the leff ar the goddess his left elbow drawn back and finger on his mouth and with his right hand lifeing

reprefented in the hand of as we fee in mc dals and other antignicies of ordennance or composition chap which is fomewhat forethortened below this child on the left side where the mount declines fit two other children joining and blowing their torches and behind them appears the offskip being valley with low horizon the sphere books and papers lying to the left at endymions feet are with fmall part of the mount which comes forwards in the light the vouth garment of which part covers his privities is purple that of the goddets sky-colour the sun is low proceeding from the right explanation of the fable by endymion we may underfland virtuous mind which the hea- venly spirits endeavour to carels and kils through violence of af- fection the high mount implies that when the soul afcends to heaven the body is feized with heavy sleep or death for fince the body hin- ders perfect union with god it follows that as foon as the soul has dilengaged itfelf it goes eafily and quierly to heaven diand by her increale and decreafe reprefents the changeablenets of things for the greek poets afferted that tupiter feeing diana go naked and indecently for virgin charged mercury to make her garment and that tho he made her feveral yet none would fit becaute her shape was always changing wherefore her figure is natural emblem of increafe and decreafe and of the mutabilicy of worldly things this figure has alfo other neceffary ufes with respect to human life as st. ambrose intimates who from the example of the moon whole light is variable always increafing or decreating reaches that nothing in the world is ftable but all things subject to decay the siffrum in diana hand the ufe of which lies in the motion allo denotes the vicifficude of worldly things and their continual destruction and renovation others think that the siffrum fignifies the sound which the moon caufes in the courfe of the heavens in fuch manner as this should all hiffories fables and fictions be examined if the artifl aim at reputation think have given the curious satisfaction enough in two examples for should go further the subject would not only be trefome but fwell as big as the whole work wherefore for variety we shall pass to chap n ordennance or composition book ii xvil rules for the management of small figures in lirge compass and the contrary he es great difference between the ingenuity of good painter and that of mere deligner with reiped to or- donnance the former proceeds by the eftablished rules of art the latter only aims at what is defigner like the one is mafter of principles and rules the other is ignorant of both the deligner con- fidersonly what relates to relief being stranger to the natures and effects of stutts colours and tints and therefore he mult find all things by means of lights and shades only but painter has more liberry and advantage becaufe he can belides the shades effeet eve thing by his colours and tints but the difference is further vi ble from the sets of prints daily publithed whether in lapdskip perfpeltive views architelture or anrent or modern story in all which the deligner generally travels the old road of compoli- ions and the ercher or engraver as clofely follows him but when good painter handles them all the parts will be improved and be come more excellent as well the invention difpofition and harmony as even the motions by which means perfon of fmall abilities can not but be better pleafed and often for the fake of one or two fine prints buy whole set as in ouduens book of the romin night in which one plate engrav ’ by abrabam bloteling does by it nearnets and elegance eclipfe all the reft and this is the more remarkable becaute in his medals the figures are shaded not with hatching but with thick stroke and touch on the hady side now agreeable to the tirle of the chapter we thall pass to the necellary management of an ordonnance with large figures in fmall compals it mult be granted that an ordonnance in large extent requires more circumitances than fmaller altho ’ in either the chief marcer lie ber in three or four fgures for what in the former comes clofe and filling mut in the larter be ppread in order to till up large space and to do this artfully we are obliged to introduce other by-works and thote tho inlignilicant yet probable and not repug nant to the subject tending to explain the story for inftance in landship to introduce fome buildings fountains pyramids of sta tves of in an hall or other large apartment hangings alcoves bals of ordennance or composition and fuch like either for ornament of to make larger crouping in thort any thing that will entertain the eye fince jmoll figures in large compass are not of themselves cupable of doing it wherefore with respect to fuch the by-ornaments ought to be large in order to create broad lights yet thefe ornaments mult not be to mondrous as some have them who in order to rell the compofiti on make pillars bigger than three of the figures can fathom with caftle-like capitals and frizal figures almoft in full proportion nor to out of the way as thofe where in landskip are feen trees or feet high termes mere coloffules and pyramids higher than any in the world to which add houfes in the offskip where be- fore people can poftibly approach them they muft be loft by diflance but this is egregious condult for we should always bring together tuch parts or objects as neither leffen the figures or cause any obfiructi- on in the composition meas that large compats mult either look large or elle be filled and adorned in moderate manner as we shall thew in two sketches of the mourning vous plate xvill each repre fented in different mianner to demonfirate that in large compass great mass of light is absolutely neceffury the story is venus incon- foleable for the deach of her dear adonis even the aid of cupid fails whole bow rrews and extinguished torch nay her beloved garland of rofes the tramples under foot murs tho fetretly-pleaf- ed at the adventure however pretends to tympathize with her im her sorrew but in wain for the flighis his offers and puthes him frown her the refts on the tomb of her lover wherein erther his body is depoficed or according to the curlom of the country his athes are kept in the trn the other by-work is grove of cypress and myr les from the urn might prosced sprig of the flower which is ad to him fince it owes its origin to his blood on dae compariton of the plates we miy difcover the difference between the two compofitions in the uppermoft the mass of light is neither to large or pread as in the undermoft which proves that in great and clofe oxdonnance in lmall compats as the upper fixt great riats of light is not neceffary much lets by-works infordey to encreafe it becaute the figures there principally govern and her ing large have on that occalion the greateft forez as well in the execution as beauty and colouring the by-works ferving to thew the place and occafion but not to draw the eye whence is cafy to fee that whaticreates decorum and elegance in the one appears infignifi- cant and difagreeable in the other speak of the ligtt ont which requirs of ordennance or composition book ii diiint management in both wherefore fince in large compats the br-ornaments make the greateff part they muft con sequently caule greater maffes of light there and contrarily in imall compats where the by-works are leaft the main light ought to take the figures only and to confirm this mult fay that what in the undermoll repretentation pleafes the eye and fets off the com- polition even were it as large again is only cauted by the light be caute the by-works being the moll abace the light of the figures wnich having in the upper with the dark tomb more force muff create fuch confution as to weaken the strength of the prin- cipal figures in word the larger the figures the more shade ouget to be about them and of consequence the smaller the figures the thor ligrt ch ap kviil of the ordennance of hifferies pourtraits still- lifc xc in small compass re we end this book or leave this subject tis proper to con- ii fider further whether it be not more artful to reprelent story natural and clofe in fnall compats than larger which think to prove from the examples of raphael caracci dominichine pouf pa le brun and other excellent mafters moreover daily experience confirms it les cerrainly troublesome to be confined to fmall com- pats especially to thofe who affelt to load their compoficions becaute largenets is very entertaining to the thoughts the difference between both managements is the fame as painting as big as the life and in lirtle where we fee that in the former lies the moft art fince we can more eaily go from the large to the fmall than contrary tho both be done from the life the cafe of thefe two arcifts is like that of skilful steerfman who capable of wreftling with storms and dan- gers fails unconcernedly in imooth rivers when meer ferry-man would be pur to his shifts to fteer on the occan he then is happiell who has been always uted to large things fince the small spring from them like an inlend river which lofes its strength the further it goes from its spring of which the old mafters were not infentible who tho much employ ’ in small painting yer lay in for large work be ing confcious that what required the moff trouble and skill got them the greater name and profit the of ordennance or composition chap force of large painting beyond small one and its advan- tages are thele the natural reprefentation has better effect for viewing it near it raifes love pity anger or any other paftion as if we lym- pathized with the story it raifes the mafter fame laftly the work is much effcemed itwere needlets to mention other advantages wherefore ishall confirm my opinion by examples we read of picture of stratenica that the sailors in storm took it for deity and accordingly worlhipp ’ it and that in june temple her flanding figure was to artfully painted that her eyes feemed to look every way and at any be- holder wherever he placed himfelf appearing fevere to the criminal and gentle to the innocent the reaton of which effelts is that the two pictures were fo highly finished and had fo natural an human shape that they feemed to be rather fleth and blood and to have motion than to be paintings this thews what inffuence large reprefentations have on the senfes let us now fee what paffions currofty raifes as in this example fup- pose murther ’ corps lying fomewhere near it perfon weeping little further the seizure of the murtherer and the people running some towards him others towards the body now it may be asked whether all thefe circumftances do not fufficiently thew the fact without other perfons or greater paffions to which antwer nega tively for we ought to fee whether the wounded perfon be dead or not and in what part wounded next whether know the affaffin whether the woman lamenting him be of quality or ordinary and whether the be related to the wounded perion accordingly coming nearer think know him am affrighted behold the wound which appears ghaftly to me

in fimple accident what force mult the life have when feen near in fuch reprefentation especial- ly if naturally expreft but we need not wonder that fo few tread in that old path fince they feck eale and want the ambition to excel by an exact inquiry into nature ionce of ordonnance or composstion ii ionce thought got reputation by painting in little but was af terwards convinced that large work or

story make an orderly divifion of his materials ere he begin to write dispoting firft the general heads and then the particular ones afterwards the incidents and which of them are principal and how many and which of them happened without and which within doors moreover contidering whether the story throughout is to be handled in all iis circumftanses in certain number of parts or in some principalones only as whether he will contract hemer books into virgifs into or orids into or at pleafure to judicious painter in handling magnificent hiffory should make him- felf mafter of the true

shall further illuftrate in the chapter of fellowing or matching of pieces in reprefenting an hiftory the rcift is not always confined to the laws of written story good hifforiographer is obliged to go thro' with all the particular facts from the beginning to the end in fuc- ceffive order painter contrarily has greater liberty of choice fince tis indifferent to him whether he falls upon the beginning mid dle or end of story and therefore fomcrimes begins where he pleafes picking out of the story what beft fuits his intention either what went before now is in action or muft be in

story and in the fifth the caraftrophe or conclution either in sorrow or joy but the drama differs from painting in this that the one con- tains in each alt particular time place or action and the

phyfiognomy perspective geometry architecture anatomy proportion colours harmony reffexions and every thing that occurs in the chapters treating of those particu lars which we shall not here repear of ordennance or composition now remains only to be obferved firfl that there are two sorts of piltures natural and unnatural secondly what good hiffories are in order to thew their continuance in one painting the natural pictures are thofe in which we exhibit the nature of story or acci- dent by fingle paftion by fingle reprefentation of the perfon on whom the strets lies the unnatural are thofe wherein the fame per- fon is reprefented more than once and thereby two accidents mixed together which happened at different times as the one by day and the other by night which is contrary to nature and wherein is often uled more than one point of sight secondly the moft pertinent and intelligible hiftories are fuch as that of heliodorys defcribed in the maccabees when he was punifhed by the angel to which add the high-prieft profirate before the alcar intreating the almighty and further the widows and orphans lamenting and crying all this thews the continuance of the hiffory and may be brought into one piece another may be that of pompey where he is burning all the letters and papers of perpenne in his sight and then ordered him to be carried to his punishment and many others chap xx of the obfervables in frontispiece plate we have treated of many particulars and their requi- fites it will be proper here to fubjoin the difposition of objects in frontifpiece-plate and their obfervables as being of diffe- rent nature from other ordonnances and tending in all respects to embellifh the book only like fine garden-walk where the ob- jells whether vafes statues trees coc are placed to anfwer their purpofes the figure which denotes the subject of the book ought by all means as the principal to appear in the middle of the plate fet off by other by-ornaments over head or beneath mult be large table or flat face with the book ticle thereon either in thick black let- ters or elfe double-lind ones and the other figures which ferve for illuftration placed of equal height on each side either flanding or fitting thus much for the fore cround the offskip having litile concern in the matter we may difpofe where we think proper with low or rifing grounds in order thereby to give the uniformity of the subject greater luftre and painterlike decorum the principal vifle of ordennance or composition beok ii ought to be in the middle but if two are neceffary for the fake of hewing fomething in the offskip they muft be on each side and equally large and extenfive ber we mut take especial care that the title be encompaffed with arctrecrure or rockage or trees or at leaff remain within the fore ground which we ought to confider as thearrical stage opened on one or both sides with curtain fomerimes fetting it off with colonaded frontifpiece or elfe incloling it in moulding or compart- ent in which cafe there should always be founding fame either before or behind let the subject of the book be what it will even the fame alone with the title of the book will look more proper than the figre of the book without the fame looks well to interibe the title in the pendant of the trumpet wher is in the middle of the plare and in double-firok ’ letters but it it happen to be on side of the plate tis improper the ca pral biack lecter fuics the middle and bottom of the place however when the title muft be placed high the open letter is beft becaute the other would take the eve too much and weaken the reft of the york thus much in general itith refrest to particulars we mult obferve that the figure repre- fenting the book should alwars poffets the chief place in the middle of the plate and that to be elevared the figures of less contequence fomewhat lower and further in and thus with the others each go ing off according to its rank action and qualiry to the ofsskip and if other additional ornaments are neceffary they muft be contrived here and there in batsrelief but to explain myself shall give plate example and take for the subject book carrled ans militaria or treatife of military exercife bellons as the subject of the work fits exalted on an high and large pedeftal in the middle of the plate fet off with all kinds of warlike inftruments as ufual beneath her on one side flands perfon in an offentive pofture and on the other defentive perfon thefe three figures make the whole story the latter is reprefented as brave citizen with table in his left hand whereon is drawn the plan of forritication and under his right arm sheaf of wheat the former appears as vigorous young man with spike headed staff in one hand and spade in the other and at his feet crow or wall breaker on one side in the oftship is town -wall and on the other some armed men feering houfes on fire behind the former htands vigilancy and behind the latter subtilry now chap of ordonnance or composition we may oblerve that the aforefaid uniformity in the figures accompanying bellona and which help to explain the senfe is una- voidable for if one of the hieroglyphic figures next her were fitting and the other flanding it would caufe an abfurdity in the ordon- nance becaute thole two figures ought to thew an altiviry or at leaft to be in readinets to undertake some encerprize wherefore they as well as thofe behind them muft be flanding the latter being plac- ed there not as capital figures but to aid and subferve the two thers and therefore being rather ornamental than neceffary they may be left out as alfo may the offskip fince the subject fufficient ly appears without it neverthelels it may be retained when it does not obfcure the main delign but should rather chufe to contrive it in bassrelief in stone-work all frontifpiece-plates should have the three following qualities to delight the exc to fend to the praife and honour of the author and de figner to be advantageous to the seller thefe obfervacions tho little heeded yet are very necelfary fince all things have reference and tendency to fomething and tho by proper application we muft thew their qualiries as in the three in ftances aforelaid yer we have liberty to make further additions if not foreign to the main delign of the compolition fay then that if the capital figure be fet off by an area palace or other building that ornament mulf come on the right side of the plate next to the bind ing of the book and run off to the left as fcantily as the delign will permit it would be improper to repreient table pedettal and vafe or such like holf in the piece unlets the print have border broad enough to be suppoted to hide the other half or it were on third or further ground we allo remark that the light falling on the objects muft be suppoted to come from without the book that is it proceeds from the left side or opening of the book and thoots to the intide of it in order thereby to create between them mean the print and the book perfect union and sympathy like that of the soul and body fuppoling the book to be the body and the print the soul which moves it to which add in confirmation of my polition that the back of the book gives rife to the print and leaves the reafon why difpofe the objects thus whether light or heavy becaufe think the contrary very improper

skerching thofe nacions affording no other scene than cruelcies murthers tyrannies and tuch like dit- agreeable objects which would rather offend chan delight moreover that the oddnets of their dreffes mfannersand cultoms do not at all quidrate with the grace and beauty of the ncique iis certain that the principal bulinets of an hiftory-painter is to express the story with proper and livelr paffions that his incertion may appear plain and fa- risfaftory to the curious and yet ths would be no more than the reading it in the author if the grace of the figures were not alfo to accompanr it

greece but perhaps another difficulty may be ftarted againtt fuch land skips namely that they can not be handled to natural and true we can have the life before us which indeed is probable however it

canfe of the fublequent motions the blood wherein lies the warmsh of the body is by means of cold which is it oppo- iixe and enters from without thro the pores forced inwardly to that it paffes chieffy from the fmall members to wit fingers and toes to its center wherefore we fee that to keep off outward cold peo- ple fink their heads into their breafts raife their shoulders hug themfelves

egg harched and opened produ ees living creature not only semetbing but something good the former mere nothing or if it have name tis vanity and therefore rather bad than good painting was by the ancient remans to highly effeemed that none but noblemen durff learn it as we may allo gather from the paint ers feveral of whom have been of noble extraction and the reafon of it is very evident fince tis not only probable but reafohnable that such chap of things antique and modern ingenious spirits should have diflinguithing inclination for arts fuitable to their qualicy above the vulgar their meditations tions and perceptions were fixed on great and fublime things they inquired into and confulted many excellent authors of hiflory fa- bles and emblems as well facred as profane and the accounts of ancient medals from whence they have drawn pleatiful and ingeni= ous matter for their studies what excellent paintings have they not oblig ’ the world with how many temples palaces and other fare structures have they eariched with elegant devices inciring to vir- tue whereby they have bequeathed lafting name to pofterity did archicecture never enough to be praifed ffourith in their times but what alterations do we fee now how are the beauties and profitable ofes of painting either funk oblcured or flighted fince thet bambocciades are multiphed in these countries at prelent we can fcarce fee one virtue appear but ten nay an hundred vices will rife counter to it thus has lprung up fecond hydra like that of lerna to that we want valiant hercules to lop off thofe dragons heads which are always prouting thus architecture itself how excellent foever is with the right praltice of painting brought into diffrace and flighted by other nations fince we fcarce fee beautiful hall or fine apartment of any coll that is not fet out with pictures of beg= gars obfcenities genera-stall tobacco fmoakers fidlers nafty children ealing nature and other things more filchy who can en- tertain his friend or perfon of repute in an apartment lying thus in litter or where child is bawling or wiping clean we grant that thefe things are only reprefented in picture but is not the art of painting an lmitation of the life which can either please or teatbs if then we make fuch things like the life they mulf needs raife an averfion they are therefore too low and unbecoming subjects for ornament especially for people of fathion whole conceptions ought to furpats the vulgar we admit indeed that all this is rt or at leaft called fo when the life is thereby naturally expreft but how much the beautiful life skilfully handled differs from the defellive life of modern painters let the curious determine iis certain that men and beafts too have each particular and different inclinagion to particular things whereby they love whats agreeable to their na- tures the one good the other bad becaute as some pretend they are governed and influenced by certain conflellations happening at their births this at leaft we know that one man inclines to hupting and no count the followers of bambeccis celchrated pringer of mean subjetts of things antigus and midern book country-life another to war strife and contention another to merchandife and deceir this to politicks and great things that to pieatures cec so that in each we difcover what his nature and paffion i prone to but let us refielt on the two arts noble and ignoble or antique and ardern and fee how much they differ both in objects and execu tion the antique is unlimited that is it can handle fylery facred as well as profane fables and emblems both moral and piritual un der which three heads it comprehends all that ever was is and shall be the pr present and to come and that after an excellent manner which nover afters but remains always the same the modern contrari- is so far from being free that it is limited within certain narrow beands and is of small power for it may or can represent no more than whit is prejent and that too in manner which is always changing what is pal anl to come is without its power as alfe hiftories fables and emblems as well paetical and philesephic as moral hence we may judge what the modern art of painring is and why it can not be called noble much less have any harmony with the antigse could affign more caufes for this dilunion but shall at prefent omit them for two rea- fons firff becaute mens judgments are to various and each argues according to his paffions and inclinations in proportion as he likes or diffifes thing secondly which is the principal that may not be thought to raile any sufpicions of partiality or prepoffeffion but why should refirain my thoughts ler me peak plain in spire of others fay then that altho modern things feem to have some prettiness yet they are only to be efteemed as diversions of the art moreover mmaintain that fuch painters as never produce more than one choice of subjects may truely be ranked among tradefmen fince fuch re- prefentations can not be called an exercile of the mind but an han- dycraft trade by fuxh remarks as thefe we may fufficiently perceive that from apprebension knowledge and judgment pring ine luttre and elevaii on of the antique art of painting and contrarily that ignorance weg- hgence and self-will debale and fubjelt the modern so that the ancients have not improperly placed mlinervy by the one and midas by the other intimating by the former skill in the art prattice careful- ness and an beavenly talent and by the latter imprudence blind leal worldly deferts and hindrances but if any one would perhaps examine whether there be not mcars to make the modern noble as well as the antique that they might both march together they would find it to be labour in vain since things ntique and modern chap fince defects once got fooring are not ealily remedied but further we often hear with wonder that painters perfuade one another thaty in handling subject is enough to follow nacure tho the be defec tive as crooked lame quint ey ’ or blind and that when the is imis cated with delicate pencil that is fufficient and fuch is their zeal and extraordinary pains that one paints for that end the air of his wife tho ever to ugly with all her freckles and pimples very exactly whereby the agreeableness of beautiful womansface is quite loft an- other chules his clownith unmannerly maid-fervant for his model and makes her lady in saloon another will pix lords dress on school-boy or his own son tho continually froaking his hair be- hind his ears foratching his head or having down lookf thinking it fufficient to have followed nature without regard to grase which ought to be reprefented or having recourfe to fine plailler-facea which are to be had in abundance the beautiful and well -compoted airs in picture of many or few figures have great effet on the minds of the knowing of which the ancients were thoroughly fenlible for in the moft perfelt bodks they made the face chieffy to excel in beauty and agreeableness na one of judgment will deny that beautiful and well carriaged wo man has fuch an afcendant as moft effedually to move her beholdorg in two different manners and by two contrary paltions under misfor= tune or in raging pain the will pierce mans heart and move him to compaffion and when the entertains us on any joyful occafion with singing or laughing the will at once delight us clowniff woman contrarily will not produce any fuch liffects for her behold ers thro her unmannerlinels and fimple behaviour defpife her mirth and mock her ridiculous sorrow what great defeet do we not fill find in modern painters when they ufe or rather abufe the life not doing like thole who being accut tomed to pobter manner view the lite with knowledge and judg- ment that is not as it ordinarily appears but as it ought to be in its greateff perfection whereas the others blinded by cultom havg no tuch nicery becaute they imitate the life just as they fee it wiifiont any difference we even fee them make it more deformed than na- ture ever produces for the more mit fhapen faces bambeccie offace browwer melfer and many others made the more they were efteemd by ignorants by which fow choiges we can eafily judge that they were strangers to beaury and admifers of deformity however tis an infallible rule that daily cultom and converte with people like olir things antique and modern book iii ourfelves contribute mish to it thus deformity and vice are pre- ferred to vircue and what should be thunn ’ fought whereas he who is fentible of virrue will always endeavour to elcape error ch ap ii method for reprefenting what is city-like or elegant modern he continual changes in worldly things afford us pleatiful matter for modern manner without recourte to hiftory fables or emblems even to much as to be endless as may be gather of from the affemblies for publick worhip pleadings in courts plays family-occurrences and the like all which we perceive to be either majeftic amorous forrowful or otherwife tbose things how different soover can be represented in the antique manner as well as in the modera provided each keep its quality as have already intimat- ed and shall further infifl in the fublequent examples which can be handled in both manners alike natural and proper without either ber- rowing any thing from the other but the subjett this think worthy of remark and the rather fince to my knowledge no auchor treating of things antique and modern has faid any thing touching it fra afieris has not only curioutly followed his mafter gerard doy in the elegant modern manner but is in some things his superior and the rare pousin and raphael prince of the italian painters ex- sell ’ in the antique let us then follow their examples in what is moft agreeable to our guftos and tho the latter far exceed the for mer in nobleness iis however more commendable to be like good mieris in the modern manner than bad raphael in the antique tho remember to have feen picture of old afieris which as often as think of it furprifes me it was an halflength figure about the bigaets of the palm of the hand reprefenting the art of painting holding vizor in her hand its air headactire dress and furm ture to very beautiful and truly antique that never faw the like done by any other medern mafter how skilful foever whence it appears how rare it is for modern mafter to give into the antigse let us now reprefent the cale of parents permitting their children to take some diversions in barbing delign which can be as well ex- eratedin the antigue as the modern manner.. the bagnio comes for- ward chap things antique and modern in the piece having defcent into it of two steps the boys from to vears old about the water and in it are naked daughter of vears of age is feen with fine white linnen cloth over her body in order to cover what modefty conceals and as is cultomary on fuch occafions neverthelels her arms and part of her legs are bare the is coming up the steps on the left side one of the aforelaid boys holds her falt by flappet of the wet cloth in or- der to prevent her going up further behind near bed the eldeff daughter about vears old appears almoft unthified and near her maid-fervant to put the clotk about her the father we repre- fent dreft either in his cloaths or japan night-gown flandingon the brink of the bagaio and laughing at the boys who are in it and playing their tricks one of them is flanding with his left leg on the steps and with the other foor juft touches the water the joungeff boy lies on his belly excended on the lowermolt step plathing with his hands in the water the cloth of the daughter who is flepping out of the bagnio dropping wer flicks to clofe to her body that the naked nets of the members appear frantparently through it the mother all this while is buty in ferving fome sweet -meats on table covered with napkin near which child of orz years of age is fitting in chair in his shirt to whom the offers macaroon somewhat further are feen filk gowns petticoats velvet scarves hoods coc hangingon pins on table are lying pearl neck-laces bracelets and other irinkets in fine the whole difpolition is moft orderly natural and beautiful as for the boys cloaths to wit coats hats breech- es stockings shoes coc they lie on the brink of the bagnio now refer it to the judicious reader whether the daughter who on the lefe side is flepping out of the bagnio ought not not- withflanding her being covered with the cloth to be reprefenced beautiful and chapeable in her arms legs hands and feet nay ven her body alfo to faras the nakedne appears thro the wer cloth her modefty appears evidently by her bathful look what carriage thew the feet and whole body while the endeavours to cover the parts which modefty conceals and how modeftly does the flep up in read of expoting thofe parts by wanton gate iask further whe ther the boy who is slopping her by the flapper of the cloth ought to be less beautiful and well-made than the father in the flowered gown the boy the fame who lies extended on his belly in whom mult appear innocence and childifhness the eldelf daughter in her bloom well defcended and virtuoully educated to whom shall we liken of things antique and modern book iii her whence muft we ferch her beauty and whom must we ale for model vulgar perfon or one of better appearance even this latter would be infufficient for the purpofe if not well edu- cated and fine carriaged becaute beauty without grace looks mishapen and fiff this virgn then who is except in her feet quite naked ought principally to be painted as beautiful and agreeable as grecian jenus mean not wanton one but an heavenly one vir- tuons one for as much as the soul differs from the body and the bo- dy from the dress does nobility from commonalty virtue from de- feel if any one ask where he shall find thofe beauties refer him in the firft place to the books which treat of perfect proportion wherein true grace coniits whilft he is findious in thofe he ought to have the belt plaitter figures before him in order to exercife his underflanding and thereby acquire folid judgment if it be again objected that the plailler is not equal to living nature own it for mean not that the arriff should paint flefh-colour after them but get perfelt idea of their beauty grace and agreeableness boch general and particular whence perfection fprings for the colouring is evident and eafy enough to be found in the lite as could prove in leveral inflances of fome ordinary painters who coloured well who before they had made much prooress in the art were cried up for great men and ret having any thing extraordinary to do were not able to sketch well an head hand or foor the modern puinting can therefore not be accounted art when nu- tare is simply followed which is meer imperfect imitation or defec are aping her even were thing reprefented ever fonatural well defigned and properly ordered the condition manners and cultom of the country well obferved and the colouring moft exact yet the knowing will not think it artful but when narure is corretted and improved by judicious mafter and the aforefaid qualities joined to it the painting muft then be noble and perfect fay therefore with respect to the naked whether of man wo man or child that when tis not exhibited moft beautifully or in its due proportion the modern painting can not deferve the name of art and with good reafon fince this is the only method whereby to make rofe two alike sinters accord jan dis never enough to be commended gained excellence in the rigue as well as the modern manner by strictly following the afore- said three graces in both and he thereby acquired the epithet of match fekeserek the tbree grates chap of things antique and modern let us therefore follow his noble example in what made him to tamous fince he is the firft who carried the modern manner fo high as to gain it the name of art whence we may eafily conclude what great difference there mult be between painter who makes the modern or defeitive life his study and excellence and one who follows the antique or makes therough inquiry into every thing that' beautiful and perfelt the difference is even to great in every relpett that can not but wonder at it especially when confider how much greater the number of the former sort is and how they daily increafe twonder fay that now -days virtue is to little heeded virtue which took its rife from heaven is now as formerly the godly affrea did flown thither again and vice contrarily which fprung forch of erebys and black earth keeps its station but it can not be otherwife fince blind love alone rules and an antero is no more the reafon of to great difference can be attribured to nothing elfe but the different inclinations of painters to objects agreeing with their tempers they who content themfelves with following defective life will never produce any thing perfect or deferve the name of artful maf ters becaule not knowing or not caring to know what is beft they can- not to much as frive at it to which add another mischief they more capity judge of what is bad than good as shall explain myfelf in the following exampie yeing man as painter with pallet and pencils attended by zeal

painter attended by leal to it but to peak hill plainer we shall fubjoin third ordonnance we reprefent two roung men of equal age the one flanding on the ground before the figure of natare and the other on one side or behind him tomewhar raifed on stone or step by the former is placed tylax and by the lawer pallas the one figaitving defeft or farthy parts and the other the soul or perseltion let the figure of astare be enlightened by the sun and caufe triangular rays to proceed from thole young men eyes upon it the rays of the for- mer extend from the feet up to the middle and thofe of the latter take the while figare let us now judge when the sun reprefents know- fedge which of the two young men can fee and comprehend the mgt and is moff perfect he who views the figure but half-way of he who examines it up to the upper parts whence we may learn that the mind and judgment are beyond the hand and praffice which withourt therry are of no worth tis art to produce something which we bove not in sight but mere copying and aping to imitate what we have before us but let us go further and confider whether the foregoing exam- ple can not be applied to the cale of the lovers of the antique and mo- dern manner we suppofe then two lovers inflead of two painters and take the art of painting inlead of natare for the objett which they like the others view the one incirely the other but half way thus he who comprehends the figure throughout knows moft and has the beff knowledge and is confequently greater lover when the other is obferved as lover of low things and ignorant of the more noble of this latter sort we hnd the greateit number in our countries iis certain policion that some men tho hinder ’ in their vouth by an ordinary education from attaining fublime thoughts and great things of things antique and modern can alter in time by art and exercife even conquer their innate difpolitions and fir themfelves for noble and excellent things to that we need not wonder that demofthenes was not more eloquent than demades who tho he feemed as if nature had not beflowed on hrim either tongue or speech yet became fo eloquent that his fin- gular example thews theres nothing impoffible to art nay few de- fells which like demades diligence and labour can not overcome do we not read of heraclides that he became philofepher in pice of narure and education why does socrates not prone to virtue become virtuous wherefore we need not wonder that many great men have obtained great endowments tho naturally unfit for them and from hence we may infer that art and exercife are of more worth than the productions of nacure have not yet made mention of feveral men of mean extraction who tho they spent many vears with pleafure and affiduity in low imployments yet afterwards arrived to general surprize at the top of their art as is faid of polydere de caravaggie who in raphaels time having been an hod-man to his vear became afterwards great mafter the fame was the cafe of quintin marfys who hav- ing been to his vear smith gave into painting and much turpalfed his cotemporaries martin hemskirk country-man son andrea mantegna cow-herd and many others of mean birth allo went great lengths in the art was not among the ancient philolophers protagoras country- man son pythagoras an engravers ipbicrates general of the taylors the orator demades aforefaid sailors and the mantuan maro prince of the latin poets the son of potter even the muses themfelves were poor their nobility prung not from their birth but their science we could give many more loflances of this kind but not to feem redious shall proceed to ch ap iii the nature of city-like subjerts which daily aford plentiful matter for modern painter the genius of arcifts differs one leading to the fublime man £ ner another to the common even to the meanelt to we find no out- of things antique and modern rook iii ourfelves obliged to treat of all parrs of the art in order to be alike ufeful to every one we have already obferved that there are three sorts of people the courtly or high the citizen or commonalty and the mean of poor state the frft is fpoken of in the foregoing book of ordennance and the second shall now follow we suppofe that every arriftendeavours to excel in his choice of subjelt thar some feek fame and money others money and fame others money only at the same time we think it no less artful to reprefent felt than ferious matter countryman than courtier or an ass than an horfe fince either requires good skill to express it properly altho ’ theres great difference between citizens and courtiers yet the one as well as the other may excel alike in beauty and good nets tis grandeur alone that makes the diftinction between the city and court for luxury and pride are peculiar to the latter but mo- defty and temperance to the former having premited this it will be eaty to exhibit plainly the fur- ther circumftances as occafion shall call for them firft obferving that as the city-life is peculiar to us with its daily occurrences of af temblies paltimes family-affairs and other particulars mentioned in the preceding chapter to tis the more eafy for painter to make fuch subjects his practice especially one who inds himfelf infufficient for the grand tafle for whole sake we give the following schemes and firtt an example of intreating and refufing two virgins are feen at table drinking tea the youngell is in her within door dress and the other friend paying her vilt each has her cup and saucer that of the youngeff flands filled before her and the has the tea-pot in her hand in order to fill the cup of the other who having turned it down fets it on the table the is friendly intreated by the other to drink another dith as if the faid pray dear ifabell one diss more but servant entring the room to call her away the refuses it with her hand on the tea-pot to hin der filling feeming to tay — thank you beartily fill no more thefe two paffions caute two contrary motions in the whole body hands feet and face the mother who is letting in the servant with his hat under his arm holds the door half open and is thew- ing of things antique and modern chap him his miftrels the opening of the door difcovers sledge the ufual carriage of holland with which he is come to fetch her now in order to express more plainly this rifing from the tea-ta- ble we may place another virgin at it near nabel who looking to wards the door feems to rife and fet down her cup the man we may make approaching his miflrels with letter in his hand and the mother fanding at the door and looking little boy may allo properly fland at the table who ftealing bir of sugar out of the box is watching his sifter to fee whether the obferves it thus the matter may fland with respect to thefe two virgins have we mind to reprefent the fame occurrence by gentlemen we ought only to change the tea into wine the tea-pot into bottle the cups into glaffes the tea-equipage of ketele chafing-dith cec into ciftern according to the seafon and the mother into menial servant the apartment if in the summer-feafon to be in gar- den houle and in the winter chamber with an entertainment of collation such subjects as thefe are very commendable and may be nobly difpoted to the credit of an artift but he mult avoid bandling cot- tages brandy-shops ale houfes bawdy-houses corps-de-gard and the like we shall exhibit another example of daily occurrence whereby appear more passions in order to thew that they muft not be wanting in fuch reprefentations ex ampl ii of an accident which happened at painters house the arciff had one morning fine plaifter figure and two bults brought home and fecting them oue of the way on cheft of draw- ers and then paying the figure maker let him depart boy of vears of age litting near the drawers eating piece of bread and butter faw this who after he had eaten and his father left the room took chair in order to view them near and thinking them play-things muft needs take them down but either thro their weight or the tottering of the chair whereon he food he dropp ’ the figure on this noife the father apprehentive of what had hap pened came down into the room and beheld the misfortune with sorrow the boy affrighted looked about for corner to hide in and at laft run to his mother hanging about her neck and begging her s of things antigue and moderm book iii her to fave him she tho concerned for the damage yet defired the father to confider the childs innocence upon which and the intrea- ty of his daughter who had ruthed into the room on hearing the outery he was pacified ordering the maid-fervant to gather up the broken parts and to fling them away after which he cook the two batts in his arms and returned to his room alcho this accident be in irfelf of no great moment yet it will furnith marter enough for mode painter as well as the contrary to fill three cloths with being full of efficacious paffions elegance and variety and as rich in subject as if it were filtion ir cant be denied that this subjelt tho no hiffory is of an biffo- rical astare and requires as much pains as the handling some filti- ons out of homer or firgil we grant indeed that the nature of it gives us liberry of adding what ornaments or taking away what hea- vy by-works we pleafe lince we are mafters of our own inventions and can manage our thoughts as we think fit till we have brought them to our liking which is licence not allowable in other kinds of hictory neverthelets when we have mind to exhibit an acci dent like the preceding we mult confine curselves to all the particulars of ir tho no hiltory becaute by abaring or leaving out any of them would make no impreftion on us this example then tho only an incroduction to fuch sort of compofitions yet requires punctual imitation and we get in time richer in thofe inventions by daily oc- currences they mult even be pleafant to painters in the grand man- ner fince they recreace the mind require no reading and may in great numbers be met with at leifure times princes often difquife in mean habits for their diverfion and cirizens and the commonal ty in rich ones for the fame reafon becaufe any sort of variety tickles and each feeks his pleafure foreign to his ufual way of living but tis more eaty for citizen to play cirizen than any other part and for painter to keep to the management of what he daily meets with than any thingelfe fince the mind is like glats ball hung up in the middle of room which receives all the objects prefent and retains the impreftion of them thus rubens and van dyt by daily converting with the great at court were fixing their thoughts on what is fublime and lofty in the rt fardeans and rembrandt again on what is city-like and bambocrie and broswer on what is moft vul gar and mean thus each in his way according to his converfation with people like himfelf the of things antique and medern following accident is as remarkable as the former ordennance this compofition exhibits mother holding looking -glats before her child this woman fits upright with her back moftly againtt the light clofe to window which runs to the point of sight and is but half feen thro which window the receives her light lutle front- ing her drets is long dark blue upper garment and her under one having long sleeves is light gold

innocence of the child he grows angry at feeing himfelf in the glass imagining that child becaute his own dress is unknown to him is come to fright him and get his apple the chief delign of the ordonnance is to exprets exictly the proper pallims of each figure according to its narure and quality which not only effectually appear by the poftures but allo by the dreffes affigned them and their colours to wir in the child fnnocence in the maid folly in the mother moderation alcho ’ this compoition be no more fact than the former yet it affects our paftions as truth and becaufe the dreffes do not quite chime in with the mode it may if well painted and executed hang better near an astique hiftory or fable than one of company of gentlemen and ladies whoferich dreffes thine with gold and silver moreover the dreffes varying from the prefent mode the picture will maintain decorum which will not abace in thouland vears if the circumitances of the by-works be well obferved by incroducing timbrel inflead of marbles nickers or cockals and giving the maid dulting-bruth inflead of broom or mop and placing by the miftress an open book of frame of needle-work instead of spinning-wheel or pudding-pan we shall perceive the childith simplicity of the firtt the servicude of the second and the tutelage of command of the third the very carlying by the dead flowers on the cricket inti- mates childith play and fondnets to fcatter all things about the room if the arriff find no taffe in reprefenting things in the antique way and yet think the modern too mean fuch an one may very commend

examine what have hitherto said and thall fay on this head becaute he will then be enabled to judge whether ris impoffible for me as some imalicioutly report to make the difpolition of an ordonnance with the due actions of the figures and in their proper places and colours according to rule becaute of my want of sight for would thefe men themfelves but open their eyes they would quickly perceive that difpolition depends on politive and certain reafons firlt difpofe the apariment with the immoveable objects after thefe the figures and laftly the colourg whereby affign regularity shalls er of the moveable objefts at the fame time as laffert the por plscesof the window tables and clbiet now do not fay on which side of the table either right or left the lady is fitting becaufe tis needlels and the can not be difpoted otherwife than the is fince the looking-glats mult be placed againft the light confequently the ought to front the light that the may fee her- felt in the glass for how could the thew her breaft fronting when the face is to be in profile and were the to bring the lock of hair over her bofom with her right hand and to put the left on the table she would be without sway or good pofture and from head to foot in profile let us next confider whether the pbilesopher could be otherwife dif= posed than where he is on the left it can no ways be for two reafons becaute the globe is on that side very much in shade and therefore unfit for his conclations becaule he would then be partly in the light and shew almoff the fame polture as the lady where ver ought to be an oppofition again were he fanding before the table or clobe then we should nerther fee his motion nor his contemplation wherefore no place fuits him better or is more proper than where he rands by which this advantage alfo accrues that becaute he now receives more shade than light the lady thereby gets more beauty and decornm he can alfo more commodioutly view the globe and make his remarks by turning his body becaule ofe side is juft front- ing the light and the other contrary to it it may be the fame with the old weman next the clolet fince its im poffible that the and the reft of the figures can be otherwile dispoted with to much dvatttage and decorum no of things antique and moders book iii this defiga could alfo be well managed in pountraiture especially in fumily piece of man wife children and servant for we find daily occurrences enough agreeing with fuch reprefentation but to difcourfe clearly on this compoficion and to thew that its founded on good reafon we shall make some further remarks upon it ifaythen that it will bear divers increpretations tho as will appear below they may be brought intoone the lady at the table and the old woman at the clofer both fignify funity and yet it may poffibly be faid that the former may as well be taken for pride and the latter as slanding before the plate and with finiling countenance rubbing her hands naturally exprets coverousness the old man feen here as philolopher may confequently lignify philosephy but fay that this only teems to be fo becaute if the explanation take that turn it can not be compendious emblem but confuled medley of divers things from which no inference can be drawn therefore tis proper to explain our thoughts of this composition thoroughly even to the fmallelf objelts gradually coming forward from the greatell diffance the bullos and fountain in the offship as alfo the servant clean- ing the hand rail tend altogether to funity as the old man with the globe reprefents vain contemplation for who can penetrate the secrets of god and narure the senfe of the young lady and old woman we have explained before wherefore the true meaning of this subject is only to thew that all is funity which yet could not be ablolutely con- cluded from it were not the children there fince the other figures and objects might be divertly applied to wit to pride covetoulness philolophy oc and therefore the children who imploy themfelves in blowing bubbles are now the soul of the work and without them there would be neither cornexion nor conclution even each figure would have dittint signiication and each call for diffinet apart- ment and tho we were minded to exhibit different paffions into the fame picture yet fomething mutt be appropriated to each of them in order to thew irs meaning for picture is not in the fame cafe with froncispiece plate wheren is general reprefentation of the whole subject of the book vis the feven wonders the twelve months c aforefaid delign is alfo not much unlike true hiftory and might likewife ferve for moral or emblem foreach figure has its particularand proper charalter men incline to fudy women to ga- ther ricnes and goods daughters grow up in luxury and mif spend their chip of things antique and medern times young and innocent children buty themfelves in triffes to that on the whole the conclution muft be that each perfon in what he inclines to loves vunity if any one here object that affrenemy mathematicks and phileso- phy are not vanicies as being afcribed to wife men he mull know that wife men themfelves are by some accounted fools wherefore pythageras tho an heathen would not be ftiled wife but friend and lover of good discourfes and sciences knowledge often makes wife men prefumptuous and prevents their confidering with the phi lotopher that sciences are vanity thus we lee daily that the rich are haughty and difdainful the handfome proud and voluptuous tho' beauty and pleafures like morning-ffower decay with the evening and we may well fay with the poet that voluptuoufness is shadow and momentary delight and therefore peer creatures they are who covet shadows and tranfient happiness all which things occur almoft daily even in one and the same family as we have more largely intimated in the preceding chapter some perhaps may centure me for incroducing into the aforefaid ex- ample fuch trifle as pair of sandals which feem to belong to the old woman but fay they are not trifles but proper for luch women as make idols of their houfes and chule rather to go bare foot over their floors than bedaub them tho they have their maids always at their elbows with woollen cloths to clean after them but fince this satrifice to neatnels of houles is here in holland too ob- vious we shall urge no further but for peace fake filently reflect ob the vanity of too spruce durch woman even the maid as depen- dant on the miftress humours her vain defires however fince thofe serviceable creatures in their conditions have likewife fomething which thews vanity givethe servant in the example before us her corals or pearls about her neck altho the were as ugly faced as vizard or like the peafants in latong

well in the astigse manner as in the common way of mode-painters chap of dreses need not doubt whether the art of painting were or will be otherwife than tis at this time with respelt to its different

it and the green laft as being the weakeff thefe latter colours are called weak and broken becaute they poffets very much the qualicies of the former the purple for lattance being produced by mixture

light aparement of whice marble or light free-ftone of in landskip painted light clear and full of sky blue purple violet green and black have good effelts whereas the colours be- fore named are in this cafe not only difagreeing but they alfo fook veak and without strength except white which can not be ufed too much fince yis no colour and therefore fuits any where except gainlt shies nevertheless do not here affert that the eprbelliffiments in the aforefaid pictures muft confiff only of light and warm colours but that they be incermixed with some durk and weat anes and that in the latter piltures where we ule dark and weak colours for the by- ornaments we mult difpofe fome light and warm ofter among them now fome may poffibly think becaute we place blue by the other colours that fuch would obftruct the ofsskip or that the lrointains which by reafon of diftance are commonly reprefented blue would be damaged by so beautifiul spot but this doubt may he foon cleared up by confidering thatl do not chufe here all dark colours but that the offskip wiil thereby in some meature appear mere diffant faint and uniting it is alfo true that blue in landskip is often harth and makes the painring look flaring but by the darknels it bechmes in this cafe foff natural and tender befides blue mention alfo violet green coc but my meaning thereby is not that tis indifferent where thofe colours are placed as blue againft the blue of the sky green againtt green trees vialet againft violet-ffone or ground or light againft light and dark rels colouring chap there nets againtt darknels for that would be improper becaute is light and darknels in landskip to we have always means to give dark and light colours their places with candle-light either within or without doors or other lights proceeding from fire fuit violet purple blue green white black red without exception thefe being pieces in which thofe co- lours have an advantageous effelt and wherein they predominate on their proper grounds for vellow and red are almoft the fame as burning candle which has great effect by night as it has none in the day-time becaute the sun-fhine makes it hardly perceptible now as the two former piltures confift of flrong colours viz white vellow and red and the two larter of purple violet blue and green yet thofe of the one sort may be joined to thofe of the other in order to create an agreeable elixture and harmony by placing with the rong some that are weaker and the contrary letting each in its place have the matery on its proper ground but have particularly obferved that out of the three aforefaid pre- dominant colours others may be temper ’ of less force viz brown oker with naples vellow pink with white and fuch like and placing them by the others as middle colours we may in conjunction with thote others setch out great mass fince white has its degrees as well as red always obferving that the principal muft predominate both in force and beauty and that chole colours which are drawn from it be disperted here and there thro the whole piece as being beft set off gainft the general ground having now plainly thewed the qualities and ufes of the colours and their differences we may ealily think that the pictures wherein they are confidered mult needs be very affecting we shall not here fay what where and how one colour mixed with another is to appear becaute tis impoffible and unconceivable the principal method for obtaining this secret is to obterve to robat pitch we work up our firft and strengeft celour and to let this colour predominate for which reafon tis maxim with some that we mult not introduce into picture more than one capital colour or colour which reprefents it but have already shewed that fireral may in that manner be brought together in the same piece wherefore the eye and judgment muft decermine this point for if we find it proper to incroduce beautiful colour where we have mind to place fuch an one why should it be bad this only makes it fo its being ac- companied by by-colours not well ordered as warm colours againft watin no colbaxing book iv and grey near bine whereby those colours have no effed of elfe by placing too ftrong and too many capital colours by one nether which overcame the aforefaid beautiful colour and make the painting look fiaring but that we may not mittake in this point let us chule any colour and in order to find an affociate for it take one which is difcordant as if we puch upon red take grey one if dark light one coc thus they are as proceeding from each other joined together and by fuch means we can never be ar lots in tinding different colours for different draperies ver with this provifo that in all thofe colours the ferce or distance of the figures muft be obferved for the ready obtaining thefe things have found out very eaty method which alwars thewed me the particularity and harmony of the colours it even ofien helped me with cerrainty over the diffi- culty about the difference of the colours in draperies especially tuch as were changeable firff temper ’ on my pallet out of my general mixtures three particular colours viz one for the main light one for the half-thade and one for the shade then took cards and feverally painted them with one of the aforefaid tem- pered colours when they were dry placed and replaced and chifted them to long as till had fansned my judgment sometimes when this would not antwer my purpofe thuffid them and then cook parcel from them at random which if they happened to pleate were my directors this method helped me moft in reffecting drg feries which thereby often produced very advantageous and of fine colour it was especially ufeful when had any doubt whether fixh or fuch colour would fint well with fuch or fuch an one or net for the cards certainly shewed me the thing as well as if had the stufts themfelves and faved me the trouble of uncertain in quiries it will not be amils to fay fomething further touching back-grounds ir often happens that perfon feesa colour in picture which feems to him very agreeable and yet on imitating it he finds his colour has not the lame force and effelt thro his not obferving againtt what ground that colour was painted point worthy of the uimofl atten sion if we would avoid mistakes in colouring wherefore we mult al ways obferve the greands and places of the colours if we would have our colour predominate ordering the moft difagreeing againlt it for inttance to make the vellow predominate place blue againft it or elfe the darks of other colours would you abats the force of fellow of colouring place green near it and to bring it lower put colour which proteeds from tellow whether it be free ftone of any thing elfe yellowith the fame manner you may handle all the reft of the colours obferving that as the objects diminith by diftance to the colours mult proportionably be fainter and gradually more grey nature thews it and yet have found that we may place even capital colour in the offckip and it shall be prevented from approaching by accompanying it with colours like it and drawn originally from it as we have before thewed ch ap ii of the property nature and colours of drefes have before faid that the art of painting is an imitation of nature in her vifible pares nothing is impralticable to it and yet observes due order in all things and as we have before thewed the general order of the colours to we shall now handle it in particular with respect to druperies wherein it chieffy lies draperies confift of four kinds of things linnen silks stufs and clotb and thefe have each their particular natures and manners of folds their properties are alfo different and to thew them by an ex= ample shall divide the kinds into the four times of the day linnen draperies are for people in the morning of their lives silks forthole in their lenith stufs for thofe in the afternoon and cloth forthofe in the evening of their lives but to peak more intelligibly there are four particular conditions of men viz infuncy touth man- hood and old age and each provides drels according to his vears children should be dreffed in linnen young people in silks full-grown men and women in stufs and old people in cloth the colours for the leveral stages of life are thefe for childhood white for touth green for manbood red for old age dark vio- let and for death black in the firft chapter we have thewed that whire and black are not accounted among the colours fince the one is but the parent of colours and the other the depriver of them wherefore we introduce whire light without which no colour is vifible dark fillemot or tawny shall ferve to repretent the earth or green nets white to thew the water blue the fir red the fire and black x colouring iv black the darkness above the element of fire for there is not any mat ter or either beyond it which can contain or be penetrated by the suns r know that there are four seafons viz the joysid spring golden summer fruitful hutumn and melancholy winter in the spring we begin to leave off cloth or heavy winter-raiment and to wear thin stafs summer and hurumn permit us to drels according to their heat either in linnen or silk wherefore certain authorlays that we cught to suir our dreffes as well as our words to the seafon the seafons may be alfoexpreft by colours as the spring by green summer by vellow auturn by red and winter by black vet among the deiries there are fome who have atways one proper dress and colour as tupiler purple manle june blue veil disz white and blue garment acprune sea-green one cot thefe we can not alter without committing miltake but the figures mult neverthelels be ordered if postible where they suit best all brarg personages of either sex should likewife be clothed in red or warm fellow it therefore behoves prudent arcifl to have perfect knowledge of the narure and qualiries of the aforenamed stuffs even were the figures ever to tmall he mud notwichllanding thew in his work of what sort of stufs the dreffes contill and alcho ’ reffexions can not be well obferved in small figures yet we ought to fee by the courfe of the folds whether the draperies be silk cloth or other stults neat painter in lictle ought aifo not only to diftinguith the thick nets and thinnets of his driperies by their folds and corour but in the particular nature and colour of each drapery their diminutions and variations as between thin and thick silk opposed to sattin and more iuch for if the eye at tirff sight can perceive and diffinguith them we ought allo to make them appear what they are chieffy in fmall and highly-finithed pictures as abseris and others have artfully done to fuch degree as plainly to diftinguish between silver pewter tin and polihed lron as becomingness fublists not only in the stuffs but allo in their colours to knowing that we shall not eafily mistake in the choice of colours and draperies bur mult here give some painters an hint about the nature of sruss especially coloured ones they believe they can paint sattin after white silk and changeable silk after coloured silk but this is lame work for of colouring chap what in plain silk is thining in the light will often be found quite dark in sattin wherefore in this nature muft be confulted for thefe reafons the eye is pleafed when in painting of con- courfe of people or publick shew it can eafily diflinguith all sorts of people and the conditions and ages of both sexes and at the same time their motions according to their natures and qualities and the dreffes and colours which become them as anold man heavy and weak flanding on both legs and fometimes by the help of stick becomes long dark-coloured cloth garment viz of umber dark violet fillemor or black

moftly in whice linnen or lemon blue or violet-coloured silk they are often in white velts without any hang- ing drapery but when they have tuch loofe drapery small one about fard in length is lufficient and this faftened on the shoulder for security while they are running bultling and rolling on the ground this condult is in my opinion of great confequence tho few have obferved it nay even fome good painters oftentimes fail in ir making no difference between manly and womanith colours giving an old man femenine colour and manly one to woman intermiking them as if there were no certain rules for either but it muft be grant- ed that the silk-colours which befit young furdy capricious mian are very difagreeable ro virgin who is tender weak more fedate and lets voluptuous he requires flrong the more loff and beautiful colours yielding pleafure to the eyc it would alfo be very improper to paint child in black young man in dark brown colours grown man in part colours and an old man in beautiful ones iv of colouring faw pitture of an unknown malter in which all the par ticulars have recommended were plainly and nicely expreft it had tuch an elegance and gave me to great

here and there appeared children running about and playing in the sand all dreff in linnen habies and foff colours this ordonnance vaftly pleated me and put me to confider what it could be likened to and find it to be the same as the four times of the day for let us rake the children wheher boys or girls for day-breat the young men and women for noon when the sun is at higheft and the old people for igts between mid-day and night is vesper or the even ing which may be reprefented by joining fomething of both condi- tions allo between gurory and midday the fame to as to make in the whole

ones whether veil girdle or sleeve-facing under garment or breaft-cloth this furniture is er ther of changeable silk or of party-coloured stufts when tis to fet off large and plain-coloured drapery

apple-bloffom and white thin silk fuit stripes purple fillemor musk-colour and whire ato look well with fringes either feanty or full according to the subltance of the stuft it muft be obferved that what have hitherto faid of the ordering of the colours is not to concern single figare only but to forve any oc casson by diffufive and agreeable intermixture nor do mean that among feveral figures there mult be but one with fingle coloured garment and the relt of changeable or broken colours for when they are feparate and the draperies large each in particular is to be fet off in the manner have before laid down for latlance if all the imall draperies were feparated from the large one and we dreit as many figures in them then each muft he further adorned with ocher small dra colouring book iv draperies of colours fuiting with it in fuch manner as the large one was before in word if we only confider that fingle colour ought to be incermixed with changeable one and changeable colour with fingle ors we shall perceive what order this affair requires in order to look decorous and pleate the eyc bur for further explanation shall give two examples of it the fird company of fre or fix aged people either without or with- in doors now if thefe figures mult be all dreft it requires no art nor is it signot knowledge to give each fingle-coloured and equally large drapery altho we might find as many different colours in order to join them agreeably and this for two reafons firft becaute that can not pappen in the life without premeditation and secondly becaute the figures may not seen to be emblematic for tho to the twelve apoples are appropriated their particular colours yet we mult not infer from thence that if they were all affembled together we ought to give them colourfrom top to toe becaute tho we break the colours tsey yer regain the same as blue with green reffexion remains blue fellow with purple remains fellow and fo of others our fecond example is wanton meeting of yoing men and girls modithly dred according to their years thefe are skipping about and playing in fieldor room now ie would not be at all proper to join all their dreffes of broken colours rogether tho they were coupled in such ors deras they require and for the former reafon namely that it can hever happen but thro premedication and necellity and tho it would appear elegant and pleating yet not at all artful without an intermisture of some single coloured drageries nevertheless we find many do it or ther becaufe they take no delight in changeable draperies or elfe be- caufe ther cannor paint them and therefore make thift with broken colours again there are others who have no value forfingle colours and therefore on all occations introduce changeable or broken ones we have allo met with chird sort who do not know how to make difference between changeable stuff and broken colour tho its certain that reffeeting or changeable drapery is an intermixture of two of more colours and broken coloured drapery but of two as violet with red and blue green with vellow and blue coc whence they are called broken or mixed colours in the firff chapter treating of this management we have fpoken of refleiting or changeable draperies and as we are now again embark- ed in the same subjet it will not be amils to explain the matter further many of colouring fancy they make good reftelling drapery when is well folded and different in colour in the main lights greateff shades and reffections even rapbact and other great mafters have been mistaken in fo doing whereas good changeable drapery ought to draw irs refettions from the colour of which the main light sonfiffs the shade likewife proceeds from the ruling colour yet has fome tintture of the changeablencts and altho the drapery be changeable yet it has conflant groundcolour of the main woof of the silk thus tis wtual expreftion — green and tellow changeable this then is the true quality of reflelting silk that all that is seen frenting on the relief keeps its main colour but the sides of the folds going of cause the changeableness which we may eatily perceive on laying changeable stuff fmooth on table or floor for viewing it perpen- dicularly from above it will then appear red or yellow but if feen parallel along the stuff often appear blue whence it follows as we affirm that only the folds which go of become changeable and alter in colour when the others in the main light and shade keep their own colours gain what in one stuff changes red will in another ap- pear green or yellow according to the woof or warp by reafon of fuch accidents we are obliged to have pieces of par ticular stuffs in order to thew the difference which can not be learnt by heart becaufe of the nicety of the matter we have faid in the foregoing chapter that in an ordonnance of many figures we ought to obferve the sexes ages and conditions of people and that each muft have his proper stuff the golden fuits dei- ties and thofe who are deified purple becomes princes thus each down to the slave now to thofe of weak memories shall thew good method for their becoming mafters of this point in chort time set down in your pocker book the following heads or titles old men and matrons married men and women young men and maidens boys girts and young children place thele titles under one another and write againtt them the proper dress sruff and colour of each sex and condition thefe notesyou mult often confult and especially when jou are about an ordennance of few or many figures voumay allo make column for the colours of draperies fetting them down under one another as white vellow blue green red c and againtt them write their linings and ornaments as have be fore mentioned it will not be improper here to obferve fome particulars on diffe rent occafions in an ordonnance of many or few figures with re- no colouring book iv to colours not as if they were unknown of not obferved by in geaious artifts but becaute they are ofcentimes neglected and flighted either thro carelessness prepoffeffion of an opinion that they need not be to strictly confined or elfe becaute beautiful colours are moft pleating to people and therefore they muft especially facisty the eye withos reflelting that they thereby injure the art and their own reputarions such painters are like great talkers who fay little to the purpofe truly the colours have great efficacy when well ordered and fuit- ed but they raife an averion when unskilfully and confuledly dif poted an ingenuous perfon will undoubtedly agree with me that there are purticuler characters which diftinguith one man from another prince from an officer an officer from vulgar perfon rich man from poor one by what means then is this difference perceived is it not by his authoritative countenance grandeur and stately carriage and by his garb longer and of more coftly stuff and beauty than the others if fo it will be eafy to apprehend that tho fuch perton were nor endowed with all the aforetaid qualities but with the con irarr he ought neverthelets to be made known by fomething or other as we have thewed in treating of ordennance wherefore tis needless to fay anr thing further in this matter to bring us to the prefent point touching the coisars namely to thew on what occafions they ought to be uted trastifuly and on what not for which purpofe shall ex- hibit teres principal occurrences as examples whence we may deduce and order all others the firft may be council or triumph or fuch like wherein all the dreffes ought to appear incirely of the moft magniticent rich and beautiful stufts in the second contilling of bucchanals country-merry-makings and herefmens sports the colours ought to be half beautiful and half droken each agreeable to the condition of the parties and in the third being publick sigbts viz pleadings mountebanks tugghrs merry-andrews and fuch like made up of common and mean people coarfe stufts and dirty colours ought to be moft vi here is shill to be remarked that in the one sort of colours as well as the other the moft beautiful excels and as thofe three oc- carrences are not common muft lay that among the meaneft as well as the bert there are some which have the preference among the beal of colouring are some more beautiful and among the mean meaner ones thus much as to colours in order to know good malter but ere we finith this chapter let us obferve in what parts the co- loured stufts appear most beautiful fince stufts are very different in this relpect and have their divers proper beauties we lay then that black stufs are moft beautiful in their srongeft shades white tellow and red in their main and greateff light and blue green and purple in the half tints but all stufts not having gloss ought to be much more beautiful in their lights than their shades becaute light gives life and makes the quality of the co- lours appear when contrarily sbades obfcure and extinguith their beau- ty contequently all objects will thew their natural colours better when their surfaces are less smooth and even as we fee in cloths lin- nen leaves and herbs which are rough or hairy in which no glols or shining can appear becaule they can not receive the reffexions of neighbouring objects but thew only their true and natural colour un- mixed nor tinged with that of any other object except the redness of the sun when by his fetting he makes the clouds and horizon par- take of his colour chat iv of the disposstion of shady objects either diffant or near against light ground againfl light and shade againft shade naturally unite againtl light ground fuit well dark figures and againtt dark ground light ones in order that they may be ttrongly fet off however the fecring off of objects either much little or less on the firft fecond and third grounds certainly differs very much now it may be asked when parcel of figures flanding or fitting have white back-ground and appear fome far from others near thers againll it whether dark colours would not be proper in all the three groups fay they would but then they ought to be confider- ed in another manner for without intermixing some of them with light colours they could not fubfift wherefore tis necellary to give tome more others lets force the figures clofe to the white ground ought to be mixed with light colours in order to flick to the light and to break the lets their force and yet the dark colours will pre- dominate the light ones being only as fay to have communicati- v colsuring iv on with the white ground thereby to keep their diffance and to nite with the great light of the back ground the figures on the frond ground which came more forward ought again to have less tgbt celoars and the group on the fore ground the leaf whereby they have lets comminication with the whice ground and confequent- ly more force againtt it tis the fame with light againtt darknets for we can eafily per- ceire thar whice and black never approsch each other without parti- apation the more black is mixed with whire the more it inclines to whire like large and thick felloon mottly light placed againt dark ground now if vou would have this feftoon appear clote to the wall for tis not with nature as with picture you muft needs ule in it some dark flowers and leaves ordering them about the ex- gremitr the mot whire or light to be in the parts myt relieved darkening it gradually cowards the two excremities nearet the ground whereby the one kicks to the other and unites remaining yet light feresx the intermix ’ with dartncis tis

proportion as flrong of the former ver tis oaly to be uted in cafe of neceffity when the marter and condirion of the place require it wherefore we muff accommodace ourtelves to all exigencies this erfelt is not only proper for flowers but alfo for fruits or- nathents eren all kinds of gold and silver ornaments may with elegance be joined together by the colours after the fame manner now follows an example in plite xkl dispoted after the afore- said manner here on the fore ground appear five figures of men and women againit white buck ground the three middle ones clofe together are dark and slrong and the two on either side of litrle lighter colour whereby the croup keeps an agreeable relief and ion on the extremity on more diftant ground fland two other fr- gures of which the foremoft is dark and the other half behind the former lght yer both of less strength than the foremoit croup the lail four flanding clofe againt the ground differ hill much from the others as being here and there intermixed with more light one having whire stomacher another white cloth on her head this having flowers that with light hair another with white pot light of colouring chap drapery nudity coc which licdeneffes notwichflanding have not to much force as to enlighten the whole croup.. the doltrine of harmony teaches that we muft always place darkness againtt light and the contrary but this is only medium thewing agreeable to that polition how and in what manner light and durknets may appear either clofe together or diffant like the forefaid feffoons but it mult not be confidered otherwife than as purt of pifture if we would have perfelt ordonnance we can order at pleafure fuch dark figures as thole againtt light grounds and the contrary for inftance would you have on the right side of the piece dark buth in the middle viflo and on the other side houfes or stone-work neither light nor dark you may place gaintt the buth light figures or other objects and in the middle gaintt the oftship dark ones and againtt the houfes others again which fuir beft execute each correctly and in particular according to the said examples and then nothing will be wanting that concerns the tines the colours joined to it make the work compleat think have fully explained this point of darkness againtt light and the contrary yet feveral things ferving my purpole hill occure ring to me which were forgor in the firft chapter judge them plo= per to be mentioned here fay then that all light colours cith were they broke appear well againtt dark ground but not with tuch force as the flrong ones as we have formerly faid that witen colours appear beft on faint ground and the coptrary whether they be light or dark tis allo conflant rule that the ftrob co lours as light red and light vellow do not fiuit on ligth of hird ground more than beautiful blue on dark one tho reckoned eat pital colour but let us return to our example we have hitherto only ipoken of the tints or light and darkness it will now be necelfary to thew alfo the colours of the dreffes according to their order place and power no is sea-oreen — vellowith grey violer somewhar less beautiful green than no — purple dark violet not beautiful but the girdle beautiful light fellow colouring — brown oker and violet reffexion greenith blue red orpiment — violet with little red obferre now from behind forwards whether thefe figures as they advance do not become gradually fronger by the intermixture of frong colours the off-group has none that in the middle has one two of which one is very firong and the foremofl ii it be asked why place here the flrong one namely red orpi- no force againft light ground fay it mult be ment as having obferred as the foremoft figure being encompaffed with two dark ores let it allo not be thought becaute thus exhibit the colour of each figare that they ought therefore to be of the same colour from top to toe confule the skerch and remember their draperies one large another fmall of broken and faint colours with which they ire intermixed and fuit the ground as we have already intimated that in order to form great maffes of capital colours viz vellow red or blue and they to predominate in an ordonnance we may enlarge or break such strong part with mixtures of the same as red gniment with brown oker umber or tuch like which nevertbeless tellow after fuch manner we may handle all the colours to wit beautiful green with other green red with purple vio lets with blue or grey yellowith white with grey and to forth in word if but one of the two be less beautiful chap of the harmany of colours hey who are converfant with books are fentible that few authors have written of the harmony of colours and what they have done is to obicure and unintelligible that shall en- deavour to make the point clear ir muit be granted that in every part of the art narure is our pattern fince the difpofes herfelf in the moft perfelt manner if we at any time difcover fomething fine and pleafing in her which we often of colouring often do and yet know not the reafon why it has fuch elegance and decorum we ought to confult the rules of difpofition and her- mony and examine with which of them the objects agree by which means we shall foon apprehend what decorum is and on what rea- founded harmony proceeds from placing faint colours againft rrong ones and the contrary wherein fuch an union appears that the one seems naturally to flow from the other as in this inftance let us fuppofe an ordonnance to be divided into three grounds or di- ftances place the principal figures in the middle on the fore-ground and let lome of them be firongly coloured and the whole croup as rrongly fiung off by shady hollow rock coming behind them place to the right on the second ground some figures beautifully coloured yet tint darker than thofe on the fore ground and behind them an airy greyith-green buth and further on light offskip filled here and there with fmall trees let this buth be tint darker than the second groundfigures on the left side of which ground place other figures as of girls and young children in faint colour ’ dras peries which tho coming againtt light buildings

only to thew the method of placing them in word whether they are to approach because of their no tural strength or to retive by reason of their natural weakness but it fcarce posfible that in any subject all the colours should according to their natures happen to fall to advantageoutly and there fore we may on any occafion alter them for inftance if inflead of the gilt boat we were to introduce piece of white marble adorned with mouldings and balsrelicfs and flrongly lighted the vifto behind turned into clole ground and the trees behind the stone-work in read of greyith more fentible warm and approaching this stone fay would have the fame effect as the boat and come forward with force tho whire we all know is not to frong colour as vellow forherein it will happen as in camp where in the generals ab- fence the lieutenant general commands and in company the lieu- ignant for the captain and the enlign for him even the serjeant is not without his power therefore when ttrong-natured colours are not in pilture the weaker tupply their places in greater or lets degree as the matter requires wheren lies the crisss of the management let me add to this inftance of the white stone-work that it muft be the rrongelt and moft carching object in the whole ordonnance and that no arong objects muft come near it to leffen its force or kill it unlets they be weakened and brought down either by miftiness or by means of their back-grounds whereby they may then have no more force than braken golour chap vi of the disposstion of irregular objects and light gaint darkness and the contrary placing and ordering of objects is of great moment for if after we have choien them all moft beaunful we difpote them careletly they will abace of their luftre again good dit- polition will make an object tho unelegant in itfelf look agreeable to give some examples of it thall begin with place kxiil on the fore-ground on the right side is lying an overfet pot gaintl large

moreable and immoveable viz men cat- tle birds trees hills buildings csc as well horizontal as falling back behind each other as to force it confifts in light againft darknels and the contrary for except by the diverficy of colour there is no other way than this to fet off objects againft one another we have faid that the three fore-ground figures are flrongly colour ed and come againft the

darkness ies allo eaty to conceive that the three figures becaute they come againtt the light offskip and not into shade mult needs require dark colours contrarily the pot and stone are fer off againt the dark trees by general rule that when there are some bigbr objects on one side of the compolition thofe on the other should be durk let us now view second example in plate xxiv as being an ob fervation depending on the former feeing neither can fublift without the other this rends to illuftrate the management of lights boch above on euch side and bebind one anotber and that we ought always to order after fuch manner when the former example shew us the irreculariry of objetts in their high and low disposstion the forward firting figures are with the firff ground dark as be ing thaded by driving cloud to alfo is the walking figure thm to its middle the building on the second ground fronts the light to gether with the two flanding figures which are fet off by the dark side of the houte

light but tis not fufficient to place here or there ground shade we mult alfo thew the occation of it that it may not be asked what cauted it for all shades are not alike fome are more dark others more clear moreover they differ alfo sometimes in colour wherefore it will not be amils to fay fomething of it here tho we shall treat of it more at large in it place the groundshade of trees often appears less of more green accord ing to their tranfparency or clofenels the ground-shade cauted by driving clouds is faime and has no other colour than that of the airbe- tween the ground-fhade of red green or blue frerched curtain is allo of the fame colour thofe of an houfe or other heavy piece of stone-work are grey and dark coc but to return to our subject les plain that what is demonftrated in thefe two examples touching light and darkness above on each side and behind one another is the same when reverfed namely if that which is now dark were light and the light dark les alfo indubirable that if one of the lights were taken away the ordonnance and agreeable harmony would be fpoiled at once even to much as not to be brought right again without general alceration for inftance fuppole the walking perion were dark above how could he be fet off by the column since we have before faid that darknels againft darkness is improper and were the column to be light how should we manage the sky and if the sky were dark be- hind the column that would be as bad again for the whole fore ground and all upon it are dark and the fecond ground is light again wherefore every thing would be in diforder and indecorous from thefe premifes we may planly perceive that this is conflant method for management and when good difpolition of the colours according to their qualicies is joined to it for we know tharobjects have various colours of which we can chule the moft proper the decorum will fill be the greater and the eye more pleated trees tho they appear always green are yet diverfified according to the seaion and their na- tures some are sea-green others deep green this rullet that grey- green thefe again light green others dark green groands likewife differ as hilly sandy clayith and muddy stones do the same all which we have fully shewed in the firft chapter of this book as for colouring pv mes pone excepted what colours have they not in fine he who well underflands the ordering of the colours and the facing them will never be at lots but let him especially observe that in any ordonnance whether of hiffory landskip or any other branch one side maft be contrary to the other not only in light and shade but allo in height and dench the defigns of thefe two examples are not much unlike that in the foregoing chapter yer here is greater variety for the former was of the force of objects either dark or light againit contrary grounds hereas thefe tho grounded on the fame obtervation thew us how they are to be ordered above one another when it to falls out for in- ftance we fee group of figures on the fore ground againll another on the second groand fomewhat higher and that againtt another silf ligher and to on to the cieling or sky we have thewed in chap how we ought to let off objects behing one another and to unite them with the ground but thefe examples reach firft how light and dark objects on another ought to be managed to as to ferve each other and that each may keep ir dillance secondly how for want of shade we mult make thife wirh the of colours lattly how irregular objects ought to be placed againtt each other which is the soul and life of an ordonnance especially where there are many people bur tis not confined to human fioures for it respects all sorts of objects whether grounds hills balluftrades bartlements win- dows roofs clouds and sky in fine every thing we can fee rife be hind any thing elle whereon people can appear speaking of clouds it mult be obterved that we may reprefent figures fying in the air and littingon clouds in the fame manner as on the earth marter of principal concern on fuch an occafion where the major part of the objelts contills of height and many are at loss in the different lights colours and tinrs wherefore docible arcifts regard this as an in- fallible rule and confider every thing which have laid down in the aforetaid examples to prevent your falling into the miltakes which are herein nlually commired thall now fubjoin third skeich plate xxv touching the crefing and geing off of objects as sequel of the two preceding see in this example boat going off againt crols height or earthern wall whereon divers people are leaning by one another who with the trees riting behind break the regulariry of the wall the approaching figures appear again againt the offskip which runs acrols the of colouring boal is in flrong light againtt the shady wall which ende in the middle of the piece where the foremoff approaching figures are fee off with light both againft it and the hindward dark figures which have their effelt again againtt the light of the buildings in the offskip the sky on the right side of the piece abounds with heavy hanging clouds and on the other side are none or very small ones here we perceive firff great motion in the dilpolition of the ob- jects which cross each other up to the horizon onone side and on the other the contrary which caules an agreeable variety especially as there are some objects going off which thew the point of sight the second obfervation is the harmony of light and sbaile as in the for- mer examples this examplethen thews what methods we may take in order to fetch out fuch esfelts and tis for that reafon that this point is ex- hibited feverally and in different manners which we may make ute of as occafion offers as much or as little as we think proper tho ne- ver too much fince variety tires no one but is always pleating as here viflo there bolcage houfes coc here winding road there again building hiding part of the offskip here level ground there river befet with trees partly running towards the point of sight and then bending either to the right or left cross the piece round rock and at lalt to difappear variety feeds cor tinual delightful defire but we mult know that it principally respects ordonnances in the open air or landskips chap vii of agreeableness in irregular and contrafting objects we have not knowledge in compolition all that we endeavour at is extravigancy even should we bring out good difpofition it would be owing to luck when well-ordered piece tho indif- ferenely coloured will always have an harmony the truth of this find clearly evinced in irregular objects which give life and moti- on to an ordonnance as we have leveral times thewed in treating of ordennance and alfo in the firft and laft examples of the foregoing chapter this motion is happily ferch ’ out if the contrafting objects be confiderately joined for by this means they will meet each other to colouring iv agreeably as perfectly to pleafe the eye not as placed thus by na- ture but as the refull of an artful compofition by the irregularity of objects underfland their forms as when one is high another is oblong this pointed that quire round oval c bur ere proceed further shall thew the ealy mechod took in order to get the knowledge of irregularity firft drew all forts of figures in different actions as fitting standing fooping lying walking coc and cut them out with scif fors next made skerch of my ordonnance and laid it down fat and put my cut figures upon it moving them about cill was farisfied where to place fitting flanding or lying one how many faired here how few there and thus after much thifting brought forth good ordonnance which then deligned fair making fuch al- teration in the actions of the figures as thought proper yer retain ing their poftures in general leaving large and flanding ones where they ought to be and the small ones lying or fitting in their places and to forth by this means have found that landskip with many and small frgures ought to confift of lurge by-works for fetting them off viz large and crofe trees heary stone-work broad grounds coc and withindoors in palace or apartment there ought to be behind small figares large and flat walls with few ornaments for were they to confilt of many parts all would feem alike large and were we to place by large figures lome large parts all would appear small or to speak better equally turge large object mult make another small an oblique one anothererell and square one others pointed or round for contraries muft be brought together that the one may thew the other it is the same with light if large part confiff either of light or shade let one be the ground for the other for inftance if on the fe- cond ground large part be in shade let the third have some charp and glittering lights this will help the broad shades and wanton lights but thole two choices require different management the principsl ought always to precede and the other to be fubfervient to it in landskip the immrecable objects predominate and the moveable ones ferre only for ornament contrarily in an ordonnance the figures are fird disposed and then the by-werks for when we fay that an up- right flanding figure mult be placed by bending tree and crook ed stem by ftanding figure we underlland by the former the stem to be the prinips and the figure the affiliant if in landship but colouring an hiffory the figure is principal thus it is allo in an apartment with architecture statues bass-reliefs and other ornaments the irregalarity of objects does therefore give particular deco- rum and elegance for what satisfaction would it be to the eye to fee some beautiful grapes and melons lye each in feparate dith but if grapes melons or other gibbous round oval and large fruits were grouned together they would add luftre to each other we know that lmall houte vifibly magnifies temple or pa- lace and that long and low building makes tower or maufoleum look high such contraricties as thefe are many and to name them all would be as tedious as impoffible wherefore shall content myfelf with men- tioning

faint grounds and the centrary or dartress againt light and light against darkness in already spoken largely about the management of the colours which is one of the capital parts of painting have taken great pains in building some rules thereupon with view that when occation required might give good reafons for to doing under my prefent misfortune this comfort is left that now have nothing to hunder what firmiy purpote and therefore can confider it with more vigour than ever even imagine it in de- gree equal to nature herfelf fince lnow perfeclly the strength and nature of colours and their eficts confider then the following example plste kxviil whether it be of moment the man warm fillemor drapery is againtt the faint off- ship the woman in light blue draperr agaumithe trees behind her or beautiful sky-colour blue and pale red again dark beautiful red and rofe-colour or purple and whire thefe are the principal and moll luitable alcerations befides changeable stufts some perhaps may ask whether the blue drapery which we place here againt the oftship does not contradict what we have formerly faid namely that blue is rechoned among the weak colours andyet here we affert warmth againt faininels and the contrary to which an iwer negatively becaute wecall warm colours thofe which are purc and unmixed erz beautiful skv-blue beautful fellow and beautiful red whereas when thote colours are mixed with whire their warmthnolonger lubills becaute their durkness gives the glow we fee on the contrary that light blus lighe fellow and light red even whireirself ferre for weak colours againtt the dark as this example shews the reafon why ought now to be of fingle or capital colour is becaute the ctiship being made up of to many tender and faint colours of colouring chap shall have no communication with it which makes the one the better retire and the other approach does the fame contrarily this small example is of fuch nature that any ordonnance of what kind foever as well within doors as in the open air aterfrom must thereby become good if we incroduce inflead of the offskip building with bats-reliets figures or other ornaments of weak colour or elfe of marble it will antwer the fame purpofe and if inflead of the trees we exhibit curtain grotto rock or other building of warm stope it will be the fame again with respect to colour but if come againt fist ground of one colour whether grey or white then that figure map be of different colours or changeable stuff likewife if we place bagainll an hlanging or party-coloured ground that figure muft needs be of fingle colour or drapery wherefore we are enabled to judge how far this obtervation extends yet as this example shews only light and darkness we shall fub- join another in plate xxvill aforetaid with third or middle tint which with the former will fuffice for giving right notion of compoting all sorts of ordonnances as well within doors as in the open air as before faid alcho ’ the delign were to confifl of or more groups observing the grounds againft which they come whether faint flrong diffant or near to the end those croups may by the force of light or weak colours obtain their due beauty speak not in reference to any one in particular but all in general we find that when dark colours are placed againtt faint offskip they are vilibly fet off and make the one appear diftant and the other near and the more when we fet some light and weak colours on the fore ground whereby shey fill have greater effect as we may ob- ferre in figure from which premifes tis plain that the fame can be effected by the contrary method to that the argument of some namely that rrong and warm colours ought always to be placed forwards in order to approach the more and the weak ones to be in proportion to their diftance the fainter the further is intirely overthrown for want of contidering that the strels lies meftly in the back ground the example now before us is like the former the fore ground ex- cepted which is added to it the better to explain our mmeaning in the ordering the colours to advantage by which method we can difpole our ordonnances with cafe and to as to ferch out beautiful harmo see plate xxviil aforefaid no colouring iv place on the leff side on the fore ground in the grass fitting woman with her right leg froncing the light having white un der garment and

dustily there is rill one thing which many painters careletly pats over tho very ufeful and elegant if well and naturally obferved it relates to suck objects as are duly as well in roomsas in gar- den for tho the former be fomerimes fwept and the latter cleaned yet pedettals balluftrades parapets vafes and statues always elcape galleries and publick places for walking in are likewife feldom clean ed it is therefore in my opinion very improper in thofe who with great care reprefent the prvements of the faid places with stones of di- vers colours very difinctly jointed one dark another light without the leaft spot of unckanness which makes it very difficultto get good de- corum or caule thole pavements to look fat without offence to the lyc cauting moreover an exceffive stiffuets be the colours ever to well ordered whereas ufually in large apartment daily walked in we can not in the aforefaid dittind manner perceive what the colours of the floorare except towards the extremicies and next to the walls wherefore the middle where is the moft walking must appear dull wiit of colouring and almoff of one tint some painters exprets the compart ments of fuch floors so diffinttly that you would even imagine they were wer grant indeed that lometimes in the life it is fo by means of the dark stone yet if we break and make them lictle lighter they will then not pare so much and yet be no lets natural if an apartment were furrounded with marble surbafe and in the middle of the room were gilt ciftern by which the floor may very well appear prong becaule of its agreement with the marble and the glitier of the ciftern for my part should rather chule plain floor than comparted one but if we lie under neceffity to introduce the latter the beft mechod will be to unite the colouring in fuch manner that the tints differ but little from each other this obfervation does in an especial manner affect landship fince tis certain that the parts which abound with trees whether woods or sides of roads are fubject to rain and wind and by means of dufl or sand the greens tombs pyramids vafes and all other objects in fuch places are to fullied and covered that the true colours of the faid objects are hardly perceptible for inftance in fuch as we now speak of flands red tombon black plinth now if we make this tomb or plinth too dark or too frong it will look as if it had been waked whereas contrarily it ought by means of the dult of the branches and leaves which fomerimes fall on it to be to covered over that we shall fcarce perceive whether the tomb be red or the plinth black alcho some may think this obfervation too triffing and far-ferch ’ is nevertheless highly neceffary in order to find befides by other me- thods the litelibood in picture whether it be for breaking thereby in fome meafture and uniting objects which through the nature of their colour would have too great force or for any other caule fet not without reafon that it may not appear too affected but here methinks hear some object that if we thus oblerve in every thing this dull and sully long gowns and train cloaths can- not be free from it especially thofe of women which are common- ly of beautiful and light colours and muft confequencly be at the bottoms as well as their white sandals more or less dulty to the no fmall laughter and wonder of the people to which antver that ishould more wonder to fee perfon come dry out of the water than cleap out of dufl and dirt for tho we do not fee it obferved by others who have always made the sandals beauriful and white even those a colouring book iv of common soldier as well as of general and train gown the fame yet fay that this obfervation does not tend to countenance aetakes pot to make us mindful of the natures of things and to exprets then in our piltures with all likelibood more or lels as the mat cer requires not fuperffuoulty but in moderacion virtue which tak= ing place in other things should not be negletted in this point ju- dicious mafter will obferve an equilibriam in order to prevent aver- tion fince things too beautiful are unnatural and thofe which are too dirty ditagrecable to every one this management would alfo not be juftifiabie could we not as have faid perceive the reafon of it as in poor people countrymen and fuch like with old and tattered cloaths which wear not without foiling and gathering dult but this obfervation is of no ufe to thofe who not apprehending the caufes of things will have every thing as beautiful as posfible whereas likelibood should appear in all parts prudenter agende

important in the art of painting for without thorough know- ledge of it tis impostible to make good picture wherefore shall thew all that by discourfe can bring as the refule of what have learned by many observations and long experience of common light objects in common light have no broad fharp lights and their shadesare uncertain the lecond tint and shade keep their own co lours much better in clear hir without clouds becaute the objects being lighted on all sides without vapour appear fentible and more relieved than in sun fhine this light think beft for pourtraits and fuch objects as we would have enlightened from without the picture as an open gallery or fuch like place and tho the objects thus lighted have d lights and shades no great force we neverthelets find that the mais teuches both in light and shade are firenger than in otber lights this light gets great elegance and advantage by low horizens when if makes greater shades as under the leating of trees mould ings and projectures of buildings and fuch like of the light in cloudy sty we need not wonder why the objects in cloudy air appear more fentible than in sun-thne or clear weather becaute the air or capours being moftly exhaled leave the objects below without mis riness and thus afford much charper tranparency for viewing every thing without the leat obstruction for which reafon things in cloudy air teem lels to go off from us and appear dark and near and of more beautiful colour especially the green of grats and trees of sun shing light objects enlightened by the sun are more or lets mifty as the sun thines frong or weak for this reafon that the atoms or motes be- tween us and the point of sight feem more deafe by the strength of the sun than in common or clear light and are more or lels ting- ed by which means the shales of objects become faint at ence and go of more suddinly than in another light wherefore we may ealily conceive that tho the shades are broader and more fenfibly limited than in another light yer they appear not to charp as fome mafters have by mistake expretted them efoecially berchem in his objects lets than the life this indeed would be well enough in covered pla- ces as galleries palaces apartments where there is no hir where by the objects then appear more perfelt plain and less retiring suppofe for intlance you walk thro tome fhady trees it is cer tain that comins towards the end of them you will fee the objects in the open air plainer and better than in the field the prospective glats evidencly proves this were the day ever fo clear obferve then in general that as have faid the objects grow faint more fuddenly and difappear in sun fhine which herein principally differs from com mon light of of lights and sbades of the light in halls rooms and other apurtments for pieces to be hung againtt walls of apartments the common light is moft proper if the difpofition of the light of the place will permit as being the moft moderate and agreeable when well and naturally expreffed this conduct then is principally to be obferved in it that the figures and other objects be lighted more or less ftrong and bread according to their nearness to or distance from the light of the windows and tho flanding on the same ground they ought neverchelets to be different in force of light and dullness of shades so alfo the ground-pades on walls grounds and other ob- jects should be some sporter fironger and more sensible than others the figures clofe to the windows mult therefore certainly receive their light from on high and have sorter groundshades than thote which are further from them but as it may havpen that the objects diffant from the aforelaid light may receive light from other windows to their sbades ought alfo to break more or lets and to become faint becaule they are encom- patted by alarger light besides reffexions from the walls the shades of fuch objects are alfo warmer than in the open fir where the blueof the sky and vapours very much weaken them and make them faint we mult likewife oblerve in general that in an apartment hung with red vellow blue of green all the shades of the objects are thereby reffected and partike of the same colour but the touches and shades of the fainteft objects will appear the firenger compendium of the lights in cloudy weather the objects are lets retiring more warm and more fentible in clear weather without clouds little more retiring in sun shing weather sill more retiring and less fentible in fogey weather as at the latter end of the vear or in winter the moft retiring and more fuddenly difappearing the groffer the air the more body it has and the more body the more vilibly lighted whereby the sight is thortened and the objects appear more indiffinct thus much as to objects in the open air thete of lights and shades thefe four particular lights naturally handled are certain proofs of skilful mafter and it would in my opinion look very agreeable to fee fuch pieces

expantion feeming lower or higher as tis more or less replete with vapours now the sky is certainly never without vapours fince were there none it would be very where blue as well on the horizon as over our heads but we fee it appears lighter next the horizon than vertically becaute the vapours fog and diminiththe beautiful bluetbere tis allo plain that the nearer the air is to the earth the more denfe and gross it is and in proportion to ir afcent the more rarified and tranfparent the vapoursare likewife more or lets fentible in proportion to their dentity of rarity we of lights and shades muff obferve here that when the sun rifes in the eoft it is then in that part lighter on the horizon than in the three others and at noon tis lighter in the south and to round becaute this large heavenly body communicates its infiuence to every thing near and bout it shall now demonterate by an example the reafon why the va- pours the further they are from us become the lighter take thin gaule or to vards long and ftrain it in the open air on four poles mark each vard with crots-line numbered to place yourfelf under no and looking along to the end of you will perceive the blue of the sky less in the second the straining divifion and the further fill lefer becaute the thin threads dou- bling before your eyes thereby thicken the gaule more and more and abace its thinness or tranfparency infomuch that at latt you per- ceive nothing but an intire white stuf suppofe now that the stars were up and you were to make the same experiment you would find them to appear most diffintt in the firft division and ditappear in proportion as they go off which is plain proof that tho the air be ever to rare forwards or near yet it becomes groffer the further of and confequently more body must re- ceive more ligbt tis for this reaion that the stars are never feen very near the ho- rizon and if we do perceive any thereabout they are but small and weak between the air and water there is no difference the one feems to be an impreffion of the other to wit both of them light towards the horizon and the air over head and water forwards both dark as for the ground or plan which receives its light from the hex- vens do not find it necelfary to arlign other reafons for proving that the cafe of this is quite contrary to that of the air fince per- peltive thews that every thing enlightened if it have but folid body darkens more and more the further it goes off from us sup- pofe for inftance an open gallery feet long having an even floor you will perceive the firft foot to be the lighteff and to on to the further end less and less light the same may be obferved in fi- gures cleathed in wbite and how much the firft will differ from the lall peak only of what is in the light for the cafe is quire dif- ferent with what is dark and in shade as we may fee when figures are dreft in black that then they become lighter and lighter by the thickening of the vapours no lights and sbades the objects which appear in level field when the air is with- out clouds and the sun hidden either behind mountain or tree will receive light from all sides and jet keep their relief by reason of their firong and dark tourbes their colours are not broken but re- tain their nacural beauty and tho the sun as before faid be hid den by fomething and can not then shine on the objects they will neverthelets receive more or lets light from the fir on the side where the sun is hidden without altering the colours that the blue of the sky is no colour we can plainly perceive by the objects in an open field when the sun or light clouds fhine not on them which are not in the leaft tinctured by it as being nothing elfe than vafl remotencts or height from whence it comes forth and therefore not able to impart this colour to the objects as they do their to one another for want of body since we are treating of the virtues of the hir it will not be mils to fay fomething of its reffexion matter worthy of obfervari- on fince in that point are offen comminted great miltakes and to explain it we thall exhibir the three following examples the numbers fignify the tints as is one tint one tint darker and tint darker than the preceding the figure plare kxik is tint darker in shade than bfor this realon that the trunk of the tree has rough superficies which can gire no light and the white houfe contrarily can give great light or reffexion now if the houfe were not there but lerel field inflead of ir would rather be lighter than darker and if the trunk and buthes behind it were alfo taken away thofe two figures would have like shade whereas now we fee two fr gures on one line or ground one darker and the other lighter tho' the darkeff shades in the latter keep their own force which did they appear otherwife would be againt nature and the rules of art the second exemple has the fame obfervation now am well altured from experience that if we were to give to tome who had never feen this sketch or known the reafon of it an oatline of the following or fuch defign difpoted alike and one figure as far from the trees as the other is near it flanding in line parallel with the horizon in order to shade them according to their own notions they would reprefent them both alike in light and shade tho by an infallible rule he who flands furtheff from the trees have more light round about him than be who is nearer and therefore it can not poffibly be otherwife than as we fee here exhibited to wit bone ti of lights and sbades in shade and in the ground shade and tints in shade and in the groundshade now behold the woman on the fore= ground who like has one tint in shade by reafon of the re- flexion of the stone flanding near her the groundshade upon that stone confifts of three tints and if the stone or any firch hindrance were not there the ir would caute the fame effect tho not fo rrongly some may poffibly think that the houle is too far to caule fuch reffexion and that then the figure ought not to differ to much but fay that the trunk with the may-bubes behind to interpole that the figure can not receive any reflexion from the houfe and therefore it mult naturally be one tint darker in shade than would you make far-feich ’ opposition and dress in white fay then that there would be no need either of the trees or houfe when yet irs plain that the one as well as the other is thus ordered to ferve for an example the third example plate xxk confirms the two former in which we plainly fee the reafons why objects are weakened more or less in their shades not only by the reffexions of other objects but allo by the fir on the left side and the groundshades the fame which are darkened more or less beyond the reach of the faid air or reffexion as it appears on the three columns in which tis evident that the ground-thades of and are tint fainter than that of the pillar by the light of and the air and by the airalone the pillar is about half-way from the bottom darker in its reffexion than above and its groundthade one tint darker than and by reafon of its flanding nearer to and whereby pillar comes to caft its ground shade on which ground-hade covers the light of whereby this laft can not reflect thus far againtt nor in its ground thade thefe effects happen as well in sun-fhine as common light without the leaft alteration we exhibit here another example in plate xxx aforefaid which affords no lels confideration than the foregoing and whereby thew the force of light and the mainlight touches upon objects and how unlike they appear in two objects alike according as the horizon is high or low and bare the inttances and cand the proofs of it that it can not be otherwife the cafe is the fame whether the light be sun-fhine of common or whether it be fronting or fideways the horizon is as we fee between both hleads and the point of sight b lights and shades sight in the middle or fomewhat more to the right side the light proceeds allo from the right now confider how the two heads and tho having one and the fame light differ in their main ligh-touches having thofe touch- es on the forehead and all the projecting parts as nofe and chin under lip and to forth and having them on the rife of the brows corners of the eyes befide the nofe and along the check tip of the nofe and chin cc which atteration is only cauled by the point of sight according to its pofition either high or low when the ob- jelts be they of what kind foever if but smooth and even as marble copper or the life ittelf fland under an high horizon the aforefaid main-ligbt-touches go upwards and on the contrary defcend the more the objelts are elevated above the horizon as we have faid and is here demonftrated now obferve cd of the fame stuff as the foremoff heads and lighted by the fame light where has flrong height ening on the rifing part which defcends more or less as it rifes above the horizon this example is of great mloment and procduces uncommon things in which we should fometimes be at loss and which would not occur to us in many vears peak in reference to thofe who are too conti- dent of quick conceptions and do not duely weigh things for it mull be allowed that without the knowledge of perspective it is impofli- ble to trace truth from the secrets of nature in order to bring it to pats in our works tis true we can imitate the life gold or sil- ver por kerle dith or other chining piece of houhold fluft as fine as the life but may be vaftly miftaken in the ules of them in our ordonnances if we do not regard the motions of the glitterings which are as various as incredible and yet all thofe things may be eafily apprehended if we underfland and fometimes prattile per feftirc chap iii of reffesions in the water he reprefenting reflexions in the water is certainly not of the leaft moment and their agreeableness makes them worthy to be naturally exprefted but as there are not affigned or will be found any certain rules for them without the id of perspettive to is lofl labour to feek any for which reafon some landskip-paint lights and shades often pats over the reffexions in the water to avoid the trouble of perspective neverthelels the incomparable pousin has not forgot to make ule of them and he has got great reputation thereby lpeak of nicholys who was as famous for landskip as figures and who never met with any difficulties which he did not furmount having earneftly applied to this point confidered whether there could not be found other thorter means to effect it than by planning lines coc that to agreeable part of art might not be neglected and after long trial difcovered the following method take an oblong board of what size you preafe and place thereon some wax-figures as clofe to the edge as you think proper or accord- ing to their diftance from the water which they ought to have in your pilture bend thefe figures into fuch actions as your sketch re- quires and place them by means of little bits of wood or potters earth as high or low as you defire then take trough made for that purpofe of lead wood or tin painted within fide with fuch as you want whether black umber or terrevert and fill it with water and fet it againtt the board and figures as high or low as your skerch ’ ground direlts next fix your point of sight and after having found your diftance place yourfelf there either randing or litting and thus defign the figures with their reffexions hlighily allo marking the shades then fet your layman to each figure and delign it very carefully fixing the layman each time in the place where each figure ffood to as to fee its reffexion like that in your sketch here especially take notice of the length and breadth of the re- rexion for it always shortens more than its object becaute it is to much lower under the horizon when you place the model or lay- man as much above the horizon as it reflects under it and delign it thus correctly in order to paint after it you hold the drawing uplide down here you will poffibly fay that the reffexion ought to be re- vers ’ which do not difown but then you can make an impreffion of your sketch on another paper and thereby perceive the good effelt having proceeded thus far and painted after your skeich you may be affured every thing is right but here let it be obferved that the reffexions mull always be perpendicular with the objects above them as if growing out of each other as we may fee in plats exxl this lights and shades book this merhod relates not only to the placins of figures but all ther objects of what kind foever as horfes dogs pyramids stones with batsreliefs vafes pors and other things and whether they be forwards backwards or at the sides of your painting you may inflead of watertrough ufe looking-glats but tis not to narural as the water which may be made to look deep or shallow and as dark or light as you pleafe by placing little mud grats or sand in the bottom of the trough as for the colouring experience teaches that the more the water is enlightened by the sky the more ancertain the reffexions are and when the sun fhines directly on the warer the objects will appear ib are uncertain as well with respect to us as thofe who view themfelves therein for the reffexions then appear only as defcending rays without any shape as we fometimes fee by candle the moon or other thing which gives only reflexion on the surface of the water whether in sun-thine or by night becaute we can not then perceive the trantparency of the water the reffexions in the warer tho it be quite dark and clear are never so light as their objects witheut but always tint or an half durker now to reprefent the reffexions in running water you muft firtt paint it with light and shade on ground rubbed thinly over with firtle rough oil then take large foft pencil and here and therecross harch it but better way is to take long hair ’ fitch and make the strokes as clole as the veins of the waterrun taking care not to itrike out too much of the our line but as glass is diaphanous body and therefore has so confancy or fixednels nor can effect any thing but by means of fomething elle having more body as by the earch which is firm body this we fee when the glass isfilvered or pirch- ed to with water the cafe is the fame which will produce no effect nor receive the form of any object unless there be firm ground to fx its transparency as we mavice by piece of ice having laid enough of the reffexions which concern objects out of the water it will be neceffary to oblerve fomewhat about objects pand ing in the water point well worth our notice on account of the uncommon occurrences which happen in it tho as little heeded as if they were on the land and no water thereabouts we mult fuppose the water to be like the air and that the objects between it and the air feen from topto bottom appear the fame as if they were uplide down againtt the hir there being no other dif ference of lights and shades chap between the lights of either than that water is little fainter than the air as may be apprehended by looking-glats in which the objects tho they appear ever to plain do not come up to the life irtelf thefe things being premifed tis eafy to conceive that objects randing in the water are enlightened as well from below as above peak not here of the reffexions of objects but of the objects them- felves and their shades as may be seen in plate kxxl aforefaid the man who extends his right arm over the water receives flrong re- fexions from below of violet colour like that of the air above him along his chaded side and his left arm across his breaft re- ceives double reffexion to wit from the water and from his body whereby tis of more warm colour than the other the young man bfooping over stone views himself in the water in the shade of the tree by him thew that the reffexion of the water is like that of the air but little fainter as faid before the face on the stone exhibits the fame but more fenfibly being allo lighted from below here we muft further obferve that the further or higher objects are from the water the more reffexion they receive as may be feen in the mand who with his breaft is close to the warer without any reffex- ion becaute the light over him can not thine on it fince he is flooping forward and thades the warer to the ground with his body thus far have experimented and from whence other circumfances may be deduced by practice in the mean time we may obferve how much thofe objects differ from thofe on the land of which latter we muft note that the more theyrife from the ground the less reffexion the shades receive be caule the light of the grounds being on the superficies they main- can their own conftant colours touching the reflexion in the warer befides the contraction and reffexion have been long doubting about the irregutarity between them and the objects themielves fince perceived by the rules of op- ticks or prattical perspettive that there was fomething more to be taken notice of apprehended alfo that as there is air and sun above and below to thote two lights mult needs caufe an uncommon effect in the objects and their glitter or main heightenings but yer could not firm- ly conclude how or in what manner and the rather becaute which am much furprifed at never heard that any perfon had certainly de- montlrared it atlaft finding the greateff difficulcy in explaining my concep- book of lights and sbades did to give sketch of it caute an inquiry to be made into the truchirfelf as plate xxkl aforefaid fhews wherein we plainly fee how far things may fometimes go beyond our gueffes thofe who try nice experiments mult be rejoiced when they make greater difcoveries than others we fay — he who seeks finds but nothing is to be obtained without labour and practice obferve then that the stress lies here in the main-light-teuches as the afore- faid figures plainly thew but they may be qualified according to occa- lion and as you think fit both in the objects and their reffexions we take then for example the objects flanding on the water being under the horizon equal to their height and receiving their light from the right they fland on each side of the point of sight and have their proper lights and shades according to perspective as allo the mainlight touches or gless on the relief the same ex- periment may be made with all sores of objects in all which we may perceive how much the reflections in the water as well as the contractions will differ from the objects themfelves this is an uncommon obfervation but study will make it fami- lar chap iv of ground shades according to the difference of lights will not be improper to make some obfervations about the ground fhades of objects and the course of those shades accord ing to the different lights proceeding from the side round to the fore part as perspective decermines exactly the length breadth and depth of things to tis impottible to reprefent any thing duely and well without it tho as may fay we were to practife the art an hur- dred vears and the ordonnances to confift of but two or three fi gures will not fay of ten or more tis no wonder that we to early caufe young arrifts to learn perspective before they take to com polition tis even commendable if they underfland it but indifferently and thun thofe who not only reject its rules but laugh at thofe who fiudy them converfation very prejudicial to young and unexperi- enced tyres but to return to our subject we of lights and shades chap find great dvaniage in uing sidefight in our ordonnaices with respelt to the greand-pades becaute thole shades whether for wards or diftant always run parallel with the horizon without any forefhortening which we may eafily find without perfpective as may be feen in plate xekil fig becaute they may be conveni- ently meafured with pair of compaffes or clfe gueff at we may then well perceive how much eafier this is than where the light is more fronting and the ground-hades confequently run tomewhat oblique and thorten and therefore not menfurable by the compaffes much less to be gueffed at thro their great variety and diffimularity if the objects change their places the ground pades alfo after one runs almoft parallel another more oblique and thorter and others kill more in proportion as they go off from the side whence the light comes as in fig whereby is thewed method for find- ing fuch ground-thades thout trouble or loss of time in what manner foever the light fall as to the frentlight as in fig mult further premife that as in such cafe the ground-fhades go off backwards to we need nothing but the point of sight in order to find them and their fore-fhorten ings can be only found by means of the gradation-line which tho' fmall trouble may be fooner made than read my method is this firft skeich no for my ordonnance fixing my horizon and point of sight at pleafure then begin with the foremoll fig and shade it and ftrike its ground-fhade at random according as fup- pole the light to be little fronting next fet my line where- on are marked the gradation feet on the right side further draw parallelline from the foot of fig to the aforefaid line which thews its distance now in order to exhibit the courfe of its shade lay my ruler to the foot of fig tracing its ground- shade up to the horizon where make uttle star from which star fetch all my other groundshades both fore and off-ones from one side to the other whether figures stones coc now to find the lengths of all thefe ground chades draw again from the end of the groundhade parallel-line to the gradation line then count the degrading feet suppoting the figure feet high and iis ground-hade feer long going feet into the piece as smarked on the gradation line thus may all other objects be managed by ly counting their heights in order to give the depchs of their ground thades accordingly to ses no lights and shades tis now eaty to judge how difficult it would be to find the varia- tion of shadow without fuch line as aforefaid this method has further advantage in affifting thofe who will finith all their figures after the life for by the courfe of the said groundfhades we can prefently know where to place the model or layman with respect to the light of the piece as we have demon- rrared in our drawing-book chap of reffexions in general make this obfervation plain have thought proper to it luftrace it by one or two examples becaute tis one of thofe principal beauties of picture whereby we every where dif corer the malter irs not improper for wearied huntimen or nymphs to reft in shades as in this example plite kxkiil here they fit forwards in the left corner of the piece on green bank againtt wall quite over-run and shaded by the trees on the tops whereof here and there are feen some lmall frong lights the flanding figure receives the frongelf light almoft down to the knees and the remaining part uniting with the ground fhews its diffance the light of this figure has however not to much force as to give the wall behind the fitring figures any reffexion partly becaute those figures are between and partly on account of the roughness of it as being full of breaks holes and projecting branches and leaves which double the shade and admit little or nothing of the reffetting rays of the figure we fee con trarily that the figures fitting over againtt the light object or figure receive without hindrance firong reffexions the one from before the other fomewhat fideways according to their firting either behind forwards or in the middle tis of great moment to thew plainly the true caufe of the faid re- rexions as to diffance colour and force of the colour shall lay this for the diftance have already shewed that were the faid light frgure drel in beautiful light red and frongly lighted by the sun and the four firting ones dreft in purple vellow blue and whice they would certainly be adulterated by the red reffexion and parly lofe their own colours in order to take that of the other and be mixed with ir as for inftance the purple will become red the blne of lights and shades viclet the fellow rulfet or fillemor and the white ap- ple-bloffom of fleth-colour vet some more than others according as they receive faint or flrong reffexions diftant or near moreover the naked will become more warm not all over but in the parts which are tinged by it for the air round about is feen lets or more whe ther in the shade of between it and the part which receives the re fexion the second example in plate xxxiil aforefaid shews the break ing of the shades according to the place as well in colour as force the stone-wall is of ruffet and warm colour the flanding fi- gures dreft in white or light colours are with the stones and ground about them lightened by common light or sun-thine thefe objects hew us that tho the light which comes upon them be pure and unmixed their shades are neverthelefs quite adul- terated becaute they are hidden from the air and furrounded with warm ground and receiving no other light than from the refiexi- ons of the faid ground the colour whereof the shades take we fee the contrary in the undermoft flying figure to wit that the more the objects approach the air the cleaner they become and keen their own colour as appears in the uppermolt figure which is half in the air and not the leall altered in its shade lave that it becomes little more purplith according to its distance which may be vifibly seen in its under-parts and in the loweff flying figure which is flitl in the dark and can not be rouched by the blue of the air being of quite different colour from the uppermoft to wit more warm as are allo the figures which fland below formerly few mafters underfood reffexions especially among the ialians among the french we find some made ufe of them how- ever freely own that fuch of the irations were there but one who obferved them underffood them in perfection and the french but in- differencly tho vouter oot his repuration by them having therein done much more than all the french and iuhans which makes me believe that the reffexions have not been long in praftice fince we yet find many old pieces wherein they are not at all obferved can not but think that at that time they were unknown to them buss what is kill worfe fome as laftman rotenhamer cc did not knoty when an object was in shade on which side it ought to be light or dark wherefore they shaded it like others which were in the light more or less as if it were glazed to much darker for ifflance in piece lighted from the right side you will fomcrimes fee fisure in cc lights and shades the shade of stone or other object now the sharle of this figure imtead of being sn the right side occasioned by the stone they made on the left like all the reft true sign that they knew nothing of re hexions rrphaet himself was not expert in ii for at that time they knew nothing of placing light againt light and dark againt darkness on which occasons the reffcixons come moft to pass whereas they fought the chief effelts and harmony in oppoting light to shade and the contrary and therefore needed no reffexions moreover they avoided all great shades and broadness but now -- days the manage ment is quite different we are for great sbades and what makes an ordonnance look finer than great shades and lights whether build- ings with figures and batsreliefs woody groves or any thing elfe quise in shade agreeably lighted by the reffexions of greands rir or other light objects certainly gives the eyc great satisfaction with respect to pariety and at the fame time produces an agreeable union and tendernets as well in the whole as the parts of picture ne verthelets it fares with riffexions as with all other things superffuity caufes surfeir there are allo fome who to delight in reffexions that they thew them at all adventures and will often exprets almoll imperceptible ones with the greateff force by vermilion ultrama rine red orpiment ccc we find fuch chiefly among the flemings as yordaans rubens and many others we mall take then particular care not to reprefent any reffexions without thewing the reatons of them and how far or near they are to their caules that we may rightly judge what force or weakness they receive or give in word that we need not be obliged to ask wrence the reffexion proceeds why it is red tellow or blue so brong so faint ch ap vi that sunskine has no more force than common light with respect to sbades certain that objects lighted by sun-chine have no darker or fronger shades than thofe in common light tho they seem to have tronger for the blue of the air is lighted more or lets ac cording to the sun ’ strength or weaknels and therefore keeps atways the same tint asi prove by the firtt example in plate xxkiv the of lights and shades column whether plain of ornamented with bats relicts- like the trajas or antenine is fet up in the middle of the field and at diffance from it at the side of the piece an high tower or bulwark the ground-hade whereof above half covers the column wherefore the sup chines powerfully on the upper part only and yet we shall aind the shade from top to bettem of one and the same tint tis the fame with the light of candlein darkith room or in the evening which tho fronger and of more force than the other light yer does not in the leaft darken the shades of the parts on which it comes but lets them remain aliks as we fee in the second ex- ample the lantern in the boy hland lights the objects near it in part when the refidue is lighted by the window we lee then fay that the parts illuminated by the lantern do not become darker in the shade than if the said light were not there and if the dayhappen to be thut in and night approaching it will not only be darker about the said light but all over but its quite the reverse with transparent objetts luch as stufts laballer horn cec for want of the solidity of the preceding objetts as we fee in the third example suppofe that the column either of paper or alabafter receive its light thro small opening either from the sun or candley you will find the shade about the part fo lighted to be more or lets light according to the strength of the light in fuch manner fiat it may be plainly diftinguithed from the other shade whereabout is no licht this obfervation especially prevails in nudities and transparent draperies in nudities lighted by the sun we shall find the small or thin parts to be always more or less transparent as the eyelids nofe ears fingers coc and therefore they muft not have firm shades but tis contrary in stone-face for tho the sun fhine ever fo frong againtt the thinneff parts yet they will not be tranfparent but remain as dark as the thicker and were this face to be painted with beautiful and natural colour it can not be like the life but rather dead per- fon fpeak with respect to tranfparency for we know by experi- ence that the blood being warm is thin and tranparent but when chilly or coagulated it is corporeal or folid wherefore its certain that in this cafe dead perfon is more like stone than natural figure we can plainly perceive this in flaughter ’ oxen when the entrails of lights and shades eotrails are taken out and candle fet within the carcass the breaft and parts between the ribs will be more tranfparent while the fleth is warm than after is cold and has hung loager it is the tame with dead body for if candle be fet behind an ear or next to the nofe they will not be tranfparent the fingle folds of thin draperies appear more tranparent in sun- thine than in common light and have therefore sainter shades than coarfer and more thick veftments but the shades of double banging folds especially when they are clofe together appear in sun-fhine mach bronger than in the fingle folds of thick stufts leaves of trees do the fame the difficulty being thus folved namely that the strength of sun thine or candle do not make the shades darker than they are in common light we fhall to accomplish our purpofe thew wherein the sums strength confifts matter eafily to be apprehended by thofe who have well weighed what has been before faid we find by experience that objects lighted by the sun have much greater force than thofe in common light which is not effected by rrong shades but by their broadness and sharpness which common light does not gize either within doors or in the open air some imagine the strength to be greater in the sun than in common light which can only make objects approach in proportion to their magnitude di= ftance or nearnels as mall life and large life yet fay that common light has this property as well as sun-thine what difference then is there between either no other than in the one broud and sarp sbades and in the other more round and melting ones the former -cautes plain and long ground-shades and the lawer short and uncertain ones hereby we properly dillinguith sun-thine from common light that the one is more forcible than the other is no wonder the proof appearing in the two following examples in plate xxkv better than can express it in words of thefe the firtt is lighted by the sun and the second by common light both alike in darkness of shades the one tharp with long plain groundshades and the other the contrary once painted an emblem or rather narciffus viewing himfelf in the warer cook the light more fronting as tis commonly order ed in sun-thine with an incent only to thew how apprehended sun thine with respect to the melring of the sharpness and alfo to avoid groundhade which childs head near him would have cauted on the cheek of nurciffus the principal in the piece and his left check already of ligbts and shades in shade if the light had come fideways which would have look ’ to very offentive that his view could not have thewn the beauty wherewith he was to much enamoured it was moreover indif- ferent to me whether the light came from side or was more or lets fronting becaute it respects the general delign no more than if it were intirely fronting tis true that large groundhades caufe the greatelt elegance in sun fhine if they come not too clofe together for then they look dilagreeable and caule certain melanchoty in pilture but appear more pleafant when intermixed with gleams of small lights to break their too great breadth call this piece an emblem becaute the poct fays that this vouth feeing his own likeness in the water fell in love with himfelf now this fort of love difcovers vain conceit or weak paffion in man to far clouding his knowledge and judgment that he is infentible of what he is doing for the more natural exprefting which senfe had placed near narciffus child with fools cap fawning on and embracing him and decking his hair virginlike with flowers and to thew the delight he rook in his folly his motion and look bespoke one affected with the reffexion which the child shewed him in the water this piece was richly filled with by-works as figures architec ture bolcage cattle flowers and water with delign to reprefent all the particular objects lighted by the sun each according to its qualiry and in the moll faitable manner.. it was thoroughly finithed by nished undertland when every thing is in it to the moft minute circumftance not when only the principal parts are expreft and ma- ny small circumftances left out or when things are curioutly foft- caed as fome by the word would make us believe be that as it will had not left every thing unfoftened becaute the difference would then have been to great that the piece muft have had too much near- nets fince irs certain that as objects go off they become more uncer- tain the fmall and fubile things luch as fmall folds and features difappear yet the painting might well be faid to be finithed fince very thing was in it that ought to be with respect to its distance had before painted the fame delign for model of that above was laid on flat and not in the leaft loffened whereby the difference between them was very vifible now mult own that foftening is ve- ry alluring and has an apparent distance however we may always perceive that the one has as much force as the other we have before afferted that objects lighted by the sun caute greater force and motion than in common light which fome ima- fine of lights and shades gine proceed oply from the sharpnets of the shades nowg irlis to in some meafure with respect to their broadness but principally for the plainness of the ground hades which the objects caft on each other whereby thingsare often broke and divided in fuch manner as if all ire deable even lix figures in common light will not fometimes give to many pieces as four in sum fune whence we may plainly per- ceive that sampneys grves nearness foftening more and more as the objects go off to that no objects whatever can thew any sharpness un- tys they ire mir becaute of the air interpoling between us and them if this seem strange and unincelligible due inquiry will make it ev dent wherefore fargue that the nearer the objects the more plain and fudden are their shades for as lets hir interpofes between us and the neared to it muit increate in proportion as they go off here it will not be unneceifary to relate particular accident as contirmation of my aftertion have formerly faid that in my vouth made many deligns in watercolours now had one time among others painted one which by reafon of its farved and hard penciting fo diiliked that purpoted to try to give it better face tho were to tpoil it inirely firt irried it with the glare of an esg which not fucceeding fixed it on paftboard and made brim of wax round it then poured clear ifinglats on it and let it dry by which means the painting became as neat and toff as poffible and thewing it to one of my incimates he was to furprized that he could hardly believe it to be the fame piece be caufe the body of the kinglats had taken away the aforefaid hun griness and hardness but afterwards on inquiring into the na- tures of things this experiment appeared not firange or wonderful to he by this occurrence would intimate that mill or hir takes away all shargness making things gross and rough feem light and fmooth like vernith or gluegloffing every thing in nature before our eyes touching objects lighted by the sun they can not by means of rrong and dark shades and with tellowisness only look natural or fim- ay becaute there is no difference between this and other lights with respect to force mean in objectslets than the life the sharp- nets of broad shades and the forms of ground-shades with the co lour of the light and their rellexions how weak foever can natu rally effect it but objects as big as the life are beyond our power if they were only to confift in force now fome may paffibly fay that then it is the better to be represented in little to which mull antwer of lights and shades that then the painting would not go off in proportion fick to the frame of which we shall fay more in another place chap vil of the ground-spades in sunshine certain that the groundfhades in sun-fhine which contribate much to the decorum of picture confiff not only of length broadness and sharpnels but in conformity with the objects which caufe them whether pillar pyramid square coc the ground-sbade of an upright flanding figure falling on the ground or any thing elfe must be perfertly seen even to much that tho the said object were not feen or were hid behind fomething yet we may judge by its ground-hade what shape it has which is one of the principal tokens of sun-thine some think this no great matter and that when they have ftruck on the ground long stripe of certain breadth that is fufficient without shewing whether it be the shadow of pillar or man speaking of this can not omit mentioning blunder of certain great mafter he had reprefented st. francis in the wildernels on his knees at praver with extended arms before crucifix as he is generally exhibited the piece in itfelf was very fine but cafting my eyes on the crucifix which was compofed of small twigs of trees perceived that it made diffinct shade of the whole on the ground tho was almoft balf in the shade of the saint but what more furprifed me was that his body with the arms in the same po fition as the crucifix but ten times bigger did not caf like sbade on the ground but the shade of mass or block without arms now we have faid before that tho figure or other object be hidden behind fomeching yet we can judge by the groundshade what shape or form it bas as shall thew in few words for inftance place perfon in palace or apartment behind pillar or the like and let him be lighted by the sun his shape will plainly be feen on the ground by his shadow again would you introduce into landskip pyramid tower of bulwark which is not there it may be done by means of the ground hade when it falls into the piece from the side of the light whereby the objects and every thing be longing to them will be plainly vifible no lights and sbades book ingeious pritters of sun frine have still an fidvantage above others that they need not make any high trees hills or buildings in order to create here or there large groundfhades for bringing forwards fore-objects and flinging off hinder ones they order their shades where they think proper and can always fupport their fo doing with reafons becaute we often fee in sun-fhine fmall driving cloud shadow whole piece of ground and another ground shall be light again and to feveral behind one another thus they can divide field at pleafure into lights and shades in order to thew things greeably have with great attention obferved the colour and shades of the suns light and found especially in the month of september bout er in the afternoon when the sun is ftrongeft that the sky has clear blue colour intermixed with small driving clouds as for the objects when the sun chines flrong they appear as if heighten ed with red orpiment and whire and the shades reddith grey as white black and little brown red mixt together not uniting with the blue as in common light as some imagine but becoming gradu- ally liitle more violet and growing famter towards the horizon where no blue is to be feen the treeson the fore and second grounds appear finely green the blue of the objects is greenith the red is orange colonr the violet ruffet and thus all the colours in pro- portion deep ltater thone on becomes greenith grey this exact obfervation agreed perfectly with what had formerly experiment ed in bright sun-thine by means of fmall hole in the window of darkened room by which faw naturally on the white wall as on paper the reffexion of every thing that was moving without- doors but let us proceed further to confider whether mit chapen shadows do not make objects unintelligible beaury in general fublifting either in figures landship of other objects exhibius all things plain and diftinct in their shapes and forms without dimination or breaking then for things contrary to each other can not poffibly raife an agreeable beauty in our eyes nor convey to the sentes true idea of their forms unless by medium confifting of second or middle tinr which unites the two contrary parts namely light and shade when they come too sharp on each other thereby to foften the de- formity on the objefts and to unite them fpeak of things which are the broud which makes round objelts inflead of look ing relieved feem quare or angutar as if in sun-fhine where fore of lights and shades they appear not beautiful but mif hapen and the reafon is plain people are not fenlible of any other deroram than what oc- cors to their eyes for its certain that things alter by the leall accident whether of unufral lights or shades which make them frange and unkhown let fome boatt that is broad and the bett manner maintain that tho it were sun-thine it is all one and the fame and if we are to fpeak of what is agreeable and perfect that it ought to be known that pitture with common light is the most perfect light which fiews as more exactly and plain the pre- per forms of objects what is round remaining fo and the square alrer- ing not as for the mifhapes of things exhibited in san-thine we have fufficiently thewed them as alfo that the sharpnets of deformed shades spbils ifie true propercy of the objects for inftance fuppofe two flanding figures talking together are lighted by the sun if now the one call shade on the other to as half to cover his face we need not doubt but he will becomelels known even where he parent in arcbiteffure or mouldings it happens as bad becaute the ofen- five sharpness of the shades distigures and confules their form and neat- rets at once think it therefore sign of pufillanimity not to fay cowardice in landskip-painter always to make choice of sunfhine which is certainly but fmall part of his arc as if an architect were to be continually imployed about cheff or box flower-painter about cattle-painter about cow or sheep still-life pain- ter about scull or hourglass sea-painter about sloop or boat of statuary about crucifix he is no hiffory-painter who al ways repreients an herodins with st. john ’ head in charger or rabbing herfelf or tael with an hammer or st. toon with lamb all which are but particular incidents which fcarce de- ferve name an arriff therefore mult not be afraid to exhibit every thing that can be repretented with every sort of light but the opinion of molt paincers of sun chine is as ridiculous as that of thote who always practife common light boch proceeding from millake or ignorance whereby they can not rightly judge of things diftering from what they have been always uted to now their judg ment is only conclution agreeing with their apprehcations in poilt which they precend to undertland and which therefore ought to be thus and thus when yet it certain that before we can judge of things we ought firft to inquire into them and by comparifon between boib to observe wherein they differ dd lights and shades book sun fhine is not to proper for hiftory as for landskip and ar- chirelture arifes from heace that on fuch occafions it is obftructing and appears hard and unpleafant by reafon of the sharpnets of the shades and ground hades as we have before incimated neverthelets if the matter require it it muft be uled yet with fuch caution that no mit chapen ground pades appear to obttrult the sight or create an averfion but if sun fhine were the beft and moff advantageous light face- painters would certainly ule no other of which to this day we have not one inftance becaute firft the colours do not fhew themfelves in that light to be what they really are secondly becaule is impoffible that either man woman or child can without trouble and an alteration of countenance especially dour the eyes and mouth fir any time with their faces in the sun thirdly becaufe the sunnever flands sill but is always altering fourthly becaule the sweetnets of the features would thereby be poiledatonce and laftly becaufe it would be very improper to hang fuch pictures in roomout of which the sun is kept ii would be ridiculous and abfurd to fay of woman that the is unlike man unlets they to refemble that we can fee no difference be tween them for as the woman is like woman and the man like man to there muft needs follow one of thefe conclutions to wit that he can not or will not beeir we could add third as contempt of the woman namely that the is not incirely like man but this laff which arrends moft people judgments is moft ridiculous and to be especially thunn ’ by thofe of right apprehention as being often the source of hatred and envy and even ruin as experience daily thews in those who thro prepolfeffion defpife every thing that difagree able to their work and fancy shall not enlarge on this point but keep to my purpofe of thew- ing the prepoffetfion of sun-thine- painters as well as others and to be the becter underftood premife that there are three things wherein the whole matter contifts and which we muft firft fix and diflindly ob ferve namely sunshine common light and faint light which differ from each other as much in fact as name the firft is grong and shurp the second bread but not sharp and the third faint and mekting the firft caufes di hintt groundshades the second makes melting ones and the third faint ones the of lights and shades chap firfl receives irs colour from the sun the second from the cloads and the third from the blse of the sky we will fubjoin that the firft may be confidered as man the fe- cond as woman and the third as child who will now fay that the child is not good becaule is not to lut ty frong and bright as the father or mother or that the woman is not fo becaute the is not intirely like man obferve then how thefe unthinking sun fhine painters judge further of the second and third lights it is not broad fay they whereby weare to underfland that tis not fo funny and charp in shades as in their paintings broad broad they fpeak to their difciples in to low tone that no stranger muft hear it as if it were secret unknown to the very art lis faid that the good pbilemon was to bigorted to things having broad lights and shades that he never painted other than sun or moon-light-pieces which he evidenced in exercing his whole force to reprelent tupiter with ffemena where they are both seen going to bed and yet the sun thines to bright into the room that you might count all the squares of the window on the floor poor tupiter how violently are you dealt withl dares phabus con- trary to your express cemmands peep thro the windows the you charg- ed him to bide for three days and three nights but what signifies that thinks the painter the painting muft be broad and the sumshine muft be there were it midnight had he made moonlight it would have fitted that seaton but it fares with fuch artifts as it did with one who was fo fond of painting oranges that he never made piece without one this zea- lot having made interelt to paint the battle of pavia asked his im ployer whether there should not be an orange in it hew should tbat come to pass fays the gentleman topass or not replied the painter let me alone for that the other laughed and not dreaming he would put one in aftertalking of other things faid at parting—do asyou think beft the poor man glad of the authority was looking in his picture for place for the orange but fearful if he placed to fine fruiton the ground it might be trampled on by the horfes he con- trived small square stone in corner of the painting and fet thereon in pewter-plate an orange as big as the life and very naturally done this innoceat wretch for luch deferve not the name of pain- ters gives us to underfland that what we can do beft is beft whetber it be proper or not ie of-lights und sbades book is conftant maxim that things witbeat sanstim finely paint- ed and with proper lights and shades muft needs be good without it any how do the word brord which they abute by incroducing not think then true arcifts that the pieces which are not proad are not as good as those lighted by the sun moon and candle ch ap viil how sanskine is to be represented in piece boving common lighr h propoficien may peffibly feem flrange to fome and per- haps feint but is in fact to far from it or being tritle that tis matter of moment and founded on good reaforns we take ir for granted that the sun differs in force from other lights and is tint lighter weather abounding with driving we often fee in changeable cfouds that the sun is obfcured by very thin and hanging airy va- dours in fuch aianner that whole tralts of land howles hills cc even whole woods are over-fhadowed which shades however are thin and exhibit all the objects more or lets plain than in com- mon light but let us come to the point which is to reprefent in common- light-piece sun-fhine with one and the fame force of colonrs each in its degree without impedimet to each other mean when the sun is not forward or in the front of the picture or is not too much fpread which would thereby feem too flaring to do it therefore according to the rules of rt divide for in ftance landskip into four grounds of which let the firft be whire and the three others diminithing in proportion let the fecond whire ground ferve for the sun-fhine now tis plain that as the common light on the fore ground alrerdy pefeffes the force of the coloars it muft needs follow that the sunffune which is one iint lighter as before faid and has no other force than the fame white can alfo have no nearer place than that of the fecond ground plain proof that if it be placed on the third ground ir will dit for to much more in force now in order to diftingwith the ditte rence between this light on the second ground and that on the firfl and to reprefent it narurally we ought to exhibit the shades and ground shades of the objects parp broud and long whereby we may per of lishss and shades di perceive that this is sunlight and the other with dall and pert groundshades to thew that it commen light but the better to con ceive the nature of sun-light obferve its colour in the morning and evening to aid thofe who may not prefencly underlland what have faid thall lay down fhort method of management in certain and ealy manner having sketch ’ your delign and fetiled the parts which you would have enlightened by the sun dead colour it neatly as if it were to be throughout common light but in the fecond colouring you mult fomawber mere beighten the parts which are lighted by the sun whether whiter more yellow or more ruffet according as you would have them and to as to perceive visible diference the shades allo to he mere diffint and bread without making them glowing except here and there in the reffexions now if on the fore ground or about it there be no white we have an opportunity to throw here and there on it some sunrays by the force of white fellow or ruflet according as the suns colour then appears which could not be done if we had before laid the suns force in the offskip here let it be obferved that if we enlighten some forward objects by the rays aforefaid they ought not to be of ligbt and bright-co- loured marrer fuch as whice marble or light free ftone very light draperies or beautiful carnations but of fuch tints as appear dark in common light becaute thefe frongly heightened with the sun- like whice will teech out the same light now to finith the work with certainty and to find with eate the proper tints of objects lighted by the sun proceed thus tem- per your white with red or yellow orpiment more or less tellow as you would reprefent the sun early or late then inflead of pure white mix it with your light firff tints of all the objects which are lighted by the sun whereupon you will find each colour to be broke according as its qvality or force with respect to its body dif- fers much or little from the reft thus the work will have the de- tired effect as experience the daughber of irath can reftity chap book of lights and shades chap ix that the sbades of objects in sunshine are not more glowing than in common light ny are fuch strangers to the truth of things and to iide enquire inco them that to retain their groundless ha- bits they flight reafons and maintain their erroys this is evident from their univerfal opinion that the shades aff objects are more glowing in sim-hine than in common light which intirely deay but that the shades and reffexions become lighter and lighter in proporton as the sun chines rronger is true that the suns light is more glowing than common one is indif putable for as the suns light is more or less vellow or red tis natural that every thing he thines on should partake of the same colour not only in lights burallo in the shades which receive the reffexions of the grounds and other near objects but as there are no objects what firong reffexions foever they receive which do not here and there preferve some un reffected shades as when one object is covered by the ground-lhade of another to the said shades ought fince they have no communication with the sun or his reffexions and are of another na- ture to be moregrey like thofe in common light as receiving no co. lour bit what the airgives them hereby think we can beft diffinguith between sum thine and com- mon light wherefore is ftrange that people who commonly feek shades for the sake of coolness will notwichttanding hove them warm tis therefore no wonder to find to few winter-painters have teen winter-pieces of brengel as warmly coloured as if for midsummer even the very lee and snow as glowing tho in winter all things re- ceive light refiexions and have little of no shade the ground-fhades are lighrith and blue and yet every thing has it diftance and going off tho fome contrarily make their off-fhades as warm as the for ward ones for this reafon tis neceftary for the artiff fometimes to exercile himself in sun-fhine and make due obfervations on the narure of it not making it his conflant praltice but particular and agreeable study if he can not be perfect in it he ought at leaft to know as much of it as of common light in order to ule in his works fomerimes the one fometimes the other as occation requires some think becaute of the of lights and sbades the broadness that sun-thine is more eafy than common light but it is not fo lince think it as difficult for sun-thine painter to repre feat common light as common light painter to exhibit sunchine with respect to nacuralness many perhaps may differ from me in opinion becaufe in sun fhine the groundshades are diffintt and li- mited whence they deduce this argument that in piece lighted intirely from side and the sun having meridian alcirude the groundfhades of all the objects appear third lets than their full length and therefore they may be correctly meafured by the com pafles each in proportion to its length on to the offship which willingly grant and to which will fay further in their favour that is to be practifed not only when the grounds are level and horizon tal but likewife in up and down grounds where the compalies are utelets if the ground drip the groundffades will do the fame does itrife they do to too as the knowing in perspective well underfland thus far fay they are in the right but fuppofe it thould happen that the piece be lighted from within or from without is it not thes as uncertain as in common light and becaute the compaffes are ufe less much more troublefome to find the shades and ground hades and their enlargements forwards and offdiminations which ought to be as fentible as the sun is either off or forward contrarily how ealy is it in common light where they are small and dull the task is therefore not to ealy as fome imagine who endeavour only to re- prefent right or lett fide thade to reprefent the sun in all pofitions is quite another thing and there are few fuch painters for we do not eafily find sunthine-painter meddle with common light but contrarily that commonlight painter will fometimes practife sum thine and the reafon is plain the common light takes in every thing wherefore he who underflands this well can eafily give inco sun-thinc the point is only that sun-fhine is warm in the lights but not in the shades as fome imagine now it fometimes happens that two pieces sun fhine and common light hang together both having the utmoll force of co- louring and to alike as hardly to diflinguily the sun-thine the lights being in both alike and broad for fince the word broad is come into fathion some will paint bread whether it be sun-thine or not as well within doors as without moreover the lights and shades warm what now is to be done when two fuch pictures muft hang together in order to diftinguish the sun fhine nothing edia verily than to abate the strength of the one fomewhat and heighten the force of the no ther lights and shades book ther not by making the shades darker but by more warm and bright light with long and diffinet ground shades not only broad but barg underfland here that the common light piece ought not to be inferior in goodness in its kind but not broadlighted or sha- ded unlets the caule plainly appears bur we feldom fee too fuch piecestogether done by the fame mafter becaute moll painters make but one of the kinds their bufiness and if it once happen yet they do not think the one ought to be lighter than the other and if they are done by two different hands each mafter endeavours to make the colours anfver his own inclination thus it happens that the sun fhine painters are in little concern bout it for they think — are my objefts to appear by the force of light will by the strength of fiery shades maintain the superierity we have faid before that in proportion to the suns strength the reffexions become lighter the reafon whereof we shall now explain we find when the sun is low and the objects are firongly lighted that they receive flrenger reffexions from each other becaute the suns rays fall not obliquely and glancing on the objects and thofe on others dut ffrike directly upon them and return reffexions contrarily when the sun is high the reffections of the lighted objects can not touch the others with fuch force becaute the reffexion of the light mutt heeds revert to iis origin for inftance if in an high light two men fland in difcourfe and the one receive the sun on his breaft and the other on his back the light which falls from on high on the breall muff needs reflect again upwards whence it came and therefore pats over the others head to that the former figure can thereby receive hone of but very weak and almoff imperceptible reffexion thus think to have thewn that reffexions in sun-thine ought to be reprefented much fronger than in common light the proof of which may be deduced from the life itfelf chap of the difference of ground shades preceeding either from the sun or radial point piste xxxvl the firft example thews the suhs place of quarter which obferve as eafl and opposite to it in the wel is building which is lighted throughout from the eall not rays proceeding from point and growing wider but by fuch as lights and shades chap parallel to each other mean not from the ceater of an affigned sun at the side of the piece but from the whole quarter wherein the sun is or from the whole side of the piece as wide as the opening thro' which he thines into it the second example thews the contrary to be falfe when the sun being directly behind the objects the groundhades are not ferch ’ from the radial but another point for if this were good it mult follow that when the sun fhines di- rectly thro the middle of street he would enlighten both sides of it which is contrary to nature and to what we have shewed before and in the third example tis plainly vifible that when the sun is in the eall and the room in the well the objelts on the ground muft needs be lighted directly from behind as well the one as the other without the leaff difference which their ground-thades and the lines of the floor fufficienly thew both proceeding from the point of sight and the latter shewing us the eall and weff through the whole room the fourth example in plate kkkvil affirms the fame repre fenting southern colonade lighted direct by the sun which is in the oppofite point of which bunding each column throughout calls its shade againtt the pillar behind it not proceeding from point but by parallels according to the rules of perspective the fitth example contrarily thews great miltake which yet is often committed in making the ground-shades proceed from an aftirned point each column feeming to caufe particular ground shade which is against rule and the nature of sun-fhine it will not be amiss to fay fomething here of the light of grounds to wit that in what manner foever the light comes whether from behind fideways or fronting the plan or ground will always appear alike that is in the front of the piece the moft light be the sun ever to low nay on the horizon and not only the flat grounds but every thing that receives light the reafon whereof is to evi- dent that it would be superfluous to fay any thing more about it than whats shewn in the fixth example of fide froming and backward light which perspective fufficiently jultifies if some think that when the light comes from behind or fide the ground mult be lighted otherwife than fronting for many keep it always moft light on the side whence the light proceeds allow it with respect to candle or torch but peaking of the air muf lay ligbts and shades book fay they do nor at all underfland the mitter indeed it would not be very improper in ground running off from the light but level floors or grounds can not admit of diminution were they if may tay fo thouland sceps long nay the ground will always be moft figbt forwards without any difference let the light come from be- hind or forwards think no arriff will be to foff as to ask how then it shall appear whence the light comes since tis general rule that the shades and ground-hades of the objects plainty thew ii and in cafe there were no objects on the ground the air if there be but the leaff cloud will make it fufficiently apparent ch ap xi of the representation of different lights in the same piece think ir impoffible for different lights in the same piece to look well for fay they if it were good raphact caracer tition pouffin and other great mafters would not have rejected but approved that manner even the french hcademy which is arriv- ed at to high pirch unanimoutly agrees that no more than fingle ligbt is necelfary and rejects picture which has more wherefore they judge that double lights are only the inventions of dutch maf fers who do not underfland the antigue but only follow nature in order to pleafe ignorants to all which antwer that tho rappact poxfrm and other great mafters have not thewed it in their works but only kept fingle and common light we muff not infer from thence that they defpited or rejected that manner as contrary to na- ture but they neither thought nor knew it art not being in their times got to its perfection in this particular ver do not fay that piece with different lights is better than one fingle-lighted if naw rally reprefented mean only that if it to fall outand be judiciouly managed it gives painting diverfifying elegance believe many common painters will not much thank me for dit clofing this matter becaute should lovers defire fuch piece they would have more trouble in doing it however ler every man do what he will or can it fares with our art as with others if man will learn all thars neceitary to become good mafter he may do to or if he be content with half-inquiries no body will call him in croftion for ir but he who is able to repretent fingle light well majs of lights and shades in my opinion alfo do the others well how many brave malters furmount every thing they undertake what should hinder their exhibiting three or four lights as well as one but let me not here approve the manner of some landskip-painters who introduce many small lights into piece fond conceit without any bafis thought it proper to handle this marter of different lights to thew that we ought not to regard the partial opinions of ignorants but always chule what is moft natural and agreeable mean that we should enrich our ordonnances in general according to occation and without affectation for which purpofe we shall here exhibit an ex- ample with different lights plate xxkvill in expeltation to hear what difficulties some will raife againt

sun much higher and little fainter yet herein thewed to much more conduct on making the woman and boy who are looking at an huntlman founding his horn over the wall whom the man coming out of the gare thews them pur their hands over their eyes as nature teaches when the other who had repretented the sun much sronger had not taken any notice of that cir- cumflance the firft placed man before the tree sleeping in the sun the second contrarily had placed him in shade behind the tree and tome other people were fitting in repofe againtt the wall in shade to avoid the sun heat the third had made delign of his own fee plate xll to thew his nice obfervations on the sun which the others as counting him filly at firft laught at he had reprefented naked boy firting in an open window and making bubbles with pipe the child received his light forward from the common light of the room thro the window appeared the tops of fome houfes and part of column with sun-dial affixed to to now on nice examination it appeared that this latt had bett bellowed his thoughts on the sun and that neither of the others had thewn to many good effects in their pieces as he in to small compats for firft he exhibited the colour of sun-fhine in the sky and on the tops of the houles fufficiently differing from the common light secondly is not enough to reprefent the sun ftrong or weak or with long or thort ground-hades but we mult allo fee by the ground-hades bow late it is wherefore he had incroduced the sun- dial the ground-fhade whereof was on thirdly he had obferved the dubiousness of the edgy obietts going off and lattly to shew that we can not bear the sun ’ exceffive brightness without doors he had placed the child in the window in the common light of the room that he might with more liberty rare about at the bubbles than he could in the bright open air thus he juftified the condult of him of lxtts end sbades him who had made his fignies fhading their eyes and advifed the ocher to give his figures thote of an eagle faid to be the only bird which can look againt the sun the others owned themfelves convin by theie natural obtervations ced with excute that they laughed not at his skill but his choice which ar firff feemed odd to them ch xiil of the suns three qualities we ought not only to view as far as we are able the won ders of narure but allo to reprefent their likeness so we shall now make our obfervations about the moft beautiful of things wtho can be infentible of the three qualities of the sun viz his splender hest and colour can any light exceed the sun in bright nets and clearnels or any fire be more invigorating or confuming or ant colour have greater power the sunbeams fays certain poet penetrate the depth of the sea and render the fundy grounds ligbt imperceptible things sensible cc what light can effect what this does it is faid that lightening can blind the eyes tho this be rather cauted by its suddenness than its light as for the sun ’ hear ovid tells us that phacton being of an am- bitious temper infortuned his father to let him drive the chariot of the sun which regset bring granted and the herses proving tso bead sirong and be ignerant of the course driving out of the way thereby fet the erber rirc the gold in the river tagus was seen flowing along this poverful light inflamed the eatern countries as ethiopia lybis esc in such manner as to make the inhabitants black as we fee them at this dry the lakes rivers and fountains beiled away even the sey berame fandy valley he who would know more mult confult aato himself ir is faid that the rolling and frightful noife of the thunder will which is not improbable fince the pene- mell metals in an instant trating power has great effect upon them two flints by col lition will produce fire even two pieces of wood will by frilli- nature on do the fame tho in themfelves of cold in of lights and shades chap relation to the third quality the poet proceeds thus phabus lays he in his light hair and sitting in glittering ckarict befet with carbuncles gilds all things be shines on with gellowip colour what light has juch brightness and beautiful colour what salt- fetre brimsone or other combultible matter canreach so far and spread from eal to weft the white moon and sparkling stars nay the fulden lightnings themselves are all weak and faint if compared with the absolute beanty and splender of his lively colour therefore very much wonder that fuch an ignorant can be found as met with about gor years ago even he who fat up for great mafter plainly afferred that the sun is blue may asure bluc was there ever harboured more abfurd opinion than one which makes the moft trankcendent brightnels and most penetraring object the weskgr since every one knows blse

main lights are whitish blae and the reffexions gellow and searm thus fays he we mut reason about all colours lighted by the sun think this the blueft policion that can be for in painting the sun and all other objects after this manner could there be more ridiculous picture how green yellow blue and sported would it appear — but many are fond of party-colouring we shall give here delcription of one of this mafter pictures work as frivolous as his judgment about the sun in this piece he had reprefented vulcan hammering piece of iron foot long one half whereof was red hot and the other he held in his hand he had allo exhibired finus with the fame precaution fitting ftarknaked and unconcern ’ in the midlt of the sparks now are not thefe fine thoughts and worthy of reprefentation does he not feem to fay— this hon is not beated by the fire bus painted of glowing colour and indeed he thews it plainly for the pincers which futean ought to hold the lron by lie by him on the ground moreover he was foolith enough to paint fire againtt an hanging but why do we wonder ar that why should he not do it since painted fire can not burn we might fuppole him as wile no ligbts and shades as the man who fer piece of lee to dry in the sun that it might not wer his back in carrving home to find fuch wreckes among mean people is truly no wonder dir among painiers and such as fer up for great mafters

is in proportion to his nearnels to or distance from them fo we know that the heat or coldnels of each of lights and shades climate is thereby cauted and the sun feels hotter in one place than another since we are treating of the sun we shall allo thew how the poetic expreftions defcribing him are to be underfood poisy and painting being siffers agree intirely and tho fables and filtions be not thought necellary for painter yet they are delight- ing and uleful and we can not be good painters without fome aid from poily we may make ule of poetic thoughts as far as the hillo- ry whether facred or profane will admit and as the nature of thing can be thereby exprefied how can the morning noon even- ing and night be more elegantly reprefented than homer does it in some palfages of his works among othe at the end of his odiffee where he lays — all objects appear in the morning at the down of aurera dark and afterwards the imperceptible growing light dif- tinguishes and gives them their natural colours.— thus he as to the beginning of day and elfewhere of the morning and evening he has it — as when phebus fatigued hides in theriss lap cc he lays further — aurora the day-break and

the fame time befpoke ano ther piece the subject whereof should have from his son then new ly arrived from indid accordingly the son defcribed to me certain place in india where he had lived generally inhabited by blacks except the governow himfelf of lights and shades and some others he instructed me in feveral particulars as well manners as dress and other things proper to the country all which fet down and then made rough sketch of it with pen in his prefence in which he faid had rightly taken his meaning this being done fell to colouring it in hopes thereby to get his future favour which did the young gentleman affairs in the mean time calling him out of town for three weeks his father on his return had meeting of some friends and on that occafion fent for the picture which was finithed and at the fame time defired my company the piece was inflantly hung up and after the gentle- man had little viewed it he took me by the hand and whifpered tis very well done but forget to tell you one these words thing of great moment yet you can alter it in half an hour time to be short had taken the sun too lew and alto made him fall into the piece pilcreys which occationed long

he muft needs be acquainted with the nature of the climate but his faying sw calily the fault might be rectified reminded me of the cale of apelles and thought — ne suter uttra crepidus becaute he thereby difcovered his ignorance for rubbing out the ground-thades would not in the leall have better ’ it and to enlighten the figures from on high would be more work than to begin new picture neverthelels he taught me to make my advantage of it in time to come chap xv of the suns light upon objects at rising and setting is unaccountable in many artifts who handie an art whole the ory is built on mathematies its practice on experience and the execution on ature that they take to litle notice of the three points wherein lies their honour especially in the lighting of objetts in suriet for the sun bow fow feever can not sine on ary of lights and shades any obiett anter the paraliels namelv not in the leaft from underneath aere the object if may fay fo as high as the clouds and yet we fee manr paintings wherein the objects are by sun-fer more lighted from unternenb ton which is contrary to nature as we may dailr experience in walking againt the sun how troublefome it is to thate the eves he rum our heads lideways or hold an hand ferchief before our eves even the hat is no defence and yet the sun never takes it uneernen this may be plainly evilenced by perspertive to wit that as the honzon limts our eight and the sun can not with respect to the exe delrend lower therefore he can not find his rays upwards but long the grckel or faral thefe rars isen in their pallage unless you pull your hat over eves mut needs ihine into them even dare to lay that were the brim of your hat ren acres broad and parallel with the hori- it ould not call shade of pins breadth over your eyes nor the sun to much as take the under parts of the brim tho we were flanding on an eminence bur to be the better underftood let us confider plate xl.ll where on the fore-ground place figure with board on its head like the americans lerel with the eye-brows next we fee an high building with projecting cornice running towards the point of sight and on the other side an high column with figure on it having fuch board on its head as the other now you may perceive that the sun does not prite underneath againtt it but fends his rays parat fet mean when he is fetring draw then ray from the sun pa- rallel with the board of the fore-igure and fee how much shade its eves will have ferch another ray from the front or cornice to the suns center to find how much shade the projecture will throw on the frize do the same by the figure on the column then you will perceive that the joints of the scones in the building will be parallel with the suns rays and that the offcorner of it tho lower than the nearone will yer be alike with the nearone and the frize pa- rallel with the ground ifit be objected that when we he out at window the sun is lower than the window-board we lean on and does not fhine on it antwer that we only imagine so for if we rightly obferve we shall perceive small groundshade of the crosspiece of the window tho' ever to faint wherefore we are enabled to conclude that as long as the sun chines nay if but finger breadth above the horizon the ground of lights and shades chap muft receive some light and of contequence as long as the ground is somewhat lighted it is impoffible for the sun to thine on any thing from underneath suppole for inflance column fix feet high lighted by sunfet if this column throw any vilible shade on the ground the ground mult have fome light and if to how is it pollible that the sun should fhine from above and from underneath at the same timel and if it be granted that the sun does not light the column on top irs ground-hade muft needs be infinite in which cafe the capital ought juft to be lighted from underneath and the ground of neceffity to be without light this is an un- deniable truth though the point be little handled by writers even feldom heeded by mafters tis allo no wonder to fee some fail in it the moft probable reafon for which as think is their ignerance in perspective ap xvi of the application of sun shine and other lights is an old and rooted evil and thereby almoff become law rather to gratify our fancies and paltions than confult reafon molt painters verify this in their choices and ufes to represent sun-shine fay they is pleafant and delights the eye therefore we must always introduce it but this can not be fince the varieties of the seafons and change in all things vifible demonftrace the con- trary this light is indeed very agreeable in landskip but very differviceable within doers for how ridiculous in great encertain- ment would sun-thine appear on the table and how could the guelts fee one another or how could the glitter of the plate be ex- prefted without obicuring every thing elfe what fine piece would that be where the whice tablecloth mult be mixed with black and how agreeable would it look to fee the ground-thades of the window-frames and squares expreited on the table and floor sun thine is not always proper and yet some will not give themfelves time to think whether the subject require it or not in chrift crucifiaion it is improper becaute the scriptures men- tion the sun to be hidden the better to explain my meaning shall exhibit three different lights in as many

nacures effects and qualities yet to finith this head we shall here lubjoin some particulars which could not before have place a lights and shades chap for the sun my opinion is that he can not be represented in any picture firft becaute the eye is too weak to behold him and there- fore his force can not be expreffed otherwife than by making all objects dark and black secondly becaute when he thines directly in our faces we can not perceive the right shapeor colour of things unlets we shade the eyes as nature teaches for the fame reafon think we may not reprefent burning can- dle torch or other matter giving great light unlets we allo ex- hibit the objects as this light makes them appear to us and not as by their colour stir and uunion they really are for the further from the candle the more faint they become tis therefore folly to raintain that the natural force of candle light especially it the flame be feen can be imitated fince it is paff our skill to give the other work its due appearance for when the light of the candle thines in our faces the mot deep and dark colours even black it felf appear neither darker nor blacker than they would in dark dav but we shall afterwards treat more largely of thefe lights and there- fore now proceed to lay that thofe who love to paint sunshine may obferve that tis pro per for sacrifices combars bacchanals dancings sports of herdf- men and fundry other jovial occurrences and hiffories which require great buffle but very improper and oblirulting in councils pleadings en tertainments acadenies wedding-ceremonies and other such circumstances but cloadlight gives an uncommon decorum and nacuralness in solemn afairs such as affemblies of magiftrates pleadings and other buss ness of authority and consequence the third of the lights of which we have fpoken the terch or candle is proper for mournful occasons for dying persons burials and such like elpecially in the open air the sun appears agreeable and delightful in the open field when thro thick buthes and trees his rays here and there light the grounds and the people are feen repoling or diverting in the shade bur he acts againtt nature who exhibits tender and beautiful virgins basking in funthing field faring at the sun and talking and be- holding each other with as little concern as if it were but candle or star-light fince he himfelf would leave their company and retire t shade to prevent any miftakes of which kind let us defcribe the chief fimes of the day lights and shades day-break this firft born time of the day favours the enterprizes of great

uncommon agreeablenets and decorum the morning this time principally rejoices nisture even inanimate things are fentible of it the glittering light takes the tops of high mountains and cautes both in

which bind the parts of things fo well together intirely to pleafe the eye of the knowing at this time the herthens offered their sacrifices and we read in the books of mofes that the children of

mforning as was likewife chrif in fordin the persuns moreover honoured the morning by their oferings wherefore we ought to have due regard to the time of day on all fuch occafions and take especial care that the light fall on the principal object and place according to poufins con duct in picture of cbrif refering the blind to sight wherein the greatell and flrongel light is intirely pread over

especially feeing they are not new inventions but corrections of oid mittakes as think shall prove tuppole then that ts grots error to reprefent the moon tiss the life becaute how diftant foever the be we nevertheless fee her like the sun alears retain ber natural bigness and if this be granted the concrary muit be unnatural and therefore forbidden to paiter who is the imirater of true nuture had mind to paint moon skine would without injury to nature manage it as have before faid would reprefent the sun that is to exhibit her shine but not her body for the light is of great or moment is picture than the bodies of either the sun moon or lighting my objects thereby either from behind fideways or forwards and as well in figures as landskip somewhat darker than the duylght that it may appear true moen-light and not sun-thine which it very much affects by its fudden lights and tharp ground-shades making the blue sky here and there with some glittering stars and to make ir fill look more natural we may if the subject permit introduce up and down torches or other lights burning piles of wood offerings or other fires as occafion requires and thereby mate the lights the sirenger and the colouring ruffet and more jellow yet the shades not to lights and shades so harp as those of the meon this would in my opinion have fine effect especially if the faid accidental lights were moftly ordered in dark places but we ought principally to obferve that in the whole there muft be feen more darkness than light and that no colours ap- pear to beautiful as thofe of the sky in reference to the moon unless they be red yellow and fuch others as are peculiar to burning lights as we have thewed in the firtt chapter of the fourth book for light red and yellow become dark the moon ’ brightness contrarily makes dark blue and sea-green appear lighter but black keeps its poft wherefore little light red and as little dark blue ought to be feen in the picture by fuch difpofition we gain two advantages natural light an uncommon variery in the colours if any one find any difficulty herein he may pleafe to know that he is no more obliged to exhibit the moon than the sun in his piece becaute the former takes it courfe round the heavens as well as the latter and may therefore be placed as the elegance of the figures and by-works require fince both illuminace the earth and its objects forwards backwards and fidewife as to quality in three particulars the moon is to like the sun that there is no difference between them as she always throws her rays parallel as well as he all that is lighted by her is broad and tharp the shades on the ground are plain and conform with the objects but the reffexions are not to hrong as in sun-thine be- caule the moon light is weaker than the suns by reafon of the oppofite natures of thofe two luminaries the one being warm and the other cold and as the moon receives her light from the sun the canthere- fore not have to much power to impart it to the earth nor the objects lighted by her appear to diffind to the eyc again as the sun often alters his colour by means of the vapours which he exhales to we lind the fame in the moon who by the fame means becomes alfomore pale or yellow in proportion to the vapours about her or the airs rarity or denlity can it be doubted wrether fuch piece of moon-light without the appearance of her body be fuch when the darknels broadness and sharpnets of the ground-hades and the palencts of the colour are well obferved all which conjunctively express evening or night if it be quchion whether this were the former practice lay no buliness to enquire into that fince we ought not to accommo- date the art to fancy but our senfes to the arc tis to as linle purpote of lights and shades purpofe to confider what is done but rather what may or ought to be cose according to the dillates of right reafon in short tisim- poffible when the threeaforefaid qualities are well observed in piece it hould fail of reprefenting very natural moon light as my polition runs counter to old cuftom and therefore not to caly to apprehenion have endeavoured to explain myfelf by the three examples in plate xllil in the firtt fhew the moon in her natural bignels yet without the piece becaute the would otherwife come too near the horizon and caule too long and difagreeable ground-hades in the lecond the is exhibited after the old ltay and in the third thew only starry sky with the frong lights of moon who as in the firtt example is without the picture if any one think that the moon body gives firong glitter elegance and life to piece fay the sparkting light of the stars does the same effecially if we make them as large as they appear to us but not in perifeltive way as being berween heaven and earth like the moon however we need not reprefent them all but the chief only fuch as the charict the triangle the serpent the norts and evening star and tuch as make known figure all which as having no figural being but only the shine of very fmall light may be eafily expreffed by fmall points we may allo make the moon though without the piece appear in the water and caute an agreeable reffexion in the waving surges and by chuling fuch side-fight we have the advantage of reprefent- ing alf teings q berutifal neither more nor lets than in sun-thine or common light mull fubjoin another important confideration which is that as the moon light is fomerimes obllrutted by high objects fuch as rocks palaces trees hills coc to some parts mut needs be dark in which the reffexions of to weak light haveno power to enlight en or feigh our the objects or bodies in them though ever to near for this reafon painter ought to avoid juch accidents and not to incroduce them unlets through neceffity to create an harmony or forbe and to place them mathr forward or in the offskip againft the sky for fetting them between bork cannor but make dijagreeable spot un leis it be broke by fome water wherein the reflexion of some stars orother lights of the air appear and into fuch choice of land ship or vitto you may introduce white marble images buildings light by-works and light coloured stufts which all together loon agrce of ligbts and shades and as the night vapours are more deafe than thofe of the day to the diftant objects become more faddenly dark and undiffin- puispable forger not that in windy weather the moon as well as the north-star is encompafted with yellow ring if any perfon be not yet fully fatisfed let him pleafe to weigh the following palpable realons tbe sun moon and stars can not diminish becaute we can neither approach nearer nor go further from them but all fublunary objects can by our recels or approach leffen or magnity and to prove this take glass of the size you intend your picture place it before window and draw on it the prospect with the moon as it then appears to the eye which done you will fee how large the ought to be painted now if you approach with this glats some thouland steps nigher towards the sun or moon they will not appear bigger on or through the glass but have the same magnitude whence arifes the falficy of those reprefentations which diminish the sun moon or other meteors as well as the figures conclude then that the pictures exhibiting nature contrary to what the ought to be are liable to cenfure and that we ought to feek truth by ratiocination and then waving old cultoms and prejudice to believe our own eyes hall further illultrate this matter in the chapters shawing what is meant by table and of the uses of magnifying and diminishing claffes and of the difference between large and small warm and weak painting to which we refer the curious artift ap xi of the efferts of artificial lights as of lorch lamp candle or fire ving in the moft plain and concife manner treated of the effects of the sun moon and starlights we shall on the same footing peak allo of the auxiliary lights which necet- lity for the eafe of mankind has contrived and art brought to perfeltion think it not amiss to thew here in the firft place the force and property of thefe particular lights in fuch manner as conceive them.. no lights and shades book of flumbern or forch is at night the moft powerful and beautiful having two qualiries to wit of afrighting and rejoicing light is very proper for bacchanals entertarnments plays and ther jofal mertings and on the comrary frightful in serceries ap pirisions of grors and tuch like nocturnal and unexpected accidents the lamp is melancholy faint and gloomy and therefore proper for barials prisons near fick and dying persons and on other mournful occations this light is moft agreeable within-doors and in gaves grettes or frightful and unfrequented places of small extent the astare of this light and irs efef on colours are the fame as thote of the sun with respelt to irs falfifying the colours but the light and reffexion are not to frong for which reafon the arrift is often at fland in the ules of them arifing moftly from his flight- ing this light as matter not worth his obfervation in reference to shades they are not much unlike thofe of the sun well in brondness as sharpness yet with this difference that the sunlight falls more uniform on objects as he is more diftant from them and becaute in the evening but especially at night the vi- pours are darker and more deate than thofe of the day whence it follows that all objects deprived of the lamplight ditappear and by reafon of it nearnels can be lighted but in part to contirm this we thall exhibit marhematical inftance in plate xlii fx point for the center of the light from which all the rars ffow draw under it candleftick of certain height as above the ground then skerch or columns going off fur ther and further from the faid point of light ler thefe be feet high next fet one foot of the compaffes on the faid point and extending the other to as to touch the extremity of the firft pillar tweep segment of circle on the shaft do the same with the other pillars now you will perceive that the firlt pillar is leaft toucbed bur receives the fronge light and that above and beneath the touch the light falls weaker and weaker moreover that the furcheff co lumn is mof toucked by means of the greater sweep of the compaffes and therefore it will be lighted almol all over but allo moft weak ithence tis plain that objects lighted by fuch lights are never light intirely and uniform nd were they rouched and lighted alike it would be to faint and dark that we should perceive nothing diffindly either in colour or our line more than in weak moon-thine of lights and shades any one want further information how apply this to practice shall now freely impart it firfl skeich my ordonnance on blue or dark drawing-paper then make my plan to thew the places of the figures and other objects which flightly feratch next affign point for my light either high or low as occation requires on this point fet one foot of the compaffes and with the other touch circle-wife with an extent equal to each objects diftance from the faid point all the objects wherever it happens by this means find the parts which as near- ef the light ought to have the prongeff light and confequently the diminution of the light and colour thews itfelf in proportion as it goes of from the drawn circles as for the reffexions they are in the fame cafe with all lights the brighteff largeft and rrongeft give the frongelt and the purer the light the more yellow appear the colours both in the lights and re- fexions contrarily the fouler and more vaperous the light the more russet seem the colours candle is yellowith the light of lamp is ruffet flambeau or torch is more red artifis who delight in reprefenting fuch lights ought to regard the three following ufeful precepts to keep molt light together to take especial care in the meling and lighting of their out- lines to obferve the naturalness of the feveral lights whether can- dle lamp or torch it muft allo be noted that the space between the eye and the light as likewife the firft object or figure if it come before the light ought to be the durkeft but if it be behind the light it be- comes weaker and weaker both in light and shale occationed by the vapours which as before has been laid appearing more denfe in the evening the night light more affects them and enlightens them add to this that the mainlight being temper ’ with light vel- low ruffet or red the diminution and breaking of thofe colours ought to be found by black mean by black and the proper colours wherewith the objects are shaded and more or less weak in proporti- on to their diftance for the foremoff darkness and neareft to the light is more warm than the hinder and furthermofl which in pro- portion to its diftance becomes more blue yet much more in the hh lights and shades gen sir than withindeers becaute the vapours of the air are more iubtile than thofe of conined lights which being made with lamp- oil rofin or the like emit foul smoke but as the foremoll objects mult by means of confined light with- i reeds be fubjert to much shade whereby they often main tain but small light on their extremities it will be found that luch eutaarl lights appear more or lois frong than the objects lighted freght forwards according as the stuff whereon it falls is either rough or mogtr as for the reffexions with the light thining thro thin folds obferre the fame management as prefcribe for sunfhine touching thote parts but in breaking the colours let me fubjoin that the forens darkness mit be the greateft and therefore lets fallin- ed by the light than thole which are more diftant the colours there by keep cleaner and are lets fouled and hill lets in the open air than with doors am even not afraid to add an eafy method for finding the diminu- fir of ti linis on object according to their diftances not from the pon of sgar but from the candle torch or lamp cut strip of paper or cilum as long as from the center of the light to the fur thet corner of the piece ler it be finger and half broad at bot rom and awar to point at top then paint the point with fuch colour as vou give your light yellowith or ruffet diminithing it gradually in proportion to its going off from the light next with pin fix the faid point in the center of the light to as to more it about at pleasure to all the objects near to or diftant from the light then divide this strip into degrading fict small at the pointed light end and from thence gradually larger by which means the scrip will ther withour trouble the right tint to temper for the objects going into the picture towards the point of sight you may make another strip the reverfe of the former to wii light at the bortom and diminithing towards the top or point to be fixed on the point of sight you would ule any more helps for the diminution of the co jours and lets troublefome try the following method in my ordonnance exactly defigned the figures after the life paint it like common light piece without breaking the co lours more than perspective requires the light take as from candle or other mlatter proceeding from point within the piece whether within doors or in the open air after which take thin glazing vellow of the fame tint give to my light and scumble lights and shades chap nealy and thin over both lights and shades this vellow muft not be too dark becaute my main heightning is taken only from common light wherefore asphalium yellow lake and dragons blood would be to warm and fentible as to take away the mipiness in- separable from nighhpieces unlets it were before painted accordingly to the no small trouble of the rtiff now as glared things com- monly abate of their neatnels you may if it be neceffary retouch the main-lights as well in the faces as other parts and thereby ferch out their force again the advantage arifing from this method is that there is no kind of night light whether of lamp or other oil pirch brimftone candle or torch but it may be reprefented with the fame trouble becaute it depends only on the tempering the glazing colour the bett of which in my opinion is cumbooge light pink or yellow lake mixt with little vermillion think thefe very good methods becaute fomerimes in night pieces elpecially in great brytles we use two three and more particular burning matters for lights and by this means we obtain fure nicthod for fetching out thofe lights and fires not only ar night but allo in the day-time in the evening nay in sunskine where we often meet with flambeaus torches burning allars or piles of wood but let me not propofe thefe precepts as laws but examples to exercife the artifts curiofity and for their proficiency wherein with my lahours may be of service chap xx necefary hints in the use of perfpective ve been long confidering point which in my opinion is very remarkable and yet has never been fertled tho think ic may be done it relates to the execution of hiffories either with- in or without-deers and landskip embellised with figares my thoughts are that as perspective affigns certain diftance for viewing pilture with respect to its magnitude or smallnets or large piece with large figures and other objects going off to wit on the second and third grounds thofe objects ought to be as nearly fi- nithed as thofe on the fore-ground provided they keep their faintness cauled by the interpoting aair this pofftion think is founded on certain and natural principles but of lights and sbades book mult prerioully fuppofe that when we fay piece is well iked it mut be underffood that the whele is fo and not part on if we begn inquiries we ought to puth them as far as polhible to enable us to lay tuch piece is artfully executed nay to perfect that nothing is wanting for that can not be affirmed when the fore- ground is hniched and well painted and the fecond and third grounds but flarely rouched grant that we fomerimes fee pieces with imall figures tho loofly handled accounted finer and more artful than large pictures laboured and highly finithed yet it mult be allow ed that more work is necelfary in large finithed piece than fmall looly handl the very words fnishel and feofy imply it mr opinion is that if we be not wanting in trouble and time as artful piece may be produced as what has been hitherto done yet only by thole who underfland arr and its rules in theory and prac tice and tho ir feem ditficult to aftempt thing new we mult not therefore be difcouraged for what great things have not been ex- perimented and performed what did not afexander had he feared danger and trouble he would never have gone the lengths he did he had mind to do it rhis created refolution and that finithed his hopes but to return to our subject let us fuppofe that picture ten feer high with figures as big as the life ought to be viewed at ten feer diulance and that lmaller one five feet high with figures half as big as the life muft have five feer diftance and thus the smaller the nearer according to perspective now the quellion is which of thote three pieces ought to be moft finithed many will certainly fay the but my opinion is that each of the three pieces mult be painted equally neat becaute each has its determinate diftance with respect to its bignets again there is another fuch piece ten feet high but divided in to three grounds whereon are placed the fame figures as in the three former to wit thote as big as the life on the fore-ground thote half as big on the second and the lat on the third cround the queftion now is which of thefe three grounds ought to be moft finith ed being all in one pilture the judges will contrary to what they before afferred fay the first and that the hindermoft muft not be to near and finithed fince they can never relish that the figures on the second and third grounds ought to be painted as neat and elaborate thote on the fore-ground for lay they — who would por ob lights and shades it at ten feet distancez nay who ever faw such painting or did it but the cafe is not whether there have been fuch pictures but whetber they ought to be sof we are not ignorant that tis the cultom to finith fmall pieces the fmaller the neater and large ones contrari- ly bold or loofe now would fain know the reafon why there should be more work in figure of three feet than in one of lix can it be proved that the fmall one ought to have fold nay an hair more than that in full proportion but what other anfwer can be made — if the cultom were not good it would not have prevailed nor laft- ed to long neverthelels as long as we reafon thus without foundation and bigor ourfelves to common practice and old cuftom we shall never advance irs not the proper way to go forward and therefore many keep their old station but want to be informed of now things without which art can not improve variety nourishes the mind grant that men fometimes produce new things which meet not with publick approbation but whence come they either from falfe grounds and inconfideration or elfe an immethodical way of expla- nation to express my thoughts perfpicuoully have exhibited them as plain as could in plate xl and queltion not but you will appre- hend my meaning numb has three pieces fronting with their diftances of feet and an half numb is the fame in profile with the meafure or vifual rays which limit the diftances whether great or fnall being the same polition where they are all three in one now my original quettion with respect to numb is which of the three pieces ought to be moft finithed if any one fay tbe small one because it muft be viewed neare ask again whether there mult bemore work in the small than the large one now behold numb where they are all three in one according to perspective and let the queftion be which ought to be moft finithed the foremoll or the hindmoft vou will certainly antwer that it thews itfelf that the fi- gures on the fore-ground muft be more finithed than what is further off and that there muft allo be more work in the large as being rearer but how agrees this with what was juft now faid that the smalleft of the three pieces ought to be moft finithed fince now you fay the turg- ligbis and shades gi mull be to for the examples and objects are the fame and it is al ready granted that the fmallerit is the nearer is the distance affigned and that in the imalleff or furthermoff when nearelt there ought to be as much work as in the feremoit and tho you will fay that the latt figure is fainter than the foremott yer there is not fold lets in it than if it were quite forward and as big as the life jurge further when lhighly finith figure in full proportion after the lte muff fir ar learl as near as the model is high to perceive eren the morl minuce parts of now if would make another fi- gure half as big allo after the life to place it on my fecond ground how

chap xxi of the different colouring in great and small pieces propofition is confequence of the preceding and to be incelligible shall thew my thoughts by the following ex ample in plate klvi there is gallery feet high and feet long divided into three pannels each five feet wide and to feet high the two out- ward pannels are cloathed from top to botcom and the middle one but half way from the top downwards and under it is an handlome bear thele three cloths are to be painted by three feveral malters itarpose with lindskips all having like horizon but different poince of sighr one mafter embellifhes his work with figures ei= ther fable or hillory another introduces architelture and imagery according to his gullo and the chird adorns his with cartle or what elle he thinks fit the queltion is now in order to produce general decorum agree- ing with nature whether thefe mafters ought not to be concurring in their work with respect to perspective force and diminutions certainly they ought for the light muft in all the three pictures fatt alike either from the left right before or behind the air mult be the fame fince they all ought to appear as one landship feen through three openings as two doors and window but now another queltion arifes whether the figures in all three ought to be as big as the life this will beagreed to with respect to thofe on the fore-ground but how then will it be in the middle pilture which is but half the size of the two others how shall fi- gures be incroduced there in full proportion for half foot of ground or five feet is too much difference now if the mafter who is to make the middle as the fmalleff piece paint it as firong and warm as he is able nay as face in full proportion of rembrant it would be intirely againtt nature and the rules of art but to return to our example suppole the ofship either in imall or large piece to be one and the same even were the one as fmall as the palm of the hand and the other ten vards high the reafon and examples whereof have fufficiently shewed in the laff chapter and shall further enforce in its lights and sbades book place in that treating of what is to be underftood by painted ta ble whether lanmiskip hiffery pourtraiture cc bur before leave this subject mult hill fart another difficulty we know that large painting is often copy ’ in little and the con- trary now if for inftance all that is large in the original be lef fened in proportion in the copy how can they look alike as in the delign with the two doors is exhibited in both which are large clouds and in the other small ones and all thats in the offskip teems more diftant in the one than the other if the offskip in the small pitture be that of the great one by what can you prove ir fince the objects which in the greateff diftance in the fmall piece are hardly vifible appear in the great one to large and diftind to which iantwer that every thing appearing in the one is and remains in the other always the same out so much nearer and this is evi- dent for is there any thing in the world which how remote foe- ver can not be fill remoter it has been formerly faid that every thing on earth is subject to the laws of perspective except the sun moon and stars and what elfe is feen in the firmament with respect to their forms as for the clouds they are moveable bodies and there fore muft be confidered as earthly objects leftening and enlarging ac cording to their dillance height and lowness all thefe thingsl tay can go off and appreach be diftant and near betides there is difference between copy and an original as well in the form as iiss itay in the form becaute the one ought to be viewed afar off and the other near moreover it never happens that the copy is hung by the original but the fellow to it chap xxii of the diference of force in large and small paint ing and the effects of magnifying and diminishing glaffes be the berter underffood we shall begin with the air and take thefe two points for granted namely that all dark objects in proportion as they go off become on their light parts tight or and lighter and the light ones contrarily darker and darker how clear foever the weather yer less in sun-pine as experience fuffici eatly thews now if it be asked whether the colour of the objects do not thereby allo loofe its nature and purity think it can loofe but lit ile lights and shades chap and only in the shade which broke by the other side of the light is gradually transformed into the blue of it in proportion as the objects go off or to peak better till uniting with the ofship they at laft disappear confider allo the difference between fmall paintings in the open rir and thofe within doors in reference to the going of and the co- fay firtt that the fir without is the moft clear and bright light in the abfence of sun-fhine and tho an aparement mult needs be lighted from without yet it will be less in force and brighinels and therefore the objects more darkish both in lights and shades secondly the objects can not fo vifibly grow faint in their going off becaule by the smallness of the diftance few or no vajours are per ceptible thirdly the shades are not subject to any alteration or mixture but retain their natural qualities becaufe there is no other light within doors than what comes thro the windows and this has not power enough to cause any reffexions lave some little near the win- dow nor give any colour so that by the darkithnels the ob- jects whether pourtraits figures flowers cc retain their natural colours intirely as well in sbades as lights wherefore fince the beauty and purity of the colours appear beft by the serenity and brighiness of the air they muft contrarily abace in their effects and force by means of the darkness hall here propole small inftance for explanation let good maffer paint any thing as pourtrait landskip fi- gures or cattle in oil as fmall and neat as miniature-painter and let both thefe mafters chufe their subjects moff beautiful and natural now view the two paintings together and you will find that the one differs as much from the other as within door light does from the open air tis therefore unnatural and againtt the rules to us thet warmih and strength of colours in order to force small and diftant objects out of their proper plices or to make the window fy tewards us inlead of going off from us we ought moreover to know that things painted in little can never be taken for the truth fince tis undeniable that the life appears therein no otherwife than as at distance viz through door window or other opening whether within or with- out-doors wherefore they ought to be painted in fuch manner that when hung up they may not appear like painted board clotk or flat but natural windew or deor through which the life is really seen lights and shakes book which can not he effected by the force of warm shades or has colears but by the reciring and tender ones broken by the interpoting air according as the weather is more or less clear or mifty and this withour exception of any ordonnance whether landskig hisjory experience will confirm the truth if you view your picture thro' piece of fne gaufe somercbat bluiss for then you will find the lights of your objects gradually grow weaker in proportion to their diftance without lofing the beauty of their colours it will even give piece certain sofinels and sweetness and great decorum vou may make the fame experiment with another piece of gause of grey coloar in imitation of forey weather and it will not only darken the of the objects but alfo foul and maddle it and make the paint ing look cold and ditagreeable having thewn that the vie of the greateff force of sbades in small paintings is annararal and againft rt as well in within as wichour door-reprefencarions we shall now peak of the contrary to wit pieces with lnge orjefts in order to thew what therein without prejudice think the moff parural tis conmtant maxim that the life feen near is in greatness force and colour tuperior to what is diflant the one being nature it felf and the other pemingty so for figures in full proportion are like us who view them in every particular of force afpelt and colour except motion which being granted it may be calily apprehended if we will fubmir to reafon that there is vall difference between large and fmall ordonnances of figures in full proportion and thote half as big with respect to the interpesing fir the only true caule of things being more or less faine and their going off as well in within withour door-reprefentations let us then rightly oblerve in what manner fuch large objects ought to appear that they may be natural and artful but previouly contider two things whar light is the moft proper for them what hundling is the moll natural for their execution as for the light think the common bet and much more proper than sunthine and tho fome who let up for the buono guffe are continually talking of painting broad it is nevertheless great errot as we have often laid always and without difference to ule that mar ner fince tis not proper in common chamber-light especially in figures as big as the life which ought to be in all respects like the spects of lights and shades even to much that if painted on boards and cut away they should not be taken for paintings but the lifeitself to give them broad shades but dubious and melting ones to the end they may rise and round not black like spagnoler nor grey vellow or ruffet like rembrant john lievens and many other italian duich and flemisss painters who without difference bring warmch as they call it into the shades to fuch degree as to fire them on ly to caule force let this be duly weighed left the colour of the natural and perfect life be negletted in my opinion is belt to make the shade of the same nature as the stuf exhibiring in all objects whether nudities draperies wood stone either red vellow blue of green the moft proper colour as well in light as shade as to the force should not be fparing either of white or black tho many have pretended that we mull not wte white good painter will attempt any thing vou muft not fuffer yourfelf to be twayed by this or that manner follow nature and you will content away then with drudgery and muddling handle your work boldly yet not with rembrunt and lievens to let the colours run down the cloth but lay them fnooth and even that your objects may feem round and relieved only by art not by daubing let the agreement be to general that in truth it may be faid the fi- gures are large srongly painted and beldly handled people now -- days think that painting has attained fuch perfecti- on as not to admit of further improvements fince the beautiful and

loofe hims and uncertain grounds without precedent and now methinks can not any where better than here thew the effelts of mignifing and diminishing glaffes and the various opinions fouching them many imagine that painting in little and the life feen through diminithing-glats are one and the fame and that the fmall lite seen through magnifying-glats and large picture appear alike but thefe men are much mittaken and as wide from truth as the eaff is from the well the glats ground hollow or concave fhews near objects in their force beaury and warua with diminution and the glats ground riing or

thefe men to be in the right and we were to fide with them we should by this their pofition and application of it dilcover their wrong notion fince they make the large strong and the imatt eren as

difference between large landskip ernamented with small figures and small one with large with respect to the hir the day being supposed clear in both be short and incelligible we premife that in landskip the fir is so governing that all the piece contains whecher off- skip water fields trees coc muft from it receive their decorum and naturalnels and at all times of the day whether morning noon or evening nay at night alfo for as the airalters all the objects lighted by it do the fame if the day be bright and the air clear all things appear fo if it be evening they are dusky and at night dark the mafter who has regard to this effential point mult needs fucceed and be thought artful and why becaule he has in that part fimply followed nature as an infallible guide vet he ought to be certain in lighting the objects according to their fe- veral natures and to obferve with me whether there be differ rence between large opening without embellissments and the contrary with respett to the ir by the air is meant the fuperior part which in clear day is commonly called the blue of the sty we lay that the two unlike objects in landship to wit one ona- mented and the other plain ought in order to look natural to be tike clear and neither lighter nor darker if they both exhibir the sume hour of the day and if one were of darker blue than the or ther tis miftake and unjullifiable for one of them mut needs be contrary to truth now it may be here objected according to the old way of think- ing that maffer of his art may for decency sake freely cor rect and alter narure when the is obstructing but anfwer in few words that in that cafe nature ought to command and art obey what can be the purpofe to paint in landskip the blue of the sky two or three feet above the horizon as dark as if it were evening when all the objects in the piece are lighted with the urmofl bright- nets and force either fidewife or froming altho the sun be fetting even the shades lighter than the upper air confider how fuch re- prefentations mult look in the eyes of the knowing and whether it be otherwife than day-occurrence or stage-play reprefented in the evening what advantage would accrue if every body had trus know- of lights and sbades dook and judgment in the art if we did not thew them art what lore can gam he who knows are is very fenfible of what it aims at wherefore lover of truth ought to fhun fallities picture is probable dementration of tbings and the knowledge of visible narure is like touch flone by which menjudge of the truth or falhood of all they meet with even ignorants as well as the knowing are allured by art if they find it like nature tho they are disterently affected the former delighting moff in mean and com- mon things and the latter in fublime and grand but to return to the point and from the small to full proportion mean pieces from or to or feet high the queltion is whether the light blushness of the styought not to begin higher above the horizon in piece of ro feer than in one of think it ought not becaute in boch the armof dilance is the same and there is no other dirference between the great and small picture chan between window half and quite open as the example in plare kl vil natu rally thews where are two wvindows of equal height and breadth one half fhar and the other quire open through both which the landskip and horizon are feen to rife feet and an half now we generally perceive when the sky is clear and without clouds that it appears blue as if we faid — twere all light — affuming its colour flowly and far above the horizon and therefore some land ship painters act very improperly herein and againtt narure but fi fare-painters especially are moft culpable fuch mean who in their pieces tho ever to small exhibit the rir suddenty durk and deep blue without confidering the origin of blueexperience reaches that it proceeds from whire and black and is therefore in the aforning light blue at noon sky-blue in the evening azure and at night dark bluc in this manneri divide the four times of the day as in the following example in the plsteaforefaid we by double harchings plainly thew and not only the tines but allo how high the blue be gins above the horizon and approaches towards it thefe are letterd bcd for the morning nosn evening and night ii will not be unneceffary on this occafion to impart thought of mine touching warm and weak puinting as well in landskip and hiffory as fnall and great life fince it allo takes its rife from this fountain of the lights we find that thofe who are accultomed to particular manner of painting have not the power to alter it of any occafion whatloe yer they who make large figures or landship their buliness and uil chap lights and shades great force and warmth paint every thing frongly without dif ference tho ever fo small contrarily one ufed to small things if his manner be weak retains that weakness even in the largeft things and can not ferch out the force and warmth of the other vall miltake in my opinion becaule it is fuch an ealy matter and yet produces to great an effect mean for him who governs his work by rule for who having judgment is ignorant that near tree has more strength and warmth than one at two hundred steps diftance or that figure in full proportion has more force than one of one foot think neither of thefe parties can find fault with the colours he in the great that he has not weak ones enough or he in the ltthe that he wants the flrong and warm or can not make them to by tempering if the knowledge be found nothing but will is want- ing for good performance but let us confider in what manner we may on this occation arm ourfelves good reafons ought to way every body yet scruples of ten make men fearful of undertaking things out of their way not that they should not be able to perform them but on an apprehen tion of falling from good into bad manner fince experience thews that each fuppofes his own manner the beft think have found out method for thofe accultomed to large and rrong things to fit them for the small and weak the cloth jou defign to paint on ought to be primed with light grey ground for the large work and with dark and warm ground for the small to that having no other patterns whether figures or landship than warm and sirong ones you may temper your belours accordingly and get rid of your old cullom herein pallet of the same colour is al to neceffury that the colours tempered on it may produce in paint- ing the same force or weakness and to thew that this method is of greater moment than some may prefently imagine shall relace what once happened to myfelf certain gentleman had his hallcieling lined with five cloths grimed with pearl-colour and being afterwards defirous of having fomething painted on them propoted my doing it whereup- made defigns to his liking and had cloths fent home to me the middle one large and quare and three fmaller round ones but in lien of the fifth which was got rotten by dampuess new one was fent to me not primed with light ground like the reft but of brqun colour after had deadcolour ’ the work and viewed it together perceived that the shades in the laft cloth were much browner and no warmer of lights and shades warmer than in the others and tho in finithing endeavoured as much as poftible to help it and bring it like the rell ver something remained in the sbodes of another nature which fome pertons judged to be better chan chole of the other cloths thole especially who were impliciely addilted to the warm mianner without confidering in gene ral whether twas proper of not thus found that the ground of cloth may often miffead as and put us befide the mark eitber in near- ness or difance but knowing the reafon of it if it happen again the fault is our own and thus we may infentibly and without compul tion pats from large tbings into the small and from the small into the vurge we hall further obferve on what occafions the aforefaid means may be made ufe of to advantage in paincing light landskip in painting halls rooms cc in night-pieces apparitions and candle-lights and as well in lrtle as in full proportion for thefe three particular defigas we may prepare the grounds of the clorks thus that for the landstip ought to be pimed with pearl colour that for an apartment with umber that for apparition or candie-light with colagn ’ earth or umber and black the firtt more or lels blaish according to the quantity of sky the second fomewhat brighter and more warm according as you intend to exhibit either common light or sum thine and the third according as it has lirde or much light depth of approsch smallness or large nets yet the larger the more black we think thofe colours belides the tints very ufeful and neceffary not without reafon becaute they have affinity to the nrure of the subjects the firtt to the blue of the sty the second to the reffexiens and the third to the shade have often made it queftion whether it were worth while to mention thefe particulars becaute am fenlible some may think them riffing as willingly own they feem to be but on better confide ration of the matter and how many things are negletted which ei ther offer of themfelves or seem trivial tho of abfolnte ufe my su- fpicion abared with this confolation that how minure foever my thoughts may be shall be fausfied if they any ways tend to the ad vantage and improvement of are and insiruction in it wherefore reaffuming the subject fay that the cloth may be prepared thus the colours being ground up ftiff with fat oil ought to be mixed very thin with turpentume and the cloth painted over with of lights and sbades chap foff tool in this manner the sky blue and the ground grey or green more or lets dark as your ordonnance and delign re= quire now if it be asked how we mull proceed in cafe of rifing objects as trees houles or other things coming againft the offship and above the horizon and which fill up great part of it an twer that my meaning is not to provide fuch painted cloths with- but previoully knowing what we are to paint upon them for we mull firft skeech our thoughts on paper and then conclude how much or little sky or ground muft be painted blue or green vellow or black in thofe grounds we have no occafion for fine and coftly co- lours common ones will ferve if they have good body and cever well for the blue take indigo and white for the ground umber and white or lamp-black and light oker for architecture and other stonework umber brown oker coc the ground thus laid and being dry has three defirable qualities tis fit for work as being even and dull wherefore the colours how thin foever take at firft which fmooth or gloffy ground will not admit without much trouble tis durable by its relation to the tints and colours painted on it which hold their perfect beaury and force which they can- not do when the ground is of another colour or tint fich as white upon black light blue on dark vellow or red in time appear- ing more and more through tho ever to farly painted tis expeditions for him who has ready hand and quick pencil and defires to paint up his defign at once which otherwile can not be done without dead-colouring this method has ftill further advantages than some may perhaps imagine tis particularly ufeful in creling-pieces not only in acreal reprefentations but alfo bass reliess of one colour whether white grey violet or yellowith judge now whether the trouble of preparing fuch cloth be not small when compared with the great advantage arifing from it as proof of it have oblerved of the great barthelet that when he was to paint pourtrait with purple or black drapery he laid in the drapery fat with fingle dark purple or black without any folds and on finithing onty beightened and saded it and thas worked up the piece at once k of lights and shades chap xxiv of the lights within deers h light ought to be ranked among the day-lights as tak ing its rife and government from thence this commonly called chamber-light we divide into three sorts the firtt enters thro doors windows and other openings and pro ceeding from the air thereby caules the fecond which is occationed by reffexion as from wall ground or other objects the third fublifts in irtelf as proceeding from candle or torch thefe lights have different natures thofe of the open fir are clean on the light parts of objects and do sof after then more than in the open air cauling the light to be broad and the shades dark the second falls mere or less pare on objects according to the colour and nature of the grounds and walls their shades being dim and dif appearing and only the decpest shades visible and frong the room in general both above and below being thereby lighted as well by the force and effed of the wall within as by the groand witheut of the groundhades we shall fay nothing here as having in another place treated of them and their force and diminution the cundle-light we have alfo ina particular chapter fufficient thewed how to manage as likewife sun-thine which laft we think as we have often faid very improper to be reprefented in room many have thought very improperly of thofe lights taking in manner the liberty which horace allows to poets and paint- ers and precending to help the defects of nature do it in an extri- ragant manner making no scruple to break down whole wall of room to let in beautiful light on their objects as prongly as in the open air they even go fuch lengths that tho they have doors and win dows they give every thing their proper ground fhades except win dow-frames crosspieces and piers as if wall were pot folid bo dy as well as man table chair or other furniture imagining they may do fo that nothing may obfiract the figures but in my pinion of lights and shades it were better to take away the caule of fuch an evil than to spoil the property of things by reprefenting it in painting an apartment we ought well to consider the arcbiteffure to aid it and give it preper division and thew door for pallage as for the windows whether many or few it muft appear by the objects and by the groundshades of the cross-pieces and piers and that plain in sun-thine but dubious without it and in order to make this laft point cfear which in this chapter we chiefly aim ac shall in the two examples in plate klvill plainly exprets my sentiments the firtl exhibies two different lights falling in thro two differenc windows the one proceeding from the clear air and the other by reaton of near building before the window somewhat broke little of no air being feen above that building between the windows is large pier or blank wall mark thofe windows with the letters and and the blank wall with and then obferve how the shade which the pier gives on the ground is cut on both sides by the light falling in thro the windows and and how acute it terminates and how the light is weakened by that of moreover what thort touch of light gives when that of bgoes far into the room as allo that the figure receiving the light from is dusky and hara hort ground chade and the other figure contrarily receiving its light from is lighter and its light broader and gives longer ground-shade obferve further that the nearer the figures are to the light or window the purer and more plain are their round-thadesy when contrarily the column placed againtt the pier gives ground-fhade the greater evercoming the less the second example thews the fame things according to the cor dition of the lights which are altered and come in from bebind the third and fourth examples in plare klir thew the fame things in landship for the same obfervation prevails in both with respect to light and shade as to the colours in the open air and their alcerations have faid enough of them in proper chapter think it great heedlelsnels in many painters who in giving their within door-objects side light do not mind whether they rand on the near or offfide of the window letting in the light nor confider that the light coming in thro narrow opening preads and by reafon of interpoling vapours in proportion to the force of the ligbts and sbades light there mall needs fall proportional weak or brong shade on the ground confider the conduct of the ingenious poysin in his piece of the dearb of the great general epammondas wherein no obtervation of light is neglected all things have their natural effects which make the piece look to charming tyros muft not think it irkfome to mind to many obfervations in matters of confequence which when once well apprehended in their principles nothing but carelessacts will afterwards make them flight endeavour then to fix the prisciples and knowledge in your memories by the help of jadgment and all things will certainly have narw- ral and ealy iffue ch ap xxv of the application of lights to the different speci- es of histeries with table or ordennance of all the lights rh we may not be thought to keep any thing back from arciff which may be of service to him judged is necelfs- to fubjoin this chapter to the lights tho we have to largely greated of their natures qualities forces and effelts drawing and our line how fine foever are not agreeable before they are shaded and when this is done as nature and art require it exales the former and gives an addicional lustre to nature for so ber light fuirs not with butting figures with respect to within door-reprefentations becaute it abates the elegance and art of the ther as in the marther of cxfar in the senate-house or the death of cato but let me not be hereby suppoted to overthrow my for mer affertion that sun fhune is not proper within doors fince on foch occafions as those there muft be found fuch medium in the light as there is in the colours between the more and less beautiful and as we have thewed to be between sun-fhine and common light again this light would be very improper in salatation of eli- labeth and mary or the stery of stratonica or that of the qued of sheba thefe require more tender foft and fweet light and therefore common ofe of ligbts and shades this be not obferved good out line may be spoiled as when shade should happen to fall on the rifing parts or ground shade pass over them were we to make an hiltory wherein both pastions the sedate and firring should meet requiring confequently an oppesstion in the lights we ought to place the afting figures forwards on the firft ground as having the predominancy and to adapt the light to them as much as possible accordingly story nott occurs to me wherein the three principal pasions muft meet in one composition mean that of ahafuerus eff- her and haman efther thews supplicating and meek posture and coun- tenance the king dilcovers wratb and passion and haman affe- nishment and fright now in order to caft well the light on thote figures according to my apprehention would dispofe epber in the greateff light fomewhat in profile the king in the srongeft mean where it falls moft and has its chief effect and increate it by the force of colours but haman would place fitting on the other side of the table in dim light the rather to fereen him from the king' wrath and as it is feall or banquet prepared by epber where every thing is royal and magnificent think the common light here the moft proper becaute the sequel of the story and the king rage are but accidental we shall conclude this book with the following ordennance or table of the lights here the beautiful and darting aurera is

woods with viftos wherein the eye may lofe itfelf rocks rivers and water-falls green fields cc delightful to the eye herein lies the stress of landskip and painting is very like nature with respect to things inanimate not to mention many others as the embellifhments which give it the utmofl perfection however this variety confifts not only in the difference or irregularity of the objects as trees hills fountains and the like but in the diversity of each of them for inftance bending and frait trees large and small hills wrought and plain fountains cottages and palaces green and rufet lands cc the same diverfity is to be oblerved in colsuring according to the seasons of the tear that lovers may not he cloved by producing with the cuckoo always the fame thing as stir and motion crooked and mif-shapen bodies of trees waving branches barren grounds blue mountains or beafts birds huntings and the like or contrarily always repose and quictness frait stems clipp ’ trees level grounds intirely gre standing water and the same light colour and nature we have formerly faid that table or picture hung up and view- ed at determinate diftance appears as the liss without-deers of which the frame thews only the thickness of the sill wherein tis put or wall againtt which it hangs the queltion is now whether inch painted opening can be natural and deceiving without lixing point of sight and an horizon equrl with the eye of the spettator and whether it be the fame to place them higher or lower and further whether the thickness of the frame be iufficient to thew the thick- nets of the wall without continuing it upon the cloth fay poft- tively — no — and that fuch an opening can not be natursl much less deceiving if one of thofe requifites be wanting which prove thus take chair and fit at the window with your eye jull level with the sill and then you will oblerve that the horizon of greateff diftance parting the sky and earth will as may say approach towards ir and be parallel with your sight and that tngre od fore you can fee nothing but sky then arife and yoa will perceive the herizen landskips vi herizas alfo rife and that your eye is always level with it difcovering here and there objects on the ground now confider the infuffice eacy of your pilture when its point of sight does not agree with your exe and how nacure joined to your imagined art is per- verred your deceit made apparent and your intentions fpoiled it is therefore evident that the picture in which the point of sight is placd mull determine your dillance and that the eye ought never to leove the herizen but be always level with it if the kye be lower than the point of sight all the objects mult needs feem to tumble forwards and the fore-ground to fink if you are above the point of sight the fere-ground rifes and all the objects are tumbling backwards how then can this feem natural and deceiving wherefore there is no other way than to hang the pilture in certain place and fix diftance whence it is to be viewed without alteration as for the frame it is necessary to shew the thickness of it on the cleth in order to know at ence tbhe ditance from whence you ought to view it because its angular rays are directed to the point of sight am not infentible that this pofition may feem firange to some who will object that they never obferved any fuch thing in poustin titian brif or francefce moly or other good mafters but the old saving shall plead for me example is better than precept for they endeavour to follow the miftakes but not the virtues of thofe exce- lent mafters am fure that had thote great mafters thought of thefe obfervations they would not have rejected them do you want demonfiration that every good mafter approves of what fay and follows it shew me but one picture drawing or print of theirs ex hibiring aed vilto out of an hall or chamber wherein they have forgor to exprets the thickness of the framing or walls fince therwife they mulf depart from the naturalness and we would fay that inflead of an off-ditance they had reprefented picture or tapellrj therefore conclude that if nature require this in picture it is still more neceffary when we would have the picture taken for nature it feff in order to deceive even maffers but fome think — if iar- rive in the art to their heights shall be satisfied — in the mean time art delpairs of attaining greater luflre by further improve mments but to reaffume our former polition my opinion is that what has been faid ought to be regarded when we meet with any thing in halls chambers galleries and the like whether in niches above or in cbimseys of on other occations and the main point is to place well landskips the herizon according as the piece fands high or low my ufual prac- fice was to make the thickness of walls plainly appear in my paint- ings and would always have done it but on painting on time for lover of quality was obliged to alter it for his pleafure on surmife did it to fave work not for the good of it aftirming that the painting was thereby dock ’ and too much incumbered but the child muft have name he imagining that the alteration made the work look larger here let it not be thought that my piece was wholly taken up with the ordonnance and the thickness afterwards painted upon it becaute that would be great folly frft squared out the thickness and then adapted my delign thereto as being more convenient than afterwards to paint the thickness over it and thereby dock too much of the work now to give the findious artiff right notion as think how to compote good landskip after an eafy manner let him con- fider the nature of his subject what country he is to reprefent what seafon of the vear what month and what hour of the day whether the subject require sun or moon-fhine clear or mifty rainy or windy weather having fixed thefe points let him proceed to feek proper materi- ats bringing them together agreeable to his general design and dif poting the objects in their proper places each according to its na- ture and quality next let him place the point of sight in the middle of the piece higher or lower as he would have lets or more sky or ground con- fidering whether the ground is to be level or not and thus to order the figures equal with the eye to difcover directly whether the painting be leen thro an high window in low ground or from low ground to on bigh for tis commonly known that if things be feen from an height the figures ought to he under the herizen and when viewed from low place they mull rife above the horizen having done this let him chule proper light falling in either from before behind or afide to light the objects accordingly and then to difpole the principal object if posfible and the subject per- mil in the belt place in the midille of the piece at leat from off the edges of ir of landships book vi of divers pafam if the matter require it mean if the land ship be mixed with hiffery one ought to predominate and furpass the reft in greatness beasty and elegance filling always the greateff part of the piece with it whether by means of trees or build ings the by-io ts mult be foirable to it the becter to explain the riatter if the subject be wood it ought to be adorned with woodgeds giks or terms tonbs siats for refose weednymphs and many ther things groper to it if river it may be handled in the fame manner with the ad dition of river-gods nuiades or smimming water-nymphs fishermen swans and other jach ornaments if field be the chief object it may be fet off wich shepherds and sregherliffes couferds bacchanals and others rocks and cares require the fame management with this caution that the fye be taken with the principal object enly without other re- gard to the by-works than as aids and incidents for in fuch condud hes the beauty and goodness of landskip as to the ornaments of modern landship fuch as of the famous verdingen pynatker ruzsdaal meucheron and others who follow the atern manner they do not call for the aforefaid embellithments as having other fufficient matter viz cottages fishermen carriers waggons and tuch daily rural occurrences which are as proper to it as

military architecture will evidently difcover the prudent folly of the mafter tho otherwife excellent in alaaners chap of landskips ii of the light form and grouping of objects in landskips us now proceed further in confidering the principal qua- liries and properties requifite in fine landskip thefe in my opinion confiff in good difpolition of the irregular objects as well with re- srelt to their matter shape and form as their colour in the number and grouping them in good ordering of the light by well disposing the irregular objects we produce life and motion the objects confift of crooked frait awry high and low and by the colours we effect the fame when one thing is faint and weak ano- ther melcing this rrong that hard the grouping confitts in joining thofe irregular objects as of two bodies on two different grounds ther on the fore-ground ought to be maller than the other on the second thus if litting figure come forward flanding one muft be placed behind it and on the third ground decumbent figure on the fourth climbed one and be- yonud it fanding figure again csc trees rocks buildings cartle and other things occurring in landskip may be disposed in the same mlanner so far as concerns the irregularity of objects which in cheir matter and colour shall thew in the following example see platel suppofe then in piece five grounds with the offship of which the fourth is the largeft on the fore-ground place fuse of dark perfhiry number ’ on the second ground fountain number ’ on the third ground an hedge number ’ on the fourth ground starue number ’ and the fifth is fow offskif number ’ thus much may fuffice as to grounds going of behind each ther the same disposition ought to be obleived on singhe or level grounds as for the light its principal management lies in oppesing brown- efs and darkness to middling and greater light but when two lights are to fet off each other the bolour must effict this as for inflance when lighted figure is to come off againtt light oftship the for¬ mer mult certainly be of darkith colour as having no shade and then landskips vi then it will produce good effect for the chief management lies in placing warm-coloured objett againft light faint and weak ofship contrarily light and faint gelours againft dark and warm grounds the foremel and sirongef object againft the deepeft lointain and the objects furtter off againt nearer parts of the offship and thus light ob jects againtl dark and the contrary the artiil alloought to obferve that two lights muft never be above earb ofber unless one be rissbly different from the other in force er ther in coloar or tint left one feem to run into the other which at distance would be prepofterous union moreover part of the lointain should always be broken and the eye on one side or the other kept nearer eitber by means of wood rock building or other ob .. part of the herizon alfo should al ways be seen or for want of it some level object such as frenting wall colonude or the like this will produce satistaction to the eye and elegance in the piece no one will deny that anequal numbers are the most perfect ac cording to the demonftration both of philosophers and mathematicians this incquality alfo obferve and follow in my disposition of figures thus firfl place one figure on the fore-ground then three on the second tws on the third and foar on the fourth ground and then again one and to forth and thus as well on single level ground as where they happen one bebind another thefe unequal numbers in the grougs are certainly not of the leaft moment in landskips as to the colour mentioned before tis to be especially noted that the collar which is predeminant and has the chief place in the piece mult no where elle be feen than with little parts mean of less branty quantity and dignity chap iii of the byernaments in landships is nfual for landskip-painters to have particular inclination for one choice one affecting wild and defolate prospects another repoted and foff ones and third northern or frigid views sun and moon-fhine water-falls downs watry and woody prospects and the reafon is becaute moft people by rrange impulfe feem rather to covet the gifts of narure than the heaventy which afford what of landskips chap is whole and most perfett in word they feek only part the all be to be got this proceeds from touth and ignerance want- ing fundamental knowledge and therefore not judging what is most beautiful and profitable nay what they themselves are fit for but it is moff unaccountable that many landskip-painters are not able to em- bellith their own works to which fome may object that as they have not made it their practice to they are content with handling fin¬ gle prospects well leaving any thing elfe to the owner difpotal fad story that they can not do their work without help whence is evident of what moment if is for landskip-painter to embel- lith his own work whether the delign be his own or borrowed fince certainly if he be mafter of his art he mull allo know what is moft fuitable in his picture not triffes or figures to no purpose but hifteries fiftions or parables taken from scripture ovid or tejep ornaments which will enrich the work but this is feldom done be- caule few have time to pare or love reading as for me would rather want prints and drawings than books as an hiffory-painter make ufe of books and detcriptions of landskips and bealts but were landskip-painter should provide books of hisfory for what should be the better for exercifing one particular part of which am mafter and neglecting others as neceffary to be known need not learn what already know but tis impoffible to get skill in things without inquiring into them have time for peraling no- vels why not allo for neceffary things am curious to know the state of the war or defirous of peace for the sake of art of what advantage is the peace if do not qualify myfelf to meet it there are few or no painters who have no particular manner fo few are qualified for embellishment fince every one ftrives to excel in tomething and to get name by certain wenderfulness therein er ther by beautiful colours extravagant draperies broad and funny lights or round and dusky ones which offen poil work inffead of bettering it thefe they can not forbear their chief talent lying in them the they frequently have contrary effect when they are to adorn other men ’ works we mult alfo oblerve that there are twe sorts of byernaments the necelfary and the unnecesfary the necesfury are fuch as

you may go in the thest not to fall into the com- mon error out of which tis difficult to extricate yourfelf in treating of the immoveable by-ornaments we mull obterve that nothing is more difpleating in landskip than always to see houses be- kind againt the offskip and on the sides nothing but trees and hills or scarce so much as one stone upon another this repetition mult needs be difagreeable wherefore tis no wonder that thofe who are igno- rant of architeffure avoid it as much as postible but it is furprizing to me that many landskip-painters will not be acquainted with that art even rather never delire to exhibit it how beautiful foever than to be at the trouble of learning it or of following the models of others which are to plentiful and made for fuch purpofes point to eafily artainable and giving piece to great decorum have been long rudying the caule of it and can find no other than want of inclination and knowledge of its virtues and value tis eut of the way to think that landskips confift only of trees hills and green fields without houses or if there be buildings ruins or triumphal arches that then it is no mere landskip since no one will take an history in landskip for landship or piece with arckitefture and some trees for landskip or hiffory but prospect with buildings landskip fet off with an hundred fmall figures will never pats for figure- piece but

that men who pretend to great skill in painting landships incirely banith beautiful green out of their works and introduce in its place black vellow and other tuch colous iis true that plants and herbs differ as well in their natures and qualiries as chapes and colours that some are of beautiful green others blue some vellow or ruffet others grey some of fenny others of warry colour nevertheless art reaches us not to imitate the faded and mean but what is moft charming and agreeable in the diverfity aforefaid we fee the abject and the mean and the beautiful anl most beautiful if now it be faid that the artiff ought to exhibir every thing that is beautiful as well as the contrary and that he only apes nacure it but then he muft be an imitator of well-formed nature and elecantly paint her mot perfect parts but by my pofition that beautiful green is beff and moft charmif in landship let me not favour the perverfe opinions of some tha colours can not be too beautiful either in hiftory or landship do they exceeded nature irfelf of this have largely fpoken in the chap tor of the harmony and placing of colours for at that rare how cs landskips chap colour fet off

thofe two precious bodies richnels would not be apparent the proverb fays tenues ornant di- ademata cund that is the gold of crowns may beaft its native worth but meaner objects bring its lusire forth many painters have err ’ in this parricular of which shall give one inftance certain artiff had once painted landskip wherein the firft and second grounds and every thing belonging to them ap- peared beautiful and nacural but on the third ground all was grey and foul on this laft ground he had placed man in beautiful ut tramarine garment as bright as if he had been on the fore-ground he was told that thole two things were unnatural and oppolites mean soul and muddy green and so beautiful blue garment which was moreover as the man was walking in the sun painted as bright and beautiful in the shade as in the light tho the light should have been more broke but the main error lay in breaking the green of the ofskip too much and not at all bringing down the beautiful blue peffment tho at the same distance this example may fuffice to thew that the parts ought not to be broken or fouled to suddenty tho we fee it done by many in order to make the foremolt parts look beau- tiful and rrong

allo the sizes of their bodies ber or long and whether they grow ftrait or crecked in dry or uutry plices another ditticult point but which caufes the greateff decorum is the roundness or relief of

if on that occafion you light and heighten the uimoft edges it can add nothing to the relief becaute the light rounds off too faddenly and having once painted it too flrong you can not help it by glazing without muddling fince it will always appear diffind from the other parts as well in colour as nealncks there is alfo as great difference between the bodies of trees as their leaves fome are more beautiful and painter-like than others thefe again more ftrait and found those differing in colour from there cec but chief regard is not to place asp or linden-leaves on oaken bodies nor those

can not judge whether he be true one or how rich his thoughts are secondly becaule the artiff ought in his ordonnances to comply with the fancy of the preprietor as far as reafon and the rules of art and decorum permit as to the firft common nature thews him his error do we not behold sun fhine and fine weather with greater pleafure and attention after and can it have aless effect on our senfes in

objects well handled look allo very plealing in room thus we might as may fay thew the world in epitome and behold it at one view if painter always follow one manner how often will he expofe his weakness and incapacity if it be sunfhine what places will he find to fait all his pictures can he place them always in the sun in order to thew their naturalness but granting the work to be placed in luch light another unhappinets will hill artend it for the sun- light will fall into the pilture from side and the real sun fhine will come upon it fronting from which premifes tis apparent that the common light is not only neceffary but always the moll advantageous for chamber- pieces good painter ought to be prudent in the difpolition and choice of his work carefully obferving the nuture of the place that his art may not disjoin but aid the archicecture making his landships landskips book vi order to lock like nature the further they are from the light of the reem so much lighter than those which are near it for otherwife they will look but like piftures the second confideration which is great addition to ornament respelts the fellowing or matching the pictures well and tho matching pieces be very well known yet many people entertain wrong notions about them their opinions touching what is necelfary in fellowing- picture are various but they generally agree that it confitts of an umformiry of conception and difposition of objects colour and light to which fome add that if one landskip be flat country the other ought to be the fame if one be rocky the other ought to be to roo in thort they mult be to much alike that on coming to gether the one feems to be an impreffion of the other in both qual sky equal by-ornaments equal filling nay to very equal that there mull not be white speck in the one but the other muit have if allo my belief is that chefe niceties are owing to the wilfulness of arrifts and that in matching piffure nothing more is requifire than an equal point of sight and unifermity in the figures when it mut bang at like height with the other he who would join the reft of the particulars feeks the fifth wtheel on waggon for why affer fatisfying my curiofity in viewing colicary wildernets should not enjoy the pleature of pleafant plain or woody landskip in op polinon to an agreeable warer-view and delightful prospect think the word felfows fufficiently implies that they are two pictures of equal size alike framed receiving the same light whether the hang above of next each other motly alike filled with work and the figures of equal magnitude and leffening towards the peint of sight and as for the thoughts or defign the more different they are the more agreeable and the better thewing the richnets of the mafters and ar- fancy in

largely treated of the lights in the prece- ding book yet find myself obligated to fay fomewhat about it with respect to landskips especially frent-lights in picces which face windows this point purzles many painters and not without caufe fince tis critical proof of their capacities the chief reafon of this is that arcifts will not venture to under- take any think that is unprecedented and no one has courage enough to fet the example they plead main difficulty arifing from hence namely that having front-light they can not make shades on the ground or objects but mult find their effects going off and force on- ly by the darkeft touches if the driving clouds did not caule large ground-fhades which daily experience thews they do in the next place thefe men tacitely confels their ignorance of the force and har- mony of colours in chuling dark objects againft light ones and the contrary for placing againtt an offskip of green trees light colour- ed objects fuch as whice rofe-colour light and frong vellow and the like you have so need of large shades would you make ob jects againt light coloured building let them be of dark colours or vafe of warm and brown colour and againtt it lighter ob- ject again and againtt the offskip the foremoll work is made flrong by the diminution of the tints fince all that goes back or retires be- comes darker and more dusky as the shades on the contrary grow fainter and weaker the further they are off again the grounds themfelves can afford us great helps one may be light vellow ano- ther green another bluith according to their qualities as we shall further thew as to the figures they may have fufficient and natural side-ade for fetting them off for thofe which are on the side of the piece which moft goes away from the light will receive much more shade than the middle ones as allo ground-shade becaute they go to much aside from the point of sight and the further the more we conceive alfo that if any houles or other upright works running towards the point of sight were placed quite on the side the one high and the other low as here grotto with viflo there again fome- thing elfe with ruflicated stone or ballultrades coc and before them nn water of landskips book vi water along the extremity of which some vafes or figures were standing on pedeftals thefe objects fay altho they had no perfect shade yer with respect to the light would fuffice and moreover throw ground hades againlt each other which would give the whole york great dicorum and elegance if it be objected that this management would caufe too great force on the objects without the piece and make it look empty in the middle and the eye of courfe be drawn too much to the side more- over the rce corners of the piece would then be too confining antwer that if the ordonnance be difpoted on fuch ground as aforelaid and the coloars well chosen and ordered the large light in the middle will be found the prongel and the side-work more close and compact and by ordering some pedeftals with vafes here and there againtt the large and broad shades of the buildings they would produce fine ested many dare not introduce any ground thades on the fore-ground in fuch froming light in order to break kctle that large light and make it goot alledging tharthe wall covers it and thinking that no more ground-thade can be feen on the ground than that of the wall but thefe menare much mistaken they sland and behold the place but do not corfder what is built over their heads what high stories and what large ground skales thofe tkings ought to cause on the fore-ground going of which ther mult imagine to be feen without doors above the opening of the piece for tho it fland againtt plam wall yet it attully reprefents an incire open pannel

asked whether the figures in the middle which on this occafion make the principal light ought not to be altogether or always the major part of them in the shade to which lastwer that the heught or lowness of the house must govern in that point for if it be of landskips high the ground fhade will be longer if low-roof ’ neither fo long nor broad this method to far as it relates to frenting-pieces is as well founded as helpful and tho never prattifed tis however not to be rejected butno body will lead the way without feeing the examples of others and yet every day as we walk in sun -thine we may make this obfer- vation in nature the sun thews us examples enough moreover tis natural in viewing things rather to have the sun behind than in our faces and yet many reprefent the sun-light behind in the picture and not one does it fronting as having no knowledge of the natures and effects of colours nor of making lightness and darknels againtt pro- per grounds and confequently do not underfland due harmony pourtrait and bats releif painters dare venture to do it and find to much advantage in it as thereby beft to deceive the eye to their great honour if the artiff think he

the further they go off fidewise from it the broader are the sbades did not propofe to favany thing further about the lights and their qyalnes but in the courfe of wruing fomething of moment touch ing them sill occurs to my thoughts which think worthy of ob fervation as being to uncommon that doubt whether any inftance has been before given of it it is touching the air or common light falling from on figh thre an opening into round and close temple or any place of retirement rocky reposstory for the dead cec luppole the open ing as the delign will permit now we have formerly thewed that common light contrary to that of the sun illuminates the objects with widening rays wherefore all things going away from the center of the round tempie have longer and narrower ground-udes as the nearer the laid center the porter even to much as if flanding julf under or upon that center they give not any ground-shade at all except under foot on the contrary it will be found that fuch ob- jeltsreceive fronger light from on high than thofe which go off fide wife and the further they go off fill the less vet we perceive the contrary in the reflexions from the ground the more the objects ap proach the center the lighter they are in reffexions be the ground even whire or blue red or vellow light or dark as for the courfe of the ground-chades of the objects let them fland where they will on the aforefaid plan or ground they flow from the center or middle point directly under the light chap of landskips ix of landships in small compass have formerly afferted that reprefentations in small com- pass are necelfary as general rule for all choices which we shall exemplify in landskips on almoft the fame balis as that of hifery to wit that there is difference between landskip in fmall compass and the contrary and that the former is much more artful and troublefome than the latter tho having lets circumflances to which we shall fubjoin the requilites necellary to borh in order to make each in its kind equally good together with remark touch- ing the by-ornaments as to landskips in general they are as we have thewed in the same caleas hiftories to wit that large ordonnance in fmall compais carries more aart knowledge and elleem than the contrary becaute the objects require more work and more plain and dittinct ex- prestion of their qualiries which in fmall objects in large com- pass is not fo nicely requilite for the nearer we approach the objects the more fentible they become as in hifories variery of thoughts and objects occur for compoling ordonnances either imall or large with go even an figures in palaces halls galleries towns villages in the field and woods so in landship offer an intinity of objects for making fine views both in small and large compass fuch as woods plains rocks wilderneffes common roads buildings fountains and statues folitary places with tombs and groftos sea-ports caicades or water-falls in order naturally to exhibit theren all sorts of occurrences the herokc and pafforal as well as the fatyric mournful joyful and merry and tho we could order all the aforefaid particulars into one piece yet they can not pro- duce fuch an effect in reference to art as each lingly will do it be ing certain that things feen from afar as we have formerly obfer- red never fatisfy curioficy fo well as thofe which are near whereby they become to us more diffinct as well in their exifience and form as colour we know that the more the objects diminith and go off from us the more they abate of their lirclenelles not only in their superficies but alfo in their out lines and sways trees body full of holes and knots appears fmooth and even at diftance even the book vi of landskips crooked will feem almoft ftreight and the whole leafing as one mate iis true that large and concife landskip does not give general yet we know that an affembly of few out people of fa gm will never break up without doing buliness when con- trarly meeting of the vulgar feldom does any thing without con- fution irs the fame in mulick with many voices they make great noife but never affect the senfes like the single voice of fine toman accompanied with the basso centinue which incirely charms us make us ligh even fometimes thed tears and this is only cauted by the force which les in sole fupported by the bass by the diltinctness of the words tweerly utter ’ and lattly by their senfe or pattion all which is not to be found in great concere becauie we cannor underfland the words much less the sente bur fix our attention on the general harmony only it is true great performance of mufick will pleafe common senfe but an artful sol is for people of judgment the former does in some meafure af feet the body but the latter rouches the soul and leaves lafting im- prefficus the principal difference between small and great landskips lies in the peint of sight in the great in small compass the horizon is commonly fomewhat low and in the small in large compass high in one is high ground in the other valley the one is natural reprefentation and the other looks like map the one keeps good decorum let it hang ever fo high and every thing looks upright in the other all teings teem to be tumbling and it appears well no longer than while on the eafil in great landskip in fmall compats all is ieen plain and diftinct at leall one part according as the choice is in the small in large compass we can perceive nothing perfectly but the general parly becaute the great light creates faintness and partly becaule the piece is viewed at great diltance as hanging commonly above other paintings tis even certain maxim that as pitures never hang below the eye unless in an auction to land ship with an high horizon mult always needs be falfe leave the contrary to any one judgment how much more decorum and advan tage it hes when of fuch an extent as to be placed high or low ever up to the cieling without fear of being hung below the eye when the other muft find its comfort under its fer height without hope of ever gaining its decorum unlets by coming calually on the ealel again affel of landskips having thown that great landship in small compass with low horizon can bear hanging above the eye and look be- coming and that small one in rarge compass becaute of the high horizon lofes its true quality to the detriment of the paint er we conclude that there is no better method to be uled with landship of large extent in order to make it becoming and natural chan to fet as aforefaid the horizon fomewhat lower fince fuch pieces are always placed above may fay far above the eyc but here perhaps difficulty may be ffarced namely that if the horizon be let to low the sky will over-power the principals of the pilture but in antwer let me ask whether the sky is to be look ed on as an ufelets parch does not the sky moft adorn and invigo- rate landskip and make it look agreeable mult we suppofe the earth to excel the heavens in magnitude ay but fay they there is nothing to be seen in the sty.—— but is beautiful sky tuch triffe and to eafily to be painted is it not more artful to reprefent thin driving clouds than flat ground here and there an hill or plath of water grass or herbs beautiful sky is proof of good malter but if it feem too large we have an help for that make the fore-ground fomewhat large and then treeor tco thick or thin- leav ’ will take up enough of the superfinicy and break any thing that is obttrulting likewife building may ferve either fronting of in profile or inflead of it pyramid or obelisk thefe not to be flung into the offskip according to ufual practice but brought on the fore-ground great and firong letting the tops of thote objects ad vance high in order to fill and thereby as have faid in some mea- fure here and there to break the sky but here it may be again ob- jelted that fuch larse trees would not look fine becaute their leaf ing can not be feen but is the leafing of tree of more value than the top of beautiful building pyramid or any fuch uncommon ob- jell muft thefe give place and be left out for the fake of tree would it not look wonderful and be great pity that one in an hun- dred should lofe its leafing let one two or more boughs fhoot forth there are enough without them fay then that by this means the shy will be sufficiently filled and the difficulty removed nd now the sky is moderated and the greateft force lies in the landskip and by-ornaments the fore ground is eleganrly embelliffied the offskip broad and deep with an excent equar to my with and the hotizon tich as need not fear the rumbling of the objects vi of landskips peak of placing forwards great trees elovated buildings prramids and large figares for by-ornaments fome may poffibly fay that then the greand goes down bebinl and rises forwards fince they can not relith any thing they are not ufed to and which requires the objects to be fomewhat more finithed and larger than in their common way but altho have thus thewed the preference of one manner of painting before the other yer do not prefcribe it as law to be al wars followed my delign is only to illustrate what is fine in the one abore the other ch ap of painting reems with landskips hin this point to be of moment and weighty enough to be contidered with attention the rather fince some painters often happen to fee different management with respect to the rules for painting halls parlours cc and therefore can not refolve on what is molt fntable and advantageous for thofe apartments and when they are to perform fomething therein to many difficulties arife and their opinions fomuch vary that they are at sland whether they shall re- prefent picture or painting in the manner of tapestry or ny ture itfelf as to the firl sort we muft be fenlible that the piltures being all of size and placed orderly will be taken by the knowing for abaratted painings breing no relation to the room according to the notions of thofe who being mafters of good collection are indif ferent where ther pictures hang whether againtt bare walls or hang ings as to the fecond sort is certain that paintings made in the manner of tafefiries will never be taken for real iapeftries be their borders ever to beautiful and elegant and therefore have not the ef feet which the mafter purpofes the third sert to reprefent narure is certainly the betl for what can be wanting when the work is natural artful and proper to the place reprefentation of tapeltry is lame picture and picture not agreeing with natare and the place is alfo deficient wherefore mafter who paints fuch is unpardonable becaufe inftead of dorning the room and preserving its arcbiteffenic order he at once spoils bott ivas landskips chap was one time asked whether any certain rules befides the light and point of sight were neceltary for hall-painting antwered that the architecture ought to be observed throughout as far as concerned the compartition and ornaments and that whether painted or real they mult correfpond with the deor mantle-piece and alcore and the whole work take its proportion from one order that it may look proper and make up one compact body now if wall were to be covered with fingle picture it mult be handled in the manner of an hlang- ing but picture is fomewhat more brittle than tapetiry and fooner damaged by hanging to low chairs mull not be fet againtt it if it get hure or dents they are not eafily repaired surbafe is much better and belides the wall is fomerimes to long that it can- not well be feen at one view wherefore when the dillance is too imall it is better to divide the wall and to ufe more than one point of sight if now there be door in the middle or on each side they ought to be left free tho they are without mouldings and even with the cloth for the room mult have at leaff one pallage but not painted over according to the practice of some with trees hills or stone- work as if it were not there very common error and which no mafter will jultify unlets he have greater eye to preft than the general elegance of the werk wherefore tis more advitable to enrich the deor or doors with fine mouldings or ornaments if the deor happen to come in the middle beautrful frontispiece adorned with carving will look magnificent this in order to fave buildingchar ges might alfo be reprefented on cloth yer some artifis who are not uted to it will not eafily be induced to undertake ir but rather to much more landskip tho on due confideration and for the lake of decorum and naturalness they had better call in the affiftance of an other hand for their help when now there happens to be door but not in the middle it will be proper for obtaining regularity to order alfo one on the other side unless it be even with the wall and the moulding of the surbafe run cross it in which cafe you may make fomething or other on its upper part fuiring with the land ship fuch as stone with batsrelief either diffant or near lay jou may do fo but for my part should not much like it where- fore my opinion is that two doors are much better than none and tho you might neverthelels incline to the laff propofal in order thus to have larger piece yet tis inconfiffent fince the cieling muft have its support according to its comparement under each suim mcf landskips book vi mer ought to be fomething either pilafter or term or elfe the piece mst bave circular head but rooms are feldom to ordered perhaps becaute fome men love to engross all the gain to themfelves exclutive of the affictance of others and were some permitted to do as they pleale they would paint over every thing with flowers fruit or ejfory an architecture painter every where mouldings they may even in time go fuch lengths that could the floor be paint- ed as well as the cieling we should fee in every stone either flower-por viilo or an hinery as fomerimes we fee it in lron chets fay then that an arciit tho the whole work be undertaken by him only muit not incroduce more of his particular branch into it than reafon and decorum require taking the affictance of friend in tuch parts if there be any as he has not tiudied for variety re frethes the eye think an hall or room with one sort of pittures like shop wherein are fold but one sort of goods to give an in ftance ler us suppofe room with side-wall go feet long divid ed into three pannels and the surbafe round the room and the pi lafters between the pannels to be either of painting or wood as it proper and ever the chimney propese piece with figures tho landskip painter undertake the whole work but not being able to manage the chimney-piece defire the affiftance of figure painter becaute generous painter if he expect praife and honour mult not so mach regard his gain as the decoram of the room cloth of or feet more or less in fixh grand undertaking is but triffe ler another hand get fomething by it if it tend but to the or nament of the work iorder figure-piece over the chimney be caute tis the principal place of the room for what buliness can have there the herison whereof ought to be without naj much lower than the pirture wherefore in to principal place nothing would be seen but sky we are very fentible that if in fuch room we reprefent na- ture we can not introduce into one pannel morning into the fe cond ahid day and into the third an evening nor wfe various cour rries all mult have one and the fame ir we grant that were the room comparted into four pannels we could exhibit the sour cardinal poists or the four seafons provided each fiece had parti tuler point of sight as for the difficulty of the left and right light to which the side pieces mull needs be subjett and the light falling on the wall fronting from of landskips ii from the windews we have fufficiently fpoken of it in the book of lights and shades and now if throughout we fee continued or natural landship the ir alike and the leafing of the trees running from one into the other when they are extenfive enough imagine the painting mult look well and nature and art be fully facished if am not followed by every body am fufficiently honoured by doing juffice to art and the cu- rious chap xl of ornamental painting without deers ft er having treated of room-painting with landskip think this the fircelt place to peak of ornamental painting with- out-doors this point is very ufeful for two realons firft be- caule by certain paintings adapted to places we difcover what sort of places they are and what ufes put to secondly becaute it will be of service to arcifts frequently concerned in painting viftos foli- afe and other things withourdoors in leading them to further thoughts think it moft proper to ornament summor-houfes which are at the ends of walks and ufually benched with grottes set of with fi- gures and fountains bur shallow and side jummer-houfeslook beft with bassreliefs of darkith colour in houses of pleafure for drink- ing talk or other amufements fuit grottes fountains figures urns and pases the ends of galleries become architeftonic views and the piers between the windows niches atth fifures and bassreliefs according to the thickness of the wall in gateways having rooms on each side figures and bassreliefs are proper as alfo fine archi- tetture fet of with terms and other fuch things yet on the sides and sofitas of windows ought to be foliage only but to return to the summer-bouse-painting we mult confider that as the kinds are various to there fuit to each particular reprefenta- tions as will in defign as colours according to the different lights if the building be square and have the opening in the middle and the painting exhibic bass-relief the light ought to be frenting but if it be cdole roafed the light muft come more from below again it this building be desg or the opening which gives if light far from the wall it ought to be lighted mesity from the reffexion of the ground icl.. of landships vi yet if the cpening be wide the light may proceed someribat from the sik but contrarily when the summerhoufe is shallow or the opening near and one part of the painting is in the light and the other in shade its own natural reffexion mut be seen in the sbady part that the work may look like real garred bassrelief and becaute no tendernels or pleafaniness can be ufed in it as being in sback think the parts there ought to be handled fomewhar more large and rong mean with few littleneses in order to make them cor ex and for preventing confulion that at further di rance the work may look becoming thus much as to light the coloars in this cafe if well chosen and put together add no small ludre of thefe think the three folloxing sorts the molt pro- per namely free fore blue stone and chite mharble by reafon of the grcens of the bulding which cover ir and commonly bade the pining and impart to it more or lets of their colour which how ever looks lovely and fweet especially upon the whirs the twoo- thers blus and free fone may be used for by-works fince purple vi olet or red can not have here proper place by reafon of the dif cordunt green producing an inharmoniou mixture but if ckan light fall on the painting without being shaded then the three laft named colours appear well as does alfo fleh-colour and have with the green good effet as being by means of it improved and the green thereby becomes beautiful and lively especially when pla- ced between blue fione ornaments which every where unite with the green and keep together but in this management let me be underffood to fuppofe the summer houle to be wide where what has been faid is on each side next the opening without painted on boards giving little of no shade in the painting ought alfo to be confidered its shape whether cir- cular square offanguler oral or any other which will beft fuit there as for the subjects or designs they mult be governed by the sity- ation of the place flowers are facred to flora the spring to veaus fruits to pomona fines to bacchus herbs to iiculapius corn to ceres musck to rpollo who is alse the parent of the seasons procreation to priapus and fruitfulness to diana from thele heads may be drawn abundance of matter for the ornament of summer houles now to be more plain in what have before afferted shall ex hibit two examples for landskips ii for the one place zephyras and florg in the middle of square or round piece as occalion requires thefe are both feen fronting my- cually embracing in lovely manner he fitting on her right side has his lett arm about her neck with his right hand holding hers which refls on his knee and the peaking to him very friendly and lovingly almoll mouth to mouth her head inclines over the right shoulder wich her left hand the is taking up wreath out of basket of flowers her lap ways to the left and his to the right and between them are fitting one or two cupids twilling garland about fiaming torch he is almofl naked and winged having trumper lying by him she is airily and finely dreft the other example confifts of three figures and exhibits florg on the right side pomony on the left and apollo in the middle touching his lyre and firring fomewhat above the two others flora has corne copie full of flowers and pomonas is filled with fruits and the holding pruning-knife apollo fits fronting fforg looks forward with finger on her mouth and pamona as in surprize tolfes her head backwards and fideways thefe goddeffes fit in profile againtt each other the by-ornaments round about confift of childrenor capids such defigns as thefe especially the former are moft proper in flower-gardens but where there are moy fruits pomong takes place here you mult oblerve that order thefe two compolitions for bass- reliefs fomewhat more than half rising and lighted fronting but when the light comes from side they ought to be very faint or little re- lered as we shall further illuftrare in the book of statuary treating of the three sorts of bass-reliefs in flower-gardens fuit bed diffant vizes or groves contrarily in walks with trees the ornaments should be rivers sea-bavens with hills buildings rocks and fuch like as they are not shaded by trees bit receive pure and open light vet in summer-houfes and places for rql which are fomewhat thaded by the greens viffes are not proper but rather bass-reliefs contilting of one two or three grounds on the court-yard walls between the houle and garden fuit alfo fuint bass-refiess of one or other of the colour ’ stones aforelaid like- wile terms urns and vafes with greens in cale no natural ones be there or elle fountains with their water-falls againt green hedge or wall fuit well circular hellows with bufts in them if alto thereabout fland no natural ones thefe bults may be painted of wbite or light red marble or other light-coloured sione the landships book vi the plaes before -mentioned are the principal and moff common bit feldom happen to be together yet if they should the methods aforefaid will be of uic and you may enrich your thoughts by their means tince they are laid down as well for hints as examples and if vou allo confult the fine deligns of le patre you will never be at gard but the better to aid the conceptions of young mafter willngly fibjon another ordonnance of my own invention as follows place txrs in the middle of the piece fitring quite naked between povins and flera this latter flands on her right side crowning her with chaplet of flowers and pomond on her left offers her branch of peanes which jenas receives with her left hand who tisting high and almok rrair maincains fine air and charming de- portment and this by her tripliciry affording an agreeable har mony of barky smell and tagre for here beauty implies sight and if the place be higher than broad you may join apotto to their company fomewhat off and fainter fitting playing on cloud and thus you may in the moft proper manner exhibic the five senfes however apelo is not to abfolurely necelfary here fince venus or beauty alfo implies harmony but bring in pomong becaute fruits and flowers generally go together for flowers grow and appear all the vear round as well as the frusts in summer and autumn there are allo fruits which bloffom at the fame time as the flowers do to wit peaches apricots almonds cer in pimfical and kirchingarden would place esculapins the son of spells god of phyfic as the principal of the piece and to whom the gardenis facred flanding in the middle between apolle and diamy the one with his quiver at his back fits on his right hland or near him hold ing sceptre topp ’ with sun or elle hlaming torch and the ther on his left adorned with moon either on her head or in her hand and equipp ’ with her bow and arrows sculapins holds staff rwined with serpent the moen or earth caules the seed to rot which apolls or the sun by his warming and fearching inflvence caules to rife as to phifical herbs three firtues are alcribed to them warming and coot ing and nixture of both thefe may be appolitely reprefented by the aforefaid three perfons fince by asculuprus with his staff twin ed with serpent is underflood prudence in moderating one herb by another and by art to make them work their effects having of landskips ii having thus largely handled this point shall confirm it by fome figural examples respecting what has been before faid in order to thew what sort of paintings and ornaments are moft proper in fuch places where we ufually reprefent any thing and which mult govern careful mafter in order to make his deligns conformable thereto obferve then beginning with the firff skerch what shall further if the proprietor be defirous of having the place painted all round what sort will be the moft proper colours or bass-relief what obfractions may be there to hinder the nacuralness of the work in some deligns at what diffance it ought to be feen either from without or within fince it muft be executed boldly or neat accordingly whether the painting is to remain there conflantly winter and summer yow fee then in the firtt example of plare lii place inclofed by two side walls at the end of which is summer-house equal to the whole breadth the entrance into it is in the middle and on each side is an opening through which the reprefentations of and the one on the right and the other on the left receive their light as the middle piece has it fronting over the summerhoule and wall appear the tops of the hindbuildings now the quettion is what subject is proper for villo or balsrelief green pro- spett such as woody country of flower-garden would have no good efielt in this green summer-house when feen from without where it ought to be viewed becaufe mixture of green with green affords nerther variety nor delight sea-baven or court adorned with statues fountains cafcades and fuch like elegancies would appear exceedingly fine vieiwed from within for thole colours look well among the green but feen at its proper diftance without they will be found to be falfe and contrary to nature by reafon of the tops of the houses which being behind and rifing above them difcover general step- page whence it follows that nothing is more proper for the middle- piece than bass-relief let us now confider what is beft for the two side-pieces seen from within the one as faid recieving its light from the left and the ther from the right bass-relief can not in my opinion be deco jous there becaute the eye mult not be to clofely confined they ought to be viffes as not having the inconvenience which attends the middle piece to hinder their naturalnets the summer-poute be- no landskips vi ing roofed in the light therefore falls more advantageous on thefe two places than the middle one as being without the glare of it wherefore viffes mult be beft there and even the fainter and blser the bewer as before intimated an hoven with shipping court with fountains ilands with hills street-view of fine buildings temples and galleries together with blue ofship cc thele are very delightful objects and produce between the greens variety and decorsm now we ought to obferve that the two pieces and tho they receive their light from the place yet if we plcafe may be lighted etterwise becaute they are without-deer-prospetts having communication with this within door place as the bats-relief has which is confined to it thus much as to that side the fame obfer vations are proper for the sides and the fecond example in plare lll aforefaid exhibits garden with parterres alfo walled in in the middle is gate of letticed work and on each side shallow letticed seat covered over with greens noted and in the back of each seat is circutar re presentation and over them appear the tops of irees as of large orchard marked now let us confider what subjects will be mott proper for the seat and firft then obferve the diftance whence the work is to be feen which is from without on the nearfide of the parterres here as in the preceding example viffes are not proper and becaute the place is to full of green more green would not look well wherefore balf-raifed bass-reliefs would be beft as for the cclear we have before prefcribed it the sides may allo be afforned as before in the laff example oblerving what objects rife be bind and above them here on one side are hloules and on the ther green wall behold now third sketch in plate lill difcovering walk with trees at the end of which flands the painted object herein you have great liberty and may ule your pleafure fince the defign flands free from any obftruction this only is to be noted in it that be caute tisalong walk and in nature itfelf we are oftentimes tired with travelling fuxh an one we have no occation to make it longer by perspect- ive and other views tur rather slop the walker by fine prospett and in wite him to little contemplation and refl that he may afterwards the better go forward wherefore we bere

proper subjects for the place and fuitable to the occation you may alfo paint fome terms on boards cut away and place them againtl green wall en both sides of the niches windows or circu- lar hollows wherein may be fet bults or calls as you fee in the fe- cond example of fuch colours as before-mentioned and which ap- pear lovely among the green thefe terms may reprefent eaccha- nals satyrs gods

but as much as poftible rouze and enrich their genins have pitch ’ on this sub ject for the ornament of landskips and tho it be common yet question whether it was ever handled in fuch manner idr vide it into three ordonnances the firtt is venus making love to him the second his taking leave of ber to go hanting or ratber to be killed and the third her finding him dead the fable is this venus was according to the poets very much enamoured with the vouth idenis notwichflanding his celdnels and infentibility and yet he refrained not from kiffing and careffing her for seafon which much incented mars and raifed his jealouty and rage as often as he law the vouth in her lap tbe first ordennance the place opens pleafant and agreeable country ffored with very thing that can delight the eye woods hhills valleys rivers and stone-work except houses and temples fer the point of sight ii p landskips vi in the middle of the piece between it and the left side on an hil lock place the goddess and her

to reprefent the month of may or the spring when every thing is coming forth and bloffoming tho am very fentible that the green of the trees by the diverfity of co- lour is in the summer more painter-like however this mult not be like summer belides the ifland of cyprus is not like helland or other cold countries where the greens come up late for otherwife should not introduce basket of fruit now if it be asked becaufe sill fet on the large pedeftal vale and that directly againtt the hillock where venus and adonis are with the graces whether this would not throw very large ground-fhade over thofe figures fay it would not becaute af- fign the sun meridian alrude moreover do not fet the pede- ral to near the hillock as to be any obftacle to the figures the foremoll tree becaute it rifes to high can alfo as littie prejudice them its ground-hade paffing by them over the willow in the cor- ner or at leaft part of it which makes the colonade againtt which it preads fall back tho the trees behind the hillock can fufficiently effect the fame fince make them either dark green or elfe in shade and the little leating hanging over the lovers in the light in order thus to have below tome darkness for fetting off the lovers my incention being to place that group directly in the jun in order to have there the principal light but here may be reproved on suppolition that alt counter to my own polition namely that in sun-shine people do not sland talk- ing without sbading their eyes which do not deny but let it be confidered that the gods are not fubject to human frailties and therefore they can look againtt the sun and to folve the difficulty with respect to adonis who is not god make his upper parts in shade receiving agreeable and rrong reffexions from venus and the graces from whence arifes another difficulty namely by what means this ground hade can fall on him only fince they are fitring to clofe to gether that venurs arm is about his neck and one of his hands preffes her breaft and therefore the mull needs take part of the same shade to which anfwer that there are means enough by one thing of landships vi thing or other to find that shade and as for venss the may be to dispoted either litile backward or forward as to receive light nough now that alars and eary at the stone-work may not draw the eye too much from the principals by making them in the light bring not much sun into that quarter mean that fet the foremoff whole seem of the tree and great part of the hind mofl with part of mars in ground chade occafioned by fomething wirboat the piece and to let that shade run on the fore-ground jutt to the low wall breaking the relidue here and there fomewhar with buthes and shrubs might alfo place there priapus-term of other object in order lictle to fill that corner we have before faid that neither ffoufes nor temples muft enter the composition why not they fay fome as well as the terml to which that the fable makes no mention of any fuch objects and let me ask who should live in the houfes lis not faid that adonis tho man had any houthold or that he worshipped in temple this piece may be richly embellished with ten or twelve figures tho afars and enny are but partly figures some landskip-paint ers may poffibly object againtl fo great number for that thote well execuced would better become an hiffery than landskip but the aniwer is ealy the figures are fmall and the landship large we shall now proceed to the colours and aftions of the figures we reprefent tenas in her linnen yet with her opper-parts and legs almoft bare under her on the grass appears part of light red garment adonis garment is greenith blue or dark violet the two groces standing next to venys are drest in light coloured garments of changeable sruff and broken colours preferving about that group great mats of light for which reafon chule fich colours as do not caute any unteemly reffexions in the carnation of venss or adonis her garment who is crowning veus with chaplet is rofecolour second more forward and with one knee bent is in whire and has flower in her hand and the third hav- ing the fruits and flanding on the left side and fomewhat higher on the hillock has an furera or straw-coloured garment we need not fay much about mars and envy fince cafar ripa relates enough conching them nothing is more proper for mers than rulty fil lemot of blood colour ’ coat and for exny than black one as of landskips chap for the motions of venus and adonis they are fronting in both but their feet more or lets turned to the light donis on the right side inclines his upper-parts towards venys with his right hand on her breaft and his right shoulder coming for- wards his under-parts are fronting and his left leg excended and his right drawn in as if he were about to rife his face froncing in clines little over his shoulder to the child who blows the horn contrarily venus relling on her right thigh applies in some mea- fure both her knees to his extended leg her face in profile turn- ed cowards him fronts the sun her breaft is alfo feen fronting the draws back her left elbow in order to prets his hand on her brealt on due confideration thefe two figures will be found to have and ealy contraft or oppofition in motion fince have en- deavoured to give myfelf full satisfaction touching all the actions exhibired before fet the layman but mult return again to the ordonnance forgot to place two children behind the foremoft low wall of whom the one is leaning over it and with finger on his mouth and head funk is thew- ing the other the fleeping river-god place them there firft for decorums sake and fecondly in order to break in some mea- fure that long and fliff piece of stone-work the watergod is of brownith vellow hue almofl as dark as the faid stone-work and for two reafons firil for the sake of repofe and secondly to prevent mass of light there with the children to the detriment of the principal belides further purpofe to adorn the pedeltal of the vafe with balsrelief reprefenting bacchanol or dancing nymphs and tho it come in shade yet affign it frong reffexions there ought allo to beadded one of two dogs afleep of which the one awak ing ftares back with prick ’ up ears at the sound of the horn have before faid that one of the graces should be dreffed in whire but now caff beautiful blue veil over it as proper to break the srength of the white piece thus executed is fufficient for the production of many others especially if we duely confider how many things are obter- red in it which by few is taken notice of the qualiry of each figure iis origin or emblematic signification coc many fictions are painted from the poefs dekcription but few people weigh the writ- ors meaning tho attended with an explanation which however is oaly general without the ddition of the circumftances tho well known of landships vi khnown to the writer as the shapes dreffes colours paffions and other remarkables ii hence wemay conclude what mult be the cafe of thofe men who do not make themfelves mafters of all thefe things and how eafily they may miftake even pervert the senfe of the writer or poec if the fact lay in the spring they reprefent it in summer if in winter-morning they exhibit an aurumn-evening ought the pening to be folicary place or wilderness they will incroduce di vertions should any perfon have red drapery as proper to him is made blue yellow coc we grant that the fable may be re prefented plain enough and who the charaffers are and wrat they are doing prefently conceived but the drift of it is wanting iis unnecellary to enlarge on this table or ordonnance further than to oblerve that mars here figaines vengeance adonis the winter and jenss the spring which is the realon why thefe two latt can- not agrec the poets wrife that there were four who went under the name of fenus the firlt was the daughter of calum and the day the fe cond was brought forth of the frorb of the sea being conceived in morber of pearl and conduted to cypras by the airy eepbyrs ii was the who bore capid to afercury the third was the daughter of tupiter and dione who was wedded to valcan chief of the cuckolds and the fourth was the syrian called aftarte who courted the love of adonis and to whom solemon erected allars to pleafure his concubines whence we may judge what great dilparity there is between thefe fenuss asfor the wild bear it implies the night lgnorance impiety fil sbiness lewdness cc the second ordonnance or sequel of the foregoing story when adonis was now tired with kiffing and flattery or to fay better when his forrowful fate drew near and the dogs fcenting the boar fet up cry he deaf to venur intreaties wretted from her embraces and jumped up eager for sport we muft previoully underfland that we are obliged to confine our felves to two principal points namely the general disposstion and the ligbt and tho on due confideration it may poffibly feem to be cholenless advantageous than if it were fingle piece which willing ly allow yet as it now ferves to motch anotber it therefore requires the same light tho revers ’ one might better become it becaute then landskips chap should be at greater liberty but even then the dispesstion would not be different enough from the former we have in the book of ordennance thewed that when two pieces hang together they ought to have certain conformity efoecially landships with small figures as if for inftance the heaviell work be in the one on the right side and the viftoon the left in the other or matching-piece it mult be contrary and yet notwithflanding that neceffity or rule which however fublifts find fomething which gives me greater satisfaction and better expreffes the seafe as may appear in the sequel place as in the preceding ordonnance the point of sight in the middle of the piece and on the right side an eminence alcended by or steps fronming or parallel with the horizon upon it at the end againl the oftship reprefent an open niche almoll quare and compals headed adorned on both sides with pilaffers fupporting but elegant cornice here and there fomewhat broken about the niche hang feltoons of poppies which are fatten ’ to the crown of the niche and being buttoned up on each side their ends en- twined hang down together thro this niche having seat before it we difcover an agreeable view of woods lawns rivers roads co this eminence takes up third part of the piece running off keep on the inner side forwards againtt the steps which are moff= ly in shade by trees without the picce to the corner whereon flands the goddels we place her gilt chariot drawn by two pidgeons on the left side between the point of sight and the frame of the piece fland or great
