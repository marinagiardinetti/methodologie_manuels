elements of with crayons by john russell in tenui labor — virgil london printedfor wilkie in st. paui church-yard an walter at charing-cross mdcclxxii to his grace the duke of chandos my lord he excellence at which the polite arts have arrived in every nation where they are known has been owing in great measure to the encouragement and protection shewn to them by illustrious personages on this account my lord presume to solicit your grace ’ patron- age age for-the following little treatise on the art of painting with crayons sensible that your grace ’ known benevolence can not be displeased that endeavour to render myself serviceable to others the honour you did me in the early part of my life when you condescended io wishi would direct my studies to the arts of painting has ever been held in remembrance zand it will af- ford me great satisfaction to know that your grace accepts this address as an humble tribute of my gratitude and to believe that am with the highest respect the elegant arts of which painting is one of the most considerable have ever been held in the highest estimation by the great and illustrious of all ages not solely for private amusement but for their beneficial influence in society in promoting benevolence and inspiring delicacy of feeling titis will not appear paradoxical if we observe that they are evidently contrived to afford innocent pleasures disregarding the inferior senses in this light they may be considered as rational science and when cultivated to an eminent degree of refinement they do honour to mankind every attempt to encourage and improve the elegant arts deserves great commendation since there is too much rea- son for believing that the interests of humanity are not so strongly guarded or so firmly secured as easily to relin- quish those succours or forego those afsistances which they administer to them since painting is an art in which truth of qut-line is no less necessary that justness of colouring apprehend few hints relative to the former will not seven at this period be deemed superfluous or unnecessary for should these ele- ments fall into the hands of the accomplished artist to whose judgment submit them with the highest diffidence flatter myself shall meet with favour and indulgence since intend this work principally for the use of those who are just entering into the world of imitation -- to such hope to make an offering worthy their acceptance should inclination lead them to the study of painting with cravons by exhibiting the materials used in this art with the me- thods of making and preparing them for the execution of design with respect to crayon painting the present age has produced an uncommon instance of excellence in one of our own countrymen mean the late mr. francis cores whose method propose to explain in the following pages with all possible perspicuity for it seems to be universally allowed by all good judges that as crayon painter this celebrated artist excelled most of his cotemporaries reader will doubtless excuse this tribute of gratitude to ° in what high estimation are the pictures of rosalba heldp how happy do connoisseurs think themselves when they possess any of her worksl if the crayon pictures left by mr. cotes are not held in equal estimation posterity will not do justice to his merit the memory of an excellent master who for some years directed my studies aud used his endeavours to communi- cate that knowledge to me which had most eminently distinguished and raised him to the notice and esteem not only of the first artists in the britisb nation but to the favour of our illustrious monarch who in the commence- ment of an auspicious reign and even in that early period of life when pleasure generally is the sole pursuit shewed an elegant taste for the fine arts and has since been gra- cioussy pleased to protect and encourage the cultivation of them by the establifhment of royal academy which from its first institution has been conducted with such pro- priety and unremitting attention as to do honour to its profefsors and add dignity to the character of english- men the hopes of rendering some service to the art of paint- ing with crayons of suggesting some hints which may pos¬ sibly give rise to further inquiries respecting this pleasing study and of explaining its principles for the benefit of such as in this age of dissipation may prefer the silent amusement of beautiful art to the delusive enchantments in the gay circles of unrestrained pleasure have induced me to this undertaking and should it instruct or even en- courage single student shall not think my labour ill bestowed but happy shall be if my observations should in the least degree awaken the attention of the curious to those new sources of beauty and elegance which may yet lie concealed for if they are found to be just those who are masters of the subject may be tempted to improve and ex- tend them be this as it may my aim by this publication is to be useful to those who want experience and therefore have not doubt but shall stand excused from any im- putation of vanity with those who do not require such assist- ance to the former lwish success and would soften the censures of the latter by reminding them in the words of tbere is labour in the most trifling tbings elements of painting witr crayons- section concerning taste there is no disputing about tafte because its prin- ciples are not absolute and therefore they can not be defined the opinions of men concerning as their faces their dispositions or the different climates in which they live nature it is true is in every particular consistent with herself we are framed with minds capable of having the highest relisn for the elegant arts and conse- quently nature has framed us with an uniformity of taste to furnish proper objects for that high relish without which the the arts could never have arrived at any degree of perfection and this is sufficient to convince us that they are not yet brought to perfection some objects indeed of the fine arts make such lively impressions of beauty grandeur and harmony of proportion as to command kind of ge- neral taste but instances of this sort are very uncommon taste depends more on experience than on nature this is point which merits peculiar attention because it opens to us fure method of improving our taste in the elegant arts and is powerful incitement toward the cul- tivation and improvement of them study which can not fail to embellish manners and sweeten society azz therefore that can be said concerning taste is that there are certain principles that constitute the sensitive part of our nature and which being common to all pre- serve kind of uniformity with respect to the emotions and feelings of different individuals the same object making upon every one the same impression or at least the same in kind if not in degree this is the only way of account- ing for uniformity of taste in the polite arts and this in other words may justly be termed the common sense of mankind which is the only true standard of taste all other being equivocal or uncertain and consequently will never be sufficiently general to become standards of taste but the principles that constitute the sensitive part of our nature nature will undoubtedly lead us to methods of ascertain- ing the common sense of mankind or standard of taste with great exactness and accuracy these will determine almost generally what is either elegant or beautiful and hence when our ideas are regu- lated and directed by these principles we may be said to have formed good taste and be enabled to discern what is natural and proper and what is not so true it is that inattention the force of example pre- judice or passion may introduce bad taste and banish good one in painting heavy composition incorrect drawing and bad colouring may prevail notwithstanding the influence of those principles that constitute the sensitive part of our nature instances of so defective taste will however be very rare and when they happen they will seldom prejudice any but the possessors because they can carry but little authority with them to impose on others after all the remedy against forming bad taste is to study the works of men of good taste this will enlarge the mind and by observation establish the student in good taste of his own elements of section ii of drawin drawing may be justly termed the foundation of painting this should be the first object of the student ’ attention the more perfectly this is attained the greater is the certainty of acquiring excellence genius is the gift of nature but genius without cultivation can never arrive at the summit of perfection the materials necessary for drawing are port-crayon à leather stump some stained paper charcoal black white and red chalk with drawing-board of about two foot square soue artists reject the use of drawings or prints for the student ’ imitation ee it is say they servile method of ci proceeding because it cramps the ideas and hence ge- « nius suffers too great confinement notwithstanding this the usual practice is to copy after prints and drawings at first and imagine experience has determined the advan- tages accruing from this method to set the drawings in particular of the most eminent artists before young be- ginner at his first commencement must be highly benefi- cial cial as it most undoubtedly will prevent rudeness and in- accuracy against which the most exact can not be too much guarded how much more then ought the young student to observe this caution some geniuses require restric- tion and when this happens to be the case the placing of accurate works before them must hold them in kind of subjection from which alone correctness is to be ex- pected exact copies are absolutely to be required at first this will imperceptibly produce habit of correctness till by degrees the student will make himself master of those grand essentials to perfection truth boldness and free- dom truth will be acquired by this accustomed correct- nefs boldness and freedom will follow after as the certain consequence and on these the excellence of the performance must depend -- copying the drawings of good masters has also another considerable advantage viz teaching good method of execution by which many laborious and fruit- dess efforts will be prevented crayon painters fhould pay particular attention to the drawing on stained paper with black or red and white chalks as this kind of drawing has bold effect is allied to the manner of using the crayons and imparts knowledge of what is usually termed the middie teint indeed in almost every respect this method is attended with considerable advantages but the young student should always have it in remembrance that his chief aim ought to be the making of correct drawing and of attaining truth of outline since this is more essentially necessary than smartness of touch or pleasing execution- when he has made some considerable progress with the chalks he may then attempt the round or plaister figures but here as in every other case care fhould be observed in making choice of good subject for nothing is so preju- dicial or dangerous as to copy from imperfect subjects on which account he should be directed in his choice by the opinion of the most experienced artists who all recom- mend the study of the antique and other approved plaister figures previous to the drawing after living models which will furnish the student with great knowledge and correct- ness as has been before observed and without which there is great danger of acquiring extravagant and pernicious ha¬ bits which are easily attained without great care but they are not so easily difmissed when acquired to draw from living figure without having first studied the antique is no less absurd than to attempt to understand the classicks without previous knowledge of the rules of grammar the human figure and especially the face is the most difficult study but thorough knowledge of this particular will give facility of execution in every thing else when the student has made himself master of good degree of exactness by copying after prints or drawings let let him be provided with some good head cast after the antique one in which the features are strongly marked and boldly determined such as the hercules jupiter or wiobe as he will find the strength of either of these more easy of imitation than the refinement and delicacy of the antinous or venus of medicis though the latter after time will be his favourite and most valuable study apter the choice of subject the next consideration will be to place it in proper light and shadow-lf the win- dow is too near the ground the effect can not be pleasing because the shadow will be distracted into too many parts in this case the lower part of the window should be dark- ened with sometbing that will quite obstruct the light about the height of six feet which will throw the shades into very agreeable mafses on the subject for imitation which being thus placed having the drawing-board partly resting in thod let the student carefully observe the particular turn and action of the head hou much the forehead is inclined over the right or left shoulder and how much over the back or breast then with the charcoal let him lightly draw the general shapes of the head after which the center-line of the face from the middle of the forchead to the middle of the chin and then the cross lines which determine the situation of the eyes nose mouth and roots of the hair all this being the foundation on which the student may give the particular shapes to each feature and he must remem- ber that good proportioned face is divided into three equal parts the first contains the forehead the second the nose the hair to the crown of the head is just the height of the forehead the nose being the centre most artists begin their par- ticular shapes with that feature and from thence proceed to the eyes and mouth but let the student fketch the out-line very light that any mistake may the more easily be altered his greatest attention must be paid to the pro- ducing his drawing correct and the lines of the features parallel to one another and each at proper distance if the student fails here all his labour in the finishing will be to no purpose but when the lines are properly drawn the broad shadowe may be laid in with soft chalk disregarding the lesser parts till afterwards sweetening with the leather stump then the demy shades and the heightening with white are added with which the whole is to be compleated preserving an intermediate space of the stained paper which as middle teint inust be left between the white and black otherwise the use of drawing on teinted paper is effectually destroyed and the production will have heavy unpleasing effect and be entirely destitute of that greatness and breadth which distinguishes the productions of master from the efforts of inferior abilities when the student has made himself master of the know- ledge of the face he may proceed to the whole figure stu- dying with much assiduity the casts after the antique those almost perfect standards of grace majesty and beauty rules it is said are the fetters of genius but great man very judicioussy observed lately that ee they are fetters only to men of no genius which is undoubtedly true for when they are properly used by men of abilities they rather assist genius than impede it on this accounti have given the measures of fine proportioned-human fi- gure with which it is necessary the student should make himself acquainted previous to his studies after the life and for this reason place this particular before what propose to say on that important part of study ten of which from the lowest hairs on the forehead to the bottom of the chin is the beft proportioned height. -- the face is divided into three equal parts ist the forehead ad the nose and the mouth and chin -- from the chin to the collar-bones is twice the length of the nose.— from the collar-bones to the lowest part of the breast the length of the whole face -- from the bottom of the breast to the navel one face and half nose -from the navel to the secrets one face -- from the secrets to the knee-pan two faces -- from the knee-pan to the ancle two faces.— from the ancle to the sole of the foot nose and an half —when the arms are extended horizontally their length from the extremity of the longest finger on one hand to the other should measure the same as the height of the figure from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot.— from the shoulder to the elbow the length of two faces.- from the root of the little finger to the elbow two faces —from the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit of the collar one face -- -the foot is the sixth part of man ’ height and the hand should measure as much in length as the face-the thumb is the third part of face in length —the shoulder that the face is most turned over is raised higher than the other- the shoulder bearing heavy bur- then will be raised considerably higher than the other the hip on which the body chiefly rests will be raised higher than the other the knowledge of anatomy as far as relates to the structure of the bones and dispositions of the muscles with their various motions will enable the student to draw the human figure in great perfection this may be acquired by studying some good treatise on the subject and by draw- ing the bones and muscles in different views the attend- ing some dissections if he has an opportunity willimprove the student much sooner than any other method possibly can le brun ’ lectures on the passions of the soul read before the academy in france will impart great knowledge in the expression of the muscles of the face which should be strictly attended to and also the knowledge of light and shadow as this in particular will instruct him how to preserve harmony in his pictures and proper expression of the different projections these things being acquired ge- nius will improve by study and perfection and fame re- ward the labours of close application when the student draws from living models great care is required to place the figure in proper action after which particular attention should be paid to the general sway of the figure being careful to preserve what is termed the centre of gravity which is that line always perpendicular from the pit between the collar-bones to the heel of the foot on which the figure restst.-the first sketch must be touched very lightly in square manner describing the large forms by which the action of the figure is expressed the second time of drawing over the qut-lines notice should be taken of those lesser parts which in the former slight sketch were neglected in each sketch the student must begin at the head which must be carefully placed in it ’ proper inclina- tion or else however in other respects justly draurn the fi- gure will have an ungraceful appearance it must be remarked that all graceful figures stand on one foot only when the out-line is correct and in good proportion the principal difficulty is overcome the next step is to proceed to the shadows which must be made broad and firm and not distracted into too many parts which would perplex the student as all the inferior distinctions in the se- veral degrees of shadow ought to be second consideration and are therefore to be avoided when the whole care should be to preserve the masfes of light and shade broad and mas- terly care should be observed where the principal mass of light falls as in every well-set figure there will be princi- pal mass of light to preserve it broad and not too much divided considering the whole together before the parts in particular ir shadow is produced by any muscle near the grand body of light it will at the first view be apt to mis- lead the student and incline him to think it much darker than it really is but if compared with the principal shadow the true degree may be ascertained sometimes on the rising of musele or the projection of bone the light may catch near the mafs of shadow which if not drawn ten- der will have an unpleasing harsh effect which can only be regulated by comparing it with the strongeft lights this method of comparing one degree of light and shadow with another will be the only certain rule of preserving the tone and consistency of the whole together as the comparing of lengths and breadths with each other is the only rule to pro- duce the just forms of figures while the figure is resting the student will have an opportunity of placing his drawing at distance by which means the eye will more easily discover how much he has erred from this rule which he may soften with linen rag or rub out with bread at pleasure -as it can not be supposed the figure can for any length of time have the same mnscles of his body in continual action the opportunity should be embraced while they are most properly exerted to draw each limb and describe each particular muscle the great variety of which will give liberty to the student to exercise his genius in producing his drawing in an elegant tafte section iii of the application of the crayons witi some previous dispositions whether the painter works with oil-colours wa- ter-colours or crayons the grand object of his pursuit is still the same just imitation of nature but cach species has its peculiar rules and methods.—painting with crayons requires in many respects treatment diffe- rent from painting in oil-colours because all colours used dry are in their nature of much warmer complection than when wet with oils for this reason in order to pro- duce rich picture much greater portion of what painters term cooling teints must be applied in crayon painting than would be judicious to use in oils without any danger of mistake it is to be supposed the not being acquainted with this observation is one great cause why so many oil- painters have no better success when they attempt crayon painting on the contrary crayon painters being so much- used to those teints which are of cold nature when used wet are apt to introduce them too much when they paint with oils which is seldom productive of good effect shall now endeavour to give the student some direc- tions towards the attainment of excellence in this art the student must provide himself with some strong blue paper the thicker the better if the grain is not too course and knotty though it is almost impossible to get any intirely free from knots the knots should be levelled with penknife or razor otherwise they will prove exceedingly troublesome after this is done the paper must be pasted very smooth on linen cloth previously strained on deal frame the size according to the artist ’ pleasure on this the picture is to be executed but it is most eligible not to paste the paper on till the whole subject is first dead-coloured the method of doing this is very easy by laying the paper with the dead-colour on its face upon fmooth board or table when by means of brush the backside of the paper must be covered with paste the frame with the strained cloth must then be laid on the pasted side of the paper after which turn the painted side uppermost and lay piece of clean paper upon it to prevent smearing it this being done it may be stroked gently over with the hand by which means all the air between the cloth and the paper will be forced out when the paste is perfectly dry the student may pro- ceed with the painting the advantages arising from past- ing the paper on the frame according to this method after the picture is begun are very great as the crayons will adhere much better than any other way which will enable the student to finisn the picture with firmer body of co- lour and greater lustre the late mr. cotes found out this method by accident and esteemed it valuable acquisi- tion and remember on particular occasion he re- moved sine crayon picture of rosalba ’ and placed it on another strained dloth without the least injury by soaking the canvas with wet fponge till the paste between the cloth and paper was sufficiently wet so admit of separation when painters want to make very correct copy of picture they generally make use of tiffany or black gauze strained tight on frame which they lay flat on the subject to be imitated and with piece of sketching chalk trace all the qut-lines on the tiffany they then lay the canvas to be painted on flat upon the floor placing the tiffany with the chalked lines upon it and with an handkerchief brush the whole over this presents the exact qut-lines of the picture on the canvas the crayon painter may also make use of this method when the subject of his imitation is in oils but in copying crayon picture he must have recourse to the following method on account of the glass tie picture being placed upon the easel let the out- lines be drawn on the glass with small camel ’ hair pencil dipped in lake ground thin with oils which muft be done with great exactness after this is accomplished take sheet of paper of the same size and place it on the glass glass stroking over all the lines with the hand by which means the colour will adhere to the paper which must he pierced with pin-holes pretty close to each other the paper intended to be used for the painting must next be laid upon table and the pierced paper placed upon it then with some fine-pounded charcoal tied up in piece of lawn rub over the pierced lines which will give an exact qut-line but great care must be taken not to brush this off till the whole is drayn over with sketching chalk which is composition made of whiting and tobacco-pipe clay rolled like the crayoi and pointed at each end when the student paints immediately from the life it will be most prudent to make correct drawing of the qut- lines on another paper the size of the picture hé is going to paint which he may trace by the preceding method be- cause erroneous strokes of the sketching chalk which are not to be avoided without great expertness will prevent the crayons from adhering to the paper owing to oertain greasy quality in the composition tiie student will find the sitting posture with the box of crayons in his lap the moft convenient method for him to paint the part of the picture he is immediately paint- ing should be rather belo whis face for if it is placed toohigh the arm will be fatigued let the windows of the room where he paints be darkened at least to the height of six feet light may fall with every advantage on the face avoiding too much shadow which seldom has good effect in por- trait painting efpecially if the face he paints from has any degree of delicacy berore he begins to paint let him be attentive to his fubject and appropriate the action or attitude proper to the age of the subject lfa child let it be childish if young lady express more vivacity than in the majestic beauty of middle-aged woman who also should not be expressed with the same gravity as person far advanced in years let the embellishments of the picture and introduction of birds animals be regulated by the rules of propriety and consistency tre features of the face being correctly drawn with chalks let the student take crayon of pure carmine and carefully draw the nostril and edge of the nose next the shadow then with the faintest carmine teint lay in the highest light upon the nose and forehead which must be executed broad he is then to proceed gradually with the second teint and the succeeding ones till he arrives at the shadows which must be covered brilliant enriched with much lake carmine and deep green this me- thod will at first offensively strike the eye from its crude appearance appearance but in the finishing it will be good founda- easily sullied when too bright than when the first colour- ing is dull to raise the picture into brilliant state the several pearly teints discernable in sine complections must be imitated with blue verditer and white which answers to the ultramarine teints ufed in oils but if the parts of the face where these teints appear are in shadow the crayons composed of black and white must be substituted in their place though all the face when first coloured should be laid in as brilliant as possible yet each part should be kept in its proper tone by which means the rotundity of the face will be preserved ler the student be careful when he begins the eyes to draw them with crayon inclined to the carmine teint brilliant and at first not loaded with colour but executed lightly no notice is to be taken of the pupil yet the student must let the light of the eye incline very much to the blue cast cautioussy avoiding staring white appearance which when once introduced is seldom overcome pre- serving broad shadow thrown on its upper part by the eye-lash black and heavy teint is also to be avoided in the eye-brows it is therefore best to execute them like broad glowing shadow at first on which in the finish- ing the hairs of the brow are to be painted by which me- thod of proceeding the former teints will shew themselves through and produce the most pleasing effect the student should begin the lips with pure carmine and lake and in the shadow use some carmine and black the strong vermillion teints should be laid on afterwards he must beware of executing them with stiff harsh lines gently intermixing each with the neighbouring colours making the shadow beneath broad and enriched with bril- liant crayons he must form the corner of the mouth with carmine brown oker and greens varioussy intermixed lf the hair is dark he should preserve much of the lake and deep carmine teints therein this may be easily over- powered by the warmer hair teints which as observed in painting the eye-brows will produce richer effect when the picture is finished on the contrary if this method is unknown or neglected poverty of colouring will be dis- cernable apter the student has covered over or as artists term it has dead-coloured the head he is to sweeten the whole together by rubbing it over with his finger beginning at the strongest light upon the forehead passing his finger very lightly and uniting it with the next teint which he must continue till the whole is sweetened together often wiping his finger on towel to prevent the colours being sullied he must be cautious not to smooth or sweeten his picture too often because it will give rise to thin and fcanty effect and have more the appearance of draw- ing than solid painting as nothing but body of rich co lours can constitute rich effect to avoid this as student finds it necessary to sweeten with the finger he must continually replenisn the picture with when the head is brought to some degre ss let the back-ground be laid in which mus different manner covering it as thin as possible and rubbin it into the paper with leather-stump near the paper should be almost free from colour for great service to the head and by its thinness give botl and solid appearance in the back-ground also rayon but that has whiting in its composition should be chiefly such as are the most brilliant and the least adulte- rated the ground being painted thin next the hair will give the student an opportunity of painting the edges of the hair over in light and free manner when he gives the fi- nishing touches the student having proceeded thus far the face hair and back-ground being entirely covered he must carefully view the whole at some distance remarking in what respect it is out of keeping that is what parts are too light and what what too dark being particularly attentive to the white or chalky appearances which must be subdued with lake and carmine the above method being properly put into execution will produce the appearance of painting princi- pally composed of three colours viz carmine black and white which is the best preparation painter can make for the next step is to compleat the back-ground and the hair as the dust in painting these will fall on the face and would much injure it if that was compleated first from thence proceed to the forehead finishing downward till the whole picture is compleated in painting over the forehead the last time begin the highest light with the most faint vermillion teint in the same place where the faint carmine was first laid keeping it broad in the same manner in the next shade succeeding the lightest the student must work in some light blue teints composed of verditer and white intermixing with them some of the deeper vermillion teints sweetening them together with great cautione insensibly melting them into one an- other increasing the proportion of each colour as his judge- ment shall direct some brilliant yellows may also be ued but sparingly and towards the roots of the hair strong ver- ° this direction is for the finest complections but the student must vary his colouring according to his subject diter teints intermixed with greens will be of singular ser- vice cooling crayons composed of black and white should succeed these and melt into the hair beneath the eyes the sweet pearly teints are to be preserved com- posed of verditer and white and under the nose and on the temples the same may be used beneath the lips teints of this kind also are proper mixing them with the light greens and some vermillion in finishing the cheeks let the pure lake clear them the lake may be intermixed the bright vermillion and last of all if the subject should require it few touches of the orange-coloured crayon but with extreme caution after this sweeten that part with the finger as little as possible for fear of producing heavy disagreeable effect on the cheeks as the beauty of crayon picture consists in one colour shewing itself through or rather between another this the student can not too often remark it being the only method of imitating beautiful complections the eye is the most difficult feature to execute in crayons as every part must be expressed with the utmost nicety to appear finished at the same that the painter must preserve its breadth and solidity while he is particu- larizing the parts to accomplish this it will be good general rule for the student to use his crayon in sweetening as much and his finger as little as possible when he wants point to touch small part with he may break off little of his grayon against the box which will produce corner fit to work with in the minutest parts if the eye- lashes are dark he must use some of the carmine and brown oker and the crayon of carmine and black and with these he may also touch the lris of the eye if brown or hazel making broad shadow caused by the eye-lasn red teints of vermillion carmine and lake will execute the corners of the eye properly but if the eye-lids are too red they will have disagreeable fore appearance the pupil of the eye must be made of pure lamp-black be- catch very strong but it miust not be made too sudden but be gently diffused round the pupil till it is lost in shade when the eye-balls are sufficiently prepared the fhining speck must be made with pure white crayon which should be first broken to point and then laid on firm but as it is possible they may be defective in neatness they should be corrected with pin taking off the redundant parts by which means they may be formed as neat as can be required the difficulty with respect to the nose is to preserve the lines properly determined and at the same time so art- fully blended into the cheek as to express it ’ projection and yet no real line to be perceptible upon close exami¬ nation in some circumstances it should be quite blended with the cheek which appears behind it and determined entirely with slight touch of red chalk the shadow caused by the nose is generally the darkest in the whole face partaking of no reflection from it ’ surrounding parts carmine and brown oker carmine and black and such brilliant crayons will compose it best tie student having before prepared the lips with the strongest lake and carmine must with these colours make them compleatly correct and when finishing intro- duce the strong vermillions but with great caution as they are extremely predominant this if properly touched will give the lips an appearance equal if not superior to those executed in oils notwithstanding the seeming supe- riority the latter has by means of glazing ’ of which the former is intirely destitute when the student paints the neck he should avoid ex- pressing the muscles too strong in the stem nor should the bones appear too evident on the chest as both have an un- pleasing effect denoting violent agitation of the body circumstance seldom necessary to express in portrait painting the method with which painters in oils express transparency in the lips is by painting them first with light vermillion teints and when dry touching them over with pure lake the most necessary part to be expressed and which should ever be observed even in the most delicate subjects is strong marking just above the place where the collar bones unite and if the head is much thrown over the shoulders some notice should be taken of the large muscle that rifes from behind the ear and is inserted into the pit between the collar bones all inferior muscles should be in ge- neral quite avoided the student will find this caution necessary as most subjects especially thin persons have the muscles of the neck much more evident than would be ju- dicious to imitate as few necks are too long it may be necessary to give some addition to the stem fault on the other side being quite unpardonable nothing being more ungraceful than short neck in colouring the neck let the student preserve the stem of pearly hue and the light not so strong as on the chest if any part of the breast ap- pears its transparency must also be expressed by pearly teints but the upper part of the chest should be coloured with beautiful vermillions delicately blended with the other section iv of drapery dainting the drapery is commonly thought to be very inferior branch of the art this is most certainly mistake very great painter being afked what part of the picture he thought most difficult to execute answered the drapery whether we allow this to be absolutely true or not we may venture to affirm that it is very difficult part to execute with taste merely to give the effect of silk sat- tin or cloth is not the point this the servile copyist by the mere dint of labour may effect and may even de- ceive the-vulgar eye so that the imitation may be taken for reality but to make the folds give grace and dignity to the the figure to cloath it uninfluenced by prejudice fafhion or caprice so as to bear the test of ages requires the fullest exertion of true genius and the study of man ’ lise but it is not my design to say much on this copious subject there- fore shall dismiss it with sew observations concerning the colouring and execution dark blue purple black pink and all kind of red draperies also should be first tinged with carmine which will render the colours much more brilliant than any other method over this should be laid on the paper the middle teint medium between the light and dark teints of which the drapery is to be painted except the dark massfes of shadow which should be laid on at first as deep as possi¬ ble these sweetened with the finger being destitute of the smaller folds will exhibit masterly breadth which the lesser folds when added ought by no means to destroy with the light and dark teints the smaller parts are next to be made with freedom executing as much with the grayon and as little with the finger as possible in each fold touching the last stroke with the crayon which stroke the finger must never touch in the case of reffections the simple touch of the crayon will be too harsh therefore fingering will be necessary afterwards as reflected lights are always more gentle than those which are direct with respect to reflections in general they must always partake of the same colour as the object reflecting but in the case of single figures it may be useful to make some particular observa- tions in blue drapery let the reflections be of greenisn cast in green draperies make them of yellow teint in yellow of an orange in orange reflect reddish cast in all reds something of their own nature but inclined to the yellow black should have reddisni ressection the re- flection of reddish teint will also present purples to the best advantage of whatever colour the drapery is the reflection on the face must partake thereof otherwise the picture like paintings on glass will have but gaudy effect linen lace fur should be touched spiritedly with the crayon fingering very little except the latter and the last touches even of this like all other parts should be executed by the crayon without sweetening with the finger have contented myself with treating on the first princi- ples only because many judicious writers on the subject of painting whose works notwithstanding merit the highest attention have not been so explicit on this head as seems to be necessary the methods have recommended have been practised by the most celebrated crayon painters whose works have been held in public estimation but the know¬ ledge of and ability to execute each separate part with brilliancy and truth will be found very insufficient to con- stitute compleat painter without his judgement enables him to unite them with each other by correctness of draw- ing propriety of light and shadow and harmony of co- louring in order to accomplisn this the student should carefully avoid finishing one part in particular till he has properly considered the connection it is to have with the rest the neglect of this is the principal reason why the performances of indifferent painters are so destitute of what termed breadth so conspicuoussy beautiful in the works of great masters it must be granted that this observation re- lates more particularly to large compositions where diver- sity of figures requires such judicious disposition that each may assist in the combination of kind of universal harmo- ny yet even in portrait painting the student should be particularly attentive to observe this idea of breadth if he is desirous of acquiring that importance and dignity which constitutes excellence in painting painting with crayons op the materials —he perfection of the grayons consists in great mea- sure in their softnefs for it is impossible to execute brilliant picture with them if they are otherwise on which account great care should be observed in the preparing them to prevent their being hard. -- in all compositions flake- white and white-lead should be wholly rejected because the slightest touch with either of these will unavoidably turn black the usual objection to crayon paintings is that they are subject to change but whenever this happens it is intirely owing to an injudicious use of the above-mentioned whites which will stand only in oils to obviate the bad effects arising from the use of such crayons let the student make use of common whiting prepared in the following manner taxs large vessel of water put the whiting into it and mix them well together let this stand about half mi- nute then pour off the top into another vessel and throw the gritty sediment away let what is prepared rest about minute minute and then pour it off as before which will purisy the whiting and render it free from all dirt and grittiness when this is done let the whiting settlé and then pour the water from it after which lay it on the chalk to dry and keep it for use either for white crayons or the pur- pose of preparing teints with other colours for with this all other teints may be safely prepared if the student chuses to make crayons of the whiting immediately after it is washed it is not necessary to dry it on the chalk for it may be mixed instantly with any other colour which will save confiderable trouble colours of heavy or gritty nature especially blue verditer must be purified by wash- ing after this method the student must be provided with large flexible pallet-knife large stone and muller to levigate the colours two or three large pieces of chalk to absorb the moisture from the colours after they are levigated piece of flat glass to prevent the moisture from being absorbed too much till the colours are rolled into form and vessels for water spirits as neceffity and convenience shall direct reds carmine and eake it is rather difficult to procure either good carmine or good lake good carmine is inclined to the vermillion teint and good lake to the carmine teint the carmine crayons are prepared in the following manner as their texture is inclinable to hardness instead of grind- ing and rolling them take sufficient quantity of carmine lay it upon the grinding-stone mix it with levigating knife with spirits of wine till it becomes smooth and even the chalk-stone being ready lay the colour upon it to absorb the spirit but be careful that it is laid on in proper shape for painting if it is levigated too thin the waste of colour by their adhering to the pallet-knise but practise will render the proper degree of consistency far- miliar the simple colour being prepared the next step is to compose the different teints by mixture with whiting the proportion to be observed consisting of twenty grada- tions to one which may be clearly understood by the fol- lowing directions take some of the simple colour and levigate it with spirits of wine adding about one part of washed whiting to three parts of carmine of which when properly incorporated make two parcels the next grada- tion should be composed of equal quantities of carmine and whiting of which four crayons may be made the third composition should have one fourth carmine and three fourths whiting of this make six crayons which will be good proportion with the rest the last teint should be made of whiting very faintly tinged with carmine of which make about eight crayons which will compleat the abovementioned proportion as these compound teints are levigated they are to be laid immediately upon the chalk that the moisture may be absorbed to the proper de- gree of dryness for forming into crayons which may be known by its losing the greater part of its adhesive quality when taken into the hand lf the consistency is found to be right it may be then laid upon the glass which having no pores will prevent the moisture from becoming too dry before it is convenient to form it into crayons otherwise the crayons would be full of cracks and very brittle which will be great inconvenience when they are used in painting lake is colour very apt to be hard to prevent which the student must observe the following particulars painting with cravons take about half the quantity of lake intended for the crayons and grind it very sine with spirits of wine let it dry and then pulverize it which is easily done if the lake is good then take the other half and grind it with spirits after which mix it with the pulverized lake and lay it out directy in crayons on the chalk this colour will not bear rolling the simple colour being thus prepared proceed with the compound crayons as directed before and in the same degrees of gradation as the carmine teints vermillion the best is inclined to the carmine teint nothing is required to prepare this colour more than to mix it on the stone with soft water or spirits after which it may be rolled into crayons the different teints are produced by mixture of the simple colour with whiting according to the proportions already given blues prussian blue is colour very apt to bind and is rendered soft with more difficulty than carmine and lake the same method of preparation is to be followed with this as directed with respect respect to lake only it is necessary to grind larger quan- tity of the pure colour as it is chiesly used for painting dra¬ peries the different teints may be made according to necessity or the fancy of the painter blue verditer is colour naturally gritty and therefore it is necessary to washi it well its particles are so coarse as to require some binding matter to unite them otherwise the crayons will never adhere together to accomplish this take quan- tity sufficient to form two or three crayons to which add piece of slacked plaister of paris about the size of pea mix these well together and form the crayons upon the chalk this blue is extremely brilliant and will be of great use in heightening draperies the teints must be formed with whiting as directed in the former instances and are highly serviceable for painting flesh to produce those pearly teints so beautiful in crayon pictures it is not necessary to mix the compounds with spirits as clear water will be sufficient greens green brilliant greens are produced with great difficulty in switzerland they have à method of making them far supe¬ rior to ours we usually take yellow oker and after grind- ing it with spirits mix it with the powder of prussian blue then temper it with à knife and lay the crayons on the chalk without rolling them instead of this some use oker and prussian blue the crayons made of the two last may be rolled various teints may be produced by these colours according to fancy or necessity some to par- take more of the blue and others of the yellow yellows '-yellow is the most useful and the most brilliant levigated with spirits of wine and compose the different teints as before directed yellow oker and naples yellow ground with spirits will make useful crayons mr. bonhote in hayses court soho is the original importer of these crayons from lausanne in swilzerland the student may find it very useful to supply de- ficiencies of this nature with them as the ingredients which compose these brilliant crayons are not to be met with in england orange orange is produced with king ’ -yellow and vermillion ground together with spirits and the teints formed as in other cases but no great quantity of them is required brown cullens-earth is fine dark brown after six or eight of the simple- crayons are prepared several rich compound teints may be produced from it by mixture with carmine in various degrees black carmine and this colout mixed together make useful teints for painting hair several gradations may be produced from each of these by mixture with whiting roman or brown oker is an excellent colour either simple or compounded with carmine whiting tinged in several degrees with either of these will prove very serviceable in painting umber may be treated in just the same manner only it is ne- cessary to levigate it with spirits of wine purples purples prussian blue ground with spirits and mixed with pul- verized lake will produce good purple carmine thus mixed with prussian blue will produce purple something different from the former various teints may be made from either of these compounds by mixture with whiting black lampblack is the only black that can be used with safety as all others are subject to mildew but as good lamp-black is very scarce the student will perhaps find it most expedient to make it himself the process of which is as follows provide tin cone fix it over lamp at such height that the flame may just reach the cone for the soot to ga- ther within it when sufficient quantity is collected take it out and burn all the grease from it in crucible it must then be ground with spirits and laid on the chalk to absorb the moisture various grey teints may be formed from this by mixture with whiting as mentioned in for- mer instances vermillion tion of great use and teints made from this with whiting will be found to be very serviceable carmine and black is another good compound of which five or six gradations should be made some partaking more of the black and others having the carmine most predomi¬ nant besides several teints by mixture with whiting vermillion and black is also very useful compound from which several different teints should be made prussian elue and black is another good compound and will be found of singular service in painting draperies it is impofsible to lay down rules for the forming every teint necessary in composing set of crayons there being many accidental compositions entirely dependant on fancy and opinion-the student should make it rule to save the leavings of his colours for of these he may form various teints which will oecasionally be useful section section vi of rolling tbe crayons and disposing them por painting the different compositions of colours must be cut into proper magnitude after they are prepared in or- der to be rolled into pastils for the convenience of using them each crayon should be formed in the left hand with the ball of the right first formed cylindrically and then ta- pered at each end-lf the composition is too dry dip the finger in water if too wet the composition must be laid upon the chalk again to absorb more of the moisture the crayons should be rolled as quick as possible and when fi- nished must be laid upon the chalk again to absorb all re- maining moisture after the gradation of teints from one co- lour are formed the stone should be well ’ scraped and cleansed with water before it is used for another colour when the set of crayons is compleated according to the rules prescribed they should be arranged in classes for the convenience of painting with them -- -some thin drawers divided into number of partitions is the most covenient method of disposing them properly the crayons should be deposited according to the several gradations of light the bottom of the partitions must be covered with bran as bed bed for the colours because it not only preserves them clean but prevents their breaking the box made use of when the student paints should be about foot square with nine partitions in the upper corner on the left hand supposing the box to be in the lap when he paints let him place the black and grey crayons those being the most seldom used in the second partition the blues in the third the greens and browns in the first partition on the left hand of the second row the carmines lakes vermillions and all deep reds the yellows and orange in the middle and the pearly teints next and as these last are of very delicate nature they must be kept very clean that the gradations of colour may be easily dis- tinguished in the lowest row let the first partition con- tain piece of fine linen rag to wipe the crayons with while they are using the second all the pure lake and ver- million teints and the other partition may contain those teints which from their complex nature can not be classed with any of the former
