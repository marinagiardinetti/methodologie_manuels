water-colours is flake whife some recommend white made of pearl and cyffer-shells brought to an impalpable powder called pearl white which will mix well with any colour if you afe whice lead clarify at with white wine vinegar after the whise is fettled pour off the vinegar and wath it with water thus put the powder into glats of ater fir it and prefently pour the water off while it is white into another clean glafs when it is settled pour off the water and you will have an exe cellent white to which add as much gum as is neceffary to give it gloss it has been often noticed that white lead will turn black if mixed with water that comes from iron or clay to that in the space of month or two you may perceive it and it will alfo change any colour with which it is mixed it is recommended by some to rake the powder of egg- shells of the brighteft and whiteft sort well ground with gum-water to the state of impalpaple powder to which add one twenrieth part of white sugar-candy others efteem it moff when clarified in spirits of wine and then ufe it with gum-water it has been found by repeated experience that egg-shell powder is extremely ferviceable as in water-colours and thatithis and the oyfter-shell powder rectified and well bruifed will make an excellent mixture with other colours to keep them from changing fine white for water-colours may he made by diffolving filings of silver or silver leat in aqua-fortis evaporating the aqua fortis till it appears like chryffal in the bottom of the glass decant the other part of the aqua-fortis and walls the silver four or five times in

take pound of the shred- dings of glove-leather and ffeep them in water boil them with twelve quarts of water till it waltes so two ftrain it through linen cloth into well-glazed earthen pan this is called cglue or size and proper to ufe with colours in candle- light pieces to know if this be ffrong enough feel if it is ftiff and firm under your hand the glue being melted reduce fome white halk to powder and while it is hor add fuch of chalk as will bring it to the con- liftency of pafte leiring it fleep for quarter of an hour fir it with bruth made of heg' briftles in order to make this whire brighter add more eylac be careful to obferve that every layer be dry before you put on another if you work upon wood you muft put on dozen but fix or feven is fuffi- crent if your paper is thick afterwards dip foft in fome water draining it with your fin= gers ruh the work with it in order to make it the smoother when your bruth is full of white you muft wath it again and alfo change the water exhen it is too white or you may ufe wet linen rag intlead of bruth in some objects there may be seen fhining like that of gold through colours of red blue or ggreen such as some sort of flies or beetles and the cansharides this grold tranfparency may be very welk imifared by laying some leaf-gold on the shaded side of the drawing giving little to the light side to lay on the gold leaf press it tmrooth and clofe with cotton after you have walked it with trong gum-water but care muff be taken that in laying on the gum you do not exceed the limits through which you would have the gold appear in this cafe the gold is only to thing through the tranfparent colour which is to be laid over it as leaf-gold will not receive water-colours re- fularly it is necelfary to be provided with water of ox-gall and with this liquor to froke over the gold leafs by which it will receive any colour you are defirous of laying over it and will alfe tetain it in june and july there may be found upon rofe= trees kind of beetle of gold and green co= jour which may prove extremely serviceable in this kind of painting but in ufing your gold it will be beft to polith it in this manner in

confiffience of an oil and fixed paper with gum arabic on this figurative letter wath fome flrong gum-water with hair pencil lay on the gold leaf clote with fome cotton and when dry rub it again with cotton and burnifh it with dog tooth and it will appear as if it was really caft in gold there is alfo another way of working in gold which is performed by shell-gold but then it muft be pure and not that brought from germany which turns green in few days cover the shady parts with vermilion before you ufe this gold and when you have rectified it with spirits of wine lay it on when dry burnifh it as before directed in laying on this gold it is beft to leave the lights without it as it will appear to much greater advantage than if all the object was covered but providing the whole performance should chance to be covered the beft way of fetting it off is to trace dvef the fhady parts with gall-stone or the of french berries of which we shall treat hereafter heightened with mlnium having treated thus much upon gold we shall now speak of yellows in general gambodge is be- youd doubt one of the melloweff colours nature has produced it is of to mild temperature that when it is touched
