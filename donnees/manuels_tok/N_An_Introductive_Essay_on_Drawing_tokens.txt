human in- genuity of all the operations which the fancy assisted by the hand is ca- pable there are none more excellent or useful none more universally ad- mir ’ than the art of drawing among the ancient greeks it was held in the highest esteem they thought it no ways inferior to the li- beral arts and shew ’ their value for it accordingly fheir slaves were forbid the study of it none but persons of distinction were honour ’ ’ th so great privilege and princes themselves not only patro- niz ’ it but thought thz practice of it an addition to their glory the romans in imitation of them had the like veneration for it and their emperors consuls and others of superior rank employ ’ great part of their ime in that delightful study and strove with lau- dable dable emulation to excell and this art retain ’ its excellency as long as the empire flourishied but when that decay and fell prey to the qutrages of several tyrannic princes the art languish- and could no longer boast her imperial patrons and professors but tho too long obscur ’ the cloud once more remov ’ the art reard up her drooping head and thro ’ the industry and application of some curious men and the encouragement they met with from those in power regain ’ new vigour and shone again in her sirst lustre nor was it without just ground that this artwas held in such high repute her beauties are and ever will be entertaining to the curious and no- thing more illustrates the glory of nation than her productions by the labours of her professors the egyptiens grecks and romans express ’ the actions of their he roes and transmitted their fame to latest posterity nor has this art been less advantageous to reli- gion than the state tne heathens of old were cu- ious in tne practice of it and made it branch of their divinie worship and the christians particuiarly those of the romish persuasion still keep up an equal veneration for it the mysteries of their most holy religion and the triumphs of their saints and mar- tyrs are represented in all their chaiacters by the aplest artists and whose works are to this day the object of publick adoration subjects of this nature when they are thus art- fully exprèss ’ and shine in picture make more decp and lasting impressions en the mind than all the charms of eloquence itself but as the foliowing essay is principally design' for the instruction and improvement of youth shall not enlarge on tne history and progress of this art what little have offer ’ ’ hope will be suf- ficient to induce them to the study and practice of it to set value on it suitable ta its nature and excellence and regard it as an accomplishment as useful at least and ornamental as any other genteel acquisition and as there can be no art without its precepts any more than house without door for an en- irance into it and as youth should be led gently by the hand and their learning be made pleasure not pain shall lay down in as clear familiar and instructive manner as can some general rules for their future observance as well with respect to draw- ing their colours or out-lines which are their first operations as lights and shadows which beautisy those first designs and make them strike the eye with wonder and delight by proper application to which with the assistance of an industrious hand hope the young practitioner in ashort time may be enabled to judge with knowledge and pur sue his labours with pleasure and success instructions in general the first thing requisite is happy genius which is the influence of the stars and the pe- culiar gift of heaven how to improve it many books can teach us how to obtain it none and without it all agree nothing material can be done and to which you must be oblig for the greatest beau- ties of your art it is an unhappy loss of time for youth to endeavour to gain that which he has deny him as the fraits of the earth have not their proper relish nor flowers their innate beauty and fragrant smell when transplanted into foreign soil and rear ’ by an artificial heat before their due season so it is in vain that the young studient toils and sweats in the fursuit of this art if the na- tural bent of lus inclination is directed another way he therefore that would be proficient in this art and is blest with genius for it fhould study the theory first before he meddles with the actice to act otherwise would be preposterous and irratio nal it would be like his ventring out upon the wide ocean without helm or compass to direct him when once the theory of his art is become familiar to him when once he knows what course to steer there is no danger in the pursuit of his voyage andi his safe arrival at the wish ’ for port the precepts you must get habit of imitation by frequene tryals which if it be done with pen taken care to avoid scratching and making thin and lean strokes but rather broad ones drawn from above downwards but some of the hagches must be sharp fome broad some unequal some equal according to the shades hold the pen or pencil somewhat long and not so upright as is usual in writing as if you laid it strait forward and when you draw with chalks use your self- to turn them in your hand which will hinder their growing blunt so soon as otherwise they will begin with eyes nose mouth and ears in thé drawinig of face form the circles or oval of the face then make stroke down where the middle or tip of the nose and mouth should be placed which stroke must be made strait down in full face but arched or oval in an oblique or side-face for demonstration take an egg or lvory box in that shape mark the lines with ink and it will ex plain this rule in all its fore-shortnings tho ’ this is the general rule of proportion yet hature often varies which renders the object to be imitated more remarkable and casy as to the various passions express ’ in faces need not treat of them it being already so well per form ’ by the chevelier le brun when you are in drawing- your ovals and can divide ther to all positions you must proceed to hands and feet arms and legs seperatély before you attempt whole figure for more easy method should advise you to hang small thread and plummet before the figure you draw by then make perpendicular line on your paper by this means you will more easily set your figure upright or discover the bending or the sway and action of it how every part answers each other in perpendicular line next hold ruler or pencil parallel to the several parts of your figure thereby you will find how the shoulders hip knees and muscles answer each other in parallel in order to draw the form of any beast begin at the forehead with your coal first lightly drawing dovnward to the nose mouth upper and nether chop ending the line at the throat then view- ing it again where you began from the forehead over the head ears and neck continuing till you have given the full compass of the buttock then mark cut the legs and feet viewing it again touch out the breast with the eminency thereof lastly finisn the tail paws tongue beard and teeth in birds begin also the draught at the head and beware of making it too big then the breast line from under the throat down to the legs there stay and begin at the pinion to make the wing which being joined to the back-line will be pre- sently finisned the eyes legs and tail must be drawn last always letting in birds as in beasts the farthest leg be shortest infects as flies bees wasps grasffioppers worms and such like are easily drawn but nature is the best pattern to draw

pupil ’ faithful guide her image he must for ever retain in his mind and draw from ghence all the beauties that are to enter into his fu- ture works for ’ tis impossible to express that with the hand which never enter ’ into the imagination nature augments the force and vigour of the genius and she it is alone from whom art derives her ultimate perfection by the means of sure ex- perience whilst he contemplates on these truths and makes necessary reflections on them let the labour of his hand attend and accompany the study of his brain let the one second and support the other- yet let not too eager pursuit and application and over-assiduous care blunt his genius and abate hij vigour however let him not indulge himself so far as to pass over one day without some ractice by sketch- ing and drawing something no matter what let him as he walks along the streets observê the airs of heads or the different postures of ani- mals and their expressions which the less they seem to be regarded are always the most free and least any occurrence should slip his memory let him enter into memorandum-book which he should have always ready in his pocket every thing he judges worthy of his netice whether ohjects on the earth in the air or upon the waters whilst the idea is fresh in his imagination thus initiated let him be very curious in tlie choice of his master he who begins well has al- ready perform dhalf his work is an excellent italian proverb there is nothing more pernicious to youth who is yet in the elements of drawing than to en- gage himself under the discipline of an igncrant master or to foilow bad origmals and copy from books that are already published which are the drawing works of pupils in order to learn them which are daily sold at most print shops and are very pernicious they will deprave his taste by an infinite number of mistakes of which their mean performances are full and thereby make him imbibe the poison which infects him all his future days never begin to draw till you have well consider ’ af your design and settled your qut-lines nor till you have present in your mind perfect idea of your work be ever consulting the best artists he who is in- dolent in his studies and incurious in his fnquiries who forms no scruples about what he undertakes it contents himself with his own mean performances and blind and self-conceited imagines all things mighty easy demonstrates he is only pretender not workman and that the art is beyond his weak capacizy to attain but when once youth is duly conscious of the many difficulties that attend him in the execution of his work every reflection that arises inspires him with new vigour to overcome them and ey industry and applicatien he makes every day some progress and improvement whenever therefore young gentlemen your own observation cr the advice of superior artist points out any error in your operations be open to conviction act impartially to yourselves and correct it without delay lest by exposing your work to publick view you betray ycur weakness and want of judgment flatter not yourselves that you can regain the credit which you once have lost by future amend- ment drawing like writing is of long duration not like the sound of an instrument which if dies in its biin is heard no more and soon forgot but whatever mistakes of this kind are once publisn ’ to the world they are past recall and are the everlasting oljects of contempt and ridicule nog is it sufficient excuse that necessity con- pell ’ yoû to hasten your productions or that you had not time to be correct nature is sufficed with litttle and bare subsistance with credit is much more valuable than treasures with ignominy and disdain let your thoughts be bent upon acquire- ing glorious name which can never die but with the werld and make that the noble recompence of all your labours be very careful how you form judgment of- your own performances ner depend too far on- the- approbation of your friends friends are our se- cond selves and apt to be too partial foes are the most sincere do not arrogantly difdain to learn the opinion of every individual person that observes your works- for even those who have little or no judgment in the art of drawing may distinguisn the defects of nature and by parity of reason may form just idea of the blemishes of the art be very careful not to be overseen in proportioning the circumstances of your brawings for tho the practice is too common it is shamefully ridiculous sometimes you shall see ’ hogse so very smail and the doors- so very low that they scarce reach the- knees of their inhabitants tho they are supposede néarer the eye of the spectator than the personga- who are ’ to ènter into them cities and towns some- times yoù will find so little and low that cne of the figures behind might stride over them with ease but such and the like absurdities ought carefully to be avoided let nat one side of your drawing be void whilst the ogher is sitted to the border but dispose matters so that both sides may appear equal but not uni form as reverse whether there are-many figurès in it or but sew avoid drawing such views as are unnatural as aslo forc ’ actions and-motions shew no parts which are eitier immodest or disagreeable to the sight avoid likewise objects which are full of hol iows broken in pieces or in parcels then all those things which are inhuman and shocking to the eyes as also all representations which are obscene lascivi- ous unseemly fantastic poor and wretched in fhort all things which corrupt their natural forms by confusion of their farts which are entangled in each other for the eye looks-down with horrour on those tnings which ttie hands will not condescend to touch have no manner of relish for gothic ornaments since they are in effect so many monsters which bar- barous nations have produc consider the place where you lay the scene of your picture the manner of all the person ’ actions an it their laws customs and dress and every thing in short that properly belongs to them in all your operations follow the order of na- ture carefully avoid drawing clouds towards the bottom of your piece and waters in the uppermost parts of it never place stone column on foun- dation of wood but observe decorûm it was saying of xenophon that nothing pleases man so much as decency and order and it is rule laid dovn in horace which is equally just in draw¬ ing as in poetry set all things in their own peculiar place and know that order is the greatest grace this good oeconomy or distinction of figures in their proper places produce the same effect in re- lation to the eyes as concert of musick to the ears observe therefore in the- disposition of your work that the spectator at the first glance of the eye may conceive the principal paffio -it intends to inspire if the subject you have chosen be that of joy it is nècessary that every thing which enters into your picture should contribute to that passion if that of sorrow let every thing in it haven ’ sereke of distress take care to avoid introducing figures that are foreign to your subject for such may be call ’ pléa- fantly enough figures to be let horace it is true has given poets and painéers permission to dare every thing but yet he licenees neither of them to transgress the known laws eof nature for he adds immediately after but let the bounds of lieentes be fix not things of disagreeing nature mix not sweet with sowr nor birds with serpents joyn' nor the fierce lyon with the fearful hind use therefore your licences with becoming boldness but let them be ingenious and not im¬ moderate and extravagant lastly never trust too far to the strength of your memory anid the conceptions of nature imprinted on ycur mind the memory is too weak too niar- row to retain all the various objects of our sight the best and furest method is to have nature herself as often as possible you can for your model of lights and shadows having thus lead the young practitioner thrcugh the first rudiments of drawing his out-lines shall now proceed to what principarly aim ’ at in this efsay to instruct him in the dispo¬ sition of the lights and shadows of his figures ac- cording to their respective situations which is eloath- ing the designs or drawings dressing them up and making them appear more lively than what they are do nothing rashly weigh well and consider what you are about some faais require à fainter others stronger light and some shadows must be deeper than others be curious in you observation of their quantity and mixtures as to the contours or out-lines take notice where they are te direct the shadows how much light centers in the lines where they are broad and strong and where faint and lan guid never let your lights and shadows terminate apruptly -but fall gradually one within another till at last like cloud of smoke they lose themselves insensibly if you habituate yourselves to be thus curious and exact practice will soon render ycu ex- peditious when you-draw after nature or the life con- sider how large or small the object is which you propose to imitate remove yourself from it three times its magnitude have your eye in level with it and be very curious as you draw every indivi- dual stroke to remark what shadow ’ parts of your statue nudity or any other object you are imitating meet under perpendicular or principal lines as to the position of your model high light equally diffus ’ and not too strong and glaring is the best objects so dispos ’ shew all their beauties and the minutest parts appear to advantage the light thus falling from above does not strike upon or inlighten all the parts but some are shelter ’ by the relievo of others the eyebrows defend the- hollow of the eye the nose some part of the mouth and the chin obscures the throat you must likewise observe that the shadows of objects are not always single fesides the strong and eprincipal shade there are many others which are almost imperceptibly thrown overs like thin cloud upon-it but experience will convince you of the truth and ferspective of the reason of it for all spherical bodies receive as many varicus lights and snadows as there are various bodies that furround them the picture of fine lady hung up at the en- trance of dark room will strike the eye with surprising delight by the awer of lights and shadows if it is artfully disposed that is if the shadow ’ side of the face appears obscur ’ by the gloominess of the place towards which it is situated the illumin ’ side is still heightened by the bright ness of the air which expands itself over the wholg whereby the shadows on that side become aé least very faint if not wholly imperceptible this artful increase of lights and shadows gives any figure fine relievo and makes it shine with more than cor- mon lustre in drawing à face therefore never let the muscles be too bold or-close too abruptly all on sudden but let your lights be sweet die away as it were and inseniably loose themselves in soft delightful shadows on your due care in this particular all the charms and graces of face principally depends always choose if convenience will permit of it north light for your constant situation as ’ tis- much steadier than any other if your chamber fhould be open to the south it wiil be very proper and convenient to fik an oil ’ paper sash before it for by that medium the rays of the sun which will strike upon it all day will be more moderate equally diffuse itself and be constant without any visable variation when you are drawing from the life let youi light come from such an altitude as that the shadows of bodies projected on the plane may be equal and in proportion to their height in the representations of bodies give them al ways such lights as are most proper ard convenient to their supposed situation if in the fields and open air the sun is obscur ’ by the clouds and not visible they should be surrounded with an al most universal light but if the sun be conspicuous or fhines out in its full lustre then the shadows musk be very strong and dark in relation to those farts which receive the light and the extremities of all those shadows as well those which are bor- rowed as tlaose that are criginal must be very bold if the object you have chosen for your repre sentation be supposed in room little though not very much illumin ’ and you survey it from with out and stand on level with the light that strikes upon it the shadows of that figure must necessarily be very soft and look beauteous to the eye for notwithstanding the softnefs of the shadous the figure will feem as if emboss ’ and come boldly out particular lights you ’ il find more advantageous to figure than universal ones and make them appear with the greatest relievo the reason of this is particular lights produce reflexes which loosen as it were the figures from the ground these re flexes are created by the lights of figures or some thing light behind them and reverberate or dart back upon the shadows of those which are di rectly over-against them and giye them glimmer ing light but figure if supposed in dack and obscure place though exposed to particular light receives no reffex no parts of it are seen but what are illuminated this indeed is seldom or never used but in night-pieces where the light must be very particular and exceeding faint the qut-lines or contours of figures however discover more art and contrivance than the lights and shadows which is but the third part of draw ing and in colouring it is cail cromatique for in vention is the first part and the out-lines are the next which is the composition and disposition of the work to put all things in beautiful order and harmony without which you are but copier for invention requires the greatest strength of ima gination and shadowing the extent for the mem bers are all limited to certain and peculiar motions whereas the projections of shadows the qualities and degradations of light are boundless and un circumscribed when you draw after any figure and ’ sind your self at loss to limit the exact eounds of your sha dows dows always leave them unfinish ’ by this artful negligence you discover your own mdesty and at the same time your strict regard to the imitation of nature all allow that the air is clearer more subtle and transparent the farther it is remov ’ from the earth upon which account the upper parts of objects that appear above us and are seen at some considerable distance are more visible and conspicuous than those that are under for the visual rays whereby we discern the latter journey through long track of grofs and dense air but the rays by which we view the former though they begin in thick and foggy air onthe side of the eye yet on the side of the object they terminate in much clearer and more subtle air the further they remove from the eye they become finer and finer in drawing landskips therefore you must always make your mountains less clear at the bottom than the top and the same rule must be observ ’ as to churches and other high buildings the greater distance they are suppos ’ to be at the clearer always miust their tops appear and the loftier they are their forms must in proportion be more con- spicuqus and distinct objects that are nearest the eye and placed in the front of the picture must be more finisn and more bold than those supposed to be at some die stance from us as to reflexes of light on clear and transparent bedies whose surfaces are moderately dense and po- siffi ’ ray of light that thus strikes upon these bodies reverberates or rebounds liks tennis-bail and reflects upon the first body that stands in its way the surfaces of dense bodies are surrounded with light and shadows whose qualities are widely distant there arè twe sorts or kinds of lights namely primative and and derivitive primitive light is that which is innate in any body and not borrowed of aany other derivitive light is light reflected that which is not inherent in body and is borrowed of another the light of the sun is an original light he shines with his proper rays the moon is an opaque body of herself and all her light is bor- rowed her silver beams all sne can boast of she receives from that superior luminary but to proceed there can be no reflex of light en that side of body whereon it is shadowed that is to say from that side turn ’ towards any opaque place or body as groves trees herbs or plants for though every bough and every leaf admit of light yet the vast number of boughs and leaves constitute dark body through which the rays of light can never enter the reflexes of light are brighter or less appa¬ rent according as the ground on which they are discern ’ is more or less obscure when the ground is more dark than the reflex the former serves as foil to the latter and the reflex will appear strong and apparent on the other hand when the ground is brighter than the reflex it must naturally appear more gloomy by the lustre that surrounds it and by which means it can scarcely be discern ’ but that which is visible on the darkest ground must appear the boldest and most plain on the other hand that on the brightest ground must be least di stinct and most obscure this arises from the contrast between things of different degree of darkness the least obscure setting aff the others with superior lustre and the brighter rendering the others still more obscure and less ob vious to the sight as any two things of unequal whiteness when play by way of contrast one against the other the superior whitenéss reflects foil on the other beyond its native darkness for light being of communicative nature diffuses itself on every thing not hid from it par- ticuiarly on every thing that is plain and smooth but where there happens the least elevation sha- dow is produced which exhibits the figure of the illuminated part on the plan light though quite contrary to shadow is yet what gives it its being as the body or object is what gives its form or figure in effect it must be held for certain maxim that shadows always retain the same point of sight as the objects small light illumining body occasions the shadows on the unenlightened side to be large and their extremities to be very bold on the other hand large light makes the shadow on the same side of the body less distinct and mere minute in their limitations when little but strong light is inclosed in another more extensive yet still more weak as the sun in the air the most feeble in that case will have the effect of shadow on the bodics which are enlightened by it in any drawing therefore where multitude of frigures are introduced either men or beasts you must observe to make those appear the most obscure that are lowest and farthest involved in the croud figures that are expos ’ to an universal light ap- pear more beautiful and strike the eye more agrce- ably than those that are illumin ’ only with par- ticular light and the reason is because large and strong light surrounds the relievoes of bodies so that the figures enlightened thereby appear with force and freedom and preserve themselves at great distance whereas those that are more confined and only enlightened by small contracted light receive very large as well as very deep shadows you must never admit two equal lights in the same picture and let the light strike forcibly on the middle or front of your drawings and lastly when you draw your figures avoid strong shadows on the middle of the limbs but place those shadows round abcut them thereby to heighten the parts and take such advantageous lights as are large that after great shadows may suc- ceed as for sattins and silks and all other shining stuffs they have certain bright reflexions with sudden lights and exceeding bright glances especially where the light falls broad then the reflexions are less bright as the garment falls more inward from the light the like is seen in armour and brafs pots or any glittering metals you may fee à sudden brightnefs in the middle or centre of the light which causes the shining nature of all such things as thefe directions if carefully followed will be sufficient presume to answer the end proposed in prefixing this snert essay shall freely submit the following exemplifications of them to the censure or approbation of the publick
