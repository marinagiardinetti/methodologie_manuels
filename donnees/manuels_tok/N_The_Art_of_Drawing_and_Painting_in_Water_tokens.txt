appearances of objects by imitation or expressing by lines and shades the formi or appearance of any thing in nature or art the copying of another draught or any design conceived in the mind and all this without the assistance of mathematical rules the art of drawing being an accomplishment not more elegant agreeable and ornamental than useful is therefore by no means to be neglected in the education of youth wherein any genius or inclination that way is discovered besides its being of all arts the most universally ad- mired and esteemed there are few other arts or professions to which it is not assisting its great ujse is not only confined to painters engravers gardeners embroiderers weavers and many others concerned in designing but the mathe- matician engineer architect and navigator daily practise it all designs and models are executed by it its use appears in every station of life and it is equally admired by children and by adults to be able on the spot to take the sketch of fine building or beautiful prospect of any curious production of art or uncommon appear- ance in nature is not only very desirable accom- plishment but veryagreeableamusement rocks mountains fields woods rivers cataracts cities towns castles houses fortifications ruins or whatever else may present itself to view on our journeys or travels in our own or in fo- reign countries may be thus brought home and preserved for our future use either in business or conversation this art transmits to our view things that are long since past or would otherwise perisn reprefents to us the deeds of people aud nations for many ages dead and preserves the features féatures and resemblance of ancestors or other valuable persons for many generations it is therefore no wonder that an attainment so uni¬ versally useful and admired should be distinguished as one of the highest embellishments of liuman life and be patronized and cultivated by all the generous and ingenious part of mankind chap ii of the proper materials for drawing evhe materials required in drawing are black lead-pencils crayons of black white ar red chalk crow-quill pens rule and compasses camel ’ hair pencils and in- dian ink accustom yourself to hold your pencil further from the point than you do in writing which- will give you better command of it and con- tribute to render your strokes more free and bold theuie of your pencil is to drawthe first sketches or qut-lines of your piece as any stroke or line that is amiss may in this be more easily rubbed out than in anyother thing and when you have made your sketch as correct as you can with the pencil you may then draw carefully the best qut-line you have got with your crow-quill pen and ink the ink made use of fof this pur- pose must not be the common but indian ink being much softer than the other andnot running and and by mixing it with water it may be made to any degree of strength and may be used in pen like common ink after using the ink you may wipe out the pencil-lines by rubbing the piece gently with the crumb of stale bread having thus got your out-line discharged your next work is to shade your piece properly as you shall be directed below either by drawing fine strokes with your pen where it requires to be shaded or by washing it with the hair-pencil and the indian ink as to the rule and com- passes they are never or rarely to be used except in measuring the proportions of your figures after you have drawn them to prove whether they are right or not or in houses fortifications and gher pieces of architecture red lead and red or black chalk are used in the same manner as black lead white chalk and tobacco-pipe clay are used in heightening or giving stronglights and in drawing on coloured paper pastils or crayons are any colours mixed with tobacco-pipe clay which while soft and in the consistency of paste is rolled up in pieces about the thickness of quill and two or three inches in length and then dried they are gene- rally used on coloured paper and the colours are rubbed and wrought one into another in such manner that no strokes appear but the whole looks as if it was done with brusn chap iii of light and shade it is the artful management of light and shade — that gives the appearance of substance roundness and distance to whatever bodies are represented by drawing draw circle on piece of paper fill it up with any even colour and it will appear to be body with round cir- cumference and flat sides but by colouring it stronger in the middle and causing it gradually to weaken towards the circumference it will receive convex appearance like that of bali or glabe wherever the vivacity of colour is strongest that part of the object catches the sight first and appears nearest to it whereas its weakness and goings off are more and more bro- ken and faint and seem to ffy farther off from the sight in rounding the païts of any ohject the extremities in turning must lose themselves insen- sibly and confusedly without precipitating the shadows into the light but the passage of the one into the other must be common and impercep- tible that is by degrees of light into shadow and shadow into light objects that are paint- ed light must have sufficient breadth of shadow to sustain them and dark bodies must have sud- den light behind to detach them from the ground or from those objects that are placed belind them otherwise they will appear confufedly as sticking upon each other whereas the opposition of shade- to light object and of light to dark one gives projection and separates them from other bodies there should be balance preserved between- the lights and shadows broad light ought- riot to be introduced into draught without large shadow the nearer any object is to the eye it is seen so much tlie stronger and plainer sight is weakened by distances and the more reicte any object is it is seen in more imper- fect manner therefore those objects which are- placed foremost to the view ought to be more- sinissied than thosc that are cast behind and they should have such relative dominion over each other that as one object by its heightningss- causes others to retire more backwards so the same object must be chased and made to appear farther fromthe sight than others which are more- strongly illuminated it is not sufficient that remote objects be only coloured in more faint and languid manner but according to their distance the parts must appear more or less confused the eye not being able to discover minutely what is far separated from it pure and unmixed white either draws an object nearer or carries it off to greater distance it it be accompanied with black the opposition of light and dark renders the object more sensi- ble and brings it nearer to the advanced part but pure white being the lightest of colours unless it be forced forwards and supported by black will sly off to the remotest view as for pare black it is the heaviest most earthy and- most sensible of all colours and- brings the objects nearer to the sight it must be placed in masses be insensibly confused and have its proper reposes the representations of bodics give them al- ways such lights as are most proper and conveni- ent to their supposed situations if the objects are in the fieldsor open air and the sun not visible or obscured by clouds you must then introduce almost an universal light though not warm and strong and your shades must be faint but when the sun is conspicuous and shines in its full lustre then the light must be very strong and bold and the shadows very dark if the objects you represent be supposed in room little but not very much illuminated and you survey it from without and stand on level with the light that strikes upon it the shadows of that figure must be very soft whereby the figure it- self will appear beauteous to the eye and will notwithstanding the softness of the shadow seem- as imbossed and come boldly out small light illuminating body occasions the shadows on the dark side to be large and their extremities to be very bold on the other hand light makes the shadows on the darker side to be more distinct and more soft in their limitations reflection is to be used in delineating glittering or shining bodies as glass pearls silver let the cause of the reflection beit more or lefs be seen in the thing itself place all your lights one way through the whole work and if the light falls sideways on the picture the other side which is the farthest from the light must be made the darkest that part of the body must be made lightest which has the light most opposite to it if the light be placed above the head then the top of the head must be made lightest the shoulder must receive the next greater degree of light and thus must you continue to fhiade losing the light by degrees by how much one part of the body projects more than another it must by so much be made the lighter and on the contrary those parts that bend in- ward must be made so much the darker two equal lights must never be made in one and the fame picture the greater is to strike forcibly into the miedle and with greatest lustre on thofe parts of the design where the principal figures and strength of the action seem to lie diminisn- ing it gradually as it approaches nearest the ex- tremities of the piece general rules for drawing begin with plain geometrical figures as lines angles triangles polygons arches circles ovals cones cylinders and the like being the foundations of all other proportions the circle is of use in the several orbicular forms as the sun moon globes the oval in giving just proportion to the face and mouth and the square confines picture youare to copy the triangle is of use in drawing side or half face angles and arches in perspective and the polygon in ground-plats fortifications the cone in spires steeples tops of towers the cylinder in columns pil- lars having brought your hand to be fit and ready in general proportions accustom yourself to give every object its due shades according to its concavity or convexity and to elevate or deprefs the same as the object appears either nearer or farther off the light before you begin to work view your original with close attention divide it in your mind into several parts observe the length the breadth and the similitude of each part consider their proportion to each other and to the whole the distances from one part to the other and what parts lie opposite to each other after you have done your copy view it afresh by comparing it with the original for the dis- covering and amending of faults as it will not only serve to perfect you in that particular draught but will improve- your knowledge of lines and proportions in general and in time enable you for the nearest imitations the qut-lines must be drawn in gliding manner large and smooth which will give them the resemblance of life and motion you must preserve in your draught strong resemblance between the parts and the whole every member ought to be made to agree strong limbs have no relâtion to con- sumptive body or decayed old age and the eyes legs hands and feet should be exactly naired having good copies to draw after learn to re- duce them to other proportions either larger or smaller and this by frequent practice in draw- ing fruits as apples pears cherries with their leaves herbs trees of different kinds as also in the imitation of beasts fowls fishies it is requifite not only to be perfect in laying down the exact proportions but before you proceed to the shadowing and trimming your work to be well acquainted in the general or out- ward lines and this is still more necessary in imitating the body of man with all its line- aments as head nose eyes ears cheeks arms and shoulders as also in the drapery or fmitation of the cloathing and the artificial set- ting off the outward coverings habits and or- naments of the body in their natural and proper folds chap particular directions for drawing in drawing after picture or print you must take care to place it in such light that the- glofs of- the colours may not interrupt yours view but so that the light and your eye may fall- equally and obliquely upon the piece to this- end you are to consider from what point and in- what direction the eight falls upon the objects according to which direction let all your lights and shades be placed throughout the work.. that part of the object must be the lightest which- has the light most directly opposite to it if the- light falls sideways on your picture you must make that side which is opposite to it lightest and on the contrary that side which is farthest from it darkest let the piece be placed at such distance that upon opening your eyes -you may view it all at once and the larger the picture is it fhould be so much the more placed off at the greater distance but right before you and little reelined draw all your ont-lines at first very faint with the feathers of duck ’ wing or the crumb of bread bread and these out-lines should be drawn true and agreeable to the pattern before you begin to shadow any part of the object the qut-lines next the light should be drawn more faint and when vou have drawn one feature it should be direction for you in some measure to draw ano- ther by observing with your eye the distance from that to the next feature making afull mark at the place with your coal then draw it and so to the next till you have drawn the whole figure then obserye the middle of the picture you would copy and touch upon the paper with the point of your coal afterwards observe the more conspicuous and uppermost figures if there are more than one which you are to touch lightly in their proper places thus running over the whole draught you will see as it were the skeleton of the piece you are to draw having made out these sketches view them diligently to see if they answer your pattern or not for the gestures of the life ought to shew themselves eminently in the first and rudest draught of the piece correct and amend what- ever you perceive amiss adding and diminishing as it varies from the pattern by which means it will be brought nearer and nearer to the life observe the distance of one limb joint or muscle from another and the same in all other accidents of the figure their length bréadth turnings shadow next to the light very faintly and where you see bold and free touches be not timorous in expressing the same in draw- ing head after the life or otherwise take care to place the features exactly right upon the cross- lines whether it be full face or three-quarter face in fore-shortening you must make the crofs-lines to sly upwards but where the aspect is downwards they must be made downwards in circular manner having drawn the qut-lines true with coal you are to proceed to trace the same lines again with pen indian ink drawing them with more exactness ’ and by imitating all the hatches with their exact distances one from another their crossings turnings and windings with more boldness and freedom perfect your design in drawing after naked body all the muscles are not to be so plainly expressed as in anatomical figures but that side whose parts are most appa¬ rent and of signification in the performance of any action must be made to appear more or lefs according to the force of that action in drawing young persons the muscles must not appear manifestly so hard as in elder and full grown persons the same thing is to be observed as to fat and fleshy persons and such as are very delicate and beautiful and in women scarce any muscles muscles at all are to be expreffed or but very little unless it be in some very forcible action and then too they are to be represented very faint -- ly the like is also to be observed as to children the motion of the whole body muit be consi- dered in drawing of the muscles as in the risinc- and falling of the arms the muscles of the breast appear either more or less the hips do the like according as they are bent outward or inward and it is the same chiefly in the shoulders sidez and neck according to the several actions of the body the breadth and largeness of picture is also- to be considered it should be larger about the legs and garments shewing itself slender aboye by discovering one shoulder and hiding the other which is shortened by turning the body but- sometimes the figure is to be represented biggest in the upper parts by representing either or both- the shoulders or both the arms shewing the one leg and hiding the other orboth of them after one manner at discretion neither ought this to be observed only in the whole body but even in every part so that in the legs when is raised outwards on the one side that which is directly on the contrary side must be drawn in and-hid as it appears in the life.. the proportion of the figure ought to be mul¬¬ tiplied by degrees in proportion ofone to two three three four for herein the chief skill confists the diameter of the biggest place between the knee and the foot is double the least and the largest part of the thigh triple ch ap vi of drawing faces in drawing head it is usually divided into four equal parts from the crown of the head to the top of the forehead from the top of the forekead to the eyebrows from the eyebrows to the bottom of the nose from thence to the bottom of the chin but this proportion is not constant those features in different men being often very different as to length and shape in well proportioned face however they are nearly right to direct you therefore in forming perfect face your first business is to draw complete oval as you see in plate figure in the middle of which from the top to the bot- tom draw perpendicular line and through the center or middle of this line draw another directly acrofs from one side to the other of your oval on these two lines all the features of the face are to be drawn as follows divide your per- pendicular line into four equal parts the first must be allotted to the hair of the head the second is fromthe top of the forehead to the top of the nose between the eyebrows the third is from thence- thence to the bottom of the nofe and the fourtk includes the lips and chin theline across the perpendicular one or the breadth of the face is always supposed to be the length of five eyes you must therefore divide it into five equal parts and place the eyes upon it so as to leave exactly the derstood only of full front face for if it turns to either side then the distances are to be lessened on that side which turns from you less or more in the top of the ear proportion to its turning is to rise parallel to the eyebrows at the end of the diameter or erofs line and the bottom of it must be equal to the bottom of the nose the nostrils ought not to come out farther than the corner of the eye in any face and the middle of the mouth must always be placed upon the perpen- dicular line the mouth when shut is as the following is an ingenious device which perhaps may somewhat assist the young practition- er in forming the face according to its different turnings and in placing the features properly thereon procure piece of smooth wood turned for the purpose in the shape of an egg which is nearly the shape of the human head draw line lengthways quite round it as in the last fig and divide this line into two equal parts by ano- ther line drawn directly across it at right angles the features being drawn on these two lines accord- according to the rules delivered above will pro- duce fore-right face turn the oval small matter from the left hand to the right and the perpendicular will appear bent like bow as you see in fig upon which the particular fea- tures are to be drawn as in fig always ob- serving in what manner the nose projects beyond the round of the oval the same must be ob- served ff you ’ turn the oval from the right hand to the left as in fig and if you incline the oval downwards and to the right the lines of the crofs will appear as in fig and the fea- tures drawn on them as in fig if you turn it upwards reclining to the left the lines of the crofs will appear as in fig and face drawn on them as infig great variety of faces may be shewn by this oval according as you incline recline or turn it more or less but those figures which come sideways are to be drawn by means of perpendicular as in fig upon which the forehead nose mouth and chin are tobe drawn as you see in fig is to be observed that if the face be fat the gheeks will seem to swell if lean the jawsbones will stick out and the checks fall in but ffit be neither too fat nor too lean it willbe nearly round touch the features lightly where the eyes nose mouth and chin should stand then begin to draw them more exactly and so proceed till you have finished the face after which draw the hair beard and shadows about it you are to consi- der der all those chief touches which give life to face and that discover the disposition of the mind thus the mouth extended and the cor- ners turning à little up shews smiling counte¬ nance you must take care that the sha- be light because afterwards they can not be ren- dered more light and remember that they are to be more faint and light in fair than in swarthy complexion chap vii of the measures andproportions of the several parts of tbe body he ancients commonly allowed eight heads to their figures though some of them had but seven however the moderns ordinarily di- vide their figure into ten faces thatis from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot in the manner following from the crown of the head to the forchead is the third part of the face.. the face begins at the lowest hairs which are upon the forehead and ends at the bottom of the chin the face is divided into three proportional parts the first contains the forehead the second the nose and the third the mouth and chin from the chin to the pit between the collar-bones are two lengths of nose from the pit betwixt the collar-bone to the bottom of the breast one face from the the bottom of the breast to the navel one face from the navel to the genitals one face from the genitals to the upper part of the knee two faces the knee contains half face from the lower part of the knee to the ancle two faces from the ancle to the sole of the foot half face man when his arms are stretched out is from the longest finger of his rigkt hand to the longest of his left as broad as he is long from one side of the breasts to the other two faees the bone of the arm called humerus is the length of two faces from the shoulder to the elbow from the end of the elbow to the root of the little finger the bone called cubitus with part of the hand contain two faces from the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit betwixt the collar-bones one face if vou will be satisfied in the measures of breadth from the extremity of one finger to the other so that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body you must observe that the boxes of the el- bovs with the humerus and of the humerus with the shoulder-blade bear the proportions of half face when the arms are stretched out the sole of the foot is the sixth part of the figure the thamb contains nose the inside of the arm from the place where the muscle disappears which makes the breast call- ed the pectoral muscle to the middie of the arm four noses from the middle of the arm to the beginning of the hand five noses the long- est toe is nosé long the two utmost parts of the teats and the pit betwixt the collar-bones of woman make an equilateral triangle for the breadth of the limbs no precise measures can be given because the measures themselves are changeable according to the quality of the persons and according to the movement of the muscles chap viii of drawing the boox at full length irst make your oval for the head and hav- ing divided it according to the instructions already given draw perpendicular line from the top of the head to the sole of the foot and measure out eight lengths of the head this line is of special use to direct you in placing the figure upright and in the action of the pos- ture where it falls in and where it swells out one head ’ length from the chin you must draw the breasts the third measure reacheth to the navel the fourth to the privities the fifth to the middle of the thigh the sixth to the lower part of the knee the seventh to the lower part of the leg and the eighth to the heel and sole of the foot observe in every measure what touches à there are of the muscles draw that leg first on which the body stands then draw the other and after that the arms and hands but draw at first all the parts very lightly with coal only because there is least trouble in altering and rubbing out the coal as for the hands they are twice as long as they are broad and each of their parts has its length breadth and thickness the nail ’ upon the finger is about half the joint it is upon the length of the foot is à sixth part of the height of person and the length is five eighths more than the breadth the length of the face and hands ought to be exactly equal and makes but just the tenth part of person ’ height the rules in drawing children are as follow- some make child to contain five measures of the head viz from the top of the head to the privities three and in the thighs and legs two more the breadth between the shoulders the length of head and half the breadth of the body above the navel the length of onc head and the breadtn of the upper part of the thigh is the third part of two lengths of the head the breadth of the knee is just the measure there is betwixt the eyes and the chin the small of the leg and the brawn of the arm are of the thickness of the neck in general let it be observed always to begin with the right side of the piece you are copying for by so doing you will always have what is done before your eyes and the rest will follow more naturally and with greater ease whereas if you begin with the left side your hand and arm will cover what you do first and deprive vou of the sight of it by which means you will not be able to proceed-with so much ease plea- sure or certainty as to the-order and manner of your proceeding in drawing the human body you must first szetch the head then the shoul¬ ders in their exact breadth then draw the trunk of the body beginning with the arm-pits leav- ing the arms till afterwards and so down to the hips on-both sides being sure to observe the exact breadth of the waist when you have done this then draw that leg which the body stands upon and afterwards the other which stands loose then draw the arms and last of all the hands take notice also of the bowings and bendings of the body making the part opposite to that which bends correspond in bending with it for instance if one sidc of the body bends in the other must stand oût answerable to it if the back bends in the belly raust slick out if the knee bends out the hain must fail in and so of any other joint in tlie baidy finally endeavour to- form all the farts of your figure with truth and in juît proportieii nat one arm or one leg bigger or less than the other not broad shoul- ders with thin stender waist nor raw and bony arms with thick and gouty legs but let there be kind of harmony and agreement amongst the members and an agreeable symmetry throughout the whole figure but as the essence of drawing consists in mak- ing at first good sketch you must in this par- ticular be very careful and accurate draw no tered that to your mind you may then finisn one part after another as curioussy as you can in draw¬ ing the eyes ears legs arms hands feet great care study and practice are requisite this must be learned by carefully imitating the best prints or drawings you can get of eyes ears for as to the mechanical rules of draw- ing them by lines and measures they are not only perplexed and difficult but also contrary to the practice of the best masters but the actions and postures of thè hand are so many and vari- ous that no certain rules can be given for drawing them that will universally hold good and as the hands and feet are difficult membeis to dtaw it is necessary and well worth while to bestow some time and pains about them careful- ly imitating their van ious postures and actions so as not only to avoid all lameness and imperfection but also to give them life and spirit in drawing labouring man you must repre- sent him with strong limbs and ralsed muscles swelling and standing out especially in bearing burdens drawing weights leaping walking combating or such like violent exercifes in re- presenting persons afleep you must carefully avoid giving any such postures or actions in their lying as would not in all probability afford rest for great want of judgment would appear in repre- senting their limnbs or bodies supported by their own force and not by the help of something else with regard to the representation of the pas- fions mr. de piles observes that it is absurd as well as impossible to pretend giving such par- ticular demonstration of them as to fix theur expression to certain strokes which the painter should be obliged to make use of as essential and invariable rules this says he would be de- priving the art of that excellent variety of ex- epression which has no other principle than di- versity of imagination the number of which is infinite the same passion may-be expressed several ways each yielding more or less pleafure in proportion to the painter ’ understanding and the spectator ’ discernment though every part of the face contributes towards expressing the sentiments of the heart yet the eyebrow according to mr le brun is the principal scat of expression and where the passions passions make themselves most known it is certain says he that the pupil of the eye by its fire and motion very well shews the agita- tion of the soul but then ’ it does not express the kind or nature of that agitation whereas ’ motion of the eyebrow differs according as the passions change their nature to express sim- ple passion the motion is simple to express mixt pafsion the motion is compound if the paf- sion be gentle the motion is gentle if it be vio- lent the motion is so too we may farther ob -- serve says he that there are two kinds of ele- vation in the eyebrows one in which the eye- brows rise up in the middle this elevation ex- presses agreeable sensations and it is to be ob- served that then the mouth rises at the corners another in which the eyebrows rise up at the ends and fall in the middle denotes bodily pain and then the mouth falls at the corners in laoghter all the parts agree for the eyebrows which sall towards the middle of the forehead make the nose the mouth and the eyes follow the same motion in weeping the motions are compound and contrary for the eyebrows fall towards the nose and over the eyes and the mouth rises that way it is to be observed also that the mouth is the part of the face which more particularly expresses the emotions of the heart for when the heart complains the mouth falls at the corners when it is pleased the corners of the mouth are elevated and when it has an aversion the mouth shoots forward and rises in the middie the head says mr. de piles contributes more to the exprefsion of the passions than all the other parts of the body put together those separate- ly can only shew some few passions but the head expresses them all some however are more peculiarly expressed by it than others as humility by hanging it down arrogance by lifting it up languisnment by inclining it on one side and obstinacy with stiff and resolute air makes it stand upright sixed and stiff between the shoul- ders the head also best shews our supplications threats mildness pride love hatred joy and grief the whole face and every feature con- tribute something but more especially the eyes yet though the paffions of the soul are most visible in the lines and features of the face they often require also the assistance of other parts of the body without the hands for instance an ac- tion is weak and imperfect their actions which are almost infinite create nuinberless expreffions mise cail and send back they are the instruments of threatning prayer praise by them we in great measure approve condenin refuse admit fear afk cxpress our joy and grief our doubts regrets pain and admiration but to say how these parts must be disposed for expressing tie varsous paffions is impossible nor can any exact rules be given for it both because the task would would be infinite and because every one must be guided in- this by his own genius and the particu- chap ix of drapery in the art of cloathing your figures or casting the drapery upon themwith elegance and pro¬ priety many thirigs are to be observed how- ever this art consists chicssy in three points viz the order of the folds or plaits the different quality of the stuffs and the variety of their co- lours as to the folds they ought to be so manag- ed as that you may easily perccive what it is they cover and distinguishi it from any thing else as for instance that you see it is an arm that is under the drapery and not leg or leg and not an arm again the folds ought to be large and contrast should be observed between them otherwise in the first place they break and divide the sight too much and in the next place the drapery will be too stiff as to the quality of the stuffs it should be well considered some folds being abrupt and harsh while others flow more soft and easy again the surface of some have à lustre while other are flat and dead and some are fine and transparent while others are firm and solid the variety of colours when well managed makes the greatest beauty in paint- ing some are not equally agreeable with respect to each other and some are never to be placed near certain others the drapery must never be made to adhere or stick too close to the parts of the body but it must seem to flow round and as it were embrace them yet in such manner as that the figure may be casy and have free motion great light- ness and motion of the drapery are only proper in figures in much agitation or exposed to the wind the nudities of the figure should always be designed before you proceed to draw the dra- peries draw the qut-lines of the garments lightly then draw the great folds first and stroke these into lesser taking care that they do not cross one another the draperies that cover those parts which are exposed to great light must not be so deeply shaded as to seem to pierce them nor should those members be crossed by folds that are too strong lest by the too greai darkness of their shades the members look as if they were broken folds in general should be large and as few as possible however they must be greater or less according to the quantity and quality of the stuffs of which the drapery is supposed to be made suit the garments to the body and make them bend with the body according as it stands in or out strait or crooked or as it bends one way or ano- ther and the closer the garment sits to the body the narrower and smaller must be the foids the quality of the person is also to be consider- ed in the drapery for instance if they are ma- gistrates their draperies ought to be large fine and flowing if country-clowns they ought to be coarse and short and if ladies and nymphs light and soft folds well imagined give- much spirit to any kind of action because their motion implies the like in the acting member which seems to draw them forcibly and make them more or less stirring as the action is more or less violent an artful complicatiun of folds in circular manner greatly helps the effect of fore-snortenings all folds consist of two shades and no more which you may turn with the gar- ment at pleasure shadowing the inner side more deeply the shades in silks and sine linnen are very thick and small requiring.little folds and light shadowe observe the motion- of the air or in order to draw the loose apparel all slying one way and draw that part of the gar- ment that adheres closest to the body before yoû draw the looser part that slies off from it lest by drawing the loose part of the garment first you should mistake the position of your figure and place it awry.. rich ornaments when judicioussy and spar- ingly used may sometimes contribute to the beauty of draperies but such ornaments are far below the dignity of angels or heavenly figures the grandeur of whose draperies ought rather to-con¬ sist in the boldness and nobleness of tlie folds than in the quality of the stuff or the glitter of ornaments light and flying draperies are pro- per only to figures in great motion or in the wind but when in calm place and free from violent action their draperies should be large and slowing that by their contrast and the fall of the folds they may appear with grace and dignity chap of drawing mixed figures in order to draw the form of any beast be- gin at the

head ears and neck till you have given the full compass of the buttock afterwards mark out the legs and touching out the breast with the eminency thereof finish the tail paws tongue teeth beard and the several shadows in drawing beasts you must be well acquainted with their shape and action without which you wiil never perform any thing excellent in this way- and whatever beast you draw you must

begin at the pinion for making the wing this being joined to the back-line the figure will be presently finished the eyes legs and tail are to be drawn last the feathers beginning at the head very small must fall backwards one way in five ranks still increasing till finished infects as flies bees wasps grasshoppers worms and such like are drawn with great ease provided you for the first time have the original before your eyes in drawing flower begin from the rose-tuft or wart in-the middle as in rose or marigold- with the yellow tuft which being made draw lines equally divided from thence to the greatest compass or extent of the flower they may be drawn either fully open or in the bud the laaves may first be drawn rudely afterwards giving them their veins or jaggedness chap xi.. of drawing landskips buildings ll true drawing consists in nicely measur- ing the distances of each part of your piece by the eye in order to facilitate this you are to imagine in your own mind that the piece you copy is divided into squares as for example suppose or imagine à perpendicular and an hori- zontal line crossing each other in the center of the picture you are to copy then suppose also two such lines crossing your own copy obierve in the original wnat parts of tlie design those lines interfect and let them fall on the same parts ef the supposed lines in your copy if you are to draw à landskip from nature take your sta¬ tion on rising ground where you may have large horizon and mark your tablet into three divisions downwards from the top to the bot- tom and divide in your own mind the land- skip you are to take intothree divisions also then turn your face directly opposite to the middle of the horizontal line keeping your body fixed and draw what is directly before your eyes upon the middle-divifion of your tablet then turn your head but not your body to the left hand and delineate what you view there joining it properly to what you had done before lastly do the same by what is to be seen on your right hand lay- ing down every thing exactly both with respect to distance and proportion make the nearest objects in your piece thehighest and those that are further off to shoot away lower and lower till they come almost level wlth the line-of the hori- zon lessening every thing proportionably to its distance and observing also to make your objects fainter and less distinct the farther they are removed from your eye make all your lights and shades fall one way and let every thing have its proper motion as trees shaken by the wind the small boughs bending more and the large ones less water agitated by the wind and dashing against ships or boats or falling from precipice upon rocks and stones and spirting up again into the air and sprinkling all about clouds also in the air now gathei- ed with the winds now violently condensed in- to hail rain and the like always remembering that whatever motions are eaused by the wind must all be made the same way let the work imitate the season it is intended torepresent as ifyouintend it fora winter-piece represent the felling of woods sliding upon the lce fowling hunting making the trees every where naked or laden with snow or hoar- frost the earth bare the air thick or heavy the water frozen with carts passing over it let every site have its proper adjuncts or ad- ditional graces as the farm-house wind mill water-mill woods flocks of sheep herds of cattle pilgrims ruins of temples castles and monuments with thousand such other things proper to particular subjects ch ap xii curious rulesfor drawing any object in its qut-lines as exact as nature with some far- ther instructions for shadowing without any regard to the forementioned rules or any knowledge in the art of drawing take sheet of the thinnest or whitest brown-paper and brushit over with oil of turpentine which will immediately render it transparent then after drying the paper in the air strain it upon frame and fix it against the object you design to draw this done place right before it picce of wood with hole in it fit for one ’ eye to look through and as you meet any out-lines of the object on the transpa¬ rent paper trace them over with pencil hy which means vou will obtain the just propor- tion and true representation of any object in its qut-lines to render this still more elegant observe the tracings of your draught wherever the shades are and mark them with your pencil for all the art in the world can never dispose the shades so regularly as one may touch by this method but the shades must be dra wn quickly after the qu -- lines are drawn not at different times because the sun instantly changes them here observe as in certain objects you will have fainter stronger and darker shades in your remarks of them to take such memoran- dums as may direct vou how to finisn them with indian ink or other colour when-you sit down to complete your work to this end the best way is before you trace out your object to prepare three shells or gallipots of indian ink mixed with common water viz one of very faint black one of middling black and one of an intense blackt tirnberitig them and as you make vaer observation on the shades of your object mark upon your draught the same numbers numbers as they happen to appcar so that after- wards you may finish with certainty in this regard the transparent paper is of great use for being laid upon any paper or print in loose sheet all the lines will be seen so perfectly through it that you may copy them with the greatest ease and if the print or picture be done by good master you can see which lines are strong which soft and how to imitate them there is yet another way to take views and landskips which some prefer to the transparent paper and that is either with white or black tiffany or lawn strained upon frame and used in the same manner as the paper except- ing that as the black-lead pencil is used to the paper on the white tiffany and on the lawn you must use charcoal very soft and finely pow- dered bat on the black tiffany very tender white chalk is to be used chap xiii stveral other curious and easy methods of taking views copying draughts prints to the greatest degree of accuracy draught may be taken regularly from drawing on transparent paper as fol- lows take piece of paper of the same size with that of the draught rub one side of it with sone powder of black-lcad till it be well and equally blacked so that finger touching it will hardly be tinged with the blacking then take the print and laying the paper underneath it with the black side downwards upon another piece of white paper of the same size pin the three together in two or three places after- wards take pin or needle somewhat blunted at the point and trace it over the qut-lines of your picture which with little pressing will direct the black paper to impress the white so as to receive every stroke you draw this done you may carefully correct what errors you see with-your black-lead pencil cleaning the new- made draughts slightly with the crumb of stale bread as for the draughts taken- on tiffany or- lawn they are only to be laid on paper that is such as is drawn with charcoal upon white and that drawn with chalk upon black or-blue pa- per and then giving each of them knock or- two with hammer the charcoal or the chalk will fall through them upon the papers directly in the lines they were drawn and give you the true representation of the object drawn from the life in white lines upon the black paper and in black lines upon the white then strengthen these shadows of drawings with your black-lead pencil chalk or red ’ oker upon the pieces of paper where they made the marks for otherwise the lines will easily be rubbed out but it must be observed that this amendment is to be made soon after the lines because those tender draughts will quickly vanisn if care is not taken to strengthen them immediately you are to begin this operation at the bottom of the drawing another way is by taking thin piece of paper and holding it against glass-window particularly sashed one because the interruption of the lead in the smaller glazed windows will hinder part of the prospect then draw what you see from the glass and afterwards the black- lead paper is to be used as- directed before there is another way still which may be more easy to the hand or arm of person not ac- customed to drawing upon paper or lawn placed upright which is by the use of camera obscura though to help the hand one may hold baguette or such stick in the left hand as the oil-painters use to rest the right hand upon or have some other rest made for the right hand as may be easily serewed up and down at pleasure but thère is this difference still between drawing piece of perspective or view on transparent paper or lawn placed upright against any ob- ject and drawing by the camera obscura that such piece will take in more of the view or object and from greater distance than the ca- mera obscura will however the portable ca- mera obscura will at first be very easy to the arm of beginner by reason the objects appear on an horizontal plane such as tabie and the hand hand having proper rest will more easily fol- low the line represented on the plane with- great exactness the camera obscura is machine or appara- tus vherein the images of external objectsare re- presented distinctly and in their genuine colours either in an inverted or erect situation this ma- chine may be made as follows darken cham- ber onc of whose windows look into place set with variety of objects leaving only one little aperture open in the window in this aperture fit lens either plane convex one or one convex on both sides so as to be the portion of à large sphere at due distance to be determined by experience spread paper or white cloth on the wall unless the wall itself be whitened so as to serve the purpose and on this the images of the desired objects will be delineated invertedly in this case it is not more difficult to draw or rather copy the objects though they are reverse than to draw or copy several things which we see upright on the frames of transparent paper lawn or tiffany for to trace lines will be as easily done one way as the other and though the objects falling on the paper or cloth will while you are drawing them be reversed it is- but turning the paper or cloth upside down when they are done and the drawing will be right to the eye but to obviate this difficulty let the paper or what is to receive the objects be placed against the back of chair and let person look on the several objects represented thereon over the back of the chair and this will set them right to the eye or if you would rather have the images appear erect it may be done either by means of concave lens or by receiving the image on plain speculum in- clined to the horizon under an angle or by means of two lenses included in draw-tube instead of one it is to be observed that if the aperture does not exceed the bigness of pea the objects will be represented thereon even though there be no lens at all to render the images clear and distinct it is necessary that the objects be il- luminated by the sun and they will be still brighter if the spectator sirst stay quarter of an hour in the dark care must be likewise taken that no light escape through any chinks and that the wall be not too much illumined farther the greater di- stance there is between the aperture and the wall the larger and more distinct will the images be the kays becoming thus too much dilated the brightness of the image is weakened till at length it becomes insensible but the portablé ca- mera obscura is more proper for beginners as be¬ ing more easy for their arm besides the ob- jects appearing on an horizontal plane may of course be drawn with greater exactness the construction of portable camera obscura may be as follows provide wooden chest in the middle of which raise little turret either round or square open toward the object behind this aperture incline little plain mirror to an an¬ gle of which will reflect the rays upon lens convex on both sides included in tube at the end of the focus of the lens place table covered with white paper to receive the image and lastly make an oblong aperture to- look through by means of this machine the images will be exhibited perfectly like their ob- jects each cloathed in their different colours whereby any person unacquainted with designing or drawing will be able to delineate any thing to the greatest degree of accuracy and justnefs and those even well versed in painting will find many hints by it to perfect them in this art thus far we have shewn how any person- may copy draught print or piece of painting or even make an exact representation from the life but we shall yet add two other methods both easy and entertaining not hitherto mention- ed for taking of draughts or drawings which are as follow prick with pin the qut-lines of the print or drawing you design to copy and then laying the sanie on sheet of paper take pow- der-puff or tuft of cotton dipping it now and then in charcoal-dust and beat it over the prick- ed lines through the picture by which means you shall have full directions marked on your cloth or paper sufficient to finish just drawing the other way is by making such an im- pression from the print as shall give ajust copy of it and it is of great use when we want to car- ry every stroke of the engraver along with us which method if you are very careful will in- deed but very little sully the print for this end take some white or green soap whien mix with such quantity of water as will bring it to the consistence of jelly with this mixture rub the print and with wet sponge gently wet the paper designed for receiving the impression then laying it on the print cover all with two or three other picces of dry paper and rub it very hard all over with any thing that is will have upon-it the reverse of the print you rubbed it upon with every distinct line in the original if you have been careful to rubitequally chap xiv secretss for copying of drawings continued als for takingoff medals various ways with several other curious precepts for the use of painters statuaries founders to take drawing with fixed ink take thin sheet of paper and rub it all over with fresh butter as equally as possiblé then dry it well by the fire and rub the buttered .de with either carmine lamp-black black-lead- powder or blue bice finely ground till it is all equally coloured taking care in rubbing on any of these that the colours will not come off by very slight touch of the finger then lay the co- loured side of this buttered paper upon piece of clean paper and lay the print you design to copy upon the buttered paper afterwards with fine pin or needle blunted little at the point trace the out-lines of the drawing carefully by on your white paper which may be touched afterwards with crayons or the like colour ii to take the impression of print with redink mix some vermilion finely ground with lin- seed-oil but not so much but what it shall still be liquid enough to run or slow in pen with this trace the lines of your print and then with sponge dipt in water wet the backside of the print and turn the printed side down upon piece of white paper so as to lie smooth then lay over part and the lower white paper will receive the imprefsion but if you have à linnen-press it is better to put your papers between two of the leaves and screw the prefs as tight as you can by which means you will have fine impression- iii to take draughts wvritings with red loose ink take some vermilion finely ground and mix it with fair water in gallipot with some cotton in it so as that it may run very free in the pen with this mixture draw over all the strokes of your print imitating both the siner and stronger lines then with sponge dipt in gum-watar wet piece of clean white paper and while it is wet turn the print upon it and pressing it well take off the print and you will sind all the strokes remain on the clean paper and as soon as it is dry the vermilion will be fixed to it this sort of ink has been used frequently in wiiting any thing designed to be engraved for by turning the writing side of the paper down upon copper-plate covered with bees-wax and wnite ground rubbing it very equally the im- pression will be upon the wax taking draughts with blue loose ink vou may likewise make such fort of ink wirh blue bice and common water as will run very fineiy in pen and serve for the same use as the former ink te take off drawing in standing red colour by tracing take vermilion finely ground and mixing it with little fresh butter rub clean sheet of paper on one side with this mixture so that it may bear à slight touch of the finger without leaving the paper then laying the coloured side of this paper upon clean sheet lay your print upon the other side of the coloured paper and then trace every line you think proper as al- ready directed in tracing draught with sixed ink but be sure to pin the thice papers toge- ther at the corners to prevent their stipping which would inevitably spoil your work this impression made by tracing will hold without rubbing or pressing the papers the quills of swallow after they are thoroughly dry are ve- ry good for tracing by mixing carmine with some freshi butter and colouring paper with it in the same man- ner you will obtain more beautiful colour and by colouring paper in like manner witn blue bice and butter you may have the drawing blue vi to take the natural or lively shape of any herb or tree first take the leaf you would copy and gent- ly rub the veins on the backside of it with piece of lvory or some such like matter so as to bruise them little afterwards wet the same side gently with linseed-oil and then press it hard upon piece of white paper and you shall have the perfect figure of the leaf with every vein in it justly expressed this imprefsion being afterwards coloured will seem truly natural and may be use- ful to such as would remember plants vii another way of painting the leaves of plants so that the impression shall appear as black as if it had been done in à printing-prefs is as follows when the leaf is dry take such ball as the pressmen use for blacking the types and rubbing it equally over with printer ’ ink strike it gently all the veins are blacked with the ink then laying the leaf on flat board or the like with he backside upwards clap piece of white pa- per well moistened on the leaf and pressing it pretty hard but not so as to bruise the fibres you shall have fine impression but this may still be done to greater advantage by means of piece of wood in the form of cylinder about foot long and an inch and half diameter the middle part about six or eight inches long being covered with woollen cloth rolled three or four times round it with this' times backwards and forwards and you will but where printer ’ ink is not conveniently come at the following method may be made ufe of rub the back of the leaf as before directed with burnt linseed-oil then strewing some powder of black lead or for want of that some charcoal or small-coal-dust or the powder of burnt cork upon fmooth board so as equally to cover it stroke the powder gently over and oiling the back-side of the leaf clap it upon the board and then laying the white paper upon the back of the leaf press or roll it as before if none of these ingredients are conveniently had take vermilion and mixing it with fresh butter to the consistence of printer ’ ink cover your printing ball with it dawb it over the back of the leaf and take your impreffion as before where vermilion is used bice may afso be made use of either with butteror oil by grinding blue bice with some burnt linseed-oil and use- ing it as before thus you may have fine red or blue ink proper for impressions of this sort but the blue is preferable in colouring leaves be¬ cause it is an agreeable colour for the green sort it may be observed that the reason why the back of the leaf is the proper side to make the impression from is because the ribs or vessels rise on that side above the fleshy part of it and therefore being coloured with any of those inks they are the fittest to give an impression where- as in the foreside of the leaf the fleshy parts rise and these fine fibres are sunk between them viii to take off the leaveso plants in plaister of paris so as that they may afterwards be cest in metal those persons who cast in metal have fre- quent occasion touse leaves of several sorts in order to embellisn their work these are gene- rally made from models done- by the hand which take up great deal of time and even at last are imperfect but the following way which is communicated by gentleman from itoly is greatly preferable and much easier soon after you have cropped the leaf you de- sire to take an impression from lay it between the leaves of abook till once it shall lie flat then upon smooth board with strong gum- water made of gum-arabic fix the foreside or front of the leaf to the broad when this is done raise round it little wall of coarse paste half an inch high or if you can conveniently surround your piece of wood with paste-board or card-paper so close as that it shall hold li- quid for some time then oil the back of your leaf as directed below in the method for casting of medals and pour on water and plaister of paris as is there directed which when it is dry will give you an exact impression of every- vein of the leaf and from which you may easily make mould to cast in as you fancy an expeditious method of taking the impression of any butterfly in all its colours having taken buttersly kill it without spoil- ing the wings which contrive to spread as regu- larly as possible in flying position then with small brush or pencil take piece of white pa- per wasn part of it with gum-water little thicker than ordinary so that it may easily dry afterwards laying your buttersly on the paper cut off the body close to the wings and throwing it away lay the paper on fmooth board with the fly upwards and laying another paper aver that put the whole preparation into screw-press and serew it down very hard or otherwise prefsit letting it remain under that pressure for the space of an hour afterwards take off the wings of the buttersly and you will find perfect impres- sion of them with all their various colours mnark ed distinctly remain upon the paper when this is done draw between the wings of your impres- sion the body of the butterfly and colour your draught of the body after the life to take off the impression of medrls this may be of use to such as would preserve to themselves good specimens or fine draughts of curious medals especially as it is easily exe- cuted and with but trifling expence one way is as follows take isinglafs and breaking it in pieces dissolve as much of it as is necessary over the fire in quantity of water sufficient only to cover it taking care to keep it stirring till the whole is dissolved this done with hair-brushi stroke some of the glue over the medals whose impression you would take after placing them as horizontally as you can and when you have covered them perfectly all over let them lie till the glue is hardened and afterwards with the point of pin or needle raise the edge of the glue from each medal and the whole impression of the medal in glue will sly off as hard as horn with all the fine sharp- ness of the medal as it was struck this glue may be made of whatever colour you please by mixing the colour in the water the glue is boiled in the impression must be dried immediately but very regularly and not in hot sun nor in any damp place if you use isinglass without any colour mixedt with the water you may as soon as you take the impressions srom the medals breathe gently on the concave side of them and then lay them upon the thickest sort of leaf gold which will stick to them and by fhining through the isin- glass will appear like gold medal but if we would imitate copper-medal we should mix carmine with the water that we dissolve ous isinglass in although water may do very well for dissolv- ing the isinglass in for this purpose yet brandy or spirits of wine will give the glue à much greater strength so as not to be subject to soften in damp air xi to take the impression of large medals first rub the medals gently over with tuft of sine cotton moistened or greased with sweet- oil then having some melted brimstone enough to cover the medal half an inch thick put hoop of card-paper round the edge of it and pour the melted brimstone on it but not too hot as soon as it is fixed and hardened take off the hoop of paper and the impression on the brimstone will come clean from the medal which shall serve for sharp and correct mould wherein you may cast another with plaister of paris but brim- stone should not be used on silver-medals be- cause it will effectually change their colour therefore to take silver-medals off bind them round after oiling them with hoop of some stiff paper as before and mixing alittle plaister of paris with water sill the hoop with it then immediately sill the case in sprinkling manner with the same plaister till it hardens and when it turns dry take it off from the medals but from those moulds cast in brimstone that are concave you must igain cast such medals in plaister of pa- ris and they will be convex oiling the mould and using the plaister of paris as beforé by this method you may take off any medal or sine bass- relief with great exactnefs even so as to form medals from them in any fort of metal xii another way of taking off mrdalsis as follows procure some thin pieces of lead and placing the medal horizontally on the top of firm post or any steady place lay piece of harder metal flat over the lead and place piece of round turned stick over that such as is used in the staff of house-brushi saw off about five or six inches in length and holding that tight with the left hand on the lead and flat piece of metal strike the top of the stick smart blow with large hammer and it will give the lead perfect impression of the image of the medal but this must be done by one single blow to render the impression perfect xiii various ways of taking off medrls take the shavings of paper and boiling them till they are tender pound.them well in mortar so as to reduce them into paste then boil them again in spring-water with little gum-arabic let this mixture stand-some time to settle then pour off the water straining it through sieve or linnen-cloth and the remaining part of this mixture will be an excellent ingredient either to press into any mould or upon any medal for when the paste is dry it will come off very sharp some medals that are under-wrought can not be taken off this way therefore in such cases you should take common glue and melting it six hoop of paste-board round the edge of the medal and pour on the glue hot the medal having been first oiled with tuft of greased cotton when the glue is dry and hard take off the hoop and the glue will sly off from the edges and it will as being subject to bend and give way which the things formerly mentioned are not come very easily off but the glue ought to be made strong and should be poured on one third part of an inch thick when an impression has been taken by this means you must then hoop your mould of glue with either card-paper or pasteboard as before directed taking care to oil it so that no bubblés or blisters may be seen then you may cast your plaister of paris in it and you will obtain by these means good copy of the medal when this is dry the glue will sly off or may be broken off and there will remain good pattern to cast from also putty may be made of linseed-oil and fine-ground starch which being well worked together into paste will take good imprefsion from any medal by means of these moulds you may cast good medals of bees-wax but they will come off-much sharper if the mould be in brimstone than if it be in plaister of paris but then your wax should be as well blanched or whitened as if it was used for wax-candles how- ever it will be necessary to grease the mould be- fore the wax is poured in and though white wax is here recommended yet it will not be best thatthe copy of the medal be white because the darker colours shew the medal much better if you would have your copy of red colour mix vermilion with the wax while it is melting and if you would have it blue put in stone-blue well beaten or ground into the melted wax as soon as these wax-medals are cold enough to take off you should lay some leaf-gold upon them pressing it down gently with piece of cotton without rubbing it backwards and forwards and that will gold vour medal when you cast medals in plaister of paris to make them look like steel or metal rub them over with tuft of cotton lightly greased with oil then strewing over them some powder of black lead rub them well with such brushi as is used for the teeth till the whole is equally covered and this will give them fine metal-gloss you may make these me- dals in plaister of paris look like box by boiling them in linseed oil and this will harden them to such degree as to bear the brush to clean them when they turn foul or dirty if you would have these medals look of yellow colour boil little pearl ashies in pint of water till it makes strong lixivium then put in half quarter of pint of french-berries boil this till the liquor is of strong yellow and use it with your plaister of paris instead of common water if you would have the medals look green the fine transparent gum of verdegrease mixed with the plaister of paris will give them that colour and for à silver-colour leaf-silver or tin-foil may be used in the same manner as the leaf- gold for the gold-colour for the copper-colour german leaf-copper may be used xiv to take off impressions in plaister of paris from copper-plates oil the plates à little and binding them about either with card or other paste-board paper pour on them some of the finest plaister of paris and water and finishing the work with plaister till it becomes dry and hardens you will have fine imprefsion or draught of the lines on the plate in the plaister which you may make use of to draw from as you may have occasion xv to take off the fine engravings from watch-cases snuff-boxes hold them over the smoke of candle till they are quite black then wiping off the black with the soft part of the palm of your hand lay piece of white paper little wetted with sponge over the engravings and over that clap thin piece of flannel or brown paper pressed down very hard which being rubbed the paper next the picture will obtain as fine an impression as if it had passed through rolling-press the doctrine of water-colours for illuminatins in the best manner chap of colours in general olours are to bedistinguissied as follows cthe first is the white colour next the yellow next the orange then the red after that the purple afterwards the blue and lastly the black it is to be observed that white and black are the extremes of colour yellow is the lesser point of colour towards the white the next to that is the green and after it the blue with regard to the colouring of prints if the paper be pure white you are to use no colour on it unless in the shaded parts and then in painting of flowers if they tend towards reddisn colour you are to use faint colour of carmine with gum¬ water upon the shades only if bluish use littie faint indigo in gum-water slightly passed over the shades easily touching upon the lights where there is- yellow tinge either use faint tinc- ture of gamboge or of french-berries which will be described among the yelliows or if the whites have purplish cast use thin cake on the shady side suffering the colour only to shine little into the light which will give lustre to the whites and if greenisn cast should be there use very faint colour of the sap-green or in proportion of the sap-green mixed with the verdigrease-green all these colours mentioned for shading the whites may be found in the following directions chap ii whites for painting in miniature he best white sold for painting in water-colours is flake-white this is better than white lead ground and if it be pure far exceeds it in beauty because the white lead is aptto turn blackish especially if it be used in hard water but some recommend white made of pearl and oyster-shells reduced intoan impalpable pow¬ der so foft as to feel like grounds of starch or hair-powder this is by some called pearl-white and will mix well with any colour but if you use white lead first rectify it with white-wine vinegar which causing fermentation the white will soon settle after which pour off the vinegar and wasn the white with common water the method of washing it is thus put the powder into glass of water stir it about and presently pour off the water whileit is white into some other clean glass or vessel then letting it settle pour off the water from it and you shall have an excellent white to which when it is settled you are to put as much gum- water as is necessary to give it glaze it is observable that white lead will turn black if mixed with water that comes from iron or clay that is in the space of month or two you may perceive those places where it lies thick- est tinged with black and if it be mixed with any other colour it will soon change or alter it some recommend the powder of egg-shells of the brightest colour and well cleaned andi washed as very good to be ground with gum- water or you may put twentieth part of clean white sugar candied to grind with it in water it must be ground as fine as possible that is to the state of an impalpable powder and then use it some say it is better if rectifyed spirit of wine be poured on it which will clear it from any dross that may be in it this it is probable must be poured off when the spirit of wine has done its work and then the parts left behind must be mixed with gum-water again but it has been found by experience that egg- shell powder is of very great service as white in water-colours and that itself and the oyster- shell powders well rectified and mixed with the white of an egg well beaten will make an ex- traordinary mixture in other colours and will cor- rect them from changingor altering their qualities as to white for illuminating of prints the clear white of the paper is to be left uncoloured and if it happens that the paper is apt to sink or to spread any water-colour that is laid upon it more than is necessary then the way to correctit is as follows fix thepaper in such station as that it may only receive the colour you lay on to glaze just as far as you designed it then take some starch boiled and prepared in water of middle strength and with large painting-brush stroke it over the black of the print and after it has been well dried in the air or sun put the print in book with weight upon it to take out the crumplings which it may receive by wetting of it and thus will any print be rendered fit to receive water-colours which will be prevented from running further than one would have them fine white for water-colours is made by dissolving filings of sine silver or silver-leaf in aqua fortis then evaporating the aqua-fortis till it looks like chrystals in the bottom of the glass decant the other part of the aqua-fortis and wash the silver five or six times in common water till it is freed from the aqua-fortis which may be known by tasting it then dry it for use it must be used with gum-water and little water of sugar-candy an incomparable fine white lead-colour is made by grinding choice white lead well upon porphyry with vinegar so that it turns blackish then take pot full of water and wafhiing the white lead in it very well let it settle and pour- ing off the water grind it again with vinegar repeat this once or twice more and you will have an excellent white both for water-colours and painting in oil te make good white for the ground for water or oil colours proper in miniature take pound of glover ’ clippings put them some time to steep in water then boiling them in kettle with twelve quarts of water till it sinks to two strain it through linnen cloth into new earthen pan this is called glove-glue or size and to know whether it be strong enough it is only necessary to tzy when it is cold and has got its consistence whether it be stiff and firm under the hand the glue being made take white chalk and reducing it to powder and melting the glue while it is hot put such quantity of white init as to make it so thick as pap then leaving it to steep for quarter of an hour stiritabout with bristle-brush then taking some of this white put more glue to it in order to make it brighter for the first or second lay this must be applied by beating with the end of the brush mind that you let every lay dry well before you put on another if it is wood you work on you must put on dozen but if it is thick paper six or seven are sufficient this done take water and dipping soft brush in it and draining it with your fingers rub the work with it in order to render it the smoother when your brush is full of white you must wash it again and also change the water when it is too white you may likewise sometimes make use of wet linnen-rag instead of brusni your work being very even let it dry and when it is so rub it with shave-grafs or à bit of new linnen-cloth to make it soft and free chap iii of yellow here are some objects which have the appearance of gold shining through the colours of green red or blue such as some fort of flies and beetles and the cantharides this golden transparency is very well imitated by lay- ing sonie gold-leaf on the shaded part of the drawing giving in little to the light side of the print the way of laying on the gold-leaf is by washing the part where the gold is to be with dry by laying on the gold as smooth and even as pofsible pressing it down close with cotton but in doing this care must be taken that in laying on the gum-water you do not exceed the limits you would have the gold appear to shine in this case the gold is toshineonly through the transpa¬ rent colour which is to be laid on it must be observed that the gold-leaf will not receive water-colours regularly and for that reason it must be stroked over with little thin liquor of ox-gall in painting brush of camel ’ hair by which means it will receive any colour that you have mind to paint upon it and will hold it the greens may be first the verdegrease- green or sap-green which colours should be de¬ scribed in their places the reds may be lake or carmine the purples lake and fine indigo or carmine and indigo and for the blues indigo on the dark side and on the light little stroke of uitramarine-blue just to shine into the light which will have an admirable effect there may be found upon rose-trees in june and juiy kind of beetle of gold and green colour which may serve for direction in this kind of painting but if gold itself be used it will be best to polish it which may be done in the following manner there may be seen in some manuscripts fine golden letters which rise above the surface of the vellum or paper the composition that raises them thus is said to be made up of vermilion and the white of an egg whisked or beaten up to the consistence of an oil and worked together like kind of paste and with stamp fixed to the vellum or paper with gum-arabic on this fi- gure of letter wash some strong gum-water with pencil of camel ’ hair observing that the gum does not reach more than the outlines then lay on the gold leaf close with some cotton and being dried rub it with some dry cotton and then polish it with dog ’ -tooth this will make it appear as if it was really cast in gold there is besides this another way of working in gold and that is performed by shell-gold but then it must be pure gold and not that brought from germany which turns green in few days time time before you use this gold cover the fhrady parts with vermilion and after your gold has been well rectified with spirit of wine lay it on with gum-water which will readily mix with it and when it is dry polisn it with dog ’ tooth in laying on gold it will be best to leave the lights without it because it will make much brighterappearance than if the object was cover- ed all over with it but if by accident or other- wise the whole piece happened to be covered with gold there is no better way to set it off than by tracing over the shady parts with gall- stone or what is much preferable the yellow made of french-berries the composition of which is treated of below- but it is the deepest that is to be used in thisway little minium heightens it very much how the minium is to be rectified may be learned among the reds observe to polisn the gold before you use the minium on it after this colour of the gold the vellows shall be treated of as they fail gradually in their strength the first yellow is kind of straw-colour and is made of flour of brimstone which of itself is fine enough to mix with gum-water commonway of illuminating prints is by giving the tincture of gamboge for yellow and this may be of two or three forts either fainter or stronger the last to be shade to the first and to be shaded with the preparation of french-berries mr. boyle says that if the roots of barber- ries are cut and put into à lixivium made strong with with water and pearl-asnes there will be fine tried succeeded very well he likewise proposes anotherway for making transparent yellow which is by boiling the root of mulberry-tree washed well from the earth in strong lixivium of pearl-ashes and water this will afford yellowisn juice from which may be ex- tracted tincture much deeper than the former yellow oker will likewise make another good pale yellow but it is colour rather of too much body for illuminating of prints yet after it has been well washed the plant celandine will afford another good yellow by infusingit in water and pressing it gent- ly and then boiling theliquor with little alum this yellow will ineline somewhat to green but yellow which some prefer to the rest and may be used in several capacities of lights is one made of frenèh-berries and prepared as fol- lows boil two ounces of french-berries in quart of lixivum made of pearl-ashies and water till the liquor gives fine tinge of yellow to bit of paper dipped in it and then pour it off fromthe berries let the liquor cool and bottle it up for use then again put pint of the same lixivium to the berries and boil them till the liquor is as deep-coloured as gall-stone and this will be fit for the shade of any fort of yellows you can use this may be boiled tifl it produces brown co- lour and will with little ox-gall serve to shade any leaf-gold that is laid on paper and is much preferable to gall-stone in imitating any gold-colour and it answers well upon tinc- ture of gamboge or any of the former yellows next to this may be reckoned the tincture of saffron in common water only which affords bright reddish yellow such as would be re- quired for an orange-colour in covering the shadowed parts of print and when saffron is infused in rectified spirits of wine there is no- thing higher but then it will sly unless it be loaded with gum-arabic as for deep yellow with body dutch pink comes the nearest of any to the forementioned strong yellow made of french-berries in point of colour but the english pink which is still made of french-berries is of lighter yellow also good yellow colour for illuminat- ing prints may be extracted from the roots of ginger and with transparent verdegrease it makes fine green it is to be observed that the englisn and dutch yellow pinks are made with french-berries ground to sine powder and boiled chap iv of orange-colour an orange-colour for washiing prints is made by laying on teint of gamboge and over that some minium or red lead washed and ren- dered sine and fit for use it not being fine enough to paint with as it is bought at the shops and besides it will change or turn black in few weeks if it be not refined but being well pre- pared it will be very lasting and beautiful but this you must take notice of that an ounce will not produce above twenty grains of good colour to stand the test of painters this colour may be mixed with gamboge upon white dutch tile to render it of the teint you would have it either softer or stronger or else the gamboge may be glazed over and strengthened with the tincture of saffron which will make it glare into strong orange chap of minium the brightest red lead the manner of preparing it ahe minium or red lead is as heavy and strong colour as most we have and prepared is the most beautiful one when it is well washied and cleansed of its more weighty parts which cause it to turn black mr. boyle directs the preparing or cleansing it in the following manner put four ounces of it in quart of rain-water then stirring it pour off the water immediately and let it settle to the bottom of every cup or glass you pour it into then pouring off that water in day ’ time you will have the colour dry and as fine as can be desired afterwards put little gum-arabic into each glass or cup and as much water as will moisten each of them any of these may be afterwards used with gum- water but if the gum you put in itat first make it strong enough to glaze it then you need only add to it common water and according as your colour is less or more gummed use less or more gum-water for it is of itself dead colour when you use this colour touch it gently on the yellow above-mentioned that is made of the ycllow berries into the light side and if it wants shade you may put à little vermilion upon it but vermilion is too heavy to paint with when you would illuminate your prints because it hides the shades of the engraving though sometimes they had better be hidden than appear some generally shade this minium with carmine which gives it sine effect and renders it equal to the brightest red flower that is to be seen leaving still the lights uncoloured only dafhing little way into the lights with the minium when the carmine has shaded the minium it may be shaded again with lake in the strongest part to bring it to deeper-red chap vi of other reds scarlet-red scarlet may be represented on plane with minium little mixed with vermilion but if you have occasion to paint flower of scarlet- colour on print let your lights as well as shades be covered thin with minium and the shaded parts glazed with carmine which will produce an admirable scarlet such as is seen in the flower scarlet martagon crimson-red crimson-colour is represented with carmine but it is necessary that the buyer be informed that there are several sorts of it some darker and some much coarser than others therefore it should never be bought by candle-light unless of such as person can confide in for between the best and the worst there is ten shillings an ounce difference nay indeed all the money that an ounce will cost because bad carmine will but spoil the work next after crimson comes lake which is of use in shading and heightening carmine but it must be observed that in laying of carmine upon print you must touch yourlights only with such thinteint of it as can scarcely be observed laying it on strong just on that part of the light which enters upon the shade and afterwards laying some lake on the stronger part of the shade lake is to be had in most colour-shops ready pregared in shells for water-colours to make fine lake take half pound of good brazil and boiling it in three pints of ley made with the asnes of vine-twigs till half the ley be evaporated let it settle and then strain it which done boil it again with fresh brasil quarter of pound cochineal two ounces and terra marita half an ounce adding pint of fair water let this boil till it be half evaporated as before then set it by to settle and strain it but when you take it off the fire remember to put in an half ounce of calcined alum reduced to an impalpable powder and dissolve it by stirring it about with stick adding quarter in order to give it body reduce two cuttle- fisn bones to very sine powder and putting in the powder let it dry up at leisure then grind it with good quantity of fair water in which leave it to steep and afterwards strain it through cloth and making it up into fewtablets or cakes set it to dry on card or paste-board if you would have this lake redder add lemon-juice and if you would make it deeper add oil of tartar another lake may be made as follows boil shavings or shearings of scarlet in ley of the ashies of burnt tartar this ley having the pro- perty of separating the dye from the scarlet shreds when it has boiled enough take it off and putting in cochineal powdered mastic and roch-alum boil the whole again and while it is quite hot strain it two orthree times through fine bag thefirst time the bag must be squeez- ed with two sticks from the top to the bottom then the gross matter remaining being taken out of the bag wash it well after this pafs the li- quor you expressed with the sticks through the bag again and you will find paste sticking to the sides of the bag which you may either spread upon paste-board or divide into small parcels upon paper and set it aside to dry to make lake-columbine steep half pound of the finest brazil-wood of fernambuca rasped in three pints of the finest distilled vinegar for at least month the longer the better after which seethe the whole in balneo mariae till it boils up three of four times letting it settlé for day or two after this prepare fourth part of pow- dered alum and putting it in clean earthen pan strain the liquor upon the alum and so let it remain for day afterwards heat the whole again till the liquor simmers and let it settle twenty-four hours then reduce two cuttle-fish- bones intopowder and having warmed the liquor pour it in upon them and stir it about with stick till it be cold and leave it again for twenty-four hours before you strain it kemember that it must be first strained upon the alum before it is pourod upon the cuttle-fish-bone but à liquid colour not much inferior to carmine itself may be made of the raspings of brasil-wood this colour is the transparent crim- son and is made as follows boil an ounce of the raspings of brasil-wood sold at the dry-salter ’ and at some colour-shops in twelve qunces of pale stale beer and little alum till the colour of the liquor is as strong as you please which may be discovered by dipping slip of white paper into it when this colour is as you would have it pass it when cooled into linnen-cloth and bottle it up for use and if you would bring this colour to à body take ox-blood and dry it till it can be reduced to powder which being done mix it with the liquor and it will communicate colour to it little inferior to middling carmine some say -that the blood of an ox or cow dried will make good body for any colour crimsan colour from mr. boyle take the fruit of the berry bearing spinach which being pressed will yield beautiful red-co- loured juice boil this adding fourth part of alum to it then letting it cool put it up for use the red beet-root baked with little strong vinegar produces an elegant red-coleur equal toa tincture of carmine then pour it on alum and it is fit for use where carmine should be used in washing prints for it is à fine transparent red another grimson colour for wasning prints is prépared as follous put thirty or forty grains of bruised cochineal into gallipot with as many dreps of tartar-ley as will just wet it and make it give forth its co- lour then immediately adding to this .xture half spoonful of water or more if the colour be¬ still toa-dzep vou will have delicate purple- liquor or tincture then taking bit of alum scrape very finely with knise small quantity of it into the tincture and this will take away the puiple colaur and make it delicate tinc -- ture strain it through fine cloth into clean gallipot and use it as soon as you can because- this is à colcur that will always look exquisitely sine if it is -con made use of but will decay if it stands lolg indian red next to these is the indian red which though it is colour of body yet is useful for back ground for flowers at distance when used with gum-water there is also an earth brought from the isle of wight which has been found to mix ex- tremely well with gum-water though being of viscous nature it requires less gum than most other colours and as it is naturally fit for use without grinding and is viscous so it will no doubt mix with oil as well as with water there is one thing very extraordinary in this earth which is that if you rub deal-board with it it will make the board exactly of tha colour of mahogany- wood and stain it so deep and with so much strength that it is hard to get it out with washing chap vii.. of purple fine transparent purple may be made either redder or nearer the blue as you would have it by boiling four ounces of rasped brazil- wood in pint of stale beer with half an ounce of logwood or campeachy-wood till the liquor is heightened to the colour you desire which may- be known by dipping piece of paper in it ifyou find it too red add an ounce of logwood to the brafil-wood which will make it much near- method you may humour it to any degree of purple by putting in either more or less log- wood to the fornier composition and fixing the colour with alum this will produce such clear purple as no mix- ture of solid reds and blues will do and the re- ceipt has been for long time kept secret it is said that the best purple colour that can be made may be composed between the carmine and in- digo to strengthen which on the red side you may add lake between the lighter and darker part and so lake when it is used in the same way on the foregoing purple or the liquid criinson produces very fine effect the colour may be varied and made either redder by putting more carmine or bluer by using more indigo which being mixed on white dutch tile will shew itself fine purple-colour may be made of the grofs part or sediment of lake-columbine both for oil and water-colours as follows take the sediment of lake-columbine which falls to the bottom of the vial in which is the bone of the cutile-fisn let it dry and grind it there will be no lake so fine as this and if you mix it with lake it will give it berter body besides more srength and vigour chap viii of blue he uitramarine-blue is not only the first but the best sort of bright blue we have as it gives spirit to all paintings where blues are used this colour is made from the lapis lazuli divested of its gold and ground into an impalpa¬ ble powder which is done as follows take half pound of lapis lazuli and putting it upon red- hot coals let it stay there until it is red-hot then quenchingit in very strong vinegar and grinding it upon porpliry or any such hard stone with rectified brandy to an impalpable powder make apastil with which the lapis is to be incorporated for the making of this pastil take bees-wax tur- pentine rosin andlinseed-oil of each quarter of apound and melting the whole together over slow fire when it begins toboil pour it into glazed pot this is the paste of ultramarine take of this paste quantity equal to that of the lapis kncad them together upon the marble and being well incorporated tthem remain for one night after which to bring out the uitramarine that is in the paste pour clean water upon it and knead it with your hands as paste is kneaded and the ul- tramarine will come out for the receiving ofwhich place porringer or other proper vessel under your hands and let it settle in this water till you sce the uitramarine at the bottom of it ifyout colour seems to be clammy or nasty you may correct it thus add theretotartar disselved in water as much as will drown it and let it rest for one day at least then wasn it in warm water and you will by that means have it correct and well purified ultramarine must be chosen of high colour and well ground which may be known by putting lt between the teeth for if it feels gritty it is sign that it has not been well ground to know whether it be pure and unmixed pat little of it into crucible and heating it red- hot if the powder docs not change its colour after trial it is certaisly pure but on the contrary if there be any change or black specks in it then it has been adulterated the prussian blue is next to ultramarine in eeapty if it be used in oil though it is not agreed on whether it will hold so well as the other par- ticularly as not having the body of the ultramarine- the prussian blue does not grind well in water because there is such an oily quality in it that it does not mix kindly with water and at the best will change as it is now prepared in the common way attempts have been made to make it blue ink which indeed has held the colour for month or two but then turned to muddy yellow and when you put your pencil with gum-water into shell of this blue you will find that where the water spreads the blue will turn yellowish till the bedy of the colour is well stirred up and after all that can be done with this colour in wa- ter it will only serve to shade ultramarine with but in oil it may serve very well for the present to supply the place of ultramarine blue-bice is colour of good brightnefs and is the next to the prussian blue it is also colour of good body and will flow pretty well in the pencil especially if it be well washed as is directed to be done of the whites and minium saunders-blue is also of very good use and may serve as shade to ultramarine or the biue- bice where the shades are not required to be very deep and is of itself pleasant blue to be laid- between the lights and shades of such flower as is of mazarine-blue the lacmus or litmus-blue is another beautiful colour and will run in pen as free as ink being made of lacmus or as some term it litmus which is sold at miost druggists-shops but as this colour is never to be met with pre- pared for water-colours we therefore shall give the foliowing method of preparing it according to mrs. mariana take an ounce of lacmus and boil it in about pint of small beer-wort till the colour is as strong as you would have it then pour off the liquor into gallipot and let it cool for use it will soon become jelly and by degrees will grow hard but this colour is to be opened again and made liquid by water so as to be us- in ink anà will be either paler or darker as it is made tnicker or tiinner this affords bright oir and hes extraord inary effects for it is not onlya pearitral but holding colour this colour if it be touched with aqua-fortis immediately changes into fine crimson little inferior to carmine and sinks quite through the paper so as not to be got out so that when it is used às blue it is best to keep it from aqua-fortis or such strong acids it is good shade for ultramarine or blue-bice where the strongest shades should not be ex- tremely deep and for colouring of prints it is very good as it is transparent colour and goes great way indigo- blue makes the strongest shade for blues of any other and is soft warm colour when it has been well ground and washied with gum-water by means of stone and muller it is made of what lightness you please by putting more gum-water to it and by how much the less gum-water is put to it the darker it will be to try it upon dutch tile for it runs warmly in the pencil and so perhaps may otherwise prove too strong for your design which is al- ways to be taken care of when slowing co- lour is to be laid over the dark shade of print which shade will much heighten its black ness and even make it appear quite black sine blue from mr. boyle take of the blue leaves of rue and beating them little in stone-mortar with wooden pes- tle infuse them in water juice and all for four- teen days or more washing them every day till they are rotten and at last beat them and the water together till they become pulp and let them dry in the sun this will produce as good bluc as indigo and be much softer but in order to keep it à long time when you beat it the last time add little powder of gum-arabic to it of which you may put more or less as you would have it more free or tenacious in the working this is an excellent blue for shading has good body and ruiis warm in the pencil transparent blue from mr. boyle equal to ultramarine this is beautiful blue the chief ingredientof which is the cyanus or blue cornbottle-flower this flower has two blues in it onc of pale colour in the larger outward leaves the other of deeper colour in the inner leaves or mid- die of the flower both these will do being separated from the buttons and cases they grow in but the deep blue leaves in the middle pro- duce by much the best colour this may be ob- served by rubbing the leaves while they are fresn so hard upon picce of good writing paper as to press out the juice which will yield an excel- lent colour that will not fade for several years tniis part of the flower is 'erefore the principal and what may be depended on and should be picked from the rest of the flower-leaves the same day it was gathered or as soon afterwards as possibly can be good quantity of thcse middle-leaves being procured press out what juice you can from them and adding little alum to it you will have lasting transparent blue of as bright stand- ing colour as can be desired scarce inferior in beauty to uitramarine and very durable as for the outward flower-leaves which are much paler it is not certain that they will answer the end but some trials may be made whereby that may be known also let the flowers be gathered about the beginning of june or in july or august but the preparation of the colour by picking out the middle deep blue flower-leaves and pressing out the juice must be done with all the expedition possible or else they will lose their perfection it is probable that if the leaves of these blue cornbottle-flowers were cured in the same man- ner as saffron is they would produce much greater body of colour from-which tincture mnight be drawn with more ease than if pressed raw or fresn from the field in order to do this such kiln must be prepar- ed as is used for curing of saffron in which may be made small charcoal-fire that may communi¬ cate heat to the top of the kiln which is to be covered with hair-cloth upon this should be laid four or five sheets of white paper such as is used in curing of affron afterwards parcel of the picked flowers are to be laid on to the thick- niess of two or three inches laying them close and slat with knife and sprinkling them with some gum-water then the cake of flowers is to be covered with two or three sheets of paper and board with fmall weight laid on for few mi- nutes after which the board is to be taken off and the cake of flowers to be turned on the kiln taking hold of all the papers with both hands and when it has been rightly placed take off the upper papers and sprinkle the cake second time with some gum-water then settling the cake again with knife let the papers be laid on as before with the board and weight for minute or two after which let the papers be turned again and again till the cake of flowers becomes united and of the thickness of cake of saffron in this operation you will find the flowers grow darker and darker every time they are turn- ed till at length the cake will look of deep blue tending to black from whence tincture may be easily drawn during this operation great care should be taken that the fire does not scorch the flowers but that it be as constant and gentle as possible which will be sure way to bring the cake to good colour but it will not be improper for any person who shall undertake the curing of this colour to consult the methods of curing saffron of which they may be informed either in treatise of the method of curing saffron written by mr. dowglas or in another by mr. bradley in his monthly trcatise of husbandry and gardening chap ix of black the proper black for water-colours is ivory-black which if pure and well ground is of use in painting in miniature but it is not proper for colouring prints being too heavy colour and hiding the beautiful strokes of the graver unless done with great care however if it be necessary to use black for darkening aprint rather choose strong tincture of good india ink than the lvory-black but to colour pieces in mi- niature use the lvory-black prepared as follows grind the lvory-black well in gum-water till youperceive kind of oilyliquor settle to the bot- tom this liquor mix with as much of the lvorys black as you think will be proper to make it flow freely in the pencil and it will bear an extraor- dinary gloss and if the object is 'thining such as the wings of some beetles mix with some of it à little white upon dutch glazed tile till you find it light enough to receive the shade and- then make another lighter mixture of the same which being used on the brighter part of the subject will produce the effect you desire chap of greens greens are allowed by all to depend upon the yellow and blue and any green co- lour whatever you please may be made with them gamboge is one of the first yellows which may be made to produce five or six greens with verdegrease according as the gamboge is in the greater or lesser proportion if it abounds it will make tolerable oak-green and being mixed with greater quantity of verdegrease it will make fine grass-green but the yellow which some prefer before all others is made of french-berries as already described under the yellows which is either deeper or fainter as the liquor they are boiled in is more or less stained with them if it be very thin it makes good glaze all over the verde- grease and as it approaches nearer to dutch-pink or gall-stone commands almost any colour we want being agreeably mixed with the transpa¬ rent verdegrease and is still transparent in like manner yellow drawn from the roots of barberries and also that droyn from the roots of the mulberry-tree will in agreat measure produce the like effect being mixed with the transparent verdegrease as for the verdegrease itself it produces fine bluisn green flows easy in the pencil and may even serve as an ink to write with the way of preparing the transparent ver- degrease is as follows take six ounces of com¬ mon verdegrease the distilled verdegrease not answering this purpose so well break it into little pieces and boil it gently in quart of white- wine-vinegar keeping it continually stirring and when you perceive it to boil add little tartar broken and continuing still to stir it till youfind the liquor of such colour as you would have it that is till it is of fine transparent green with bluishi cast which you may know by dip- ping in bit of white paper then pour it through linnen-cloth into an open vessel and set it to cool and when it is quite cold bottle it up for use remember to cork the bottle close for being exposed to the air it will dry however it may be reduced again by common water this liquor should be touched upon part of the lights and shades of print and the shades afterwards coloured with sap-green in the making of this green remember that it be strong enough because it can not be strength- ned afterwards without the trouble of boiling it afresh but may at any time be rendered as faint as you please by mixing common water with it sap-green is colour like that of an oak- leaf if.it be used thin with common water for this as well as the formerwants no gum but if it be used strong it will produce as dark green as any it will be proper to try the colour first upon awhite dutch tile andby thinningit with water vou may render it of what strength you please and may brighten it very much by the addition of very little verdegrease there are twoways of making sap-green viz first take the flowers of blue flag-iris or flower de luce and press them while there is any juice to be got from them boil this gently in glazed pipkin till it grows thick adding à little alum to it and it will make very useful and lasting green you must observe this that in the boiling of any juice of the colours before mentioned you should always do it in an earthen pipkin for if it be boiled in vessels of metal they will often- times change it from the colour intended the second way to make sap-green for the washing and illuminating of prints is to take the juice of buckthorn-berries and though that juice simply will yield only dark purple of very bafe hue yet either of these colours will mix with the liquid verdegrease above-mentioned and will make delicate shade for it there is besides these another green which is admired by some persons that carries good body with it and degree of transparency too as it may be made but as it is commonly used is à colour of full body and fit only for painting in miniature this is made by mixing dutch pink with indigo to what degree of colour you please but the high preparation of french-berries with indigo is much to be preferred to dutch pink especially as this answers all the intentions of dutch pink and carries transparency with it which the dutch pink has not chap xi the use and nature of dry colours blue-bice is the most excellent blue next to ultramarine which is too good to wasn withal wherefore we leave it out here because blue-bice may do very well instead of it and in- deed both may be left out since smalt may be used instead of them however itwill not work so well as blue-bice which without doubt is too good to use upon all occasions only when you intend to bestow some cost and pains upon your work otherwise you may use no other blue in your piece than blue-verditer with which you may make very good shift without any other blue that is in any ordinary work indigo is dark blue that is used principally to shade with upon other blues indigo and yellow berries mixed together make dark green to shade other greens in the darkest places blue-verditer is very bright pleasant blue and the easiest to work in water it is somewhat inelining to green and being mixed with yellow berries it makes very good green this is the blue most used verdegrease is good green but subject to decay when it is dry upon the paper it will be of lighter colour than it was when first laid on therefore to preserve it from that fault put some sap-green among it to dissolve in it which will make it keep its colour there is distilied verdegrease to be bought at the shops that is far better green than the other but it is some- what dearer and the other may serve instead of it verditer-green is light colour seldom used in any thing but in colouring landfkips and those places that should appear afar off and it is good for fuch purpose because it is somewhat inclining to blue but you may make shift to do any thing well enough without it for little blue-verditer mixed with copper-green and little white make just such another green sap-green is dark dirty green and never used but to shadow other greens in the darkest places or else to lay upon some dark ground behind picture which requires to be coloured with dark green but you may do without this green for indigo and yellow berries make just such another colour copper-green is an excellent transparent green of fhining nature if it is thickened in the sun or upon gentle fire and it is the most used of any green in washing especially in colouring of the grass ground or trees for it is almost grass-green vermilion is the most perfect scarlet-colour you need not either grind or wasn it being fine enough itself only temper it with your finger in gallipot or oyster-shell with gum-water and it will be ready to use if you put à little yellow berries among it it will make the brighter colour this is principally used for garments lake is an excellent crimson-colour with which may shade vermilion or your yellow garmente in the darkest places and being mix- ed with white vou may make sky-colour with it or flesn colour by mixing white and little red lead withit andit is an excellent colour of itself for colouring garments or the like indian lake is the best lake but it is too good to be used in wasniing prints with unless you in- tend to bestow great curiosity upon your werk for the best sort of ordinary lake will serve well enongh for ordinary uses and this also will be somcwhat too costly tnerefore instead thereof you may use red ink thickened upon the fire which may serve your purpose very well better even than lake unless it is very good observe that if you would make light sky- colour of your red ink or if you would mix it among you flesh-colour you must not thicken it but shade your vermilion rather with spanisn- brown than thick red ink as it may serve very well for that purpose but is not altogether such bright and clear colour red-lead is the fiearest to an orange-co- lour and putiing à little yellow berries into fame of it will make perfect orange-colour but if you desire to make flesh-colour of it you must put no yellow in it this colour is used in colouring buildings or highways in landfxips after being mixed with little white besides this is the only bright colour to shade yellow garments with in order to make them look like changeable taffaty it is good also to colour any light ground in picture taking only the thin water of it and so for several other uses as you shall see occasion ii yellow berries are most used in wasning of all other colours they are bright and transpa¬ rent fit for all uses and will be sufficient without the use of any other yellow saffron is deep yellow if you let it stand good while it is of use principally to fhade yellow berries with instead of red lead and it is somewhat of brighter shadow but you may make shift well enotgh without this colour for red lead and yellow berries make just such another colour masticote is light yellow just like yellow berries and white and therefore you may do well enough without it only for saving you the labour to mix your yellow berries with white when you have occasion for light yellow then you may make use of it to colour light ground in picture in which case snadowit with the water of burnt umber or red lead that is the thinnest part of the colour ceruse is the best white if it be good and finely ground or for want of it white lead picked either of these will serve well enough for either of them being mingled with another co- lour will make it lighter and the more so in-pro- portion to the quantity of either mixed with it spanisn-brown is dirty brown colour and of no great use to colour any garment with unless it be an old man ’ gown or to shade vermilion or lay upon any dark ground behind picture or else to shade yellow berries in the- darkest places when you want lake or thin red ink it is the best and brightest colour when it is burnt in the fire till it be red-hot though if you would colour hare horse dog or the like you must not burn it but for other uses it is best when burnt for instance to colour any wooden post bodies of trees or any thing else of wood or any dark ground in picture it is- not to be used about any garments unless you would colour number of old men gowns or caps standing together on account they must not be all of one colour therefore for distinction and variety ’ sake you may use umber unburnt for some of them printer ’ black is most used because it is eaiiest to be had and serves very well in washing vou must observe that you are not to put any black among your colours to make them dark because it will make them dirty neither should you shade any colour with black unless it be spanish-brown when you would colour an old man ’ gown or the like that requires to be done of à sad colour ivory burnt or instead of that burnt bone is the best black and is thus made take ivory or for want of it some white bone and put it into the fire till it be thoroughly burnt then taking it out and letting it cool slit it and taking out the blackest part of it in the middle grind it for use ch ap xii directions for making gum alum or other waters to make gum-water take an ounce of fine white gum-arabic and half an ounce of clear white candied sugar dissolve these in quart of fair water then passing it through fine sieve or piece of muslin bottle it for use and as you have oc- casion to use it pour out à little at atime re- membering to keep it clear for if it should prove dirty or foul it will spoil your colours by add- ing little coloquintida to the solution of the gum it will prevent the flies from spoiling your work if it should chance to be exposed or gum-water may be made thus pour quart of pure spring-water into jar glafs and hanging in it tied up in fine woolen rag sufficient quantity of pure white gum-arabic bruised let it hang till the gum is dissolved then putting your finger into the water if you find them stick together as if they were glued your water is too strong or full of the gum and therefore you must put more fair water to it and if you find it too weak you must put in it mre gum adding if there is any occasion for it the coloquintida as before with this water most of the colours are to be tempered and with so much of it as that being touched when dry the colour will not come off it is to be observed that if the colour glisters there is too much gum in it to make alum-water boil four ounces of alum in pint of fair water till the alum is dissolved or thus to two quarts of spring or well-water put half pound of powdered roch-alum dissolving it well by boiling then filtering it through brown paper keep it up for use wet your paper with this water before you lay on any of your colours and it will prevent them from sinking in and will besides add lustre and beauty to the colour laid on but you must take notice that if the paper is not good it must be washied over four or five times with large brush or pencil remember also that alum- raises standing colours and preserves them from fading if you design to varnisn your prints after they are coloured then wash them all over equally- with white starch before you colour them and that being dry lay on your colours to make lime-water take some unslacked lime and covering it an inch over with fair water and so letting it remain for twelve hours pour off the clear part of the water and keep it for use by washing with this water you may change your sap-green into blue to make pearl-ashes water take about half an ounce of pearl-ashes and steeping this quantity for twelve hours in' rain or river-water pour off as much of the water as is clear and you will find it of excel- lent use with brasil-wood in giving its colours an enlivening lustre to make size for water-colours take half pound of the cuttings of white gloves and steeping them in water for some time boil them with six quarts of water till it be consumed to one then strain it through cloth into an earthen pan if when the size has stood till it is cold it feels firm under your hand then it is sufficiently strong you may prepare any colours with this size while it is warm after dissolving it the principal use of it is to prevent colours from hining by candle-light as they would do if mixed with gum-water on this account the scenes of play-houses are painted in size
