knock or two with an hammer the charcoal or the chalk will fall through them upon the papers directly in the lines they were drawn and give you the true reprefentation of the object you drew from the

this glue over the medals you want to take off after the mc- dalsare laid as horizontally as poffibie and when all the surface is covered let them lie till the glue is hardened and then with the point of fine needle or pin raife the edge of the glue from each medal and the whole impreffion in glue will fly off as hard as horn with all the fine sharpnets of the medal as if it was ftruck this gilue may be made of any colour we pleafe by mixing the colour we want in the water we melt the glue in five hundred of thefe impreffions in glue will not weigh above half an ounce if each medal be an inch diameter thefe muft be dry ’ dimmediately not in an hot sun nor in damp place but regularly ir we ufe the ifinglats without any colourmix ’ with the water we may when we take our copies from the medals breathe gently on the concave side of them which in fome meafure will moiften our medal and then lay it upon piece of the thickeff sort of leaf-gold which will stick to it and by thining through the ifinglafs will appear like gold medal and if we would imitate copper medal we should mix carmine with the water we diffolve our linglats in whe prefcribe water for this end it is becaufe it will do well and may be had any where but brandy or spirits of wine will give glue much greater strength fo as to be less subject to fofren by damp air when mention this tis from an experiment made for preferving the natural colour of flowers feveral vears which ndy be ufeful to the curious who ufe this glue any occation and is as follows to preserve the leaves of tulips make fome card-paper into the figure of dripping-pans and with ffrong mixture of cum-arabick and water fix them to the card then pour on gently warm some of the iinglatsprepared with brandy or spi- rits till the leaf is quite covered and in an hour or two the liquor will become hard and by kcep- ing the air from the flower will preferve it in all its colours for feveral years the fame may be done with the bloffoms of the auricula which will preferveall their coloursas if they were painted shall now mention the manner of taking off medals of the largeff fort which will still preferve to us the delincations of man curious pieces and valuable defigns for this ufe with tuft of fine cotton little greafed with sallad=oyl rub the medals gently over and melt forme stone brimftone enough to cover the medal half an

holding them over the smoak of candle till they are quite black then wipe off the black with the foft part of the palm of the hand and lay on the engraving piece of white paper little weited with spunge and over that thin piece of flannel or piece of brown paper held hard down over the engraved part and being hard rubbed the paper next the will receive fine impreftion as if it had been pafted through rolling prefs we may yet recommend another method of taking off medals in great perfection which is by getting thin pieces of lead and placing the mcdal horizontally on the top of firm poft or any fleddy place lay over the lead flat piece of harder me- tal and over that place piece of round turn ’ stick fuch as is uted in the staff of broom fawn off about five of fix inches in length and

this blow muft be done at once to ren- derthe impreffion perfect rven this may be done on any impreffion made on scaling-wax we may likewife take off medal by laying over it piece of thin sheet block-tin otherwife called foyle which is fold at the same places where the plaifter of paris is to be had or at fome pew- tcrers shops and rubbing it hard upon the mc- dal it will give us very good

from medals with putty fuch as the glaziers ufe although the medals or bass-reliess are under-wrought another way of taking off medals is to pro- vide the scraps of shavings of white paper which you

off we should lay fome leaf-gold upon them and with piece of cotton prefs it down gently without rubbing it backwards or forwards and that will gild our medal when we have caft medals in plaifter of

where the gold is to be with firong gum-water and foon after that pur the gold on as fmooth and even as poffible preffing it down clofe with cotton but take care that when you lay on the gum-water you do not exceed the limits you would have the gold appear to shinc in this cafe the gold is only to thine through the tranfparent colour which is to be laid upon it now it muft be underffood that the leaf- gold will not regularly receive water-colours to that to render it fubfervient to our purpoic we muft with little thin liquor of ox-gall in painting-bruth of camel ’ flair stroke it over and

on this figure of letter wash with camels hair pencil fome ftrong cum- water taking care that the rum does not reach more than the out-lines then lay on the leaf= gold clofe with some cotton and as foon as it dry rub it with fome dry cotton and then polish it with dog tooth this will make it appear as if it was really caft in gold there is yet another way of working thefc things in gold and that is by ufing the gold which is prepared in shells but it must be purc gold and not fuch as is brought from some pla- ces in cermany which will change green in few days time before you ufc this gold cover the fhady parts with vermillion and then after your gold is well rectified with spirits of wine lay it on with gum-water which will mix with it very well and when it is dry polith it with dogs tooth chufe when lay on this powder-gold to leave the lights vacant of it and it makes much brighter appearance than if one was to cover the object all over bor if one was to cover by accident the whole piece with gold there is no better way to fet it off than by tracing over the fhady parts with gall-fones or which is much preferable the yellow which shall give the compofition of below made of french berries mean that which is the deepeft in colour little minium brightens it very much but fee how rectify the minium amongit the rens and polith the gold before you ufe any minium to it since have mentioned gold am next to speak of the vellows as they fall gradually in their courfe of strength the firft is kind of straw-colour and is made of flower of brimstone which in itfelf is fine enough to mix with cum-water and the manner of preparing gum-water fince have not yet mentioned it shall infert at the end of this treatife of colours common way of illuminating of prints is by giving the tincture of gamboge for yel- low and this may be of two or three forts either fainter or lronger the laft to be shade to the firft and that to be shaded with the preparation of french berries which shall prefently mention the great mr. bogle has left fome papers be- hind him that were never publifhed which my lord carleton gave me and shall infert occafi- with regard to yellow onally in this ireatife colours he fays that if the roots of barberries are cut and put in liivium made flrong with water and pearl-afhes there will be fine yellow colour produced from it which have tried and fucceeds very well ano- way mr. boyle propofes to make tranfparent vellow which is to take the root of the mulberry which affords very yellowish uice to wath it well from the earth in common water and boil it in the lixivium peak of made with pearl-afhes and water from this we may take out ftrong tincture much deeper than the former but the roots of the mulberries are much harder to be had than thofe of the barber- ries for mulberry-trees are very fcarce and the barberries are in almoff every hedge in esex about littlebury especially wirh regard to the barberry-root think it would be worth while to plant them on purpofe for the advantage that one might make from them by dying the fruit in my opinion be- ing of little or no signification but the root and the wood think will nearly antwer the jame end in producing fine yellow kellow oker will make another good pale yellow but for illuminating of prints it is colour rather of too much body however being well ground with gum-water it is of ufc after it has been well wath ’ another good yellow may be made from the plant call ’ celandine infuting it in water and prefting it gently and then boiling the li- quor with little allum this yellow will be little inclining to green bur the yellow which like the beft and may be ufed in feveral capacities of lights and strength is that made of french berrics pre- pared as follows take of french berries an ounce whole and boil them in pint of the lixivium made of pearl-ashes and water till the liquor will give fine tinge of vellow to bit of paper dipp ’ in it then pour it off from the berries and when t cool put it in bottle for ofe but if we only put french berries to infufe in common wa- ter they will produce good vellow but then it will not be durable then again add half pint of the same lix ivium to the berries and half an ounce of fresh berries and boil them till the liquor is as deep as gall-ftone which will ferve to shade all the yellows you can ufe of any fort you may boil this even to produce brown colour and with little ox-gall it will ferve to shade any leaf- gold that has been laid on paper as directed be- fore and is much preferable to gall-ftone in imi- tating any gold-colour it anfwers well upon tincture of gamboge or any of the former fellows nex to this is the tincture of saffron which with common water only affords bright reddith yellow fuch as one would have to cover the thadow ’ parts of print for an orange or beldk gold-colour however there is nothing more high when we ufe saffron than when we infufe it in rectified spirits of wine but then the colour flies unless we load it with crum-arabick as have try ’ as for deep yellow with body dutch pink comes the neareft to the aforefaid itrong yellow made of french berries in point of co- four and of lighter vellow is the engliffs pink which is ftill made of french berries and in bo- dy likewife can not help obferving that one may ex- tract good yellow colour for illuminating of prints from the freth roots of ginger if one can sct by beld is meant the boiling of pure gold in liquors which will take away the vellow of it and bring it to be of reddith or higher colour nothing elfe fpeak this becaufe fometimes one wants good vellow and any one may find this any where if gamboge can be had and it makes fine green with the tranfparent verdes greafe shall hereafter mention this

grinding and is vifcous fo it will afturedly mix as well with oyl as with water this was difcovered by edward lises efqz to which gentleman we owe many more extraordinary things of value there is one thing very extraordinary in this earth fimple as tis that if we rub deal-board with it it renders it exactly of the colour of mohogany-wood and stains it to deep and with to much strength that it is very hard to get it out without wathing and dry as this earth was when receiv ’ it can not get it out of some papers which by accident were mix ’ in my pocket with it fo that am perfuaded it will prove of extraordinary ufe when its virtues come to be known sect vii of transparent purple nter this we may make tranfparent purple either more red or nearer the blue colour as we shall fee occafion

heighten ’ to the colour you defire which you muft try by dipping piece of paper into if you then find it too red add quarter of an ounce of log-wood to the brafil-wood and you will find it much nearer the purple than the former and fo one may humour any degree of purple as you put more or lefs log-wood to the former composition and fix the colour with little allum this will produce fuch clear pur- ples as no mixture of folid reds and blues can produce and the reccipt has been for long tine kept scerct mada mariand of amfterdam who has been to famous for her painting in miniature and her excellent manner of illaminating prints told iiic that the beft purple could afe might be compofed between the carmine and indige which to itrengthen on the red side one may add lake between the lighter and darker part which have in many cafes found to be good and of significancy and fo lake when it is ufed in the same way on the foregoing purple or the liquid crimfon produces very fine effect one may vary the colour of the purple either redder by putting more carmine or bluer by ufing more indigo which being mixed on white dutch tile will thew itfelf offer respr er alter to refer

quality in it that it does not mix kindly with water and at the beft will change as it is now prepared in the common way it has been at- tempted to make blue ink which indeed held the colour for month or two but then turn ’ to muddy yellow to when you put your pencil with gum-water into shell of this blue you will find where the water preads the blue will change yellowish till the body of the bluc

aqua-fortis immedis ately changes to fine crimfon little inferior to carmine and then finks quite through the paper to as not to be got out so that when we ufe this colour as blnc it is beft to

would have it darker but before you touch your print with it try its strength upon white dutch tile for it runs warmly in the pencil and may chance to be too frong for your defign which you should always think of when flowing colour is to be laid over dark shade of print which shade will much aggravate its blacknefs and even make it appeak quite black sect vil fine beve from mr. boyl the blue leaves of rhue and beat them little in stone-mortar with wooden peftel then put them in water juice and all for fourteen days or more wathing them every day till they are rotten and at latt beat them and the water together till they are in pulp and let them dry in the sun this will produce as good blue as indigo and be much foffer but to keep it long while when you beat it the laftt time add little powder of crum-arabick you may put more or lefs of the gum as you defign to make it more free of te- s fine blue for nacious in the working shading and has good body and runs warnt in the pencil sect viil of mir botles transpas rent blue equal to ultramarine the next place have colour to defcribe which took from the great mr. boyle mas nutcripts given me by my lord carleton and proves beautiful blue and what admite the more is becaute the chief of the ingre- dients it is compofed of may be cafily had du- ring four of the summer months that is the cyanus or blue cornbottle-fower which abounds in almoff every cornfield children may gather it without hurting any thing about the skirts or verges of the corn-field this flower has two blues in it one of pale colour in the larger outward leaves and the other deeper blue which lies in the middle of the flower both thefe will do if they are feparated from the buttons or ca- fes they grow in but the deep blue of the micd- die produces much the beft colour as one may try by rubbing it while it is fresh to hard upon piece of good writing paper as to press out the juice and it will yield an excellent colour which will not fade as the experience of two of three years has shewed me this part of the flower is therefore the principal and what is to be depended upon therefore the fame day that people gather the flowers or the next at the lateff employ fome children to pick that part clean from the reft and when you have good quan- tity prets what juice you can from it and by adding to that little allum you will have latting tranfparent blue of as bright staining colour as you would defire and in my opinion it is not inferior in beauty to uultramarine but for the other parts of the flower which are paler muft obferve that when had buthel of them gathered and had not an opportunity of preffing them immediately they changed white to that can not commend them left the allum should not fix them but as for the middle of the flow- er it is certainly as good bluc as can be defir- nd and is durable is if any one should object that twill be trous blefone to make it let him confider only what pains there is in gathering and curing of saffron which fometimes is fold at thirty shillings the pound and feldom brings three pounds per pound but blue if it comes up to the colour of ui- tramarine is worth four or five pounds per ounce especially when it stains to well as this does there- fore should think it worth while when any one has made this experiment as have done to have piece of ground on purpofe for this uofe where ho other thing but this corn-bottle or cyanus should be fown and as this flower is plentiful enough in the fields between twittenham and te- dington in middlefex to there may be seed enough gathered of it in quarter of an hour by one hand to fow an hundred acres there is like= wife abundance of it in the large corn-fields in cambridgesbire but how valuable are many things that we daily trample under foot if we knew their virtues we should ufe them pros vided we could bring them to proper markets but let that be as it will gather the flowers about the beginning of tune or in july or hus guft and fome you may find in may thefe are for your immediate work to make the colour of and muft be difpatched as saffron is done or it will lofe its perfections and as happen to mention saffron which very well know the management of by drying it on kilns do not fee why thefe chives of flowers may not be cured in the same manner they would certainly produce much greater body of colour and incture might be drawn from them with more cafe than if we were to pressthem raw or freth from the field the way then that would have them dry ’ like saffron is to provide in the first place fuch kiln as is ufed for curing saffron within which make fimall charcoal-fire which comins nicates an hieat to the top of the kiln which is covered with an hair cloth and upon that lay on four or five streets of white paper mean fuch as we ule fof curing of saffron then lay on the paper parcel of the picked flowers till you have the thickness of two or three luches laying clofe and flat with knife and prinkle it with some thin cum-water then cover the cake of flowers with two or three more sheets of papery and lay upon them board with little werght upon it for few minutes then take off the board and taking hold of all the papers with both hands turn your cake of flowers upon the kiln and when tis rightly placed take off the upper papers and fprinkle the cake again with tome thin gum-water and with knife fet= tle your cake of flowers and lay on again your and board with weight upon it for minute of two and then turn your papers again and again till the flower-cake becomes united and of the thickness of cake of saffron in this you will find the flowers grow darker ty time they are turned till at length the cake willlook of deep blue tending to black from whence we cafily draw fuch tincture as fpeak off durinc this operation great care muft be taken of the fire that it does not fcorch the flowers let it be gentle and as constant as may be which will be fure way to bring your flower-cake to good colour wovts advite in this cafe that whoever attempts this they should fee the management of saffron or read accounts that are publiffied of the curingit ir any one is defirous of feeing the curing of saffron with the manner of the kilns the boff artiffs that way are about chesterford and littles bury in effex though think it can be of no great morent fince there is publiffed large account of its preparation in mr. bradley montbly treatife of husbandry and gardenings and in the prefent cafe of the blue have made the neceffary alcerations and think given what

it will prefently come up in the choice of the seed should obferve that it be gathered opply in fuch fields where wc are fure there grow no corn-bottles of any other colour but blue and then one may expect all the plants which rife from fuch seed to produce blue flowers but if they should be gathered itn fuch places where there are varieties of them we muft expect various sorts as white red or purple although we are fure we gather the seed from fuch as were truly of the blue sort for ac- cording to the dectrine of the generation of plants which has been explained to the world in sicat great

make tolerable oak reen with it and being htill more mix ’ with the verdigreafe green it will be grats green bur the vellow that pfefer before all others is that which is made of french befries defcribed above which have obferved is of different cas pacities as the liquor it is boyled in is more or lefs ftain ’ with it when it is very thin it makes good glaze all over the verdigreafe ald as

produces fine blucish green flows eafy in the pencil and may even ferve as an ink to write with the preparing of this colour is yet very little known and shall therefore inform my reader how to do it take of common verdigreafe three ounces break it little and boil it gently in pint of white-wine vinegar firring it continually when you perceive it to boil add little tartar broken and keep your mixture ftirring till you find the clear liquer of fuch colour as you would with that is of fine tranfparent green with blue calt which you may do by dipping in stick and touching piece of paper with it when you have colour to your mind pour it through linnen-cloth into an open veffel and fet it to cool when it is quite cold keep it in clofe veffel for ofe pouring out little at time as you want it for when it is expoted to the air it will foon dry but is reducible again by common water when we prepare this liquid colour do not ufe the diftilled verdigreafe for it will notanfwer the end we propofe hrs liquid should be touched upon part of the lights and shades of print and the shades afterwards coloured with sap-green ... in the making this green take care you make it trong enough for it is not to be frength- iicd afterwards without the trouble of boiling afresh but may at any time be rendered as faint as we pleafe by mixing common water with it sap-green is colour like that of an oak- leaf if it is ufed thin with common water for this as well as the former wants no crum but it will if we ufe it frong produce as dark green as any we can imagine we may try our colour firft on white dutch tile and by thinning it with water render it of what strength we picafe and brighten it very much with adding to it little of the liquid verdigreafc sap-treen is made two ways viz firf take the flowers of the blue flag-iris or flower-de-luce and prefs them while there is any juice to be got from them boil this gently in glazed pipkin till it grows thick adding little allum to it and it will make very ufeful and lafting green .. in the boyling of any juice of the colours heretofore mentioned ufe an earthen glazed pipkin for if you boil them in veffels of metal they will fometimes change from the de- sign we intend secondly another way there is of produ- cing sap-green for wathing or illuminating of prints which is to take the juice of buckthorn- berries and tho that juice fimply will yield on- ly dark purple of very bafe hue yet by adding tartar to it it will turn to good sap- green and may be brought to good contiffence by boiling eyther of thefe colours will mik with the liquid verdigreafe above mentioned as well as make delicate shade for it there is yet one green more which is af- mired by fome and carries good body with with degree of tranfparency as make it tho as it is commonly yied it is full-bodied colour fit only for miniature painting for this end they mix dutch pink with indigg to what degree of colour they pleafe but in the place of dutch pink my high preparation of french berries with indigo ithink much to be preferr ’ as this anfwers all the intent of dutch pink and carries tranfparency with it which the dutch pink has not and thus have
