charalters of their figures and that with to much exact= thelefs if we examine the matter farther we shall find ness that no one in to many ages has yet been able to artain that high perfection they gave their works that very few men or perhaps none have all their parts in we may boldly fay that they have in some fort excelled exact proportion without any defect we muft therefore nature for

generally regulare according to collecting thus in one figure all the beauries which agreed to the subject they reprefented as we fee in the hercuies all their country and temper the strokes that are

beauty they pared neither time nor care there have where they were born the painters from their particular been some that have worked their whole lives in view of pro- custos from the objects that are continually before their eyes ducing one perfect figure with which they fo fill their imaginations as to make all their to animate them they had three powerful motives re- figures conformable to them ligion glory and intereft they confidered it as kind of hence it comes that we give charalter of painters by religious worship to give the figures of their gods fo the name of certain countries faying the piece is of the much nobleness and beaury as to be able to attract the custo of fuch country and indeed this guste is always found love and veneration of the people their own glory was more or less in all the defigners of thofe nations concerned particular hfonours being bellowed on those that as to our temper that acts ftill more powerfully in us tuccceded and as to their fortune they had no farther care he is that which makes the moft effential diftinction between to take when they were arrived to certain degree of merit tone man and another and has part in every thing we do beside thefe realons which have the moft contribured in this fenfe we may fay that painter paints himself in his to form thefe excellent men it is certain there are happy ages works and if we had penetration

certain models to work after with their works and that the character of their dispolition toun principal study being to be made upon thefe figures might be found not only in the choice of the subjects but it may be proper to mencion to you that in the beft of them yet farther in each figure in particular we obterve certain things which would certainly be counted let us add to to many prejudices which we have from faules if they were in the works of modern theleft ourfeives thofe which proceed from our mafter of whofe leg of the laocoon pag is four minutes longer than the manner we almoft
