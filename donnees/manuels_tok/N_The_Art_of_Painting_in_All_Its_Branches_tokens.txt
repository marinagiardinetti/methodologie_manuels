englisb and the rather to use his own reason for that though many excellent authors have written on painting yet in bulk they seem rather to cry up the art and artist than lay down solid rules for attainment to whichi may add that those authors are mostly useless to an englisbman and few or none copious enough to answer general pur- pose nor at best are of general service in engiand where fresh and fair nature is preferred before the brown and warm colouring of some other countries especially italy where the best books have been written on the subject but principally for that think nothing has been published here so learned full and complete and so well explained by plates and ex- amples as the author will be found to be nor perhaps wherein portrai- ture branch which england mightily affects is so copioussy handled the author learned the rudiments of his art under his father and at amsterdam whither he came young from luttich the capital of bisho- pric of that name in germany where he settled lived and died gave early proofs of the skill and erudition for which he was afterwards famed accordingly he pursued history and its chief ornament emblematic learning and having made some proficiency in those two capital branches he congeived that other things must be easy of course as being but rivu- lets flowing from those main springs wherefore it is probable by what he writes that in their turns he practised portraiture and the other parts in such manner as to qualify him to criticise on all of them but the translators preeace but his thirst for the arts stopped not here he was persuaded that so inquisitive so laborious genius as his was as proper for plate as the pencil and therefore at times he etched -great number of prints from his own designs which have met with good reception abroad especially in germany where set of them have been copied to good advantage as his practice was as useful laborious and universal as that of any painter of the age so also was the theory whereon he built it it does not appear that he ever visited france or italy or any other academy neverthelefs rome france england and germany know him in his works and at home he made himself master of such fund of classic em- blematic historical and discriptionary learning prints and books on paint- ing architecture antiquities and other requisites and was so well ac- quainted with the works of the best masters that he becume good cri- tic by this means and through his great industry his outline appears true and easy his colouring warm soft and expressive and his compo- sitions noble learned and just amidst his fatigues he preserved the pleasant humour which reigns in several parts of this work particularly in the odd description of the flood book chap and the contest between antiguo and modo book chap what rendered him most dear to the age he lived in was his kind and fatherly instruction and encourageinent to young artists and his com- municative advice to painters in general who made him frequent visits which they acknowledged in often chusing him the umpire of their dis- putes on art esteeming his decifions as oracles this public spirit this love for his art as they were always conspicuous in him without mercenariness so they remained with him to the last for notwithstanding his loss of sight the effect of two close an application to etching by candle-light as many imagine and as he himself almost ac- knowledges he as mons gericke rector and professor in the royal academy of arts at berlin and painter to the king of prussia observes in the preface to his version of the author ’ drawing-book made weekly thing not to be paralleled in any other master the center of eircle consisting of young students whom he instructed in drawing by which he got maintenance and like the sun dispensed his beams to all around him under his great affliction the painters his cotemporaries knowing he had stored large collection of remarks on the art for his private amuse- ment almost generally intreated him to reduce them to some order for public public benefit which notwithstanding his loss of sight and age they thonght him still capable of doing his inability for painting an amusement to his chagrin his friends re- qustes and design to be thoroughly informing to promising tyros sway- ed him to compliance and how well the work was received may appear from the commendatory copies of verses penned by the best poets of tht time and prefixed to each of his thirteen books which havc omitted in the translation as being of no significancy to an englisb reader the aforesaid remarks aud observations were originally in french and in compiling the author made several additions to them even while the sheets were printing off which may possibly make the work seem in some places less smooth than otherwise it would be though certainly the bet- ter for them judging with plato non enim tadet bis dicere quod bene dicitur he tells us that if connexion in general be not so well observed as might be wished it was occasioned by doing the work piece meal and taking things as they arose and that ifhe be thought to speak too freely and censure other mens works toe-rashly it should be considered that as man he has his failings in common with others nevertheless ifhis rea- sons be impartially examined he questions not an aquittal for says he lf any works be read without love and impartiality the labour and instruc- tion is lost wherefore he who would teach fundamentally and well must avoid prepossession weigh duly what seems odd to him and inquire and reason thoroughly before he fixes either his thoughts or opinion of he also says that if he be any where found to prescribe rules things which he has not always followed it is owing to his dark condition where- in his memory and idcas became more vigorous bright and intent and consequently his judgment more strong acute and refined by continual reflexions on the art than when he had his sight and was busied in his employment for further satisfaction in this point see chap of the book of colouring it now remains to be observed that as his chieftalent lay in history the noblest branch of painting and allowing the greatest frecdoms so the heat of his zeal and the many inconveniences attending portraiture might possibley induce him to speak à little too freely of the latter in book hope he will be excused since he notwithstanding fails not afterwards to be very particular in his instruction on that head and if what he advances in book chap touching the representation of the first person in the trinity give any offence only observe that though his reafons are plausible yet he modestly concludes that herein painter must be very discreet and not abuse the liberty allowed him by scripture and the consent of the fathers wherefore since such things are not allowable by protestants of whose communion the author pro- fesses to be no further maintain the point than to say could not in justice to the work leave out the chapter which treats of it but principal satisfaction think necessary to be given touching the verbal or descriptionary tables occurring in several parts of the work these though at first view they may possibly seem dull and tiresome yet when duly considered will appear to be master-pieces in their kind and not only display the authors solid learning but also his great in- dustry in inforcinghis precepts by every method for as it is evident that he has spared for no pains both by discourses and examples to evince the doctrine of disposition motion pasfions contrast colouring har- mony light and shade reflexions draperies grounds ornaments and generally every thing which can constitute good composition so can¬ not but observe how wonderfully he reduces all those parts to practice in the said tables and thereby illustrate divers things and essential circum- stances which could not be so well ’ done either by discourses or in any other manner in word they are summaries of the whole and the best instructions for performance and to inform the judgment of lover of painting and therefore the work would have been incomplete without them it is certain that by such precepts as the author lays down the greatest masters in history have made themselves famous and by these even face-painters have attained the looseness and freedom may say the historical management we discover in their best pieces but the au- thor stops not here for he fails not every where to inculcate emblematic and hieroglyphic learning part of knowledge which though much overlooked is very hopeful and necessary in almost every branch of painting on the whole as his great reading appears by the number of authors he quotes on this occasion and as he endeavours to be generally useful even to the handling of architecture statuary engraving etching and mez- zotinto so it is hoped the work will prove here as it has done abroad system of the art of painting and may pofsibly in due season also publish the drawing-book of the same author work as entertain- ing as profitable to lovers and artists whoever will study arts and sciences must expect both trouble and labour without repining because his expectation is not im- mediately answered or the end just in view this is so true that even the greatest masters are not always alike successful but if delays seem tiresome let us duly ponder where the obstruction lies and whether master can not help us over it surely if we be not too full of ourselves we may meet with such an aid according to cato ne pudeat

two manners very different from each other the one sluent and smooth the other expe- ditious and bold the former is proper for copying neat and elaborate painting and the latter for copying bold compositions as big as the life but he who practises the former manner has this advantage above the other that being accustomed to neatness he can easily execute the bold and light manner it being otherwise difficult to bring the hand to neat paint- ing the reason of which is that not being used to consider and imitate the full¬ neis of small objects he must therefore be stranger to it besides it is more easy to leave out some things which we are masters of than to add others which we have not studied and therefore it must be the artist ’ care to finisn his work as much as poffible it is ridiculous to hear the disciples of great masters boast that by copying great things they certainly obtain great and firm manner and fat and bold bencil and therefore are induced to disrelish every thing that is neat and elaborate but after all they can say it is certain that he who can handle best must study that manner which most exactly exhibits the different natures of the objects which he is to reprefent for there are no other handlings of advantage to painter than the two before-mentioned but further to convince any one that great and bold handling contributes nothing to the art let us place piece thus painted at due distance and then see whether the penciling makes it look more natural this advantage it may perhaps have it may bring in more money since so happy master can dispatch double the work of another through the bent of imagination fitted to the expedition of his hand each branch has peculiar handling adapted to the nature of the objects to be represented as the landscape-painter in the leafing of the trees the cattle-painter in the expression of wool and hair the ornament-painter in foliage branching and the flower-painter in ’ thin penciling painters are also observed to use some long-haired others short-haired pencils this thin that stiff colours but notwithstanding any such differences all is reduceable to the two handlings aforesaid yet in such manner as that neither of them ought to appear but for the advantage of the artist only the art being theory of the mind and the handling manual practice consisting of penciling in an orderly and determinate matter for representing an object certainly and quickly and without muddling many are of opinion that this is gift of nature peculiar to some only and thov can not entirely disown it yet must say that it lies more in practice and though we see many painters in the decline of their lives fall into an hard and muddy manner yet that argues not against my position since it happens either through inclination or want of better foundation in their youth how often do we see masters known by their disciples little and slovenly masters never bring up neat and curious painters though it sometimes happens that neat master may rear slovenly disciple and the reason is plain for good instruction is not aloné sufficient without due and perfect apprehension of it carelessness being the usual parent of bad picture and so infecting an evil will continue as long as the artist remains in his ignorance it is certain tnen in order to obtain good handling that right and early apprehension of instruction and thorough sight of faults are absolutely necessary when these points are gained the artist must endeavour at the three following essential qualifications boldness of hand in the dead-colouring more care cireumspection and labour in the second colouring and thorough patience and attention in the re-touching or finisning picture the nigher to perfection the more care these three qualities are as essential to painter as the three graces to 'enus our first work then must be to lay both lights and shades bold with broad and full-coloured pencil one by the other even and without muddling and then gently moving the pencil to and fro up and down as the nature of the object re- quires we thereby unite the colours and fetch out the relief with this caution never- theless that the lights must not be scumbled too much into the shades or the shades into the lights thus the work will have good effect by proceeding in this manner we shall perceive no very particular handling in our work and therefore it must be good one for the first colouring is hid by the second as that is by the third wherein lies the neatness having hitherto spoken chiesly of painting in little and its manner of handling shall in the next chapter lay down instructions for painting as big as the life of penciling second tint and beauty chap ii of painting after the lije he who paints after the life and finds it difficult through years and inabi- hlity to make good compofition must not undertake things beyond his strength if ten figures be too much let him take five if these be too many two or one nay an half figure for little and good is preferable to much and bad again if he have no genius for draperies let him study the naked as spagnolet carbot and other masters did but then like them he must labour to excel in that branch for middling artist will neither get honour nor gain here let me advise you to gain thorough knowledge of form or proportion and the passions that you may not only give your figures their natural motions but that it may also well appear what causes those motions express properly the condition and dignity of your figures by their carriage whether they be private persons of either sex great men or deities seck the colouring not in spagnolet or carlot but in nature herself let your carnations be as natural as pessible the fresn and fair you must paint so and the yellow or russet must be of those colours but above all industriously avoid inclining to particular manner do not main- tain that warm glowing or brown colouring is best bat is in his kind aa beautiful as parrot for then-you will certainly err and since men are too apt to hug their faults your care must be to be known by good manner and handling now for our artist ’ safer conduct we shall lay down the following precepts for the right ordonnance of piece let him chiesly consider where the piece is to be fixed in order to place right the horizon and point of sight let him consider what force the light has in that place and thereby whether the painting must have strong lights and broad shades as being near windor or more faint and melting light as removed further into the room this we may soon per- ceive in landscape or other within-door painting and whether the shades should be strong or not since it is certain that the objects whether great or small have different effects in these two instanees and now if the perspective be also well managed and the colours laid frefh and proper and well handled by gently uniting them uith large pencils the piece will be good if this handling and melting of colours be not yet understood ishall clear the point in the following instance take what colours your object requires be they red blue green violet lay them broad and distinct by each other without scumbling then viewing them through piece of lantern-horn you will perceive à perfect umnion of colours and that none of them lie distinct though in fact they do this fully illustrates what say of fluent or smooth pencil now the effect is the same when we paint in varniss or tough or fat oil because painting with starved colours on dry ground can never effect this smoothness in painting after the life we ought to use large pencils and though to some this may seem an useless admonition because great paintings require such yet must recommend it because some use common-sized and worn ones which so muddle the work and fill it so full of hairs that it will bear scraping this evil is so stealing that at last it becomes habitual and then the painter neither minds or sees it himself because there are two forts of pictures the one moveable the other fixed the former hung at pleasure in halls or rooms the latter for ceilings or far above the eye each of them calls for distinct management niches in galleries as near the eye must be ranged in the clafs of moveable pictures as well as portraits wherefore they ought to be neater handled though sometimes placed higher at other times lower if it be afked whether an upright piece forty or fifty feet deep from floor to- cieling ought to be smoothly handled and finished throughout say no but rather to be so painted as high as you can reach less finished in the middle and less than that as it advances in height and yet with such general care that all parts seem to have à like force and finishing and though we find different con- duct in jordaan ’ magnificent triumphal piece in the house in the wood near the hague yet that can be no rule because the painting being large the eye can not distinguissi whether the upper parts be less finished than the under more- over the figures are bigger than the life but here methinks difficulty may be started suppose in room where such large piece is another were to be painted by it smaller as single figure no bigger than the life how shall we manage in order to give this latter picture the same force as the former answer that force and warmth lie in the colouring not in the roughness of picture whence it is that the small picture must be handled in the same manner as the great one to make them look agreeable for heightening and shading it with the same force will produce the same effect and if not im- mediately by the pure strength of colours yet by scumbling and glazing we fetch it out but then say some it can not have due conformity with the life be- cause on comparing it with the large picture it seems less than the life answer that this objection must not make us exceed the common size of nature since no such large men as in the great picture are to be found in nature and if any such were their parts would look too big their skins rougher pores coarser hair more bushy and strong than we see in nature but the con- trary may be practised in cieling-piece where the composition is mostly hiero- glyphic and fictitious proceed now to shew more amply good manner or handling chap ii of dead-colouring and how to perform it with cer- tainty and expedition the most certain and regular way is to begin the picture from the depth or bointain especially when landscape is introduced fince all things muft suit and fall in with the lights and darks of the air and the several tints of the piece be modi- fied and governed by it as indeed must also the light on the fore-ground and the force of the figures otherwise the effect will be disagreeable and uncertain but if the main composition consist of figures or other large objects only it is better to begin where you intend the greatest force whether it be on the first or second distance and then work to the off-part of the picture now in order to proceed with certainty we must take care that general harmony of parts be well observed that the tints and colours be justly managed according to the laws of depth and distance so that nothing appear offensive to the eye and then the work will be in fit condition for second colouring with little trouble many painters indeed err in not knowing where to begin rightly and only consulting what objects they like best heedlessly fall on them first for instance if it be gold vase they begin with that and then proceed to blue drapery then red one others begn with the nudities and so run through all the nakeds in the picture by which strange disjunction the work becomes mis-shapen and the painter made more uneasy than by an ill-primed cloth but such painters never think on any means to extricate themselves out of this labyrinth to what purpose is it to shew them their error they are satisfied with what they have done and salve all by saying -- the picture is but dead-coloured on finishing it shall be otherwise what is now too light shall be brought down and what too dark heightened — but all this while the work does not go forward the rising difficulties pall the fancy and the work is in bad condition for second colouring ch ap iv of the second colouring and its requisites fa piece be well dead-coloured and have ’ good harmony and decorum we certainly render the second colouring the more easy for then we can unbend our first general thoughts and apply them solely to lay neatly and finisn particular parts and so to work on the former good ground but to do this in the best manner we must as have said begin from the greatest lointain the sey and work forwards from thence by this means we have always wet ground to melt in with the out-lines of the forward figures which otherwise they would not have besides another pleasing advantage that the piece goes forward all parts well supported and good harmony in the whole whence the eye must be satisfied and the mind continually spurred this management is one of the prime qualities of painter for what can encourage him more than an asfurance that he works on basis and which he finds without seeking it but unhappy is he who works disorderly for muddling on one thing as long as his fancy for it lasts and then thoughtlesly proceeding to others and dwelling on them in the same manner he misses the necessary becoming air of his piece and at last all appears out of joint and disrelishing having come thus far we proceed to the manner the french call it chap of retouching or finisbing retoucher we revise how fure painter is having got thus far let experience and his own reflection be judges for the figures having their proper distances strengths and effects and all parts due harmony and keeping nothing remains but to give the piece the last force of light and shade to do which well rub your piece or so much as you think you can paint of it at one time and before the vernisn grow dry with good thin picture-varnissi mixed with some fat white oil then work on this wet ground by clapping your lights on the lightest parts and by gentle scumble unite them with the wet ground aforesaid and the tenderness of the nudities and draperies in such degree as is necessary for each then put in the yellow or glow of the reflections if after all the lights of the nudities should be here and there too strong reduce them by mixing little light oker vermilion brown red lake or asphaltum according as the colour is tender or strong underthe vernisn glazed thinly over them then heighten upon this with such colour as you think fit do the same by the draperies thus the work will succeed and the colours be prevented from going in in drying chap vi of the second tint and the relief it occastons there are many who whatever pains they take can not be brought to they who have relisn thing in which they find so much difficulty long practised after nature are vexed to see the works of other masters better coloured and more pleasing than their own insomuch that with difficulty they re-assume their professions and then eagerly hoping to do wonders find their old vexation still return would these men rightly search the cause their trouble would end for because of our inferiority in knowledge yet we must not be therefore discouraged but as faid study where the fault lies let us then make good reflections on neat pictures in order to profit by them and also converse with better masters than ourselves of penciling second tint and beauty it is to be lamented that these men sometimes see fine things in another master but can give no reason for it because they work rather by accident or chance than on sure principles as was the case of young painter some years ago who shewing me some of his pieces said this piece painted six years ago this four and that less yet can perceive no difference between them in goodness -- now though the difference was visible the last pieces appearing better managed in all parts than the former yet he would not believe me saying that notwithstanding all his endeavours his pictures were grey and muddy when others were clean and plea- sant and their lights broad lay on my colours says he fine and warm as they do and then expeditiousty scumble them into each other now pray tell me what must tken occa- sion this foulness told him—certain painters with whom you daily converse spoil you and as long as you follow them all my advice is to no purpose as for your thoughts and ordonnances like them very well but distike your handling you do not lay on your second tint clean enough by the second tint mean that which is laid on the light parts towards the out-line by means of which all relieved or round parts are forced to unite with the ground and to go off rounding this you must lay on clean and beautiful in the same colour as that of the light but it must not be muddy and like shade for being also lighted by the day the darkness and its grey can have no effect upon it relief or roundness being nothing else than light re- ceding or going off which ought to partake more or less of blue in proportion to the colour of the carnation which if yellowish the second tint must be greenish if red the tint must be violet and if white colour the tint is medium be¬ tween the two colours aforesaid from all which premises it is easy to apprehend that this second colour is to be got and mixed with blue but not with foul colour because it then loses its flehhiness.-here he asked me in what manner then he should make it darker answered that as the distance of objects causes faint- ness in colouring and what we call air makes bluissi interposition between us and them so he must mix nothing with his tint but fine blue or smalt in proportion to such distance this is colour if may so say which gives no colour or does it without much alteration this conduct relates not only to nudities but also to landscapes grounds stones draperies and in fine to every object having either roundness or distance moreover another perfection necessary to this tint is that we must not let it be too dark upon the relief because broad light looks majestic and fine when between it and the broad shade tender difference only appears —he returned me thanks and went off there are many who know not the importance of the things they slight and in comparison with others think them of no great moment as was the case of an- other painter who copying piece of poussin observed nicely the colouring tempering even the half shades and tender tints exactly on his pallet but having finished the piece he in other pictures fell again into his old road he himself saw very well greât difference between this piece and those others and was sorry for it but the mischief lay in not retaining the manner which he had before imitated with so much pains and this occasioned his slightness we find even painters who believe that the second tint must upon extremities be quite dark mixing in it the colour of the ground and say the great mignard did so which intirely deny it is true that once read small treatise written by the famous bosse entitled le peintre converti or the converted painter in which among other things he pretends to prove that mignard made his second tint too dark on the extremities of his objects but say that it must not be understood from thence that he muddled the tint with fouler ground-colour but rather that in proportion to the lightness or darkness of the ground he made it either lighter or darker without using any red yellow or black in it as they pretend moreover we know the vast difference between foreright face and fore-shortened one that the one on the near side grows larger than the other as the faces in plate plainly shew which by observing or neglecting gives the the greatest difficulty some painters meet with is that one of the qualities of good picture lies in broad light this they imagine to consist in slatness rea- soning thus lfit be truth that picture with such lights is best more round ones must needs be worse very loose argument certainly since nature and daily experience of round objects teach us the contrary especially when it is not sun-shiny weather ihave said before that the contour or out-line ought to unite in the tints of the ground that going off from the more enlightened parts it may not appear so much as the others to illustrate which we exhibit here in plate aforesaid round pillar against ground half light half shade so that the light side of the pillar is set off by the shade of the ground and the shade of the pillar by the light side of the ground now it must needs follow in order to obtain the relief that the shade of the pillar ought to be made lighter on the extremity that it may round off towards the light ground otherwise it would be but semi-circle on the opposite side it is the same except that the light does preserve itself and its own colour because the air which interposes causes the out-line to recede and fall back and in the shade the same with this differerce only that there it is doubled by the lightness of the back-ground partaking more or less of its colour if this be not well apprehended let the next example explain it place globular body against light yellow ground as in the said plate then viewing it at some distance you will perceive the out-line on the shaded side tenderly to melt into the ground without any hardness this relates to the roundness only now let us observe how much the colour partakes of it lf this ball be of blue colour the extremities will be greenish against the yellow if the ball be violet they become purplisn and if the ball be yellow as well as the ground they will be more yellow in the shade as we have already taught in treating of the naked the superficial roughness or smoothness of the ball causes little alte- ratior except with respect to its nearness to or distance from the ground looking now on the light side of this ball we shall find that if the ball be lighter than the yellow ground the colour of the ground can not have so much force on it since the superficial colour of the ball can not be overcome by lesser colour than it and therefore the yellow ground can not add to its colour whence it happens that the meer interposition of the air causes the relief or the out-line to round and go off again were the ground darkish or black yet the diminishing of the colour caused by the interposition of the air will be neither less nor more but will be more or less set off by the ground and seem lefs round artists err in thinking that the half tint which is laid next to the extremity on the light side and called mezzo-tint is the same with that placed between light and shade under the name of middle tint for this last is whole tint and the other but an half tint and not so broad as the mezzo-tint which more than half mixes with the shade and consequently is bluer although some give it upon the edge of the light side another colour more like shade than the colour of the object the mistake of which we have already shewn but when the light is fronting or comes directly from before then this mezzo-tint is half mixed with the middle tint let me not here be misunder- stood for speak not of the side-light which painters generally use from all which premises it is plain that this tint though called mezzo-tint or broken tint can not be considered as shade since it partakes of the light again it happens frequently that in the same piece of painting some objects are rounder or darker upon the extremities than others which ought to be so when by means of the obliquity of the point of sight we can discover more than the semi-diameter of their roundness in some and but semi-diameter or less in others as in the two pillars in the plate aforesaid for if the point of sight be in the midale of the piece and the light fall in it obliquely from the right side then the objects on the right side will have broader shade and those on the left broader light as these two pillars plainly evidence but if now on each side of these two pillars were some other pillars placed alike distant from the point of sight and both cut from top to bottom through their centers parallel with the horizon it is certain that at the proper distance we shall see not only the inward splitting but also some part of the hindermost half as in pillar now observe as the pillar to the left shews that the part which is seen beyond the half on the light side rounds off so much the further and consequently becomes darker than where the main light rounds off on the contrary viewing the light side of the right-hand pillar you see as much less of the foremost diameter or half as more of that on the shaded side wherefore the out-line can not round off so far on its light side nor the extremity be so dark as on the other pillar where more than the half is visible ch ap vii of beauty and the proportions of the members in au human body beauty being the most valuable part of painting it must therefore be the first and chief object of our work but my design is not to mention all that can be said of its power and influence since daily occurrences furnish us with sufficient examples the wisest of the ancients venerated it as we see in plato who defines it to be an human brightness of lovely nature having power to attract the mind by the help of the eyes nay cato valued it so highly that he publicly said it were as great sin io hurt it as to rob atemple nevertheless it must be confest that it lies most in an idea conceived in our senses and judgment whence it is impossible to think that it should center in any one single object the most we can say then is this that there are as many beauties as different objects the proverb says well — so many minds so many beauties paris imagined according to homer that helena wife to menelaus was the handsomest woman apollo boasted the same of his daphne narcissus on the contrary thought no-body handsomer than himself stratonica amongst the persians was accounted the greatest beauty and her statue worshipped the neck and breast of the athenian theodota were so amiable in socrates ’ eyes that he fell in love with her many more instances might be given but seeing its standard is no where fixed in order to know it certainly we can only observe that each country each lover thinks it has the greatest the grecians think the brown complexion the most agreeable the latins the fair spaniards think black hair and the germans brown hair the most pleasing this loves tall and well-set people that esteems slenderness this modest carriage that wanton one from all which premises it is plain beauty depends most on imagination beauty is three-fold common uncommon perfect the common depends much on the fafhiion and satisfies common sense the uncommon is singled out by our judgments from amongst many others and the perfect is that as we have said which subsists in the imagination but we must neverthelefs six on some standard or model for beauty which therefore we have drawn to the best of our skill out of the many patterns left us by the greeks the beauty of nudity in either sex consists herein the members must be well shaped they must have fine free and easy motion sound and fresh colour the members must be perfectiy joined in manner best befitting their natures and qualities the head and face duely proportionate and the eyes nose and mouth to have their exact symmetry the hands fingers feet and toes and other parts of the body to be of an agreeable length and thickness by easy motion we mean that all the members from the greatest to the least exert themselves most beautifully and without pains performing their action in graceful manner as we shall illustrate by examples by colour we understand such an one as is visible in perfect healthy per- sons not subject to impairs and not inclining too much to rednefs or palenefs as we shall shew in its place these are the three qualities requisite to beautiful naked and named by the poets the three graces affirming that they were all to be found in venus urania now in order to instruct the artist fully in the beautiful division of the mem- bers shall here subjoin the measure as took it from aman ’ skeleton when for profefsor birloo physician to the king of great britain according to his instructions drew the figures for his famous book of anatomy- for ease in this measure have placed by it in plates ii iii iv perpen¬ dicular line marked with sol and luna which is the length of the figure and is divided into four equal parts called rough parts marked bcd for the quar- terly division of the figures from the head to the arm-pits privities knees and soles of the feet this line is divided again into seven equal parts and an half called head-parts and numbered the sirst of which is for the head which is again subdivided into four other equal parts marked for the forehead eyes nose and chin and by these last divisions we shall afcertain the several parts of the figure ascending from the mark luna to sol according to which the length will be and now question not but he who governs his figures by these proportions will find his advantage in it especially if he observes the gracefulneis of the statues for instruction in the second part of beauty the graceful motion of the members let the tyro consult the figures in plate vi wherein he will find the principal disposition for beautiful action consisting in raising and sinking the shoulders and hips and their contrasting motions as also those of the lesser members in the same posture from whence arises not only the grace of beautiful figures but also advantageous shades which give the last hand to grace this instruction is of so universal importance that it ought to be observed as well in dead as living nature in paffionate as meek men raging as quiet sor- rowful as joyful those in pains or dying as in dead body nay itis impossible that any particular motion or posture of the body can be good which is not na- turally exprest and conducted by the three following qualities fine out- line free sway in the motion lastly beautiful colouring for to colour living figure as dead one or the contrary raging one pale quiet one hot or mourning one in merry air would be egregious and against the truth and all lies being hateful must be unworthy of painting if seem unintelligible in saying that sine action and colouriug ought to be observed in dead body void of boih it must be known that speak of painted dead body not natural one because this letter has neither the power of motion nor disposition however when required we must dispose the model for our dead figure in such manner as looks most beautiful the face in front the breast swaying fideways one hip rising one leg close the other flung out one arm flung this way the other that way and so forth this is called fine action and the whole beautiful figure as for the colouring it must not be like wood or stone but flessy as we see in nature it if any object that because there are three principal stages of life vouth middle dge and old age each having its particular action colouring and proportions it is difficult to chuse perfect beauty out of any of them answer that all three ought to be représented alike beautisul according to their natures the young tender gay and frefh the midale-aged sedate and fleshy and the aged slow-motioned and decayed for not- withstanding age each of the three has his commendable qualities-that is an handsome youth -- there is comely man -- mind the gravity of that old man -and so forth but pray consult perrie ’ statues and carefully mind the youth of ganimedes let antinous or apollo represent the second stage of life and the old faunus the third and you will thereby see that each of those figures is in his character perfectly beautiful to which add their fine colouring agreeable to their years all of which confirm my affertion and the figure must be beau- tiful although now beautiful figure consists in good proportion and disposition of its parts with respect to action and passion yet it can not be said to be absolutely perfect ’ till further improved by beautiful lights for we often see that too faint lights render objects disagreeable and produce an effect contrary to our intention which which makes us uneasy because our first purposes are spoiled and we know- not the reason of it but so itwill happen when without minding the effect of our objects we chuse an improperlight as violent passion in feeble light which looses at once its effect and motion contrarily tender and pleasant object may by too strong and broad light and shades too sharp be quite broken and its grace gone hence it is of the last moment to consider thoroughly before we begin our work the nature and effects of the subject we intend to handle as whether it be the murther of julius caesar in full senate or the death of cato or the nuptials of strafonica with antiochus or the reception of the queen of sheba with her retinue of ladies by solomon because different passions are to be introduced in those different subjects in the former we must suppose great hurry and conster- nation fright and confusion nay all is in motion in the latter nothing is seen but tender beauty easy carriage graceful modesty and authority and now whio will not agree with me that the two former subjects ought to be handled with strong and siarp lights and the two latter with soft and more tender ones à this effect lies also in the very natures and qualities of lights themselves some producing strength and sharpness others sweetness softness and pleasure but former examples may be called graceful confusion and the two latter severe amour wherefore conclude that figure well proportioned and disposed having graceful motion and sway and light agreeable to its out-line and motion may be called perfect figure chap viii of the motion of the members et us proceed now to the second of the parts wherein beauty consists lnamely ihe motion of the members this depends chiesty on contrasting or opposition of all the members of the body and on their lights and shades which give figure motion and life and this is chiefly obtained by winding or sway as when the face is fronting the body must turn little sideways and the legs again fronting see fig plate vii second observation is contrast in the inclining poise of tke body from head to foot for instance if one shoulder rises the other must sink the hips knecs and feet the same as in the same fig wherein the right shoulder riscs the right hip falls the right knce or foot rising again and the con- trary on the opposite ’ side of tlie body third observation is that when the right arm and left leg advance the left arm and right leg fall back this morion doubles when the right shoulder is seen fronting for then the head and under part of the body must be the same as the same figure shews when the breast rises the head ought to sink and the contrary see sig the head must always incline to- the upper shoulder as in fig in an erect posture the feet must make rectangle to wit the heel of the one with the in¬ ward ancle of the other as in fig hands must always have contrasting motion if one be seen inwardly the other ought to be outward if one hangs down the other should be raised up the under part of the arm being foreshortened the upper part should be seen direct if the motion of the legs is almost like that of the arms comparing the upper part of the arm with the thigh and the under part with the leg if the upper part of the arm sink the thigh must rise and contrast it when the right arm is raised and the left depressed then the knees or feet must be contrary if the hip swell the upper part of the body sinks into the under part if the shoulders heave the neck sinks into them here take especial care that the hand and arm be not on line but that each contrast the other in an oppesing turn as we see in the good and bad examples fig the crofs line of the face is never parallel with that of the body either front- ing or profile-wise nor-the upper part of the body with the lower in these motions consist in my opmion the beauty of the body with respect ferm as for other motions these three are the principal that of the head that of the hands and feet lastly that of the body those of the head are fourfold forward backward and on each side those of the hands and feet are the same the arms and legs have but one motion to wit one on the elbow the other the knee the arm bending and the leg drawing back on the motions of the body are threefold foreright and on both sides besides these there are yet four other forts of motions proceeding from the same members to wit the simple the active the passive and the violent the simple is when the members move naturally as in walking one foot is set before the other in drinking or eating the hands are lifted up to the mouth the head turns and the other members are made subservient to the present action and to which children as well as aged persons naturally incline the active consists in carrying pulling thrusting pushing climbing and the like which is done by knowledge and judgment this is only in part proper to children see plate viii the passive arises from disquiets of the mind or what the soul shews by the body in the paffions as love hatred anger sorrow joy spite scorn and such like the effect of these though mostly inward yet is seen from without the body chiefsy in the small members as the eyes nose mouth fingers and toes see plate ix the violent proceeding from fright fear despair rage or any thing that is unusual and sudden and perturbates nature either by hearing or seeing such such as sudden thunder spectre or frightful sight these cause shrinking stretching and winding of the members to both which young and old are sub- ject see plate but all these paffions together can not produce perfect figure without the assistance of the members because we can go up stairs with hands in poekets or lift weight with both hands and yet the legs may be close person can be affrighted by something standing or lying before him without shewing it in the face we can also be in love and it shall not appear in our motion but my principal intention is to express these passions by the motion of the members and to stiew how each member contributes towards them as when the body turns or winds the members stir one advancing another falling back one raised others sinking but since it is very rare to see all these motions and paffions as happening very seldom and unawares and since no model can be so set as to give them did for certainty stand for them all expressing every one even to the lesser members eyes mouth nose fingers and toes and these were nimbly and dextroussy as you see designed by my son chap ix of passionate and violent motions- ought to observe in the first place that the greatest part of these motions are but in part to be apprehended and mostly by representing the cause of their motion by the relation which they have to each other whether in their beginnings or conclusions for the end of one oftentimes begins another as anger is step to madnefs sorrow to faint-heartedness and this produces despair or folly this is the effect of most of the violent troubles of the mind and pains of the body for this sinart stirs the members violently the muscles swell the sinews nerves stretch out of measure nay sometimes beyond their power as for instance in burning wounding and the like which pains though they produce particular contractions in the face and other members yet they would not be plainly known or distinguished if something of their causes did not at the same time appear as pyramus stabbed with sword eurydice and hisperia bit by snake procris killed with javelin and the centaur nessus shot with an ar- row hippolytus wounded by the overturning of his chariot and more such by whom we must needs as before hinted represent something of the cause as by pyramus either the veil of thisbe or the naked sword and by eurydice the snake living or dead by procris the weapon gored with blood and thus of any others moreover we ought to shew the wound and haw it happened two cir- cumstances equally necessary the same is also to be observed in nessus who is shot from behind eurydice and hisperia bit in the heel achilles wounded in the same part all which circumstances skilful master ought to dispose properly but lest these hints be not plain enough shall make them so in the follow- ing description representing the death of hisperia hisperia daughter of the river sebrenus being pursued by asacus son of pria- mus is bit in the heel by snake of which wound she died this young and beautiful maid is in the middle lying on the grafs and sur- rounded by some nymphs who mourn her misfortune her father stand- ing dispirited against piece of stone-work and weeping for her death is at- tended by some other river-gods who endeavour to comfort him but in vain her garment is airy and thin and her breast open her gold-coloured head- drefs coming loose over her shoulders her gown turned up which discovers her thigh stained with blood boy lying-near points at the poisoned wound and at the same time pushes away nymph coming by with short stick in her hand shews to the former the fore-ground where the snake lies killed by some boys with sticks and stones thése boys in lively action beat the snake with sticks and thorn-bushies one of them tramples on its neck which makes it gape another affrighted by it seems to run away at which third falls laughing wood is on the right side of the piece in the middle on the third ground are seen some rising willows and other trees of the watry kind behind which runs à river crofs tne piece slowing on the left side forwards wherein float reeds and other watry productions on the banks of this river are some vessels and urns some fallen down others lying partly in the water and one stands upright by the stump of willow some veils reeds and lris-leaves bundled together are scattered up and down several satyrs dryades and other wood and field-gods appear out of the wood some with pine-apples others with torches of the same tree some shrieking out- rageoussy others viewing the snake others the dead body most of them are ornamented with wild plants or oak-leaves about their heads some of them are arrayed with goat-skins others with deer on the left side of the piece in the offskip an high impending rock is seen and level with it in the middle of the piece thetis driving her sea-chariot to- wards the rock in order to save asacus who has thrown himself from its top here we see him flounce into the sea and full of sorrow beating the waves with his wings and heaving his breast towards heaven with his head sunk in his neck seems to complain to the gods of his hard fate some who are curious run in haste to the rock with loud cries and stretched- out arms at which the foremost figures look back pointing at the sea to give them to understand that it is already over with him do not question but he who is somewhat acquainted with fables and history and sees such picture will presently apprehend the whole drift of the story nay idare flatter myself that person not conversant with them will observe the paf- sions in it and the catastrophe though he can not tell who the persons are but to return to the mottons it is certain that all upright figures whether of men or women must for grace-sake poise but on ons leg never on both by which means one hip will always rise the legs ought not to be further apart than the length of foot walking the hip can rise little or nothing the breast ought to bear perpendi- cularly over the leg which supports the body lf the right leg advance the left must draw back by which means the body is pushed forward the right arm or elbow falling back the left arm or hand as also the face must appear foreright the weight of the body of one rumning is intirely supported by the leg which advances the breast projects the head sinks into the neck and the other foot is off the ground person climbing finks his head into his neck and the neck is erect if the left arm rise the right ought to incline contrarily the right leg is climbing and the left hangs down the body bending over the climbing leg without any visible swell of hips those who pusti and pull have different action from each other and are shewn here sufficiently with those who carry wherefore we shall say little of them though this must be observed that no body can carry any great weight in his hands otherwise than on the side where the hip rises nor on the contra- ry pull down any great weight otherwise than with the hand of the side where the hip sinks the head ought to bend over the rising shoulder there are still remaining two sorts of motionof noless importance than the others namely beseeching and steeping yet this last is not confined to the bed at night but occasioned by accidents in the day in old men thro ’ heaviness others by exercise of mind and-body women by domestick labour and youth by their play and though we can not properly call these motions but rather cessation of motion yet thought proper to exhibit them in plate xi wherein no shews slumbering young man with his arms and legs wantonly spread is sleepy woman with her head somewhat inelining to her side but her arms and legs more modestly disposed than those of the young man shews an old sleeping man with his head on his breast his arms close to his body his legs drawn in and body sinking among the besecching no we see figure praying eagerly and incessantly no is praying in the utmost distress and no is humbly imploring the gods for help think these examples sufficient for finding infinite others flowing from the paffions according to occafion and as the matter requires more or less force zeal and pleafure but think not thefe here offered to be drawn in their greatest force or the most expressive no am not so presumptuous but rather like wrestlers who challenge the best masters not to overcome them but to stand the chance who shall be the victor aspire at the prize but not with arrogant thoughts that all must give way to me it were foolisn to think that what have learnt by practice and observation another should not learn nay improvey by his industry one light springs from another and from little one be- comes greater this daily experience shews how many things do we know which were hid from our ancestors whence we may believe that our successors will be more knowing than we as arts and sciences are much improved in lat- ter ages so we may hope for the furtherance in the present polisned age if hercules hercules carried his valour to the fixed columns herculis columae theseus his suc- cessor went far beyond them and yet followed the same path this hope also to shew to the artist wifhing that by my labours or his own industry he may find shorter or more sure way to attain the highest perfection in the noble art of painting chap of the different colouring of the naked in child man and woman in health sickness and after death aving carefully studied this point find that one chapter is too little to comprehend it nevertheless shall here lay down the prin- cipal parts of it hoping to handle the rest in this work as it comes in the way having already treated of two of the fixed beauties of an human figure we shall keeping nature still in our eye proceed to the last of them the different colours of the naked are as manifold as the objects themselves nay almost innumerable but we shall confine ourselves to the three conditiens of an healthy and sick person and dead body applied to child man and woman the child being in health is of rosy colour the man of warm and glowing colour and the woman of fair colour but in sickness the child inclines to yellowish pale the man to dark pale or fallow and the woman to milkish or yellowisn white colour being dead the child is violet the man more grey yet somewhat yellowish and the woman like the child but more beautiful as having the whiter skin the reason of which is that the child having thin skin and being full of blood must appear ruddy the man being more yellow and his skin thicker must appear more grey since the blood can shine less through it and the woman having white and smooth skin must therefore shew herself somewhat ruddy hence it is that child in its tender parts is more violet man more grey and woman blue yet more upon the green than the violet all this is de- monstrable by the colours themselves for mixing blue and red it becomes violet for children blue red and yellow make grey for man and yellowisn white mixed with very little red and blue gives greenefs for woman now in order to strike the right colour for each take these for the child white and vermilion it being pretty ruddy for the man the same with the addition of some yellow oker which makes it more warm and also more fiery for the woman take white little vermilion and some yellow oker and to know perfectly the proper tint of the tenderness of each of these three persons you must in finishing take some smalt or ultramarine alone and with soft fitch scumble your blue over the most tender parts of your figure so that it lie soft and transparent and you will perceive that this tenderness pro- duces in each figure particular and natural colour so much for healthy na- ture that of the sick and dead shall be spoken of afterwards here methinks can scarce understand though nothing more common the per¬ verse opinions of painters about colouring they seck after art but do not understand nature make large enquiries to little purpose and as it were traverse the earth without moving step they talk for ever of this or that master ’ colouring of one they say ay that is beautiful and fressiof another — that is like flessi and blood -- — another says that is very fresh and glowing.— others after having prattled long time and stupified themselves with enquiries give up the cause saying such colour is not in the world can neither find nor imagine it it can not be imitated and more such talk but what sine thoughts are these lf our senses can not apprehend painted nudity what must nature herself be is not the original better than the copy had titian and georgione beautiful co- louring let us follow their manner they chose nature for their pattern with- out imitating other masters because in whatever other respects nature may be deficient in relation to the art she is certain in colouring therefore the life must be the best model and what is not intirely like her though never so flattering is false and of no worth as have described some weaknesses in painters so the following are no less evils they pretend to correct nature though she be in colouring at least not to be corrected incredibly difficult are their fruitless attempts and as difficult their meanings through the neglect of essential methods for doing things rightly and truly another mischief proceeds from tyros themselves these falling upon the life at first setting out can hardly endure to be debarr ’ by their masters but desire such may know that by this hindrance ’ till they can copy well their masters act prudently after this let them proceed to the life since it is certain that they must first get thorough knowledge of the mixtures of the colours without which they will make but poor work of the life besides it is far more easy to imitate an object painted than one neither designed nor coloured the better-meaning artists must therefore not pretend to arrive at fine colouring without consulting nature for the greatest grace lies in its variety viz in rosinels yellowness and blueness as well in old as young principally when each colour is rightly applied and naturally represented but this variety can not be seen in the academy-figure by night but in the day-figure at the drawing schools now for the docible artist ’ sake shall in the next chapter treat of such colours as have made use of in the dead colouring second colouring and finish- ing not with design to confine him to those but to open door to further enqui- ries for oné country uses these another other colours and yet both good if they at last answer the same purpose some again may have been taugnt other colouring but submit all to practice and their own judgments chap xi of the colours and their uses with respect to bath the sexes fair and tender woman is dead-coloured with white and brown red in the second colouring with white and little vermilion for young man the same except that we also mix little light oker with it- in soldier brown red and little white in the dead colour second colour as the others for fallow or sun-burnt peasant white brown red and umber for the dead colour light oker and white for the second for sick person white little vermilion or brown red in the dead colour light oker and white for the second yet but little ruddy the figures being brought thus far retouch or finisn them in this manner brush thinly over your figure some vernish mixed with little light oker then clap on your main lights scumbling them softly and gently into this wet ground as far as is necessary for child mix under the vernisn little vermilion some light oker for man and somewhat less light oker for woman but chiesly observe that the bluissi tenderness must not be mixed or laid on in the two first colourings but on finishing is scumbled in with the main lights and melted into the wet ground of vernisn not with grey or blue mixed with white but with pure and thick-tempered smalt or ultramarine only touched with fitch- pencil as have already intimated thus also the reflexions are to be managed whether they be strong or appa¬ rent or of what colour soever they be of which more in its place the tints of the naked are but three namely the light the mezzo or second tint and the broad shade but except the ruddiness which is also divided into three degrees or parts the three former tints ought to be made and proceed out of one colour in shades as well as lights but reckon not among them either the greatest shades or main lights used in retouching the colour of dead body could by this interposition have no place after those others in such figure use brown oker and white in the dead-colouring which being thinly glazed with lake more or less according to the age and condi¬ tion of the person it represents thereon paint with light oker and white for the se- cond colouring in which have due regard to fingers toes and other sinall parts both of body and face which ought to be grey and violet as in living na- ture those parts appear rosy and blushing if any afk why expresly asfign light oker vermilion or brown red to this or that body and be not content with recommending red and white or yellow and white he must know that there is vast difference between red and red for instance take vermilion and white and brown red and white and observe how much the two mixtures differ in force and beauty thus it is also with the yellow which makes great difference in the colouring of the three nakeds aforesaid and also in their tints but do not absolutely confine myself to those colours name them only as my opinion touching them and that may be the better understood in what say about them has the artist mind in the second colouring to put in the tender tints à let him do it but they will on viewing the painting at some distance appear like spots he will also find more work and trouble because the colours lie too thick whereby he is convinced and obliged to work it over again another tine before end this chapter must propose one familiar question frequently started why many disciples give into worse manner than that of their ma- sters which resolve thus their bad manner is the joint fault both of master and disciple the master ’ chiefly in being sometimes negligent in his instruc- tion for though he understands the grounds he does not teach them his pupils the greatest care he takes is to put them on copying all sorts of pieces as well of old as later masters each handled in particular manner sometimes quite different from his own the disciples on the other side being content with superficial likeness viz this part as red that as yellow blue or green as the original which they themselves must find out by tempering and re-tempering thence it follows that in one part or other they generally fall into extravagancy after they have left their masters is their master ’ an hard manner theirs will be harder was he rough they will be rougher he warm and glowing they fiery did he colour slaring they will exceed him was his manner to paint young and old women alike they will paint both women and men young and old after one manner and make their wives or maid-servants their only models as for painting worse this lies at the disciple ’ door through propensity to some particular parts without regarding the whole one affects draperies another likes nudities another delights in bye-works but such must not take it amiss if compare them to thistles which where they fall stick but master who seeks honour and esteem must not only be acquainted with what have now delivered but many more things if he will be valued for hi- story the universal painting ch ap xii of agreeable and beautiful colouring ince piece cleanly and beautifully coloured must needs be very pleasing as well to the ignorant as the knowing and the contrary ones be displeasing we shall treat of it as matter of great importance but many miss the mark herein some knowingly others against their wills say knowingh in taking fancy to this or that manner whether good or bad and against their wills when they are past recovery and custom is become habitual sometimes it also hap- pens through carelessnefs and fear of doing worse these it is true give good ear but neglect right methods as pure light causes objects to appear clean and beautiful so it must needs be that the more it is broken and sullied by darkness the objects will also be- come darker and less beautiful many great masters have in this very particular been much mistaken as among the flemisn rubens and in holland rembrandt lievens and many others of their followers the one in endeavouring to paint too beautiful is fallen into flaring manner and the other to obtain softnefs got into rotten-ripe manner two extreams which like two dangerous rocks ought to be avoided but prudence observes mean in every thing and skillful master will make judicious use of the colouring in general whether in nudities draperies landscape stone-work or what else have often wondered how some bave tormented themselves in the different colouring of man and woman painting him warm and fiery her tender and fair without reflecting whether such colouring was proper to their con- dition or not nay without making any distinction between deities and men the nobleman and elown which think very filly now whether they intention- ally do it to shew how masterly they can match such colour or whether they are fond of such extravagancies or bid defiance to those who colour the nakeds of men women and children with littie or no difference will not determine but must at least observe that though good colouring in general is very commendable yet what we most shew our judgment in is the giving every object its proper colour according to its nature and quality for the difference among objects on the fore ground onght to be-much greater than those of the second or third grounds because the distance or medium of air between unites every thing less or more as well colours as objects the end of the first book the art of painting book of ordonnance or composition chap of the qualities necessary to the first idea or sketch in order to give the curious artist previous notion of every thing think necessary to the main matter to the end he may duly weigh his qualifications for it say that he ought in the first place to ave good memory to consider well what he is to represent and to retain it in his thoughts and next free and nimble hand to execute instantly on paper what he does conceive lest it slip out of memory again buf these qualities will be of little service unless he observes order in his pro- ceedings the more important the composition the lefs delay because bright thought sometimes comes unawares and is as suddenly lost and though perhaps it may be retrieved yet with meaner circumstances than at first in fine as we take more or less pains about the matter so the loss will be the greater especially to those of weak memories to whom we may apply this emblem man em¬ bracing the smoke of burning pile of wood with both arms with this in- scription —he who embraces too much retains nothing how often do we find that when we betake ourselves to thought we are by some outward cause interrupted and our project spoilt by the confusion of our senses to obviate which it is best to be alone and then having paper pen and ink or crayon and settled the scheme of yope ordonnance as to height and length you must mark out the plan or ground and fix the point of sight whether the design be landscape or for chamber palace grotto or what else after this weigh well your whole design then what sort of persons must enter it and who ought to have the first and most visible place which mark instantly and their bigness not in figures but strokes here on the first ground there on the second according to their characters and merits beginning with the king or prince and next his retinue or other proper persons if there be still another party to be introduced of less moment than these and yet as essential to the or- donnance mark it with points in its proper place without more ado having brought your design thus far you may some time afterwards reas- sume the thoughts of it beginning with the principal figures and now consider by what passions your figures are moved how they ought to stand sit or lie what they are doing whether they sly or run and whether before or against the light how they contrast and how they shall be set off against each other sketch all this on another piece of paper and though in so doing some circumstance may have been omitted yet the consequence can not be great since the lesser like à river flows from the greater without burthen to the memory go to your sketch again at some other time with fresn thoughts and then con- nider what characters must be naked what cloathed what heautiful what common to- gether with the proper colouring and it is agreement and order thus the design is brought to bear and this in my opinion is the surest way to help and eale the memory thus much of ordonnance in general proceed we to treat of each part in particular chap ii of ordonnance wonder at nothing more considering how many histories can be col- lected from facred writ that we see so few of them handled and those so lit- de different in design for in qoo lately published most of them are on sub- jects which have been represented before without any attempts on such as have been left undesigned as if no ordonnance could be made of them it is the same with ovid homer virgil and many others though from them might be gathered matter for above three times as many compositions the cause of all this find after much pains and inquiry to be ignorance and carelessness those two impotent sisters who check the senses and obstruct inquiries an evil to be cured only by diligent exercise we need not doubt but that the ancient painters have picked out the best hi- stories but it is folly to think they therefore despised all the rest it vyere un- happy if the secrets still remaining had before all discovered for then we might bid adieu to all future endeavours but supposing that the best subjects are chosen it falls out nevertheless that those which are slighted are oftentimes the most painter-like and have the strongest passions and at the same time the most ele- gant by-woorks so that we need not despair of sufficient matter to handle but we see in cattle that they will follow one leader and so it is with some painters who think they have done enough when between their compositions and the old ones on the same subject the difference lies in figures sitting instead of standing the action in the open air instead of being within-doors or by some al- teration in the ornaments and by-works but nobler souls soar higher they do not sit down contented with what others have thought but strive to excel in things better and new or at least as good as the others what praise-worthy pieces must those be which are built on other men ’ thoughtsp the original designers taxed with ignorance and little sense because their works are seen thus corrected in actions draperies colours and ornaments bat let such artists continue to torment themselves as long as they please men of sense will always think meanly of them and give the praise to the first inventors great souls are always ambitious-to share equal honours with happier masters for who of the poets would not be equal to homerp of the philosophers to aristotle of the painters to raphael of the statuaries to michael angelo great men have done as great things to acquire name desire of glory has fed the fire of their labours and this has secured them both honours and riches they did not vouchsafe when the day was shut in to spend theix time in company but ardently fired their lamps for night improvements and thus they attained the greatest happiness these things judged preliminary to what follows and therefore we shall proceed to management chap ii of the ordonnance of histories vhe management of history will serve for univerfal conduct throughout this whole work for no one can be said to be good master without perfect knowledge of it ft is so general that it affects every branch of the art as the grouping of figures placing of colours choice of light and shade lay- ing grounds nay even the disposition of each fingle figure but shall never- theless be brief and so proceed when now you have chosen your subject whether in history fiction or em- blem make rough sketch of it and so imperfectly as only to understand your own marks and strokes then read with attention the best and exactest writers of the story in order to conceive it well and fix it in your memory marking immediately what you have read on your next return to this sketch you must principally consider in whaf country in zohat season and what time of the day the action happened and whe- ther within or without doors whether in stately places or common ones and lastly the quality and dignity of the persons concerned thus much for circumstances now mind exactly the essence of the story and then the aceidents proper to it the event of the story must always fill up the chief place in the composition and the beginning of it to be disposed in the offffip as cannon-ball shot from distance batters near bulwark and scatters whatever opposes it by this means the drift of the matter will appear at first view note all these things in your poeket- book that you may remember them and be sure to consult them often for that purpose some day afterwards early in the morning when your head is easy and clear re-consider the whole matter imagine yourself to be the figure which one after ano- ther you are to exhibit and so proceed to the most inferior next extend your thoughts to the places where the action happened this will bring you to apprehend the nature of it and you will quickly perceive all your figures in order and the qualities of each their diftances and proper places mark this in general with strokes only put each principal person ’ name to his figure that you you commit no mistake in them or the disposition ssip out of your memory after this you must mind every other particular figure and lastly consider by what pasfions they are all moved by this method it is certain that we are far advanced in general but little in particulars the design is as yet no more than as if person standing on an emi¬ nence or the top of steeple were viewing in an open country the preparations of great army he sees all neatly divided into troops and regiments here the horse there the foot and there again the general and further off the officers yonder again the carriages for provision and ammunition and so forth now such an one only knows the objects to be there and the place where but having good order and following it he can the more easily represent the rest but he must still go further in considering from what side and in what place all is to be seen and whether the horizon must be low or high place your principal object as much as possible in the midale on rising ground fix your point of sight determine your light whether it must proceed from the left or the right from behind or before and whether the story require sun-shine or common light next dispose the rest of the figures in groups some of tæo or three others of four or five more or less as you think proper but of this we shall say more in parti- cular chapter in the mean time to help those who may not presently apprehend this we shall give an example from off the fore ground say then that you must place your principal figures conspicuous and elevated upon the fore ground give them the main light and greatest force of colouring in one mafs or group the less objects must be somewhat lower and their force of light and colour more spread the second ground ought to be in shade or silled with sady objects and behind them on the third ground which must be light again dispose the objects of smallest consequence observing always that large objects are placed behind small ones and small objects behind large ones as also strong lights against dark shades if vou can- not find it by the snade endeavour to affect it by dark colours as we shall shew more amply in another chapter having got thus far make your sketch anew on another paper wherein design all the medities after the life and the draperies from the layman figure after figure as finished as possible disposing every thing so to the light that neither more or less shade appear than the zhole requires forget not to place your figure and layman agreeable to the point of sight in your sketch now consider the motions and passions which to represent naturally shall here shew proper method standing before looking-glass make with vour oton body such actions and motions as your figures require the passions you must conceive from the history for instance for figure in fright observe how you stand what you are doing with the right hand and where the left is how you turn your head what the left leg is doing and what the right how you bend your body and so forth sketch all this with their circumstances without heeding proportion but the motion of the members only then set your layman to that sketch disposing it so as you shall need it in your ordonnance chusing the moft beauriful side best light arid moft advantageous shades for the purpose if the figure must be clothed clothed cast your draperies as fine as possible according to its character then design it curioussy on blue or drawing-paper but finisn the naked from the life onsy take the same method in other paffions and figures as we shall shew further in the sixth chapter in the mean time begin your general design on the cloth from your last sketch and compleat it after your finished drawings or models as for by-woorks and other proper decorations we shall treat of them in another chapter chap iv of the uses of fine prints academy figures and models in few parts of the art are greater abuses committed than in the use of fine prints and composures of greater masters for many accustom theinselves so much to them as seldom to do any thing which is not borrowed from prints or other men ’ drawings are they to compose an history emblem or fable they bring it together piece-meal and by scraps and searching their whole store of prints drawings and academy-figures take an arm out of one leg out of ano- ther here face there drapery and out of another body in order to make of the whole an ordonnance but to whom does the honour belong has some- body used an ordonnance of poussin is the design that person ’ or poussin ’ this is like duck-eggs hatched by an hen and we are puzzled to know to whom the praise is due but it is certain that if the true owners of such borrowed goods were each to take his own from such painters fear their genuine offspring would be but small it would even fare with them as with erasmus ’ cuman afs who with the lion ’ skin looked terrible but his ears discovering him he was stript of his borrowed clothes and severely bantered by every one but another mischief attending this method of proceeding is that it makes them slight the life nay oftentimes forget it whereby and the neglect of rules they never become good designers the necessary use of prints consist herein that next to what has been said in the preceding chapter and the sketch settled we inform ourselves what great masters have thought and done on the same subject how they chose their objects and with what by-works ornamented this will improve our thoughts the next thing we are to observe is the grace of their action faces lights and fhades and if any thing be for our purpose seck it in the life or if draperies take them from the layman thus we may call the work our own but above all we must make use of academy-figures of our design especially those done in private- no figure must be painted twice in one ordonnance without urgent necessity but the followirg ornaments whether our own or others we may lawfully use such as trees stones tombs fountains urns statues ruins all sorts of architecture and other ornaments as much as we please he who goes further bigots him- self so much to prints and other men ’ thoughts that he thinks himself under necessity to express every thing their way but it is certain our aim in viewing prints prints is twofold first to soothe and please the eye next to enrich our thoughts when we are about composition of our own for then they prove of the greatest advantage to tyro in giving him not only fine thoughts but also pleasant and beautiful manner agreeable postures graceful actions well-cast draperies and what is above all quickness of thought and warmer inclination as is more amply shewn in my drawing-book chap of probability and what is painter-like in an ordonnance of few or many figures drobability as operating on the mind and imagination by the help of sight ought chiesly to be observed in the partition and representation of histories and is next in consideration to the three branches wherein beauty consists of which we have already spoken it ought to appear not only in general but in each single object and we must take care to reject every thing repugnant to it in order to it consider what characters the subject consists of whether of people of fafhiion or ordinary people or of both mixt let this appear in their carriage shape graceful motion and pleasant colouring as being people of education if the figures be rustical let rusticity be visible in them not only in dress but in their behaviour colour and motion and if therein some agreeableness appear let it still savour of rusticity by this means and what follows your thoughts will appear natural and likely to wit by giving more or less beauty to persons of condition and more or less simplicity to meaner persons one may be fhort another may be tall one squab and cor- pulent another thin and slender one somewhat crooked another of brown or pale complexion one of quick another of slow motion nay in three or four figures there ought to be at least one quite unlike the rest might say that hardly any two ought to be alike among six or eight one at least should be hunch-backed and though this may seem to contradict what we have before said touching beauty yet it gainsays it not in reference to condition since an hunch- back wry shoulders distorted hips bigger or less head have as good an agreement with the other members as the most handsome-made if it be afked what would be wanting if the figures were all well-pro- portioned yet some inferior to others in beauty answer that these last but in some measure partake of the agreeableness of the others and one in less degree than another and as it is truth that great people are subject to defor- mity of body as well as little ones so their deformity is not so visible as in meaner persons hence think my opinion not ill grounded that chiefly in resortual com- positions such as plays divine services courts of justice and concourses of all forts of people all foris ofshapes are to be introduced as crooked short tall awry fat and lean and even some lame and crippled as occasion requires but but then they must be so disposed that without offence to the eye they do by comparison infenfibly set off other figures near them which is main proof of the likelihood or probability of an history but to make this point the plainer shall shew the difference between one old person and another aad one young per- son and another each in less or greater degree of beauty and confirm it by examples as for the handling of fables and emblems these being not facts but fictions consisting mostly of virtues and vices require à quite different inanagement for in representing virtue no blemish must appear and in vice no perfection as to deities who ought to be perfect in every respect we shall as occasion offers write more at largé and treat of them thoroughly in select chapter and in the mean time shew here some different handlings of the same thing in persons of different conditions as in plate xii example no shews the different grace in taking hold of glass the one takes it with full fist no takes it lower with some manners no is princess holding cup with the tips of her three fingers drawing warily and agreeably the little singer from it no is lady ’ woman who fearful of spiling holds the glass handily yet less agreeably than the other no prince holds it handily and cautiously below on the foot example ii here you see again the effects of education between people of condition and more common persons very worthy painter ’ notice no shews clownish peasant and how greedy and disorderly he eats out of his porringer he sits and leans with both elbows on the table embracing his disn with both aris lest somebody should take it from him he holds the spoon with his thumb and fingers under the porringer his mouth over the dish and his chin advances to meet the spoon his head is sunk in his shoulders and he bends forwards with his upper parts no sits upright and being better bred holds the porrenger by one ear and the spoon with three fingers by the end of the shank he opens his mouth but little again appears difference in no representing gentlewoman holding the spoon with the tips of three fingers and the hand over the shank in very agreeable manner and in no you see à lady managing spoon with lefs grace than the other this pleasing air is admirably observed by the great raphael and correggio and particularly by barocci as we may see in fine print after one of his paintings where mary is represented with spoon in her hand taking some spoon-meat out of dish held by an angel in order to give it to the child jesvs who half swaddled swaddled stands in her lap this print is in my judgment so adnirable for grace and so natural modest and great that nothing could be better exprest though the two preceding examples might be sufficient to shew all other handlings and the difference of action in particular conditions of persons we shall nevertheless add third example iii shews how attentive the two peasants land listening the one with an high back advances his chin and stares at the speaker as if he would look through him he hugs himself and rests on both legs which with the toes are stradling the knees somewhat bent and the feet turned inwards the other stands streight poising his body mostly on one leg has one hand by his side and with the other takes hold of his garb on his breast the other leg little turned is somewhat more forward and his belly somewhat sticking out his whole car- riage more agreeable than that of the other here again we see reputable gentlewoman of modest gate her carriage lofty and agreeable one hand rests under the breast towards the body the inside ing with attention she with the other hand lifts up part of her garment she stands streight her head turned sideways little forward her knees and feet close and one heel turned towards the inward ancle of the other foot now on corn difference educarion makes in people ’ actions both her hands rest on her hips she stands on both feet without any sway the upper part of her body bends little forwards her breast and chin advance her head somewhat tosfing her mouth little gaping but her hips fwell not in such observations as these consist the very nature and grace of composition be it of many or few figures in reference to persons and therefore can not too much enforce the enquiry into so important point speak here of grand ma- jestic and moft agreeable action for the contrary is naturally and daily to be found in us and though many would be better thought of yet they shew the contrary by daily conversation with mean people whereby they slip the opportunity of get- ting better ideas of genteel carriage contenting themselves with shooting at ran- dom only however they excuse themselves by saying that they have no op- portunity of getting into sine company weak shield to defend their slothl do not the church the playhouse and the park give them handle enough to see fine people and to observe how they behave as for me before had the happiness to which we may sometimes arrive by the smiles of friends missed no oppor- tunity of making observations and noting them in my pocket-book which an history painter ought always to have about him wherever he goes and with good reason for thoughts are often so volatile and slippery as to be retained with difficulty as have before intimated in the first chapter about ordonnance nay when saw an handsome gentlewoman walking in the street imade it my business to enquire into the reason of her grace and in what it consisted and why she appeared more agreeable than others and on the contrary why ofhers are less agreeable by such researches as these we come to the knowledge of what is handsome and ugly as well by the one fort of people as the other but best by studying what is most sublime and grand let me then persuade the artist to this method not as think it the only true one or to dissuade him from any other but as an inlet to so useful knowledge and by which we obtain the finest things which as have said when once lost may perhaps never be retrieved many mistake who think that magnificent garb and rich ornaments as jewels pearls gold and silver stuffs are infallible marks of the greatness and power of people but can the most discerning certainly conclude them to be such by these tokens without enquiring whether their education be equal to their grandeur à even then also they may be deceived since some mean people have naturally or by imitation such an air and carriage that were their dress answerable they would be taken for great ones the reason of which is that at firff sight there appears little difference between false jewels and true though on nice enquiry may be found as in the jewels so in their actions and behaviour such difference as points out their true character again if these different conditions depended only on rich cloaths nothing would be more easy to painter than this difficult part of art since at that rate there could be no fashion or broom-stick might become lady ’ hood never- thelefs there have been and still are painters enough infected with this opinion and follow it as law thinking that david solomon and ahasuerus would not be known for kings did not their crouns shew it these forsooth they must always have wherever they are and as well in the bed-chamber as on the throne and the sceptre as well at the table as at the head of an army say nothing yet touching their royal robes he who duly weighs what have been saying must allow that state and car- riage are two such excellent qualifications that picture can not be said to be good without them nay think them the very soul of good picture but as noble soul in well-shaped body without the addition of ornaments visibly shews it- self so of course such are needless in expressing true greatness indeed when ornamenis are introduced with judgment and caution tney add to the splendor of picture but nothing to character nor can cause any paffions as we see in raphael poussin dominichino and barocci who far from approving it have by the very simplicity of their figures snewn the extraordinary greatness have been speaking of if any object that raphael himself has not observed this conduct in his story of bathstieba where he represents david in window with crown on his head or where abraham courts his sarah in sun-shiny weather which afar off is seen by abimelech leaning on bullustrade as for the first composition must say if may speak my mind that do not over-like it or indeed apprehend it but rather believe it to have fared as some faulty things did with me which being done in my apprenticeship am still under some concern for but by the intro- duction of the sun-shine his thoughts may possibly be finer than they appear at first view because had not the sun shone on that amorous couple abimelech could- not at his distance from them have seen their courtship and if he had re- presented presented them in any other cornef of the room than that where they were they could not have been sitting however since great masters have their failingg it is probable that raphael ’ bible-prints were sooner or later either designed or painted by his best disciples viz julio romano gio francesco penni or pierino del vaga from his sketches and afterwards retouched by himself since it is im- possible that one master could dispatch so much work in so short time though he had quick pencil besides his custom was to keep his works long by him for the sake of improvements and to give the last hand and the utmost per- fection to them but as for this bible if it be observed with attention there will be found great difference between one ordonnance and another though in some the greatness and likelihood are well preserved but to conclude the matter of this chapter must say that my precepts ought not only to be observed in an ordonnance of many but of few figures also since it is very difficult to bring them all into one story but if the subject be coartly as of solomon ahasueras or such-like it must be known that the persons to whom majesty and grace are most proper ought to exceed in it viz the king among his oourtiers the queen among her ladies governour among citizens and thus the greater above the less according to his quality office or dignity this causes propêr distinction of superiority and exalts the prime person above the rest even peasants who are à little conversant with the towns and know somewhat of good manners are observed to surpass others worse-carriaged than they in their discourses holiday-mirths and church-ceremonies but clownisnness must appear in them though with respect to the paffions some may appear to excel others except that if burgomaster or topping citizen be mingled amongst them he must appear superior to them all by his handsome carriage and city- behaviour chap vi of the difference between youth and age in both sexes the artist ought not only to mind nicely the actions but also the difference of the persons who are to compose his ordonnance and he must have great regard both to iniversal and particular differences as well in the sexes as their ages chifdren alter commonly every three years and ’ till they are six years of age have always short necks and round fingers the difference between boys and girls is visible in their outward parts without opening their legs as testa does in the small members the difference is not very visible though girls are some- what thinner have smaller ears and longer heads their arms are likewise more round next and above the wrist and their thighs thicker than those of boys but the upper part of boys arms is thinner and smaller those of francesco quesnoy are incomparably fine to paint after nay nobody has attained his perfection we see his often represented either without hair or but very little whether he thought it more beautiful or it was his choice in making models can not determine yet methinks boys may very well sometimes be allowed hair and that frequently curled girls may have theirs twisted and wound on their heads with slying locks serving not only for ornament but distinction of sexes boys of five or six years old may have hair finely curled girls more thick and displayed another difference in the sexes may be this that girls hair is more soft and long boys more curled and short children of five six or more years old ought seldom to be represented with close mouths their upper eye-lids are generally hid under their swelling brows they have commonly quick look young damsels have vigilant and lively look raised forehead nose à little hollowed small but almast half open mouth round lips and small chin in which as in the cheeks is à small dimple they have no under chin. virgins we see seldom open-mouthed their eyes are more sedate and composed than the others old women ought to have more set and heavy look and hollow eyes their upper eye-lids large and loose yet little open the under lids visibly swelling nostrils somewhat contracted mouth close and fallen in and when they are very old and without teeth their under lip comes over the upper they also have risings under the cheeks on each side of the mouth long but little crooked nose suits them but in men more crooked one is proper people in authority become grave look forehead somewhat raised and large heavy eye-lids and those half open their aspect settled and calm their faces turned little sideways the nose alike with the forehead and eyes mouth shut and double chin it is necessary to take particular notice of the different make and form of persons so far as they are described in history in order to express the better the nature of the matter as alexander and hephestion in the tent of darius wherein hephestion ought be taller than alexander in saul and david the former tall and the latter less and ruddy and thus of any other circumstance of history we should here have brought in some examples of physiognomy but as there is lately published on that subject sine treatise written by mr. le brun and translated by de kaarsgieter we think it not necessary to say any thing about it but refer to the book since it is of service not only to painters statuaries and en- gravers but also to poets historians and others in the observations about taking and holding any thing have taken notice that infanis are very fickle and harmleis in it and because their members are very feeble and commonly ply any way they act as if half lame their hands are al- ways squab and therefore most open zoung girls are wanton in their taking and holding as in the manner of goltzius virgins and stayed women are modest and mannerly in their taking and holding as have shewed before but aged people have stiff'and dry hands for which reason they are most times shut and they can not extend their fingers although different accidents cause an altération in 'the face and posture those al- terations are neverthelefs very unlike each gther therefore each ought to be handled in distinct manner chiesly when any particular passion moves us to tlris or that action whereby the features and lineaments of the face are doubled by the said unlikeness suppose for instance that all faces were cast in one mould and each governed by particular passion as forrow gladness hatred envy anger madness hence it is certain that they will be very unlike and different as well the actions of the body and if now you give each particular make and lincament this will augment their difference this observation is of great use to face and history-painters and the contrary as useful when nature and circumstances induce us to make teoo or three to be like each other in one composition namely company of figures all of one family who therefore may well take after one person in likeness as the sons of jacob the horatii and curacii for thus we evince the truth of the story again in handling the fable where the daughters of cecrops open the basket in which was erichtonius here we are obliged to make their faces alike to shew that they are sisters for otherwise who would know them to be so though re- presented alike beautiful and it would be afked how the affinity appears see- ing it is not enough to say they are sisters or that pallas is jupiter ’ daughter or the long-bearded asculapius the son of young -spollo but if you give these three sisters one and the same aspect yet to each distinct passion they will then differ very much for instance let the youngest who opens the basket with surprize start back as if she were saying -- -good god what is thisp the second full of fear runs away calling out-— dear sister save me from this monster and the third being elder and more rlayed stepping back with amazement says — what this is à monster tiisrproceed three different motions from one aspect or like- nefs for though the resemblance is somewhat altered yet the same proportions and features still remain the case is the same between parents and their children for instance if the the father have crooked nose or that of casar the child will in some de- gree have nose somewhat longisn and rising has the mother long and streight nose the daughter will have the same except that in tender youth it is less or more bending as in old age it is thicker and broader but little different in length as experience shews we see in the twelve heads of the roman emperors their natures -and inclina- tions well expressed and agreeable to the histories of their lives yet doubt whether they all agree with the true aspects of those emperors or whether the cotemporary masters who were well-skilled in physiognomy have not thus al- tered them according to their natures rather to represent their innate faculties than their outward appearances it is adfnirable to consider how our senses are surprized when all the particular aspects are- well observed according to the passions wohich they represent methinks we thereby discover mens inmost secrets that this person sings high tune- that low one that one bellows with pain another inwardly laughing the teeth of one chatter with cold another parched with heat and thirst thus small line can let you into whole countenance less or more fatness also much alter face but but for the artist ’ benefit think proper to shew him way of finding out all sorts of aspects after certain and easy manner let him take looking-glass and draw himself by it in such paffion as he desires as joyful sorrowful spiteful and imagining himself to be the figure he wants to represent draw this nicely with red of other chalk on drawing-paper ob- serving nicely the knitting of the brows look of the eyes swell of the cheeks contraction of the nostrils closeness or openness of the mouth jutt of the upper or under jaw-bone according to his position whether streight or bending then let him take plaister-face and make mould from it of lead or other hard matter in order to make afterwards as many impreffions of clay as he pleases these let him alter to the before-mentioned drawing either with his fingers or modelling sticks as he thinks proper taking away something here and adding something there but still preserving the general likeness thus they will serve instead of the life chiefly when the face on which the mould was made comes to be like the drawing that by the aforesaid alterations the artist can also see how much the features likewise alter thus all sorts of pasfions may be moulded with little trouble and the moulds used in as many different manners as he pleases whether they are to be viewed from below or above or in profile he who is provided with store of such models will find great help from them since we can not be furnished with them froin life itself nor from our own persons otherwise than in single and fronting position in looking-glafs as for knowing how to make them few days and little instruction will teach us as much as is necessary if we can draw well zalf to these the artist add mould for child and woman the set will be thermôre compleat ’ re we conclude this chapter it is necessary to say something of the disposition of both sexes in fketch of capital ordonnance as in concourse of all sorts of people at an offering play where we see that those of sex get toge- ther and youth to youth age to age men to men and women to women but young women out of curiosity are observed to crowd under the people and though notwithstanding they join themselves to their sex yet they are afraid of mishap and therefore for protection ’ sake often take children in their arms but man of judgment will nevertheless distinguisn these maids from others by their breasts head-attire or drefs though attended with three or four children it is improper to let children of three or four years old run into crowds without mother brother or elder fister to guard or hold them by their hands in places of publick pleadings firm and high places should always be assigned to women as against stone-work walls and the like because their bashfulness makes them timorous and their reputations ought to make them covet rather old mens than young mens company to guard them from the insolence of the mob soldiers or others who on such occasioûs intrude any where tolraimmage rob or play tricks the vulgar commonly press close to the pleading place light women are mostly found in the middle of the croud and people of falnion stand behind chap vii of the property and choice in the motion of the members in order to express the passions previous to the matter of this chapter ishall insist on an observation which in my judgment is worth the artist ’ notice as being for his ad- vantage as well as his diversion it is in asfigning the reason why many make so little progress in their studies now imagine it to proceed from their incon- stancy and lukewarm affection which tie up their hands unless necessity drive was so lucky as to do it or -- — it fell out them to work they often say -as if the business depended on fate not on mathema- better than expected -— ticks but it is quite otherwise with those who pusn on with zeal and good-will and confider earnestly and sedately not accidentally what they are about these are not satisfied with having painted picture well and being as well paid for it but reflect how much they are furthered in the art by it and consider if they were to do the same again what alteration and improvement they could make in it since it is certain that though we improve by practice yet by shorter ways we can attain perfect knowledge and in less time too our own faults make also deeper impression on us when discovered by ourselves than if observedby others because we naturally hate reproof nothing affected me more than when found my errors or more rejoiced me than when had corrected them which nevertheless did not fully satisfy me for endeavoured still to make what was good better about twenty-four years ago had mind to paint in little the story of stratonica ’ paying antiochus visit took abundance of pains in it and it was extremely liked some years after an opportunity offered of my doing the same thing again but six times larger idid not think it proper to govern myself by my former thoughts though much ap- proved but diligently consulted the best writers on the subject rejecting the trivial ones and then proceeded as carefully to finish my work which got me more reputation than the former because executed with more simplicity and less pompous circumstances it representing only king seleuchus stratonica antiochus and the phyfician whereas in the other had introdueed train of courtiers about them and in fine every thing could think of to make it look pompous and gaudy thus out of single flower we may by care and industry produce doublé one as was the case of another picture of scipio and the young bride which is in the appartment of the states of holland at the hague this-picture was of my first thoughts but handling the same subject second time this latter as better composed got the preference though done but two years after the other which submit to any one ’ judgment who compares them now if any one afk the reason of this great difference and in so little time too answer that having perceived my ignorance and errors in the first composition doubled my pains informed myself better made nicer reflections and spared no trouble in order to exceed myself if possible in the second performance this circumstance also attended my first alexander and roxana for that which painted afterwards and is at the late major witzen ’ house in amsterdam is of thus ithink have sufficiently shewn by my own example the great differ- ence between sitting down contented with what we know and do seeking further improvements nothing delights more than to find-what we seek and to im- prove daily in order to which ishall give the artist the following examples example plate xiii of mutual or reciprocal love two children are seen to exchange lighted torches which each gives with the left and receives with the right hand thereby signifving that what is given with good-will ought to be received and requited with thankfulness the right hand denoting mutual kindness or help and tuition decency teaches that the giver should hold what he gives at the upper end and the receiver to take it underneath or in the middle the giver offers it with an arm stretched out contrarily the receiver takes it bassifully with his arm close to the body both incline the upper parts of their bodies their heads lifted up and inclining over the side of their gift in friendly manner and mouths open giving the torches cross-wise to each other they are in all circumstances alike in beauty shape motion and aspect except differ- ence in their mouths with respect to the priority of intreaty the giver holds his torch with three fingers the other accepts it with full hand now after each has recived his gift they may be supposed to exchange right hands and their shoulders to meet their left ears crossing each other that is their heads come cross-wise over their left shoulders and if you please each kisses the other ’ left cheek their right feet advancing come close to each other example ii of voluntary submission here we see coward surrendering his sword to another he holds it by the blade close to the hilt the other receives and takes it close at the hilt as these actions are twofold so are both the paffions the one shews his pusilanimity the other his courage the giver stoops his head very low with eyes cast down at the other ’ feet he stands on both legs alike bent as if he were fainting away the left hand open he is putting forth or pressing thie outside side of the hand against his breast as if he were saying there ’ all have my life is at your merey the other contrarily stands set and upright his foot advancing his left hand on his side and turning hindwards has stern look his mouth shut his under lip and chin standing somewhat out looks with scorn somewhat over his shoulder on the giver example iii in plate xiv of liberality this reputable man who in passing by is giving an handful of money to poor one holds out his right hand sideways inside downwards beholding the poor man with calm and set look he stands upright and with swelling belly is stepping forward the receiver on the other hand makes up to the giver bowing his body stretching out both arms as far as possible with his two hands hollowed like bowl-dish looks on the gist with joy eyes staring open mouth as if he were faying hol example iv of benevolence he who prefents an apple to any one holds it from ’ underneath with three fingers as friendly intreating pressing his left hand inside upwards close to his breast his breast and chin advaacing his head bending somewhat over onc shoulder the other contrarily receives it with respect taking it on the top with four fingers advancing the upper part of his body and somewhat bowing his head he discovers modest gladnefs looking on the gift in the mean time the other is watching his eyes example plate xv.. of the same he who offers his friend fine flower holds it with three fingers at the lower end of the stalk the other takes it with the thumb and fore finger next the flower with-his head over it in order to smell the giver as having sinelt it draws back his head over one shoulder from it his face lifted up eyes somewhat shut but one-more than the other his mouth half open his left hand close to his shoulder he holds wide open as in surprise he rests on one leg advancing with the other the receiver contrarily is standing on both legs closed with his left hand behind him the giver stands firm the receiver wavering examplevi of- fidelip or friendsfip the person who is presenting à ring to virgin as token of fidelity or friend- ship holes it upright with his thumb within it and the stone upwards he advances his body and face and looks direct clapping his left hand to his breast the virgin on the-other hand stands or sits strait up her breast some- what heaving close to the ring her head somewhat bending and swaying to her right shoulder her left arm hangs down the hand open receiving the ring with three fingers of her right hand the giver looks not at her eyes but her mouth speaking with look between hope and fear she with modest and serene countenance looks down on the ring rests on one leg her feet close the giver advances with his left leg his knee bent and rests on his right toes these three last examples exhibit but half-way since the disposition of their lower parts may be easily understood as the gifts in all the examples are different so the sentiments are often very various as well in giving as receiving whether it be done in sincerity out of hypocrisy or for the sake of decency the motions in either case differ very little because in them all the parties endeavour to act with as much dexterity as possiblé nay sometimes so far that thinking to impose impose on each other both are frequently deceived in such case we must take appearance for truth and the contrary but such representations would not answer right purpose as having false mean- ings for instead of dissimulation or decency we should take it for pure love since in all three as say the motion is the same therefore to remove all doubt and uncertainty we must have recourse to emblematic figures which will clear the meaning and point out hypocrisy falshood deceit by proper images beasts or hieroglyphic figures which by-works prudent artist ought so to dispose that though inactive or mysterious they may yet answer their purpose for they who are deceived or missed should not perceive the least tittle of it some may think that the deceived as well as deceiver ought to be set off with such emblems but this is superfluous for as both parties seem to profesa sinceritv nothing but hypoerisy must be shewn ovid tells us that mercury having ftolen some oxen and perceiving that one batius saw it and fearful of being betrayed desired him to keep it secret which battas faithfully promised however in order to try him mercury disguised him- self and little after came to him in the shape of the owner of the cattle and afked him whether he could not give tidings of them batius pointed to the cave wherein they were hid which incensed the godly thief so much that reassuming his form he beat the traitor and turned him into touchstone nowit is very probable that in the disguise mercury hid his winged cap and feet and caduceus that he might not be known the same we find related of jupiter and calisto when he in the shape of diana deceived her but here the matter would not be known did not some tokens make it evident that it was jupiter and not diana though he appeared like her the case of such picture is the same with theatrical representation where every thing is exhibited as if it really happened the characters deceive and belye one another secretly without knowing it but the spectators perceive all nay their very thoughts ought plainly to be seen and heard chap viii of the ifue or result of thoughts touching histories there are grounds and principles in all arts and sciences whereon we must build and we can not without exactly keeping to themi either execute or gain true knowledge of things so they ought chiesly to be observed in the art of painting and especially in the ordonnance and since the memory can not furnisn out story with all its cireumstances in such due order as regular sketch re- quires we must establisn certain rules in order to supply that defect since though person should be so happy as to have strong memory and brisk conceptions yet the hands are not so quick at execution no the thoughts exceed them some things also must necessarily go befcre others follow which implies and requires time could we but draw as faft as think memory would be useless whercas it is cer- tain we can design nothing but the ideas which memory first conveys to the senses however let no one imagine by what say that master must first sketch what he first thinks and run through tlie design as things occur to his thoughts for conceptions never observe order and therefore by such irregularity the per- formance would be abortive as in the following inftance suppose represen- tation of cain and abel and the fratricide the first thing that offers is cain fly- ing from god ’ wrath next is abel lying dead next the burnt-offering on the altar and lastly the weapon lying by it now the last being furthest in your thoughts it is first scratched down with your pen then the altar appears after- swards abel then cain and then the almighty and at last the landscape which to determine the bigness of the composition judge now what such con- fused method of designing must produce it is therefore matter of indifference how you begin design for the principal figure must be first considered and then the iecidents asgold is separated frem the earth and cleared by refining we ought then to proceed orderly in the designing making first the plan next the stone- work and then the figures or by-works however we handle this subject in the chapters of ordonnance of histories hieroglyphic figures where we maintain that the principal ought to be placed first then the figures of less consequence and lastly the by-works.. but what intend now is to shew fhort and certain method of commodi¬ oussy apprehending and retaining things whether they be given in writing or by word of mouth prolix or brief together with their circumstances be they many er few that youmay sxetch them exactiy in all their particulars perfectly agreeable to the relation as well iin mation colour drefs and probility as by- works of singular use to those of short memories but who are nevertheless skilled in the expressinn of action the paffions and their effects uses of colours and draperies according to sex and age laying of colours against proper grounds difference of countries sun-shine and ordinary light and more such having considered well of the subject and where the action happened first make plan or ground- next determine where to place the principal figures or objects whether in ’ the middle or on the right or left side afterwards dispose the circumstantial figures concerned in the matter whether one two or more what else occurs must fall in of course after this to each figure join its mark of distinction to shew what it is as whether king philosopher bacchus or river-god the king must have his ministers courtiers and guards the philosopher must be attended by learned men or his disciples bacches must have satyrs and bacchanals about him the river-god has his nymphs and naiades the king excels by his royal robes croumn and scepter the philosopher is be known by long and grave vestment cap on his head books rolis of vellum and other implements of study about him bacchus is adorned with vine-sprigs crowned with grapes and armed with thyrsis the water-gods are set off with urns flags reeds and crowned with water- flowers all which badges are naturally proper though not described in the story nay if they were you need not heed them since their characters remind us of them when we are handling them as if we were reading about the goddess of hunting every one knows that she has à retinue and is equipt with accoutrements for sport and that the charming venus is attended with her graces this may suf- fice for personal character as for motions aking is commanding philosopher contemplating bacchus rambling and the river-god in his station when the king commands all is in hurry iand metion to execute his will his re- tinue are obsequious to his words and nods when the philosopher is exercising himself he is either reasoning writing or contemplating when bacchus is on his ramble the menades bacchanals and satyrs madly attend his chariot shrieking and howling and with tabors pipes timbrels cymbals the river-god in his station either rests on an urn or pot shedding water or is sitting among his nymphs on the bank of à river thus each character is occupied according to its nature and so we deduce one circumstance from another without seeking it or being at à stand having such fund of matter in our heads that onthe bare imention of person we must con- clude that such and fuch properties tare effential to him- the next businefs is the effects of the paffions when the general moves the whole army is in motion when the king threatens the accused is in fear and the ministers and others remain in suspence when the philosopher discourses the audience is attentive and each person moved in proportion to his apprehen- fion or attention one has his finger on his mouth or forehead another is reckoning by his fingers another scratches his head another leaning on his elbow covers his face with his hand when bacchus speaks the noise ceases when the water-gods are taking repose every one is husn fitting or ly- ing promiscuousty at ease if these examples be not sufficient to establisn my purpose shall add one or two more and the rather because no one before me has handled this subject so methodically nay may say hardly touched on it we read in scripture that queen efther over-awed by the frowns of king ahasu- erus swooned away that belthazzar peroeiving the hand-writing on the wall was with his whole court troubled in mind again in ovid ’ metamorphofis ariade in despair on the fhore was comforted and made easy by the acceptable presence of bacchus who offered her his aid from all which and the like cir- cumstances we are enabled to conclude with certainty that single paffion handled handled according to the manner before laid down can alone furnish matter enough to enrich whole ordonnance without the aid of other by-works since many things and circumstances do proceed from that one passion onsy for let us suppose two persons passing by each other as in zlate xvi and one seen in front the other in rear he who walks on the left side and is going off has bundle on his right shoulder from which something drops behind him -- he has boy and dog with him the other coming forwards and perceiving what falls calls to tell him of it whereupon he looks back and the boy runs to take it up now refer to any one ’ judgment whether my thoughts by fo simple relation be not presently conceived since it is all the story fancy they are but yet still better if keeping within the bounds of the relation were to make fketch of it for though the bare description of the thing easily makes an impreffion on the senses yet he who is not conversant with the fine motions and beauties of action which consist mostly in the contrasting of the members can never hit the writer ’ meaning place then the man calling out foreright and the other man past by him looking back and hearkening to what he says in these postures both look over the left shoulder now if any one afk whether he who is paffing on could not as well turn to the right as the left in looking back and the other do the same say no unless we will run counter to nature for suppose that he who is approaching has stick in his right hand and with his left points to the cloth which is dropt and the other having the bundle on his right shoul- der his left hand rests on his side by which also the child holds him now because each other ’ left side meets and onc sees the cloth dropt at his left his kindnefs compels him speedily to call over thé same fhoulder to the other man who plainly hearing turns to the side of him who calls whereupon they behold each other the boy being nimble runs quickly to the cloth and the dog out- strips him in getting to it first from all which premifes is implied natural mo- tion and turning of the members without our saying the upper part of the body fronting the left or right leg thus or thus—lf we know the place of standing towards whom and what they have to say the rest must follow of course such reveries as these give us right judgment of picture make us retain it and help to remove difficulties and if ’ to this be added some certain strokes to point out either the place or actions of figures it would be more easy and helpful to the memory know painter who made each letter or mark have its particular significa- tion for instance anl was figure sitting on the ground christ cruci- fied and so forth moreover he had another secret whereby he expressed cer- tain figures he made use of as decumbent figure of caracci running one of raphael flying one of berettini da cortona child of quesnoy light and shade of la fage and many others if now the preceding example of the two men- passing each- other should seem insufficient will subjoin one other of the same nature but fact imean the story of judah and tamar see plate xvii when coming from his country- dwelling he is in the way accosted by her in the habit of an harlot put the case case thus judah comes forward and the road lying on the left side of his house along which some of his servants are going off in order to sheer sheep tamar sits on the right side of the road on the grass airily and wantonly attired and with veil over her head now it is probable that having lewd design she first accosted judah who like man of repute past her but when she lifted up her veil and beckoned to him he stopt to hear what she had to say there- upon suppose he stood still resting on one foot and advancing the other to make an halt to see who calls him he turns to the left opening his left hand like one in surprize and then claps it to his breast to shew that he is struck there and lastly takes hold of his beard as pondering what he is going to do in the mean time she rises and lays hold of his garment the servants are seen either in profile or backwards as the road turns and winds to the house having scissars or sheers with them the house may lie as the road shews it though according to ordonnance the middle suits it better than side this is sufficient for understanding the meaning of this story and the right method for handling great work by fhort introduction if any one suppose that if the road were to lie crofs the piece and the whole disposition altered so as to make the man go from right to left and not place the woman on either side it would be all the same since then she would still be on his left side say no for she calling him we should then of both theirbo- dies see but one of their faces and what were such paffionless statue good for again we could not shew his principal motions which are very essential to the fact wherefore the other way is best but let no one deceive himself by my manner of relating this history for consulting the scriptures he will find that have inverted the sense to subject shewing how to give two persons distinct passions and thereby to embellisn picture for by the scriptures it will appear that judah is going to the place whence make him come in order to send tamar lamb or goat to redeem his pledge leave it to any one ’ judgment whether it can not be plainly inferred what motions these two figures must have to make thereout three distinct and pro- bable reprefentations which thus deduce first in the man ’ person an unexpected rencounter secondly an enquiry who she is and what she wants lastly criminal paffion first he is grave afking and understanding what the matter is or at least imagining it he wisnes it may be true then begins to make love at last being fully persuaded he gives loose to his paffion grows bold and venturesome- these three periods produce peculiar paffions in both different from each other the first grave and modest the sccond kind and loving and the third wanton and bold the woman contrarily is moved by three paffions first she is friendly and lovely secondly wanton with dissembling stand off lastly they both agree first she accosts him with an enticing air overcoming his gravity secondly secondly he approaching addresses her in friendly manner but altering her speech she answers him roughly and will not be touched lastly he being transported with passion at which sne secretly laughs sne pushies him coyly from her on one side and lays hold of him on the other from all which premises we may find three positions springing only from the words which we suppose must naturally pass between them perhaps some may say — know nothing of such effects since they never hap- -but it is certain there are very few who never felt them and even they can sometimes account for them better than others who have known them many know the virtues of medicines and poisons without tasting them arguing with judgment improves the performance otherwise art would be im- practicable or at least attainable by few if it consisted in inquiry only for who run mad and could afterwards tell how the frenzy seized himp the truth is we can only guess at it but this last story is proposed by me for no other reason than to make it plain and evident how the members are moved by the impulse of the senses and the intercourse of talk and how by such motions we express our inward thoughts there are many such occurrences in authors chiefly in ovid as jupiter and calisto salmacis and hermaphroditus phabus and leucothae mercurius and aglaura jupiter and semele vertumnus and pomona venus and adonis apollo and daphne befides some others in history as appelles and campaspe alexander and roxana scipio and the young bride tarquinius and lucretia antiochus and stratonica and in scripture david and abigail hagar with the angel christ and magdalen in the garden christ and the samaritan woman at the well marys annunciation the visit ef mary and elizabeth and many others all which ought to be treated in the same manner according to the nature of what they are doing as at each word exchanged cvhat motions throughout the body muft follow and what lineaments of the face how the car- natiens must change either to red or pate more or less fierce and so forth by means we may design any thing and come to perfection the shortest and surest way chap ix remarks on some mistakes in historical compositions will not be amiss as caution to others to censure some mistakes of masters in historical compositions in order to shew of what great consequence it is to represent plainly the true nature and state of things that we may improve and not meet with rebuke instead of glory man of good sense may freely exercise his thoughts as he sees good but many think they merit much by following the letter of ftory though at the same time they overlook above half its probability which fre- quently happens when they are got into esteem and have name but alas what rich man would not be thought such what valiant man do cowardly action or wise man commit folly only through wilful carelessness truly it seems unnatural and think that nobody of but moderate sense would strive to excel in this or that art without being tickled with the desire of fame either in his life-time or after death and although some instances may contradict this vet yet you must observe that am speaking here of pare virtue for he who built the remple of diana and he who fired it though instigated by one defire to leave lasting name behind him have been as different in praise as action from whence infer that no artist can be void of inclination for praise and honour which other- wise he must not expect and if so would blast his credit by an imprudent act raphael in his adam and eve has represented him receiving the apple of her and resting on withered stump and that smoothly fevered as with an ax or saw which is double mistake and if done wilfully not to be excused for how is it likely that tree which has hardly received life and placed so near the tree of life should so soon be withered this must be an oversight like that of cain who kills his brother abel with sharp pick-ax and in another piece eve has distaff what improbability and impertinence is this for when eve has spun her flax whence must the weaver come and who make the scissars to cut it but perhaps these were not raphael ’ riper thoughts but rather those of his youth wherein the greatest wits sometimes mistake charles vermander thotgh writer poet and good philosopher has mistook as much in his confusion of babel for the tower and scaffolding are represented un- finifhed in the middle of the piece divine wrath with slames wavering over it moreover are seen the children of lsrael marched off in tribes and here and there distinguished by troops they with their peculiar standards sit or lie all about not like people confounded by diverfity of speech and straying confusion but as met together from all quarters only to form congrefs for there we see egyptians persians arabians moors asiatics americans europeans turks nay scoissers all in their modern habits surely we need not afk them whither they are going because the love for our own country prevails above all things and there- fore every man is returning to the region whence he took his character manners and habit what this painter ’ meaning was know not but in my opinion it is true confusion can not omit another piece of rowland savry representing paradise wherein elephants rhinoceroses crocodiles bears wolves unicorns ostriches eagles which must intirely lay it waste now appeal to any man whether such stance of eating an apple which might as well have been done by an ape squirrel or other small creature which makes it look rather like deer-park than garden of pleafure had more people been created than adam and eve the cherubim need not have guarded the entrance to keep the savage creatures out fince they were already entered but rather to keep them in in order to save the rest of the earth from incommodity have seen more such compositions but to avoid tediousness shall not mention them here it is sufficient by few examples of great masters to know how easy it is to commit mistakes through ignorance or want of heed in the first of the aforesaid examples would shew how it fares with those who amuse themselves more with small part than the whole of story and with an arm or leg which no ways concerns the matter without being in any pain for forcing nature or turning the sense of the second example shall fay nothing here since it may be guessed what mean by the iron of the pick-axe of the third that some men seck five legs on sheep as we say whereby instead of clearing they make the matter more obscure and intricate as for the fourth some make no difference between an stalian floor and green field if they can but have an opportunity of shewing their wit introducing every thing whether congruous or not as to savry ’ piece my thoughts are that all beasts are created by god but not in the same manner with man and that each clime produced its proper species of animals which came from thence to adam to give them name ac- cording to their natures which was no sooner done but they returned to the countries they came from some to the east others to the south according to their natural inclination to this or that climate so that the garden wherein the spirit of god dwelt was only for adam and his consort in it they lived happily and besides them no irrational creatures except such as could delight their eyes and ears moreover it is my opinion that this garden could not harbour any un- cleanness putrefaction or noxious creatures wherefore my composition is this these two naked persons place as principals in the middle of the piece on small rising close to fine tufted apple-tree of larger size than ordinary and of sound-body adam ’ sits with eve in his arms who half in his lap directs the apple to his mouth he with his face towards her with staring eye and raised brow looks surprized and seems to put the offer away with his hand to the acceptance of which she with lovely and enticing air seeks to persuade him at the same time with her other hand behind him she is receiving another apple which the serpent hanging on bough réaches out toher behind her is peacock with its tail spread and cat pawing her besides fine hound who looking back is going away introduce also cocks and hens and other tame creatures proper to the region for embellisning the landscape plant there all sorts of trees except the cypress to gratify the sight and palate small birds are slying about to please garden on the right side of the piece shew the entrance into the place and on the sides two square pillars of green leaves beset with melons pumpkins and the like besides long and high green wall running up to the horizon and uniting with the offskip the horizon is level along the green wall are seen orange and lemon-trees intermixed with date-trees the whole piece is en- lightened with an agreeable sunshine to this composition shall add another of the flight of adam and eve was formerly of opinion that when this pair received their doom and were driven out of paradise and both subjected to the same fate the beasts must fly with them having learnt to know their own natures wherefore intended to make my ordonnance accordingly to wit the two naked and afhamed persons dying from the fiery sword which threatens them and for embellishment great great confusion of beasts each attacking the enemy of its kind as the eruel wolf setting on the innocent sheep the sharp-sighted eagle on the timorous hare and so forth but as by this violence the main action would intirely lose its force and fall into perverted sense desisted ’ till had better informed myself of the matter especially seeing no beast stayed in the garden but each returned to his country thought again how can this be like the slight of adam out of eden looks more naturally like two condemned malefactors driven into forest to be devoured of wild beasts which their fear and friglitful looks make more pro- ble and therefore afterwards contrived it thus in adam ’ dlight the labouring ox accompanies him to help him in tilling the ground the scaly serpent moves before turning and winding on her belly by the ox are the long-bearded he and wanton she-goat the woolly sheep the crested cocks and hens and other such like creatures for sustenance as also the faithful dog and pawing cat and such other tame animals as are proper in an hieroglyphio sense after these follow noxious creatures as rats mice no sunshine appears but all is gloomy and the wind blows hard whereby the trees shake and their leaves drop all is waste and wild as if winter were at hand the rugged and dry ground parted by the heat makes here and there ups and down the water in the fens being dried up the frogs gape for breath the sun being quite hid the moon or north-star appears such were my thoughts of this story will end this chapter by sketching third composition of my own for the studious cattle painter benefit being the story of orpheus ’ death lay the scene in desolate place yet filled with men beasts trees hills rocks water-falls and brooks full of fish and what can be more proper to the matter all being in disorder ovid relates that this ingenious poet and singer son of apollo and of the muse calliape did with the charms of his harp bewitch this crowd but it lasted not long for the mad bacchanals enraged because he despised them stew him casting his head and harp into the river hebrus called by the grecks marjsias as the poet says now we see the unhappy body of this excellent musician thrown from small hill at the foot of tree which moved by so sad catastrophe bends it boughs with sorrow endeavouring to cover the body with its shade next we behold the insulting mad and intoxicated women girt with skins mocking run away after having flupg the head into the river run- on one side ayoung girl who flings in his harp is likewise driven by the same phrensy behold now guzzler who though so much in liquor as to want support yet must vent her spleen by kicking the body and flinging drinking- pot at it which makes her seem to tumble backwards here lie broken thyrses potshreds bruised grapes and vine-branches scattered round the body in great disorder the long-lived stag makes to the cover the dreadful lion and spotted tyger grimly pafs each other each creature seeks and attacks its enenay the hurtful mouse till now sitting quietly by the party-coloured cat hangs in her mouth mouth the greedy wolf seizes the sheep by its throat the faithful hen escapes the thievisst fox who near fallen fir-tree catches the lascivious dove the hills and rocks retire clashing against each other whereby they tumble here we see an huge stone there flying tree nay the water itself seems to flow back- wards the frogs and other marshy creatures afraid of being devoured by the vulture and other birds of prey dive under water but yet the white stork flies with one of them in his bill the cautious hare running from the swift dog stops short whereby the dog goes over him and the hare to make her escape takes side course the black raven and solitary owl chatter in the tree at one another beholding the murthered body which they desire to eat and by it lies the faithful dog howling regardless of any thing else the piece has no agreeable sun-shine but the air is stormy and full of driving clouds foreboding tempest the prin- cipal of the composition is shady and slung off by light lointain which is almost in the middle thus enquire into the genuine state and nature of things like an huntsman who tracing the course of deer finds at last his cover not that do it for curi- ofity ’ sake as philosopher but because these and no other means can help me and as long as keep this path hope never to err or commit the before- mentioned faults especially seeing nothing argues stupidity more than untimely fimplicity whereas critical inquiry is the key of nature ’ treafure and of her deepest secrets being not unlike what the wittv greeks have feigned of minerva whom they exhibit with abox and key and-dispensing the sciences to men ac- cording to their abilities ufed formerly to imitate the unthinking in not lessening or augmenting the sacred stories but adhering to the letter of the scriptures without more ado and without making any distinction between heavenly and earthly things between soul and body or in short between something and nothing lknow that as to our eternal happiness nothing is wanting to compleat it but many things with respect to art must therefore remain in ignorance or dull simplicity in the scriptures they say all is written that is to the purpose but then how came the beasts into the garden of eden where gets cain an iron pick axe and eve distaff or the babylonians their particular dresses since no mention is made of such circumstances but when you read that the king went to visit such and such persons that doés not imply that he went alone as when vou find that haman was carried to the gallows somebody must attend him besides the execui- tioner josaua in slaying many thousands didit not alone without the help of his army as for me my opinion is that in true histories either sacred or pro- fane no improbable or impossible things ought to enter into the composition nor any thing left dubious but that every thing tend to the clearing up and better understanding tiem in their full sense and force chap of richness and probability in history by the courage and curiosity of sea-faring men many remote countries nay new world have been discovered so in painting when artists spare neither trouble nor pains they will likewise but with less danger discover new world in the art full of variety to please the eye we want not new homer virgil or ovid and their inventions the present have left us materials enough to work on for thousand years and that not suf- ficient for the execution of tenth part of their thoughts and if we do not mend our pace ten thousand years will be too little the reason is that we con- tent ourselves with patching up old houses with new materials and vet they are old houses if some parts decay the worst are repaired and the rest rather left unfinished than the whole improved but leaving similes we will use other means though uncustomary to forward us in the art curiosity is repesented with wings to shew its eagerness to attain things unkrown to her let us not then stop in barely inquiring into old things but enrich them with new thoughts as an example let us open ovid and seehis fable of deucalion set down in his first book of metamorphosis deucalion was king of thessaly who with his confort pyrrha were the only persons remaining alive of the human race after the flood these were enjoined by the oracle of the god themis to cast the stones of the earth over their shoulders whereby human race was propagated and the world re-peopled well-grounded thought leads the way to many others even so it happens here in this poet ’ fable laid down as truth nay so agreeable to the truth of the flood and noah ’ preservation that there is little difference between the truth and the fable for what is in the one is also contained in the other and the circumstances of the flood are the same in both the matter lies now in probable expresfion of the damage which the earth suffered by so total an inunda- tion and to execute it sketch-wise as conceive it ordonnanee of deuccalion and pyrrha after the flood suppose these two aged persons walking on level ground the man ’ head co- vered with corner of his garment and the woman ’ with veil knotted behind with his left hand he holds his garment full of stones her lap is empty cupid conducts them by the flaps of their garments with one hand having also lighted torch in it and holds them fast that in turning or winding they may not hurt or go before one another the stones which they have flung behind them all the way as they walked represent human forms perfected in proportion as they are first flung and furthest from them the man walks upright with his right she is rightly so called as proceeding according to hesiod from calum the heaven and vesta the earth who appointed her to preside over righteousnesi and by jupiter she was stiled the mother of civil sciences right arm lifted up and hand open as having just flung stone which is seen skimming little above the ground the woman represent somewhat stooping in her walk receiving the stones from cipid which each time sne casts away and he walking along takes up before her deucalion ’ garment is à sullied purple her drefs old and dark and her gown violet cupid is adorned with red dia- dem the grafs full of mud and sand lies flat little from these figures is themis ’ temple built on an eminence and supported by columns or close wall quite over-grown and full of mofs this temple is surrounded with sine and blooming trees and near behind it is seen the two-headed mount paffing by the point of sight and encompafsed with water on the left side in the offfkip represent the ocean fufl of tritons and nereides fwimming about the mount to this hill fasten an anchor the rope whereof is tied to the boat which being left by the water remains hanging keel- upwards these are the principal of my conceptions as for the lesser circumstanées fhall not limit them here fuch as the dispersing of the rainy clouds by the east wind re-appearance of the covered hills and rocks discovery of buiidings da- maged by the water pieces of wrecks statues sea-monsters bones of men and beasts ornaments and other remains appearing here and there out of the mud plashies and infinite other things removed by the force of the waves from one part of the earth to another and washied from east to west all which leave to- the artist ’ discretion but now it may be afked why introduce cupid who in naso ’ description is not mentioned and give this reason that he being the eldest of the gods and according to heftod brought forth of chaos and the earth by him consequently all things are produced according to the poets therefore it is probable that in this second creation he can be spared no less than in the first love was also the principal nay the only paffion which these people preserved to each other after their great misfortue and which they cheriffied by their simplicity and up- rightness again though they were aged and near their ends yet they were studying means to escape death and to render their race immortal and who of the gods can contribute more to it than cupid must not japiter himself own his sovereignty therefore though the poet inakes mention but of two persons yet reason permits nay would have us bring this god into their company especi- ally fince painters have the liberty to add new niatter and more figures for orna- ment-sake when they are not repugnant to nature and likelihood for which horace gives them full commission in his lyrie song on poetry -pictoribus atque poëtis quidlibet qudendi semper fuit æqua potestas thus paraphrased by mr. dryden poets and painters free fron servilé gide may trear their subjects and their obyects drate add then freely when the writcr is silent one or more figures to your work not to gain mastery or to excel but-to make the matter more plain and evident which in fables is very necessary though in histories it must be done emblematically only after having entertained you with my conceptions of this story give me leave to exhibit representation of the same subject handled by another painter not to shew the oddness but the superfluity impropriety and ill-bestowed time and the ignorance of presuming pedants especially since contrary arguments frequently produce truth and thereby shew the validity of rule which is levelled at ab- surdities this painter ’ friends paying him visit he put his piece on the easel and thus entertained them behold gentlemenl here is proof of my judgment and art call nei- ther the leaened nor the virtuosi to unfold its meaning no an ignorant pea¬ sant can tell it you at once there is the world after the deluge as natural as if it were alive but no wonder for the ark is plainly discovered on the top of mount parnassus here you see the wonders of the heavens shut up and the fountains of the earth stopped with cork there the sea runs high in valley and full of all sorts of wood-work as tables chairs benches paper-mills and what not besides some dcad bodies as well of women as men one of them has leather-apron another crown on his head and another night-cap this gentlemen concerns only what is carried away by the water but there on the land lies camel next him silver salver and by it dead nightingale in cage here again you see the grave of mabomet and about it some scattered rolls of virginia tobacco and before an that hillock some cards and egg shells but had almost forgot the cardinal ’ cap which lies there and assure you was painted with carmine as alsp aefcorpion as natural as if it were alive there on the third ground is ’ à gallows and under it three thieves with the halters still about their necks yonder is child in his go¬ cart half buried in the sand and there sea-calf entangled in the boughs of thicket besides some pickled herrings moreover you see there imush- pot with some pencils and crayons as also mass-priest in his surplice nay even the great turkiss horse tail behold all the toys blown out of nuremberg toy-shop scattered here and there there by the old lantern lies drum with its head turned to jelly by the water isay nothing yet of that iron chest in which are kept the records of the imperial chamber of judicature at spire nor of an hundred other things besides houses and monasteries nay the vatican it- self for all is turned into ruins and rubbisn no living creature is to be seen but deucalion and pyrrha and their three sons and their wives all done to the life now who will not take this to be flood and believe that all happened in this manner look there myself am sitting on thé fore ground on an hillock and-modelling every thing after the life and there is my name and the date having said this he stood much surprised to see they did not extol his fancy and approve it since he thought it so well executed for my part think that no one before him ever represented such out-of-the-way thoughts many indeed have have now and then erred but being made sensible of it they have rectified their mistakes whereas this whole composition was but one mistake scripture jumbled with fable moses with ovid antiquity with novelty cardinal ’ cap vatican cards things found out thousand years after with antiquity what is all this but chaos of folly methinks such an artist is like common chymists who to extract gold fling any thing into the crucible that will melt drudging night and day and wasting their substance to find at last in the bottom of the devouring crucible nothing but little scum of can not tell what an unknown nothing without colour or weight when good chymist will get the true knowledge of metals and their natures in order to obtain the precious gold by art and labour even so ought painter also to obtain the knowledge of objects and their natures times properties and uses or else the substance of his art will evaporate have often observed that superstuity instead of rendering thing more forcible and conspicuous has lessened and obscured it and that too large ground thinly filled has no better effect we must therefore avoid this scylla and charibdis as two dangerous rocks can not compare such proceedings better than to excessive and melancholy temper or the other from lively and too fertile an-one or that some men are superstitious imitators of other men ’ works as we see daily in one the greatnefs of carracci in another the fine colouring of titian in this the graceful simplicity of raphael and in that the natural expression of guido this method is indeed what some men are prone to but let us consider the difference between modelling in clay and cutting in marble to return to our subject about the floods let us make comparison between them and raphael ’ in order to form judgment raphael makes noah and his family the principal characters in his composition we do the same by deucalion and his zoife and the other contrarily exhibits them very dubioussy and too much out of sight in the offskip in raphael ’ nothing is seen of what is laid waste by the water or dead bodies beasts in ours so much is visible that the cause and the effects plainly appear and in the other so great super- fluity abounds as if the whole world were contained in the single picture in raphael ’ is seen noah ’ going forth of the ark in ours deucalion and pyrrha are of the waters is scarce perceived wherefore in medio securo that is secure we tread when neither foot is seen too high or low but in the golden mean let us therefore ponder and weigh thoroughly what we are about in such an important composition and then proceed to work as quick as possible chap xi of the ordonnance of hierogylphic figures having before said cursorily that an excest of fuch figures often obscures their meaning nay renders them unintelligible think it proper to treat of this subject here since they are of such frequent ufe and service not only in handling fables histories and emblems but in carving statues and bas-reliefs for great men and their palaces caesar ripa ’ treatise of lconology is questionless an excellent and useful book for all persons whose art has any relation to painting but although it treat copiously of hieroglyphics manners paffions zeal virtues vices yet something is still required to the right use of that book according to the occaston and dif- ference of the subject which by that great writer is not laid down since it is without dispute that each figure must express no other passion than its ocen but when they are used for by-works or ornament to illustrate some principal real character they must then subserve the ends for which they are introduced for in- stance in fight victory should attend the conqueror honour or fame an excellent man love or cupid an amorous man the vindictive revenge the hypocrite falshood the cancrous man envy the innocent innocence and such like omit others as anger madness sorrow modesty boldness autho- rity charity temperance cruelty pain because these have no share in some acts nor come into play except they are used alone and without the com- pany of living persons as the elements against each other virtues against vices and so forth it is therefore of the greatest consequence for painter statuary poet or orator to know these things thoroughly and keep them in memory which practice will make easy remember that when was under my father ’ instructions and studying de- sign my gusto was for emblems which collected from his and other masters works and then made intire compositions of them which though trifling be- cause of my youth and inexperience yet surprised many who advised my father to let me pursue that kind of study but whether he thought me too young or that rather inclined to history he diverted me from it as much as possible especially since it drew other masters disciples to see my odd productions which he much disliked but when my eldest brother brought me out of ltaly caesar ripa ’ book aforesaid which hitherto we were strangers to or else was locked up as secret then my flame for emblematic learning broke out again by the help of this book produced many and strange designs which for their fingu- larity were accounted as prodigies ’ or dreams by some out of spite against me others through ignorance however my proficiency was such that it yielded me an annual profit because the jesuits scholars yearly bespoke of me the embel- lishing of above of their positions or thefei with emblems histories or fables in water-colours judge now whether these my studies tended not to my advan- tage and improvement and what honour was shewed me in preferring me to the employ before my cotemporaries and fellow-disciples and what little sxill they must must have in hieroglyphical learning though doubtless then made many mistakes but leaving digreffions let us return to our subject and illustrate it in the story of dido ’ death which we fhall handle two different ways natural emblematical in the first manner we reprefent the queen in despair and past hopes on pilè of wood and after sacrifice stabbing herself when lris cuts off the fatal hair her sister attends the solemnity in tears and lamentation all is in confusion and every one affected with sorrow in greater or less degree -- thus far virgil in the second manner we shew how despair accompanied by rage is dragging love to the grave with this inscription -dido ’ death and so designed it for the frontispiece of monfieur pel ’ tragedy on that subject now it is easy to see why in the former manner neither rage nor despair nor love attend the princess and in the latter why neither princess by-standers altar nor pile of wood are introduced since in the first manner no aid is wanting because each figure fufficiently acts its own part and shews every thing which its paffion naturally leads it to wherefore it would be redundant nav obscure the story to double all the several motions with the same passions and senses by these figures whence it is that they can have no place but where the subject is purely emblematic and emblematic figures the principal characters as in the sccond manner they must come into play because each figure then expresses its natural quality in order to clear and illustrate the sense of the story without the addition of any body else in this manner apelles contrived his piece on his being accused by antiphilus wherein he reprefents innocence pursued by rage vice lies and slander and dragged by them before an ignorant judge thus many things are couched under single allegory but when any particular person man or woman and their cha- racters shapes countenances are burlesqued in this manner then such design may be called pasquil it is without dispute that every man has but one predominant passion at time which moves and governs him wherefore prudent generous and valiant man when he is doing prudent act may be accompanied by generosity and valour but not with prudence because that quality appears in his act again if in an attack he perform valorous action such must appear in his person and pradence and generosity only must accompany him if he shew his generosity as in re- storing captives without ransom prudence and valour are sufficient to attend him with- out the addition of generofify the case of famous master is the same for he being possessed of several good qualities as judgment assiduity quick concep- tions if he be represented employed at his easel those characters may all illus- trate him except affiduity which shews itself by his motion and posture if philosopher do foolisn thing all other good qualiries should ornament him except folsy because he is committing it such observations as these are worthy of notice and without them an emblem cannor be good this part of the art is very liable to censure but yet few understand it because the facts being always couched under uncommon appearances are se- crets crets to the vulgar without explanation nevertheless they should be so handled that people of judgment at least may know their meanings and the artist not be reproved remember to have seen picture of bacchus and ariadne wherein observed mistake in placing sorrow and despair about the princess the latter was seen flying from her which in my opinion was right and proper in the master but our dis- pute was whether the figure of sorrow had any business there he justified it by very plausible reasons saying that although by the presence of the compas- fionate god her sorrow was at an end yet it abated not suddenly because she was to give him relation of her disaster and then to wait for favourable an- swer and so long forrow must be with her have says he represented her with sorrowful look and tears in her eyes pointing towards the sea at the per- fidious theseus the occasion of her forrow bacchus is attentive whose upper gar- ment is opened by cupid and because ariadne knew not whom she had with her man or god love discovered his godhead and made her sensible of his power this picce was in my judgment fine yet think sorroze should have been left out of the composition because according to our position no paffion can act in t places at once for though the princeis ’ countenance sufficiently shew- ed it yet as being overcome it is taking its flight have seen more such mistakes but it is no wonder for we are not born wise in the use of hieroglyphic figures for expressing the passions consider in an es- pecial manner whether those paffions work internally or externally mean whe- ther the action or motion of the body also shiew sufficiently it predominant paffion fora good-natured sedate man needs no auxiliary action to shew he is such because his countenance does it effectually but when we desire to make known love and sorrow which are internal affections of the soul these must be expressed by means of hieroglyphic figures and yet if the body be disturbed and moved by those paffions the acting passion may be clearly perceived without hieroglyphics notwithstanding the necessity of this knowledge in all who have any relation to painting yet many young statuaries imagine that being generally con- cerned in carving single figures only it does not affect them but they mis- take for suppose they should be required to set off figure with emblems whether on pedestal or in niche in bafs or whole relief in order to bla- zon the qualities and virtues of the person it represents they would be at stand and the rather as we see painters exhibit most of their emblematic figures in stone-work in order to make an history clear now the statuary not able to trust in his own strength relies on the painter ’ aid to design him such and such thoughts which he sets his model and so proceeds to work after having fufficiently spoken how figure ought by its form to ex- prefs the paffions we are led to say somewhat touching the order or succession of ils action for though in story the one oftentimes proceed from the others and revert and fall back again yet especial care must be taken that they be not expressed and shewn all at the same instant of time but that each wait for its proper turn and season as if gentleman should order his servant to- beat any one three motions arise from hence which can not be performed at once because the order must precede the hearing and performance be the consequence again it is pre- posterous that prince should stand in commanding posture at the same time time as his fervants are executing his commands it would be as unnatural to frame the story of the uoman catched in adultery in this manner christ is writing in the dust while the people are sneaking away discontented and afhamed and which is still worse some provided with bafkets of stones either waiting on the second ground for the issue or departing out of the temple though our saviour parable poussin possessed this conduct in high degree as may be seen in his picture of this story when general is spiriting his army each soldier observes filence and attention while the harangue is making in my juvenile years painted the story of progne where in revenge of her desloured sister philomela sne is shewing and casting at tereus the head of his son whose body is almost eaten up by him at which pursuing her in rage she was metamorphosed into bird represented those outrageous women shewing him the severed head at which the king transported with fury rises from his seat with drawn sword the table is overturned and the drinking vessels dishes and other table-furniture lie broken to pieces about the floor and the wine spilt at their feet and yet made the women keep their standing holding the bead to re-consider this story it is natural to think that in the beginning the tyrant fat quietly at the table ignorant of what was doing afterwards the women entered the room shewing him the child ’ head cut off attended with speeches proper to the occasion which put him first out of countenance and then piercing his heart he furiously arose froin table and overturned it and drawing his sword in order to pursue them he pushed down every thing in his way notwithstanding all which rage and disturbance the women remain in the same posture and station as when they came in you may easily perceive my oversight and improper handling this story it is true indeed that all the diffe- rent motions were sudden and quickly successive yet she kept the head too long in her hand to throw it on the table after it was overturned in all likelihoods at the end of her speech she must have thrown down the head and taken to flight as soon as tereus made the least offer for rising and then must follow her nietamorphosis and she be off the ground iiconceive therefore that the table ought ought to have been still standing and sne after the head was thrown up into to be flying and to snew her inhumanity with sword or chopping-knife in one hand and menacing with the other but pafs on to shew my cooler thoughts in another example being the fable of apollo and the dragon python this ordonnance exhibits wild prospect on the right side on the second ground in low morass is seen the frightful monster python said to be engen- dered of the vapours and exhalations of the earth lying half in and half out of the plasn laden with arrows some people standing on near hill are viewing him stopping their noses because of the stench on the left side where the ground rises higher round temple appears and the statue of apollo with vari- ous conditions of men worshipping sacrificing rejoicing skipping and dancing about the morass or plashi stand some withered trees pieces of ruins and scat- tered bones of devoured men and beasts behind the aforesaid rising in the off- skip are seen cottages the near ones ruined those more distant from the monster less damaged on the fore ground the insulting archer is seen leaning on his bow and with his quiver at his back empty he stands daring and haughtily on his left leg tossing his head backwards towards his right side and the light and with his left hand extended and scornful smile he is putting by capid who with his scarf flying behind soars aloft from him and with anger in his looks nods his head shewing him an arrow with the point upwards as if he were saying -— .tou shall soon feel this point behind phabus or apollo stands large palm-tree and by it an oak against the trunk of which he sets his back his head is adorned with oak and other leaves forwards ought to re- prefent brook wherein he is partly seen by the reflexion of the water his dress is golden coat of armour and purple garment hanging down behind him second ordonnance touching apollo and dapene no sooner had apollo cast his eyes on daphne but he fell in love with- her his eager passion made him pursue her in order to make her sensible of it here- upon cupid after having touched daphne ’ heart with cool arrow pierced apollo ’ with an hot one daphne insensible of what is doing is talking with some water-nymphs who lie with their pots on the bank of clear stream she stands in the sun in fronting pofition with her quiver hanging at her naked back she beholds the nymphs with down and lovely look over her left side her left hip rises her left hand is airily under her breast with the palm out- wards in her right hand she holds her bow above the middle which somewhat supports her opening her elbow from her whereby the hollow of her body on that side is filled up her garment is girt short under her breast being fastened with ribbon on her left shoulder and with button at knee the side slappets are tucked under girdie coming over her hip the ends hanging down from her head-ornament buttoned up her light treffes hang down on both sides with lovely flow over the shoulders behind her along the water-fide which after partly running towards the point of sight alters its course is standing white marblé marble oblong stone three or four feet high adorned with bas-reliefs against which stone her ground-shade falls on it lies water-nymph on her left side fore-shortened she is resting on her elbow and with the left hand under her cheeks is looking at daphne the nymph ’ lower parts are covered with blue scart which sets off the naked upper parts of daphne daphne ’ garment is apple¬ bloffom colour little darker than the naked with violet reflexions along the water-side stand willows for repose of the nymphs on the brink of the river to the left is rocky mountain full of risings from bottom to top between which the foamy water runs and descends on the right side apollo is seen be- tween the point of sight and where the ground rises high with rude steps coming full of amazement sideways from it he stoops forward his left hand resting on crook or ftaff his right foot lowly put forth just touching the ground with his toes his breast almost meets his left knee hij right elbow is drawn back his open hand is up at his ear his face in profile and his eyes staring at daphne fiery arrow enters his breast his garment is of coarse light-grey stuff two ends of which button under his chin and the others from under his arms tuckt in his girdle before where also sticks shepherd ’ flute on his head blue cap turned up before and wrinkled on top his breast somewhat inclines to the light and his right thigh is seen in full length the light proceeds from the right the hill on that side is upright like wall the steps parallel or fronting on the left the hill makes rugged slope and every-where over-run with va- riety of wild shrubs and herbs it sfills up almost the right side of the picture run- ning up high by the point of sight projecting over the way which is very low it gives ground-shade there which takes half the way to the stone be¬ hind daphne and beyond it is another ground-shade running between some high trees behind the hill the offfkip on the left side discovers fine fabric be- ing the palace of king admetus near which some cattle are grazing in the field cupid is slying towards the hill looking back at apollo if it be afked how we shall know this to be apollo answer by his beauti- ful air and golden locks his lovely aspect and the devoir with which he is viewing the nymph and by the arrow with which the flying cupid has pierced him besides do not know that ovid ’ metamorphoses affords any such re- presentation of shepherd thus enamoured with nymph for it must be observed that apollo was at that time expelled heaven and bereft of his godlv ornaments the purple garment sun-rays management of the chariot of the sun the lyre and the like and got his living by feeding cattle for king -admetus represent daphne ’ conversation among the naiades think not improperly since the river-god peneus was her father whom leave out of the story because his paternal authority would not suffer her to entertain such kind looks for he disliked her manner of living and would have her marry which sne disap- proved wherefore to shew her aversion for men have introduced none but virgins have also not given to apello crown of oak-leaves because improper to shepherd but blue woollen cap dress better suiting that condition since now he is no more phabus but apollo this story is rarely handled generally overlooked by painters third ordonnance relating to apollo and daphne here apollo is pursuing the object of his love running and at the same time intreating her her countenance discovers fear and seeing him so near her she endeavours to shun him stopping short and taking another way she fears neither thorn-bushes nor rugged ways but runs swiftly over all he pursues but not with iutention to seize her because he has one hand on his breast and with the other he casts away his staff skimming over the ground behind him his blue cap is blown off his head towards the way whence he came his head is flung back and sidling to demonstrate that he is intreating her and she is looking back at him his aspect fiery his eyes flaming but to no purpose for she con- trarily though tired and sweaty is pale and wan her face dry eye-brows- knit mouth raised in the middle with the corners downwards like an half-moon to shew her pain fhe lifts her extended arms towards heaven quite exceeding the poize of her body the quiver at her back is flying back and the arrows scattered along the way she holds her unbent bow in her chilled left hand apollo in the pursuit has catched flap of her garment as her feet take root her body is to- wards him buut her face towards heaven struggling with approaching death her eager lover as yet insensible of this thinking she is now in his power hopes for victory but here mean not to shew her standing still but to run further by striving to disengage her rooted feet and toes which she imagines are only retarded by apollo wherefore she flings her head back discovering her fears by loud shrieks at which moment her metamorphosis begins it is not improper to shew long and winding way by which they come and in the offskip the nymphs by the white marble-stone looking after her one of them shades her eyes from the sun with her hand others are wondering others mutually em- bracing behind them are seen the mounts- gtheren and helicon rearing their heads to the clouds and behind daphne between some trees is terme of mer- cury if then in being otherwise that of diana her mistress her dress is as be- foie apollo and danhne ’ course is against the sun sne is seen backwards her right leg forward and the left lifted high seems.- to turn to the right to take that way he contrarily somewhat stooping with his left leg forward and his right behind just off the ground is turning to the left tracing her steps like an hound coursing an hare which stopping short takes new way sequel of apollo and daphne ’ story daphne unable to run further at last remains fixed to the earth often striving to unroot her feet but in vain rough bark now covers her legs and half her thighs and deadly chill congeals her blood her fluttering soul seems to be leaving her sighing for the last time she stands on the left fide of the point of fight on the fore ground the upper part of her body arms and head are still intire her quiver in disorder recedes little from the point of sight to the left the under part of her body fronts the light her right hip rises her legs twining unite below just under the knees into single stem her breast standing out is fronting her head turned to the left droops over her left breast her eyes are half closed her mouth almost shut discovering still some faint signs of pain her cheeks are pale but her lips violet her head is full of branches and so filled with leaves sprouting out on all sides that they shade the face and half her bosom before her little to the left large oak rises which she embraces with her left arm against which her head is leaning her dress is as before apollo now at the end of his hopes bursts into lamentations moaning her hard fate but chiefly his own hot inclinations the cause of both he stands on her right side with his right leg on the second ground his foot hid by the hollow of the way and his left leg on the first ground with the foot close to the stem his head little backward leaning to the right side and his face towards heaven he extends his right arm with the palm of the hand outwards as far as he can reach feeling under her left breast to see whether her heart still beat or not- his right hand is off from him quite open the slap of his garment loose on the left side hangs down behind on the right side from behind the ground water-god comes running with wonder above whom appears atropos or fate with her distaff and scissars she is seen from behind and fore-shortened soaring high towards the right side of the picture the sky abounds with driving clouds the mount parnasus appears off on the right side as also the river running be- hind it towards the point of sight on the bank of which river some beasts are drinking halfway up the mount is seen small round temple of the goddess themis before the frontispiece of which stand an oak and lmden-tree and in the lointain almost on the horizon the town and royal castle of admems the rest is field in the middle of which shepherd is sitting on the grafs and another standing by him who points at the castle at which the other is looking with wonder cupid talking with atropos is flying along with her behind the oak should be seen part of the before-mentioned term the conchesion ef apollo and daphne ’ stery when apollo had finished his prophecy daphne gave nod as token of her assent to it but while he is gazing at her mouth he fees her no more the troe alone on which her bow and

eye as picture viewed its full lustre but in all things there is an use and abuse and so it happens in painting the use lies in handling of noble and edifying subjects as fine histories and emblems moral and spiritual in virtuous and decent manner so as at once to delight and instruct thus the art gains its lustre the abuse appears in treating obscene and vicious subjects which disquiet the mind and put modesty to the blush he who follows this method can never expect the reward of virtue which horace says is an immortal name but rather eternal infamy we shall consider the matter in both respects when historians treat an history they seldom pafs over any circumstance though ever so indecent nay though it be intirely evil poets do the same in their fictions but in worse degree because flattering tale easily ruffles often misseads the mind of reader in fine it were to be wishied that when such liberties are taken which should never be without absolute necessity naked truth were either veiled or cast into shade in order to prevent unlawful desires but if discourse can thus captivate the heart how much more must the eye be attracted by painting since the sight affects the senses in greater degree painting the good man noah wallowing obscenely in liquor and would it be less crime than cham ’ mocking him he did it only to his brothers who turning away their faces covered their father with their garments in order to hide his nakedness whereas the painter exposes him to all the world it is as indecent to shew poriphar ’ wife naked on the bed in an unseemly posture inti- cing joseph though it was private fact and not attended with the worst cir- cumstances nor is michael angelo buonaroti more to be commended in exhibit- ing his leda stark naked with the swan between her legs circumstance cer- tainly tainly that he might have omitted is it not to be lamented that since there is such fund of matter forfine designs virtues as well as vices whence we may them so barefaced and circumstantially that they want nothing but smell as horace intimates nam frustrâ vitium vitaveris illud si te alio pravum detorseris but leaving this unlawful subject as unworthy of an artist let us proceed to shew the tokens of good picture writing printed is more intelligible than the scrawl of an indifferent pen- man and so it is with picture if the story be well exprest and each object anseer its character with respect to the story time and occafion leaving naked or cloathing the figures which ought to be so such an ordonnance may justly be called speaking picture but it is otherwise with paintings governed by whim and void of like- lihood the former picture explains itself at first view and the latter is dark riddle in need of unfolding is it not sufficient to fhew diana with moon on her head venus with her star and flora with her chaplet of flowers for we should also shew their distinguisn- ing qualities and characters still regarding their head-ornaments and when they must be decked and when not doubtless in every country except among sa- vages are to be found good laws and manners and three principal times for dressing especially among the women whose attire morning and night is plain and loose but at noon set out it is no wonder that among the crowd of excellent masters few make true de- corum maxim in their works since their opinions are so various and governed either by their degree of sxill or inclination one thinks it lies in the harmo- ny or conjunction of lights and shades another in the composition of colours and those altogether broken third in chusing the colours as beautiful as possi- but let them ble another in great force another in airy reflections fancy what they please none of these parts will alone constitute becoming picture how fimple soever much less compleat ordonnance of figures land¬ scape architecture flowers cattle for instance of what worth is com- pofition of figures where all the postures and airs are alike of landscape where in the boscage we see no difference or variety in the bodies of trees leafing or colouring in architecture the same but how decorous must cattlc- piece be when we seë the qualities of the animals well expressed some smooth others rough hairy or woolly true decorum then proceeds from conjunction of all the particulars above-mentioned and great force of light snade and re- flexion and an harmony of colours as well beautiful as broken and the whole managed according to rule and agreeing with nature if we will weigh these things we shall soon perceive that the fault is often our own and that it is in our power to arrive at perfection if-we want not ambition to excel and do not undertake things above our capacities ultra vires nihil ag¬ many many excellent masters have mistaken the mark ars longa vita brevis say many but it is poor pretence for an artist if it be true that you endeavour to gain this decorum alter your particular inclination as soon as possible be as careful in the least as the greatest circumstances of your picture reason diligently with yourself at vacant times for though scarce any one is to be found alike skilful in all the branches yet it is not impossible to be so in short if it is not in your power to bestow extraordinary time to advantage be at least so prudent as not to bring any thing into your compositions which you can not justify chap xiv of particular inclination for one branch whether figures landscapes buildings seas flowers iligence and proper talent in conjunction with prudence may gain priches sudden wealth is not so stable as that got by degrees the former is the effect of desire and luck the latter of prudence think that master resolves best who considers in the course of his study of any branch whether his fortune and well-being depend on one particular person or on the body of the people whether it be not more advisable to accommodate himself to the occafions and tempers of the people than to confine himselfto his particular inclination lastly how his studies may be sometimes enriched with variety of new matter he is say prudent artist who weighing these premises betimes as quickly puts them in execution especially since the world is best pleased with variety and novelty which spur them to love inclination and desire what can subsist without variety ls cook who can dress but one disn and one way to be compared with him who can do several we have many sad instances of excellent masters who through obstinacy have drudged in poverty and sat down in want rather than go against their custar if the master painted figures he confined himself to he and she-faints if landscape nothing but wildernesses and deserts if flowers nothing but flower- pots if seas nothing but storms and tempests if architecture nothing but grottos and auins it is true that it is more commendable to excel in one branch than to be indifferent in many but as true that variety of food causes new gusto in short making virtue of necessity we are obliged to alter our notions and submit them to seasons and occafions we shall now proceed to enquire and observe what ready and constant materials each artist in his practice has occasion for and whether those be copious enough and lastly what are proper to each branch- the general fund consists first in the variety of paffions and designs secondly secondly in pleasing new matter moving to love as the proverb says nen sufficit unus wherefore variety and novelty are necessary but mean not that it should appear in every piece we do but now and then occasionally in order to please and retain the curious lastly it must be considered whether there can be found such constant flow of novelty as the particular study of the artist calls for and wherein it consists some principal instances of which from whence may be deduced an infinity shall here subjoin as for the figure-painter there are not only he and she-saints but also philosophers prophets and prophetesses or sybils eminent men and women as well in policy as warfare monarchs lawgivers statesmen and eccle- siastics the four parts of the world the five senses and innumberable other remarkable persons and objects judge then whether there be not matter enough for those who would go greater lengths than to spend years nay their whole livés in fingle figures in landscape what field is there for variety besides wildernesses and deserts as delightful lawns beautiful inclosures rivers and cascades rocks and caves pyramids burying-places and tombs and places of publick exercise plantations of trees country-houses sports of shepherds sacrifices and baccha- nalia and all these varied by being made fronting in profile or in rear some- times with an high at others low horizon sometimes in sunshine at others in moon light to which add beasts birds for sea-painters remarkable accidents as well ancient as modern sacred and prophane stories fables and daily occurrences some of them may be these christ walking on the sea and peter fishing in boat is calling out to him christ asleep in fhip in ftorm and awaked by the people sea-coast with ships riding at anchor and others

afford greater variety than architecture as well inward as outward besides ruins and innume- rable by-works for ornament what an abundance of beautiful temples palaces frontispieces galleries triumphal arches colonades pleasure-houses of elegant taste and colour spring from the five ordersà also termes niches with figures ballustrades adorned with lions and lionesses sphinxes and other ornaments of porphyry free-stone copper gilt and other ornamental stone to which add the great diversity arising from the ornaments of gold silver and marble bass-reliefs paintings hangings alcoves pavillions cabinets in fine nothing can be ima¬ gined that the painter of architecture can not make his own and the proper defigns in painting may be solomon praying for wisdom the queen of sheba with solomon the nuptials of joseph and mary christ among the pharisees mark anthony and cleopatra the murther of julius casar solon with cræsus the goddess vesta appearing before the entrance of the pantheon to curb the insolent attempt of the people people to violate her herse and other virgins going to the temple of flora and mercury in love hovering follows her mercury and herse in her bedchamber other inward and outward decorations may be sacrifices in temples court- stories and occurrences in palaces halls and apartments some of which we have elsewhere shewn besides consults grand entertainments plays visits withcraft ghosts delightful appearances as to the flower-painter what can be more pleasant and agreeable than flowers in their great variety beautiful air and colour sight which never tires though but in painting confine them not to single slower-pot for they may be variously disposed wreathed as garlands or made into festoons and groups or loose in baskets sometimes intermixed with grapes apricots peaches cherries grains of paradise according to the fealons which may be exprest by busts of copper and all sorts of marble and by bass-reliefs besides the five senses add for variety notable leafing as laurel cypress oak and sometimes to the fruit corn turnips carrots pum- kins melons walnuts figs proper designs for this branch may be these for the spring venus and aabnis in courtship set off with children and flowers for the summer pomona and flora with flowers and fruit for autumn pomona and vertumnus in summer-house think it needless to descend lower since there is no subject how mean soever which can not be sufficiently enriched with something new but perhaps landscape painter may say understand nothing but my own branch birds or beasts never studied another may say still-life is my practice landscape figures or cattle never touched poor excuse since for many infirmities help may be found as for short sight spectacles for lameness crutches for deafnefs an ear-pipe and so forth borrowing from fine paintings and from prints and drawings these latter are always to be had is in such case no reproach moreover we may without hurt to our honour employ seilful hand if he conforms to the subject and sense we are handling it is remarkable that pieces painted by two masters seldom or never answer the intention of the composer the distinction appearing either in force handling or colour but this is no wonder when each of them follows his own gusto and manner without any regard to the other as if the afssistant ’ share in the work were as great as that of his employer when general finds himself too weak for an enterprize he calls- in some body to assist him but not to command so we painters when we need an assistant intend not to shew what he can do for his own credit but that he should work in conformity to the composer ’ direction and purpose but we shall confider an affistant ’ qualifications and how he ought to accom- modate himself he should be skilful in perspective colouring and penciling by der spective to give more or lefs force with regard to the composer ’ manner by colouring that his-be more or lefs beautiful and that in penciling his be agreeable with the other ’ if the piece be tenderly and naturally handled the by-works must also be kept tender and well finished if the piece have light and bold manner the by-works must have the same so that the whole work getting thereby general decorum seems to be all of one hand this is so necessary conduct conduct in an affistant that his service can not otherwise be said to be of any use to us nay granting him to be greater master in fame than his employer he ought to take care that his work do not predominate fault which would disserve them both and when this fault is heightened by ignorance or malice the ma¬ jesty and elegance of fine composition is lost and the work subjected to the scoff of the curious as have divers times experimented chap xv of the four sorts of tables or ordonnances what they are have been long in suspence whether might without being taxed with presumption offer to publick view my reveries about the general tables or ordonnances which spring from refined judgment and are of important use to curious artists and poets as well to exercise their pens as pencils but at last pre- suming that the product of my weak abilities would not give offence pursued my intentions imperfect as they are shall be at least pleased if my endeavours gave handle for better inquiries it is agreed that fable or ordonnance is representation of some fact either with the pen or pencil poem is fhort and plain account of the most material circumstances shewing the true cause from whence the fact proceeds three qualities are necessary to good poet an exact acquaintance with history and the best authors good knowledge in antiquities lastly an easy and delicate poesy to which add an agreeable stile by which after having weighed what materials and pasfions are proper he disposes every thing in con- secutive order and the most perspicuous manner grace is as necessary in poesy as harmony of colours in painting but though all the aforesaid beautiful qualities be well observed yet they can not produce perfect ordonnance without the aid of the rules of painting for sine history of great personages accompanied with elegant by-ornaments in delightful country unartfully disposed is so far from perfection that it can not have the utmost grace though it were the life itself much may be said for subject well treated but more for an ordonnance of fkiful master painted according to the laws of art which make even crookedness seem strait ishiall now treat of the nature force and quality of tables or ordonnances as necessarv for landscape as history-painters and therein consider their kinds their names which of them have double uses and which have single suppose four kinds viz historical poetic moral and hieroghyphic the first is simple and true fact the second double fiction exhibiting fabulous stories or mixture of deities and mortals the third has threefold moral teaching our duty to god our neighbour and ourselves and the last is fourfold as couching under short and mysterious sense the three before going handling virtue and vice for the benefit of soul and body and shewing the happiness and immortality of the one and the corruption of the other in history the poet or painter ought intirely to confine himself to truth with- out addition or abatement his ornaments though borrowed from poesy must be so restrained that nothing serving for illustration create improbability for instance not to represent day-break by the poetic figure of aurora or the night by diana or the sea by neptune which is needless and an error be- cause those things can be naturally expressed by colours as day-break by its appearance of yellow red and blue or by the sun-rays appearing on the horizon the night by its darkness and by the moon and stars the sea by its waves and billows rocks monsters and shells on the shore also the nile by its crocodiles or any thing proper to the sea or rivers the poetic tables differ from the historical in this that instead of true story they consider fictions only intermixing deities with mortals as we have said and thereby signifying nothing else but the course of the world through the four elements as air earth fire and water and though historically handled yet each is simple figure having mystic meaning either in name or shape and often in both as soylla atlas leda cyclops and many others and thus the fable being both philosophic and moral in one and the same manner prescribes virtue and decries vice as we gather from ovid virgil and others it is necessary therefore in designing such an ordonnance to keep intirely to the fable as before is said without any addition of hieroglyphic figures as temperance prudence anger jealousy which are so improper here as hereafter shall be shewn that they destroy the very intent of it for there are others which though in different manner will express the same paffions as cupid instead of lovs pallas instead of wisdom and many others as we collect from the poets the moral ordonnances are true facts or histories proposed only for edification or instruction exhibiting either the gallant acts or crimes of human nature and these explained by some additional emblematic figures which express the paffions by which they were moved or misled for instance with alexander we may place ambition next marcus aurelius humanity next augustus piety next scipio afr icanus his moderation in restoring the young captive bride to her spouse and many others as horace in his emblems artfully exhibits in this sort of ordon- nances we are no ways confined to time the sun ’ place or the quality of the country for we may intermix summer with winter even all the elements may appear the subject may be in the front of the picture in africa and in the off- skip at rome or elsewhere even in hell itself another scene may be acting so great latitude has moralist but he must take care to avoid supersluity and things improper to the main action which as in plays spoil the beauty of the representation the bieroghphic ordonnances are quite different from the three former in their nature and quality having no other affinity with them than an intention to exale virtue and debase vice by the rewards of the one and the punishment of the other they are as well christian as heathen the christian affect the soul and the heathen the body the former demonstrate the immortality of the foul and the latter shew the vicissitude and vanity of the world these tables consist in assembling several emblematic figures of different paffions which all together are to express single meaning as piety peace war love and such tables are called emblems by their application and emblematic use and by being made up of compounded objects which have their proper meaning and relation or else deri- vatives from them as the palm-tree laurel myrtle cypress or the sun moon and stare or an hour-glass dart slame which signify any power virtue or extraordinary effect these tables like the preceding admit not of the least superfluity to obscure their significations because having neither history nor fable to build on they consist only of single paffion proceeding from the sub- ject which may be at our own choice explained and made intelligible by the other emblematic figures which must not be improperly introduced lest the sense of the whole scene be altered but here we must observe to make dis- tinction between heathen and christian representations the heathen admit of venus cupid or anteros for love the christian shews charity or woman with children about her and flame on her head the former has hercules for fortitude and the latter st. michael the one takes jupiter with his thunder and the other justice the former expresses piety by woman with an oblation-bowl in her hand and near her an altar with crane and the latter chuses cross instead of the bowl but all this is uncertain and not confined to time or climate being well apprized of these things we obtain the best and surest method for defigning any kinds of tables or ordonnances how abstruse soever nay be your design ever so single it will always afford plentiful matter to furnish out and enrich large and capital compofition as shall shew in the following table though but in part as leaving out the city of athens in the offfkip river with swans fate in the air or mercury flying along with atropos we read of the greek philosopher aschylus that as he sat meditating in the field he was killed by tortoise dropped by an eagle on his bald pate which mournful acci¬ dent handle thus little to the left from the point of sight place the un- fortunate old man on small eminence with pen in his hand and book in his lap he is fallen on his right thigh which is foreshortened with his legs ¬ cross and one of them extended to the left his upper parts bending and in- clining somewhat to the right his head is in profile and downwards he flings his right hand sideways from him the pen almost touching the ground and his left is open over his head the tortoise falls somewhat sloping head-foremost along by his left ear his hook is tumbling out of his lap to the left over his head little more to the left where his garment is under him hovers the eagle looking downwards at the corner of stone six inches high and co- vered

would not be amiss to shew another man who passing by and hearing the philosopher ’ cry does in surprize look back at him swaying the upper part of his body which is almost naked to the waste to the

landskip and offskip leave to the choice of those who like the composition it is said that this philosopher was so fearful of his bald pate that he thought himself secure no where but in the field in the open air wherefore do not in¬ troduce near him either house tree or any thing else that could hurt him but thus it happens in the midst of his security he meets his death mors inevita bile faium some perhaps may afk why have chosen but single figure for the subject of this ordonnance my reason is to shew those who are skilled in landskip method of giving their by-ornaments greater lustre and excellence those mean who are so rich in invention of inanimate objects that are content with one figure and at most two and those perhaps of little significancy though it must be granted that the name of an excellent wise and celebrated person represented in an artful landscape gives the work lustre and the master reputa¬ tion for fkilful landscape-painter certainly deserves honour but double when he shews that he also understands history and poetry many landscape-painters not excepting some famous ltalians chuse commonly low mean and poor subjects and by-ornaments for my part generally lessen my landscape to give room for embellishment in fine if we can not be alike perfect in all things we may at least through perseverance go great fengths for gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed jade cadendo that is by constant drops the stone is holloz ’ thro which greater single force could never do the aforesaid ordonnance is very fine for landfkip and the rather as it handies an uncommon story attended with few circumstances for the whole is but fingle figure though the scene as being beautiful open field would easily admit of three or four consider then excellent professors of this branch what have laid down the trouble will be but small and it is in your power to make it easy to you qui eupit capit emnia- chap xvi of the uses of ovip ’ metamorphasis and what is further necessary to the sketching and executing table or ordonnance experience tells us that truth loses by repetition and that he who eafily believes is as eafily deceived but the master who makes it his bu- finess to build on the most certain infallible means in order to obtain his end bids fairest for excellence what poor work is it after having seen well-ordered defign of another mast adorned with elegant by-works and fine colonring to be slavish imitator of it by introducing neither more nor less figures nor other draperies and colours what reputation is got by it were it ever so well execu- ted nay if differently disposed and incomparably painted it is certain that something more is neceffarv before we undertake subject prudent general will not rely on the report of one spy nor spare either men money or pains to get right intelligence of the enemy ’ defigns good painter should do the same in order to excel which to do the following observations are highly necessary we must know how the story we pitch on is described by the author and consider whether we agree in every eircumstance with his opinion we must consult the comments of the best writers on that subject in order to get the true meaning of the story we must weigh the suiting and application of the draperies and their pro- per colours and by-ornaments how the four elements the four complexions and the four hours of the dav with their form ornaments and colours ought to be represented thus we may obtain truth and the master will make it appear whether he has gone to the bottom of things¬ few painters excel in history especially fables for want of inclination to en- quire thoroughly into their subject reading they think is troubiesome and need- less since ovid ’ fables are now in every body ’ hands copiously handled with three or four lines of explanation under them by which they know whether it is venus and adonis vertumnus and pomona zephyrns and flora is not that suf- ficient say they and do not see that the one is naked and the other drest this man that woman this has dog that bafket of fruit and the dther flower-pot xohy then should not these be my patterns since they come from such great masters à readily grant that books of prints are of great us to painters but to use them in this manner is willing slavery unlefs we can not read in my youth was so conversant with the least of ovid ’ fables that on hear- ing but the name of one of them could repeat the whole circumstances of the story but their meanings and uses which fhall be our present enquiry my fa- ther had never told me ’ till long after led by curiosity re-considered them and with the asfistance of my brother james who was master of the greek was led into some of the mysterious meanings which they contained many have superficial knowledge of ovid ’ fables but few understand the drifts of them what they gather is mostly from prints nothing from the text wherefore wherefore we shall now explain ourselves in two examples of the sun and moon at- tended with all the necessaries and circumstances and observations which we have before insisted on and first in the fable of apollo and hyacintrus ovid relates that apollo was in love with this youth for his extraordinary shape and beauty and that as they were playing at coits together the youth was un- happily struck with one of them which occasioned his immediate death the comment says that this youth being also beloved by zephyrus he offered to make him the chief ruler of the most agreeable spring-flowers but he reject- ing the offer kept close to the conversation of latona ’ son in return for which apollo promised to teach him all the virtuous exercifes which became his condi¬ tion and liking such as shooting with bow the gift of prophecy touching the lyre and finging but principally wrestling with privilege that sitting on swan he might behold all the places wherein apollo was most beloved and wor- shipped the west wind having made fruitless efforts to gain the youth ’ esteem at length through rage gave into despair and plotted means to be revenged of his rival wherefore taking his opportunity as apollo and the youth were at coits he secretly blew coit so violently at hyacinthus ’ head that he died on the spot apollo being extremely grieved thereat the earth in compassion turned the young prince ’ blood into flower in order at least to make his name if not his person immortal the table or ordonnance hyacinthus in his bloom is on the fore ground to the left and falling back- wards his back most visible his belly raised and his right leg flung up and some- what bent the left leg stretched off from the ground contrarily lifting up his right arm with the hand open and fingers spread his left elbow drawn back and the outside of the hand against his right cheek his face trickling with blood is in profile and his head flung back his hair is bright short and curled chaplet of flowers falls from his head by his right shouider which with half his back is bare and lower his vestment is girt about his body apollo ap- pears twenty or thirty paces behind him to the right of the point of sight step- ping back in great concern he is seen in front stooping his breast sways from the light his under parts contrasting it and his shoulders shrunk his mouth is open his left hand from him and close shut his right arm acrofs his body and the hand up at his left ear his left leg stisly flung out his right leg quite bent the foot hindward supporting his body he is naked and his hair light yellowissi and long flying above his shoulders he is crowned with laurel ze- phyrus or the west-wind whose rage was the cause of the sorrowful accident we represent winged and flying from the youth towards the wood on the left side of the picture his right foot is upwards and his upper parts sway to the left part of his head and back are covered with shoots and leaves of trees on the left side side of the piece forward is seen enzy in shade peeping out of the boughs and laughing behind apollo we introduce piece of stone-work extended almoft from the point of sight to the extremity of the picture and therein two large circular openinings overgrown with mofs and wild shrubs near him is large tree and by it laurel whereon hangs his garment and below on the ground against the body his lyre the ground of the picture opens large plain bounded to the left with wood running up to the point of sight just by the aforesaid large tree where the river eurotas is gliding from left to right on the right side of the piece forwards we place large sphinx on broad pedestal whereon lies hyacinthus ’ garment and against it javelin and on the ground bow and arrows an hasel-wand musical instruments and musical and other books the coit flung at the youth is seen rebounding inches from the ground to the right behind the sphinx stand an olive and cypress-trce the aforesaid stone- work is brownissi grey inelining to violet apollo ’ garment on the tree is purple embroidered with gold the lyre ivory the sphinx whose fore parts only are seen is in profile and of white marble the youth ’ vestment is white striped with gold and his garment on the sphinx ’ back beautiful dark violet the whole ordonnance shews bright and clear sky the light comes from the right and the point of sight is in the middle explanation of the fable hyacinthus who according to the poets was metamorphosed by apollo into flower of that name is true emblem of wisdom for apollo presiding over the muses and learning hacinthas is represented to us as youth beloved by him for his beauty having his natural faculties as yet uncorrupted as being child with- out judgment or discretion yet beauriful exalting his mind in order to contem- plate himself whence we learn that when the senses forsake the follies of youth they bring forth the flowers of wisdom adorned with virtue whose immortality is by writers sacred to all ages further notes the use of the bow latona had two children by jupiter apollo and diana both expert archers apollo was esteemed the god of prophecy and oracles on ithe gift of prophecy account of the delphic oracle to which people from all parts resorted in order to know things past present and to come the are of singing apollo is from highest antiquity accounted the chief musi- cian in finging as well as on stringed instruments principalby ze restling this word has divers allusions but in general implies any bodily exercise anciently practised in the grecian games as playing at coits leaping dancing fighting with the fists wrestling siiting on swan he should behold the ancients have not without reason consecrated the swan to apollo because he being the sun gives all things life according to the saying of the philosopher —the sun and the moon bring forth the man.— by the swans and their easy deaths are chiefly denoted virtuous men who part with their lives chearfully in order to meet immortality animadversion on the foregoing picture with respect to the painter ’ ordonnance that the agreeable youth is of noble extraction his fine mien and purple gar- ment shew his wisdom and knowledge appear by the sphinx with the instruments lying by it the chaplet of flowers shews his amiable qualities the garment he wears on this occasion points out his virtue and modesty the cypress near the olive-tree gives us to understand that all sulunary and sensual pleasures how pompous soever end in misery having done with the sun we shall proceed to handle the moon in the same manner the poets differ in their relation of this fable of diana and endymion but mostly agree in the explanation of it as fhall now shew they say that the moon diana falling in love with the shepherd endynion flung him into an everlasting sleep on mount in caria named latonia that she mignt kiss him at pleafure but others report otherwise pausanias intimâtes that they went further than kissing and that endymion begot daughters on the moon others affirm that she yielded to his pleafure on condition he made her present of some white sheep though all be fabulous yet it carries some probability for pausanias concludes that endymion was the first who observed the phases and course of the moon pliny also testifies that endymion first observed the motions of the moon and learned her nature and qualities which gave rise to the fable that she fell in love with him alexander aphrodisius likewise writes in his emblems that en- dymion had great skill in astronomy and because he slept by day to fit himself for night observations it was feigned that he had carnal knowledge of her and also wonderful dream by which being philosopher he got that knowledge others say that he was poor shepherd as seneca in his tragedy of hyppolitus though king ’ son and that he dwelt on mountains and in solitary places the better to observe the moon ’ motions the learned gautruche thus has it — the fable says he testifies that diana fell in love with the shepherd endymion who for too great familiarity with juno was by jupiter condemned to eternal sleep but we hid him in mount in order to soreen him from her conforts wrath- the truth is that endymion observed nicely the moon ’ motions and therefore used to pafs whole nights in solitary places in the contemplation of her which circumstance gave rise to the fable let this suffice for the story the parts and ordonnances whereof follow table or ordonnance of diana and endymion endymion son of estius king of elis beautiful and well-shaped youth is lying lying asleep on his upper garment on near mount on the right side of the picture under his arm is jacob ’ staff crook near him and at his feet large celeftial sphere and some books and papers whereon appear characters and diagrams he is profile his upper parts somewhat raised and'he leaus with his left ear little forward on his left hand his right leg is extended and the left thigh and receives strong reflexions from the moon diana little off not in her hunting habit or sitting by him and kissing him with the half moon on her head as usually represented naked descends from the clouds with full moon behind her as big as herself and surrounded with stars with the attend- ance of love or cupid she is in fronting position bending little forward with her left knee on low cloud her arms wide open as if about to embrace the youth and in her left hand is æ sistrum her aspect is beautiful and gay and full of desire being lighted by sun-set as well as cupid who is descending with her on her right side with his face towards her and holding in his right hand behind him his bow downwards and in his left which comes forwards an arrow with which he points at the sleeping youth he flies somewhat oblique- ly with his upper parts from her with his legs seen hindward through the cloud boy standing on endymion ’ right side looks to the left at the goddess his left the left side is pulling of her garment flap whereof twines about her right thigh which is somewhat foreshortened below this child on the left side where the mount declines sit two children joining and blowing their torches and behind them appears the offskip being valley with low horizon the sphere books and papers lying to the left at endymion ’ feet are with small which part covers his privities is purple that of the goddess sky-colour the sun is low proceeding from the right explanation ef the fable by endymion we may understand virtuous mind which the heavenly spirits endeavour to caress and kiss through violence of affection the high mount implies that when the soul ascends to heaven the body is seized with heavy slcep or death for since the body hinders perfect union with god it follows that as soon as the soul has disengaged itself it goes casily and quietly to heaven diana by her increase and decrease represents the changeableness of things for the greek poets asserted that jupiter seeing diana go naked and indecently for virgin charged mercury to make her garment and that though he made her several yet none would fit because her shape was always changing where- fore « sistram is mufical instrument generally represented in the hand of lsis as we see in medals and other antiquities fore her figure is natural emblem of increase and decrease and of the mutabi- lity of worldly things this figure has also other necessary uses with respect to human life as st. ambrose intimates who from the example of the moou whose light is variable always increasing or decreasing teaches that nothing in the world is stable but all things subject to decay the sistrum in diana ’ hand the use of which lies in the motion also denotes the vissitude of worldly things and their continual destruction and renovation others think that the sistrum signifies the sound which the moon causes in the course of the heavens in such manner as this should all histories fables and fictions be examined if the artist aim at reputation think have given the curious satisfaction enough in two examples for should go further the subject would not only be tiresome but swell as big as the whole work wherefore for variety we shall pass to chap xvii of rules for the management of small figures in large compass and the contrary tdhere ’ great difference between the ingenuity of good painter and that of mere designer with respect to ordonnance the former pro- ceeds by the established rules of art the latter only aims at what is designer-like the one is master of principles and rules the other is ignorant of both the de- signer considers only what relates to relief being stranger to the natures and effects of stuffs colours and tints and therefore he must find all things by means of lights and shades only but painter has more liberty and advantage because he can besides the shades effect every thing by his colours and tints but the difference is further visible from the sets of prints daily published whether in landscape perspective-views architecture ancient or modern story in all which the designer generally travels the old road of compositions and the etcher or engraver as closely follows him but when good painter handles them all the parts will be improved and become more excellent as well the invention disposition and harmony as even the motions by which means person of small abilities can not but be better pleased and often for the sake of one or two fine prints buy whole set as in oudaen ’ book of the roman might in which one plate engraved by abraham bloteling does by its neatnefs and elegance eclipse all the rest and this is the more remarkable because in his medals the figures are shaded not with hatching but with thick stroke and touch on the shady side now agreeable to the title of the chapter we shall pafs to the necessary management of an ordannance with large figures in small compass it muft be granted that an ordonnance in large extent requires more circumstances than smaller although in higher the chief matter lie but in three or four sigures for what in the former comes close and silling must in the latter be spread spread in order to fill up large space and to do this artfully we are obliged to introduce other by-works and those though insignificant yet probable and not repugnant to the subject tending to explain the story for instance in land¬ scape to introduce some buildings fountains pyramids or statues or in an hall or other large apartment hangings alcoves bafs-reliefs and such like either for ornament or to make larger grouping in short any thing that will entertain the eye since small figures in large compass are not of themselves capable of doing it wherefore with respect to such the by-ornaments onght to be large in order to creare broad lights yet these ornaments must not be so monstrous as some have them who in order to swell the composition make pillars bigger than three of the figures can fathom with castle-like capitals and frizal figures almost in full proportion nor so out-of-the-way as those where in landscape are seen trees three or four hundred feet high terms mere colossuses and pyramids higher than any in the world to which add houses in the offscape where before people can possibly approach them they must be lost by distance but this is egregious conduct for we should always bring together such parts or objects as neither lessen the figures or cause any obstructions in the composition mean that large com- pafs must either look large or else be filled and adorned in moderate manner as we shall shew in two sketches of the mourning venus plate xviii each repre- sented in different manner to demonstrate that in large compass great mafs of light is absolutely necessary the story is venus inconsoleable for the death of her dear adonis even the the aid of cpid fails whose bow arrows and extinguished torch nay her beloved garland of roses she tramples under foot mars though secretly pleased at the adventure however prétends to sympathize with her in her forrow but in vain for she slights his offers iand pushes him from her she rests on the tomb of her slover wherein either-his body is depofited or according to the custom of the country his afhes are kept-in the urn the other by-work is grove of cypress and myrtles from the urn might proceed ’ sprig of the flower which is ascribed to him since it owes its origin to his blood on due comparison of the plates we may discover the disference between the two compositions in the uppermost the mafs of light is neither so large or spread as in the undermost which proves that in greât and close ordonnance in small compass as the upper such great maïs of light is not necessary much lefs by-works in ordersto encrease it because the figures there principally govern and being large have on that occasion the greatest force as well in the execution as beauty and colouring the by-works serving to shew the placc and occafion but not to draw the eye whence ic-is easy to see ’ that what creates decorum and elegance in the one appears infignificant and disagrecable in the other speak of the light onl which requires alilistinct management in both wherefore since in large compass the by-ornafients make the greatest part they must consequently cause greater masses of light there- and icontrarily in small compass where the by-works are least the main light ought to take the figures only and to confirm this ’ must-say that what in the undermost re- presentation pleases the eye and sets off the scomposition even were it as large again is only caused by the light because the by-works being the most abate the light of the figures which having in the upper with the dark tomb more force must create such confufion as to weaken the strength of the principal figures in word the larger- the figures the more-stiade ought to-be about them aud- of consequence the smaller the figures the more light ch ap xviii of the ordonnance of histories portraits still- life in small compass ere we end this book or leave this subject it is proper to confider fur- ether whether it be not more artful to represent story natural and close in small compass than larger which think to prove from the examples of raphael caracci dominichino poussin le brun and other excellent mafters moreover daily experience confirms it it is certainly troublesome to be confined to small compass especially to those who affect to load their compositions be- cause largenefs is very entertaining to the thoughts the difference between both managements is the same as painting as big as the life and in little where we see that in the former lies the most art since we can more easily go from the large to the small than contrary though both be done from the life the case of these two artists is like that of fkilful steersman who capable of wrest- ling with storms and dangers sails unconcernedly in smooth rivers when meer ferry-man would be put to his shifts to steer on the ocean he then is happieft who has been always used to large things since the small spring from them like an inland river which loses its strength the further it goes from its spring of which the old masters were not insenfible who though much employed in small painting yet lay in for large work being conscious that what required the most trouble and sxill got them greater name and profit the force of large painting beyond small one and its advantages are these the natural representation has better effect for viewing it near it raises love pity anger or any other passion as if we sympathized with the story it raises the master ’ fame lastly the work is much esteemed- it were needlefs to mention other arlvantages wherefore shall confirm my opinion by examples we read of picture of stratonica that the sailors in storm took it for deity and accordingly worshipped it and that in juno ’ temple her standing figure was soi artfully painted that her eyes seemed to look every way and at any ueholder wherever he placed himself appeared severe to the criminal and geatle to the innocent the reason of which effects is that the two pictures were so highly finisnied and had so natural an human shape that they seemed to be rather flesn and blood and to have motion than to be paintings this shews what influence large representations have on the senses let us now soe what paffions curigsity raises as in this example suppofe murthered corps lying somewhere neax it person weeping littie further the seizure of the murtherer muretherer ’ and the geople running fome towards him others towards the body now it may be afked whether all these circumstances do not sufficiently shew the fact without other persons or greater paffions to whioh answer negatively for we ought to see whether the wounded person be dead or not and in what part wounded next whether ’ know the affaffin whether the woman lament- ing him be of quality or ordinary and whether she be rélated to the wounded perfon accordingly coming nearer think know him am affrighted behold the wound which appears ghastly to me and am the more affected by tke tears of the troubled woman who ftands at his head look for the murtherer with concern and revenge and see him dragg ’ in irons between two- officers he looks pale and his heart forebodes the worst in fine every one is variously affected some concerned others indifferent with refpect to the fate of the wouaded or murtherer now if such variety of objects occur in fimple accident waat force muft the life have when feen near in such representation especially if naturally exprestp but we need not wonder that so few tread in that old path since they faek case and want the ambition to excel by an exact in- quiry into nature once thought igot reputation by painting in littie but was afterwards con- vinced that large work orthe life feen near was the sureft way to excellence but envy and strife stopped my career what the painters in large in these countries merit may be eafily determined since lfew of them ido it masterly through ig- norance of-the true antique or beautiful life by true autique understand perfect antiquity without mixture of modern mode not venus with stays mars in fuit of armour pallas in straw-hat which is choice that can never get repu- tation- because such mafter has no thorough knowiedge of tlre life nor brings work-enough ints his ordonnances if he-get bold and light pencil that is thought sufficient his drawings -are commonly so flight that thuy disgover little more light than what is neeessary for the most relieved parts without regard to half tints tender parts and soft muscling and from-these drawings he paints as big as the life whersby he is obliged to supply as hecan all the other requisites which in the life he slighted ’ thus the composition comes out lame and what makes it worse his aversion to draperies and-beautiful folds which are so grace- ful in picture and so easily to be had from the life but drapèries says he are trifles as they fall out let ’ em pafs if it is not linnen it may seive for woollen and if for neither it is at least drapery but when on the-contrary view the old masters works what vast differ- ence do not discoverl what pains have they spared to handle their subjects pro- perly ’ tis true they admitted not of many circumstances in their compositions but what they did were perfectly artful elegant and natural view but caracci ’ woman by the well raphael ’ simon magus dominichinos judith ziba esther and david pouffin ’ esther and ahasuerus or le brun ’ beautiful death of st. stephen how wonderful expressive noble natural and close they are ordered and that with large figures all which plainly proves that painting as big as the life is much preferable to that in little and that he who has made the former his practice can easily perform the latter though he in littlé can not so eafily give into the large large to have finé and natural expreffion in littie is certainly commendable but it is more easy to mark out camp and draw up an army for battle in large plain than in narrow compass spread army is weak but closenefs of troops makes it-strong wherefore in narrow and ill-situated places general must shew his utmost conduct we ’ usually say that the best writers and poets are short and concise in musick the same perfect harmony lying in four parts whether vocal or instrumental it is likewise more artful to conipose piece in few than many divisions charles du gardin was exceeding fine in little and yet he had great inclination to intimate the large manner but he did not succeed mieris the famous painter in little lost all his credit with his patron the duke of tuscany by his portraits in full proportion and so it has happened to others those who practice in lit- tle use small puppets for their layman but not puppet-dresses their academy- figures are drawn on white paper uncertainly snaded with mezzo-tint or tender- ness and no higher finished than serves their turn others who fancy they know better -and as if they had notion of broad management sharpen the extremi- ties of their figures and darken little against the light having no need of second tint becairse their ’ sigures shall not round once as was drawing at the academy tmet with person who managed in that manner and desired he might be afked because then understood not the language of the country why he did not finisn the figures better since he had time enough for it whose answer was he had no occasion for more finishing as painting small things one two or three foot high at furthest then caused him to be afked that supposing he were to do something larger whether he would not be at loss he answered that he hoped he should not as long as he kept to his text which indeed was truth as appeared in the consequence for having an opportunity afterwards to paint some figures in full proportion there was no more in them than his draw¬ ings which were his models more instances of this kind were superfluous since it-it is hoped the better advised will conduct their studies rightly in due examination of the life in order to qualify themselves for larger things this observation touching small and large compass is not only useful in history but also in landscape portraiture flowers fruit shipping architecture in fine in all parts of painting chap xix of the division of history all things we should observe order which some proceed in according to their fancies and others act counter to rules not knowing that things are established thus and thus by an universal consent and why he who thinks himfelf to do as he pleases may indeed paint jupiter with fool ’ cap and yel- low or green garment and momus in purple drapery and so forth because there is no other punishment for him but his ignorance but well-advised artist make better inquiries that he may justify his work or that the work may speak for for itself let us love virtue says horace for the sake of virtue and shun vice not only for fear of punishment but also for the odium it carries although no one need fear corporal punishment for disorderly management of history yet he is not free from the reproach of ignorance and blunder punishment great enough to generous mind wherefore we should submit to established order as the con- ductor of our studies the surest way being best and the beaten road nearest if good historiographer in compiling story make an orderly division of his materials ’ ere he begin to write disposing first the general heads and then the particular ones afterwards the incidents and which of them are principal and how many and which of them happened without and which within-doors moreover considering whether the story throughout is to be handled in all its cir- cumstances in certain number of parts or in some principal ones only as whether he will contract homer ’ twenty-four books into twelve virgil ’ twelve into six or ovid ’ fifteen into seven or eight at pleafure so judicious painter in handling magnificent history should make himself master of the true con- tents and meaning of it as whether the parts be few or many if many whether he can not bring them into small compass and if few whether he can not add to them moreover he is to consider which are the principal parts and what can be left out in order to reduce them to such proper number as will answer his purpose always remembring in case he should fall short that he may use any licence that is not against nature and reason even to make two incidents out of one when occasion requires we are therefore to establish it for general method in handling thorough history divided into three four or five ordonnances more or less that the first picture must always shew the drift state and place of action and the last the conclusion of the whole story large histories such as of joseph alexander hercules and others which best become palaces saloons apartments and galleries can not be handled in single piece because of the variety of accidents they contain which must be continued in several pictures whether in tapestry or painting again if the gods come in play which frequently happens the cieling is proper for them taking care that either the beginning or conclusion of the story be over the chimney as shall more largely shew in the book of cieling-painting there are many such long stories in homer virgil apuleius tasso even in scrip- ture itself now if we would chuse two incidents out of any of them or make two compositions and those to be hanged together we ought in the first to re- present the most remarkable part whether it be the ist ad ath or gth ac- cident according as it happens so that its fellow may be the last as the end of adenis or his death the fall of phaeton or his grave sardanapalus burning him- self aneas ’ deification reincud ’ disinchantment and in facred story solomon ’ offering to the idol here it is necessary to be observed that all histories have two contrary be- ginnings and conclusions some sorrowful beginning and joyful exit others contrary to which add third which are neither joyful nor sorrowful the story being divided into three accidents the first should serve as an introduction to what we intend to treat of in the second should appear the main action and the third should turn in the happy or miserable event for instance we may repre- sent julius caesar entering on the government next his condition or further pro- motion lastly his death we can also divide story into four parts or stages as the birth rise life and death of vulgar or noble person but five divisions are the most perfect more are superfluous because any history may be sufficiently represented in five parts thus the person ’ beginning in the first his rise in the second his condition in the third his fall in the fourth and his end in the fifth as we shall further illustrate in the chapter of fellowing or matching of pieces in representing an history the artist is not always confined to the laws of written story good historiographer is obliged to go through with all the particular facts from the beginning to the end in successive order painter contrarily has greater liberty of choice since it is indifferent to him whether he falls upon the beginning middle or end of story and therefore sometimes begins where he plcases picking out of the story what best suits his intention either what went before now is in action or must be in consequence being obliged to exhibit no more out of the whole than can be seen together at one view horace divides the drama into five acts the first containing the sense and in- troduction of the story in the seeond is the sequal or consequence arising from the first in the third the contention or dispute in the fourth is seen at distance the issue of the story and in the fifth the catastrophe or conclufion either in forrow or joy but the drama differs from painting in this that the one con- tains in each act particular time place or action and the other exhibits only momentary action the division of the drama into five acts is not without reason from the ex- ample of the sun ’ course which begins with day-break secondly ascends all the morning thirdly has meridian-altitude fourthly declines in the after- noon lastly sets in the evening he who would act sure and orderly should use the following means which besides the truth of the story will furnish him with plenty of thoughts the time the place of action the conditions of the persons con- by the time we understand either the past present or to come and therein divifion into night morning noon and evening also into spring summer au- tumn and winter and into months weeks days as for the place we must consider whether it be in europe afia africa or america whether in town or country within or without doors in stately or vul- gar buildings or mixture of both in the conditions of persons we meet with great and illustrious ones as emperors kings princes senators generals as also deities and high-priests male and female in the second tire nobility merchants and citizens lastly the com- mon people countrymen beggers in these orders of men we distinguish between great kings and less and the same in the other conditions and divide them again into old middle-aged and young among people in general we find tall middle-sized short thick flender well and mis-shapen healthy and sickly sensible and foolisn all differing as well in their natures and humours as in their countenances and shapes we may add in the fourth place the manners of each and the particular customs of nations whether of romans greeks perfians armenians germans together with their dresses confisting of various stuffs as silk linen course or sine woollen-cloth long or short lastly the knowledge of phyfiognomy perspective geometry architecture anatomy proportion colours harmony reflexions and every thing that occurs in the chapters treating of those particulars which we shall not here repeat it now remains only to be observed first that there are two sorts of pictures natural and unnatural secondly what good histories are in order to shew their continuance in one painting the natural pictures are those in which we ex- hibit the nature of story or accident by single paffion by single repre- sentation of the person on whom the stress lies the unnatural are those wherein the same person is represented more than once and thereby two accidents mixed together which happened at different times as the one by day and the other by night which is contrary to nature and wherein is often used more than one point of sight secondly the most pertinent and intelligible histories are such as that of heliodorus described in the maccabees when he was punished by the angel to which add the high-priest prostrate before the altar intreating the almighty and further the widows and orphans lamentifig and crying all this shews the continuance of the history and may be brought into one piece another may be that of pompey where he is burning all the letters and papers of perpenna in his sight and then ordered him to be carried to his punishment and many others chap xx of the observables in frontispiece-plate oince we have treated of many particulars and their requisites it will be proper here to subjoin the disposition of objects in frontispiece-plate and their observables as being of different nature from other ordonnances and tend- ing in all respects to embellisn the book only like fine garden-walk where the objects whether vases statues trees are placed to answer their purposes the figure which denotes the subject of the book ought by all means as the principal to appear in the middle of the plate set off by other by-ornaments over head or beneath must be large table or flat face with the book ’ title there- on either in thick black letters or else double-lined ones and the other figures which serve for illustration placed of equal height on each side either standing or sitting thus much for the fore ground the offscape having little concern in the matter we may dispose where we think proper with low or rising grounds in order thereby to give the uniformity of the subject greater lustre and painter- like decorum the principal visto ought to be in the middle but if two are necessary necessary sor the sake of shewing fomething in the offscape they must be on each side and equally large and extensive but we must take especial care that the title be encompassed with architecture or rockage or trees or at least remain within the fore ground which we ought to consider as theatrical stage opened on one or both sides with curtain some- times setting it off with colonaded frontispiece or else inclosing it in moulding or compartment in which case there should always be sounding fame either before or behind let the subject of the book be what it will even the fame alone with the title of the book will look more proper than the figure of the book without the fame it looks well to inscribe the title in the pendant of the trumpet when it is in the middle of the plate and in double-stroked letters but if it happen to be on side of the plate it is improper the capital black letter suits the middle and bottom of the plate however when the title must be placed high the open let- ter is best because the other would take the eye too much and weaken the rest of the work thus much in general with respect to particulars we must observe that the figure representing the book should always possess the chief place in the middle of the plate and that to be elevated the figures of less consequence somewhat lower and further in and thus with the others each going off according to its rank action and quality to the offscape and if other additional ornaments are necessary they must be con- trived here and there in bass-relief but to explain myself shall give plate-example and take for the subject book entitled ars militaria or atreatise of military exercise bellona as the subject of the work sits exalted on an high and large pedestal in the middle of the plate set off with all kinds of warlike instruments as usual beneath her on one side stands person in an offensive posture and on the other defensive person these three figures make the whole story the latter is represented as brave citizen with table in his left hand whereon is drawn the plan of fortifi- cation and under his right arm sheaf of wheât the former appears as vigorous young man with spike-headed staff in one hand and spade in ’ the other and at his feet crow or wall-breaker on one side in the offscape is town-wall and on the other some armed men setting houses on fire behind the former stands vigilancy and behind the the latter subtilty now we may observe that the aforesaid uniformity in the figures accompany- ing bellona and which help to explain the sense is unavoidable for if one of the hieroglyphic figures next her were sitting and the other standing it would cause an absurdity in the ordonnance because those two figures ought to shew an acti- vity or at least to be in readiness to undertake some enterprize wherefore they as well as those behind them must be standing the latter being placed there not as capital figures but to aid and subserve the two others and there- fore being rather ornamental than necessary they may be left out as also may the offscape since the subject sufficiently appears without it nevertheless it may be retained when it does not obscure the main design but should rather chuse to contrive it in bass-relief in stone-work all frontispiece-plates should have the three following qualities to delight the eye to tend to the praise and honour of the author and designer to be advantageous to the seller these observations though little heeded yet are very necessary since all things have reference and tendency to something and though by proper application we must shew their qualities as in the three instances aforesaid yct we have liberty to make further additions if not foreign to the main design of the composition say then that if the capital figure be set off by an area palace or other building that ornament must come on the right side of the plate next to the binding of the book and run off to the left as scantily as the design will permit it would be improper to represent table pedestal and vase or such like half in the piece unless the print have border broad enough to be supposed to hide the other half or it were on third or further ground we also remark that the light falling on the objects must be supposed to come from without the book that is it proceeds from the left side or opening of the book and shoots to the inside of it in order thereby to create between them mean the print and the book perfect union and sympathy like that of the soul and body sup- posing the book to be the body and the print the soul which moves it to which add in confirmation of my position that the back of the book gives rise to the print and leaves the reason why dispose the objects thus whether light or heavy is because think the contrary very improper and ill-grounded as the decorum of it may be seen in the frontispiece-plate of my drawing book designed in that manner which shall explain and give proof of in the two following examples example place on the right side of the design fine frontispiece or porch of court or temple with wings coming from it on each side and on them some people leaning over ballustrade all running to the point of sight which is in the middle of the piece at the entrance stands prince princess or vestal virgin and before him or her on the steps man or woman kneeling and receiving staff or roll of paper fame on high sounds towards the left and on the second ground also on the left side but half without the piece some affrighted people taking their flight on the same side the offscape should appear visto-wise like gallery up to the point of sight now the design being lighted from the left and only slightly sketched with black chalk or pencil and rubbed off on another paper the former will face the book and the reverse the contrary example ii in landscape on the right side is massy tomb supported by sphinxes and set off with other stone-work as pedestals and vases the foremost whereof are more than half without the piece and all running to the point of sight as in the foregoing behind behind it is close ground of cypress and other trees up to the point of fight and beyond it is the offscape from the left side on the second ground may be seen in part only some people coming forwards as priest boy with sacrificing utensils the ax-bearer and beasts for facrifice before the tomb on the plinth should stand small altar forwards two or three harpies taking their flight and from the tomb cupid flying after them with an arrow in his bow as driving them from thence now reverse this drawing also and then observe the de- corum it produces although this method of proceeding be founded on reason and good grounds yet fear many will take it for chimera on supposition that we pretend to amend something and lay down positive law for what has been several hundred years left free and unlimitted since books may without the aforesaid observa- tions be good sell well and bear price again if book be good and have but title-page without frontispiece-plate that ’ enough even plate ever so poorly handled will pass if it but shew what the author treats of but let me afk whether it is not more acceptable to give print great decorum and make it better with little trouble than to beat the old road especially when we can support it by certain rules which will dicover the error of former management some perhaps may say why have not others mentioned this since the position is so positive but answer that though many things have been found out something still remains to be discovered by the studies of curious and inquisitive men we grant that if book be bad the frontispiece-plate will not mend it however if the proverb may take place thing well set off is half sold and there- fore elegance is very necessary in all things of the representations of dreams apparitions unusual thoughts and fictions at leisure times who can blame studious artist for amusing himself sometimes with sketching odd conceptions or for painting them think it very commendable and token of greatness of mind and the best method for excelling in design it is certain that they who make their art their diversion have double advantage in it because they exercise their judgments with usury in the most abstruse de- signs which the senses can comprehend let us only consider with respect to the people how acceptable such an artist must be since most men have an itch for novelties as in plays which draw the greatest concourse of people the more uncommon they are if any think lought rather to maintain that such artists ought not to be regarded and that they should find their pleasure in better things let me afk in what whether in hearing idle talk reading useless books walk- ing the streets all which is rather wasting time than improvement it is not unknown that raphaele michael angelo and many other famous masters did some- times exercise their judgments with out-of-the-way thoughts whence infer that they thought it no shame but contrarily what good can come of excessive drinking and dipping into other things as if painting no longer concerned us it is certain we can not serve two masters at once and as certain that he who studies studies difficult point and intends to master and practise it must not at the same time for pleasure give into another which is more difficult and of different nature lest he destroy his first point we ought therefore to accustom ourselves to things which neither over-charge the senses nor too much burthen the memory in our pastimes young artist who at his leisure endeavours to qualify himself for fine compositions must especially shun excessive drinking hearkening to old women ’ tales enquiring after news reading trifling books of stories and romances principally accounts of murthers and sad accidents in- tidings too much affect the mind and series of troubles puts us beside our- selves reading of murthers seizes the heart and makes us unfit for study curiosity instead of being satisfied is so craving that when we design something sedate it can hardly find place in our thoughts and the study of musick or to explain what say touching the designing of uncommon thoughts at leisure shall give three or four examples each of different nature but must first in- quire why painters will not give themselves the trouble to design unusual or bar- barous histories such as the indian japan or chinese and find that it is because no authors have written any thing about them worth sketching those nations af- fording no other scene than cruelties murthers tyrannies and such like disagree- able objects which would rather offend than delight moreover that the odd- ness of their dresses manners and customs do not at all quadrate with the grace and beauty of the antique it is certain that the principal business of an history- painter is to express the story with proper and lively paffions that his intention may appear plain and satisfactory to the curious and yet this would be no more than the reading it in the author if the grace of the figures were not also to ac- company it what disgusts in fine play more than ordinary action bad dresses and contemptible stage if fine voice be agreeable to the ear how charming must it be when the eye sees it comé from beautiful woman beauty causes love but deformity aversion it is therefore no wonder that we have no relisn for such odd subjects fince europeans are too conversant with real beauty to be pleased with such shadows and ghosts yet notwithstanding what is said of the figures and histories think it not unworthy of landscape-painter -sometimes to exhibit such uncommon landscapes because the oddness of the grounds trees and buildings found in them is pleasing to most people especially those who are con¬ versant with their history and indeed this novelty of prospect is no ways so re- pugnant to art or nature as the people and their manners in spoiling the shape which god and nature gave them if it be said that such landscapes are improper without figures of the same country it must be granted nevertheless as the by-ornaments of landscape are usually the least regarded think it not disagreeable to exhibit here and there some of those creatures in order to shew the nature of the country judi- cious artist may dispose them as he thinks best for the good of the whole picture and the pleasure of the eye and because those countries are well known to europeans he can introduce them there and intermix with them travellers from other countries as persians romans greeks who may add to its improve- ment as we introduce whites into the blacks country and blacks into greece but perhaps another difficulty may be started against such landscapes namely that they can not be handled so natural and true as where we can have the life before us which indeed is probable however it must be granted that the authors treating of those parts are so many and so particular that man of judg- ment may gather sufficient instruction from them the temperature of the air fruit- fulnefs of the soil shape of the trees and other greens and their natures and colours are plainly set down and if the green happen to be little lighter or darker or the ground more yellow or russet who will go about to disprove it if artfully managed for my part should make no scruple to paint such piece fince painter ought to ssip no opportunity of getting praise and wish to have done it according to my present idea of it lf we omit doing many things for want of proper knowledge of them what can not the pencil of judicious master do if he will but set about it yet some men will not go out of their old road as was the case of fellow-pupil with me under my father who on my afking him why he painted not other subject as well as bible stories answered that he had no occasion to scek after others since the bible yielded more than he could do in his whole life which indeed was no wonder fince he painted one story ten times if it pleased him but we shall now come to the representations we promised remorse of conscience occasioned by an apparitien see plate xix after sextus tarquinius had ravishied lucretia the unhappy lady who had stabbed herself in revenge of her violated chastity appeared to him as he was lying in bed shewing her breast gored with blood at which he was so terrified that he knew not where to hide the figure which accompanies her holding dagger with cypress-leaves about its head and waste represents despair as the broken pair of compasses sticking in its girdle plainly shews now perhaps it may be afked because lucretia is open- ing her wonnd whether the dagger should not become her which grant as having committed the fact through the other ’ instigation it is certain that there is no need of by-help as we shall prove in its place in the bass-relief of aseleagar when the mischief is done by our hands but here the case is very dif- ferent for meleager was there dying and the revenge not yet executed whereas here the revenge is already had because she is producing her wound and there- fore the greatest effect of despair is over and she shews him the bloody dagger by means of despair which figure would indeed be superfluous where she not sup- posed to be saying this steel did it for if sne were in desperate posture with the dagger in her hand the figure of despair would be unintelligible and therefore superfluous again it would be absurd to make her stab herself at his bed-fide since no spectre of any person can appear before separatiou from the body wherefore she shews herself to the debauchee as the cause of her untimely death in order to bring him to remorse and for that reason despair is represented in — haec invicta manet triumphing manner as if saying megara by the bed-side with her head beset with serpents scourging him with smoaky pitchy torch intimates not only remorse or reproof but all other in- ward troubles grief rage horror disquiet the lamp on the table and in princely apartment may perhaps seem odd nevertheless think it has fine effect on the foremost figure and also helps to make the table-furniture conspicuous without hindering the other light doing still more good as being lamp and having burnt long time without snuffing and therefore casting gloomy russet light when that of the spectre is bitumi- nous burning white and blueish as for the small compass of the ordonnance some would have filled room three times as large with those figures and even represented an hall adorned with pictures bass-reliefs tables stands for candlesticks and within-door visto an ltalian comparted floor and many other things representation of vanity according to the saying man ’ life is dream alexander reposing on bed the following spectres appeared to pafs by him first time with his hour-glass next ambition holding torch next valour followed by asia africa and america in irons then follow riches and pleafures and then honour and glory the former with pyramid and the latter with coe- lestial sphere naked man brings up the rear having dejected look and hug- — alexander ging himself who in passing the bed accosted the prince thus behold me reflect on what was and what now am the whole world was at my dis- posal my valour purchased me the highest honour and glory riches and pleasure were at my command but nos in nakednefs pajs by as à shiade —sic transit gloria mundi this cavalcade exhibit in an hall richly furnished representing the figures in waving motion and skimming over the floor foot high on thin cloud cross the picture to descent of two or three steps on the left side and thence on the same side up to back door on the left side of the point of sight where they disappear the bed little raised stands backward in the middle of the piece the aforesaid shades are vapourisn but not sharp forwards on the left side place on pedestal the figure of sitting aezander with thunder in his hands globe in his lap and an eagle by his side and behind the pedestal stand two centinals in earnest discourse insensible of what is doing let it not be thought because make the three parts of the world fettered that alezander by his valour subdued them for according to the testimony of some writers he did not conquer all asia nevertheless that his ambition made him hope to do it is not improbable since he caused himself to be worshipped as second jupiter ammon as he himself has given us to understand by these words -alterius jovis altera tela question not but that if such shady ghost-like manner be well executed it will appear very uncommon though do not lay it down as fact happening to alexander but give it as my own invention have have said that the shades or appearances walked as on cloud by which mean thin vapour serving them for ground and giving faint shade to the hall-floor yet the vapour and ground-shade are of no other use than to express things in supernatural way and to make distinction between real and imagi- nary people have seen such thought painted by jordaan ’ where man is dreaming in his bed and before him stood naked woman appearing as real one who one would think was going to bed to him had not the artist painted there some clouds as if she were standing in door of clouds whence was led to think she might be spectre but then not having ghastly appearance thought she had too great communication with the rest of the picture she was seen from behind and very beautifully coloured and others therefore concluded that this woman was only model to which the other particulars were added in or- der to patch up picture and sill the cloth -- -but to return to our ordon- nance my thoughts are that alexander must not be represented naked on the bed but in princely attire for otherwise the door must not stand open and am not con- fined to the chamber-light because of the shades or spectres wherefore in re- ference to that have two points in view first to keep the light beautiful as sun-shine or secondly which is better and more ghastly to keep it somewhat gloomy in order to express naturally the vapouriness and by it the vanity of human condition an odd fable the fable-wrights tell us that in the beginning of time difference arose be- tween apollo and diana both in their youth who should produce the finest ani- mals wherewith to furnisn the world jupiter as chief ruler in heaven for pas- time allowed it and gave them power to do it after many challenges and dis- putes it was finally agreed that apollo in the presence of all the gods should make the first essay and accordingly to general admiration he produced large lion diana sensible of it and seeing the gods taken up with the sight of so strange creature and fearful that she should not produce the like brought forth cat creature not unlike the lion but as much inferior in strength and shape as the moon is to the sun whilst the gods were- laughing at this apollo was so nettled at the presumption of diana in thinking herself his match that he instantly brought forth mouse to shew in scornful way that the cat was not compa- rable with the lion whereupon diana summoned all her wit and power to bring out monkey which creature like the former being found to be very ridicu- lous and her endeavours judged fruitless by the gods sne was so provoked as to create an eternal enmity between the lion and the monkey and the cat and the mouse apollo as youth of about fourteen years of age stands à little to the left of the point of sight holding in his right hand scepter which rests against his hip hie stands in daring posture on one leg has fierce look and on his right side little from him sits large lion over-against apollo little forward stands the young diana holding up dart in her right hand and seeming to call up monkey from the earth who half out of the ground looks grinning behind him at mouse which because of the cat standing by diana seems to creep away un- der the legs of apollo the deities view those strange things with pleasure jupiter and juno sit by themselves on low cloud in the middle near apollo and diana are seen mercury and aurora and on the right side forwards mars and bacchus the former lying on stone venus attended by cupid lies on the grafs and next them little further ceres sitting in the lap of rhea points and laughs at the monkey be- tween these two and the cloud whereon sits jupiter and juno appears saturn on the left side forwards sits pallas with asculapius between lris and ganimedes be- hind apollo advances momus stooping forwards with his bawble upright in his ieft hand whereon he leans and looking to the right makes scornful sneer his other hand is wide open with the thumb on the tip of his nofe the whole assembly of the gods except apollo looks merry and gay emblematic ordonnance of folly here we exhibit naked young man stripped of all his substance which he lavishily consumed appearing before the frightful idol lashed by despair the stern old man standing next it drest in black garment has his hair and beard plaited and somewhat like conjurer is shewing the young man cushion lying on the ground before the altar from under which sprout out thorns on which nevertheless he is forcing him to-kneel nature on onc side on the second ground lies feeble on dunghill looking with tears at ceres and bacchus who despitefully going from her deny any succour necessity alone sits squat down by her having nothing about her but broken cup and some creeping insects the building seems to be ruinous palace the visto behind the idol is frightful enough and yet how fine the house on the third ground appears partly in the sun and partly in the shade of the pleafant trees methinks it has two sphinxes of white marble on two hand-rails at the sides of the door and on the steps is seen luxury scat- tering handfuls of money out of the horn of amalthea wantonness is playing on timbrel to some dancing satyrs and lewd women little further under the trees some of the same company lay eating and carousing like brutes by fountain the aforesaid idol is like chimera composed of many improper parts the head of frog the upper parts like woman ’ arms like wings hands as lion ’ paws with one of which it holds up purse of money and the other rests on an harpy its legs and feet like those of satyr and on its head is crown of holm-leaves the prodigal is treading on broken stone whereon appears small carved altar or some remains of it fortune deserting him is slying forward at the same time envy behind the idol is laughing in her sleeve nefariun vita fortuna dispendium chap xxi necessary observations in continuing an history in seve- ral pieces for halls galleries we have several times asserted that strict probability ought to be one of the principal cares of judicious master in his compofitions without devia- tion on any pretence whatever be the choice figures landscape architecture or any thing else becaufe as the proverb says truth though obscured for season must appear at last now to obtain this likelihood or probability besides the requisites which we have in their places already laid down it will not be amiss to observe that the principal personages retain their own forms characters and colours from the beginning to the end of the work by the forms we are to understand the proportions of their bodies by the characters the features which alter from time to time with their years from youth to maturity from thence to middle age and thence to old age by the colours we mean the fair rosy pale or brown bestdes long or short dark russet light or black hair long or frizled beards in fine such an one must must be knouyn to be the fame person through all the compositions without any alteration the same conduct must be observed with respect to the attendants or retinue especially black man and woman who if they have any part in the stately at- tendance in the first composition must maintain that post to the last because be- ing slaves they are seldom exchanged and by their presence their masters are better known especially when they have been observed to attend them several times it is not improper to make mention of blacks both men and women since they are seen in the retinues of most people of power in all nations the one more the other less and drest in particular garb by way of distinction like great mens- liveries it is necessary avoiding mistakes to know how many olympiads the whole work takes in and exactly to enquire into the different years in which the first second third and fourth story ended in order to assign each character its certain age bating for accidents which indeed so alter people that they get out of know- ledge as in the thin and slender becoming thick and fat and in the brifk and sprightly becoming dull and heavy and the contrary and yet those accidents leave the features whence likeness proceeds in their perfection but here perhaps it may be afked if we follow this observation punctually whether the likness would not be so lessened as to be quite lost in old age to which which agree so far as respects the colour and fleshiness the one in greater the other in less degree yet the character with all its known features is what maintains likeness be man ever so old wherefore it is necessary to make that ap- pear in the persons from time to time alexander was very young when he wa- ged war with the perfians and at the end of his conquests died in the flower of nis age of darius and casar we ought to observe the same though differing in years from alexander christ at the age of twelve taught the scribes and pharisees in the temple when full grown he did his miracles and was finally accused condemned and put to death at about thirty lastly we ought to observe that the life and atchievements sometimes follow in long feries of years and successively as in the stories of romulus julius cae- sar scipio alexander and many others and in scripture christ john of some of which we have largely treated in our book of tables and emblems which we shall publish in due season we leave it now to any one ’ judgment to consider how necessary the aforesaid observations are in the continuance of an history wherein we must also take care that the horizon through the whole work be of one height and level with the eye of the be¬ holder as we have several times said in its place the same conduct as we have recommended for figures respects also all immove- able objects belonging to the story for instance if the general subject require that palace or house must come in more than once it is necessary that it always keep it first form and station only altering the point of sight as we would have it seen either in front or rear or in flank either near or distant the orders and ornaments of architecture likewise come under the same regulation for the frontispiece balcony porch steps rails ballustrades statues windows must remain the same in each composition and not only so but of the same marble and same zoood abating for the decays of time with the inward ornaments the case is the same for the rooms must not be adorned in ta different manners but with tapestries or pictures of such or such choice the inner court may be set off with fountains statues no greater overfight can therefore in my opinion can be committed on such an occasion than to employ different hands in so capital work because they com- monly differ in manner handling and knowledge as much as night and day whence it happens that the chain of story is so broken and dubious that with- out an explanation it is difficult to know whom or what it represents one fol- lowing the antique gusto another the modern one giving his personages cer- tain likeness and another giving the same person character quite different from that of the former as it hits their fancies and choice so that virgil ’ saying is remember to have seen two pieces being the continuance of one fact in both which were represented one and the same general in the former he was in armour and bareheaded more or less antique-like and in the latter he was triumphantly carried on à shield clothed in buff and with shoes and stockings hat and feather and with naked sword in his hand as for his carriage it was as little like that of the former as his dress now how ridiculous this must look let any one determine could give more instances of this kind of blunders but thinking this suffi- cient caution to those who may be concerned in fuch works shall pursue our main defign and come to likeness which in word lies in the features how much soever person may advance in years to hit the likeness well and prevent the afbresaid mistakes the following is thé best method chusc fine plaister-face ci hér of man or woman which has such an air as the subject requires whether modesz austere dr amorous this face we must make use of from the beginning to thé end of the work where those obser- vations are necessary either in front or profile eud with such light as is proper to the whole design whether right or left sorward or backward candle or torch all this to be done without any variation except somewhat in the liveliness and fleshiness which through years is continually abating in both sexes as we have before faid as to the motion of the passions caused by particular accidents we have in former chapter shewed method how to manage in such cases without the life having said thus much touching the ordonnance think it not improper to subjoin two observations which are as necessary to what has been said as to what shall hereafter be treated of namely description of the conditions of men in the summer and winter seasons and conclude this book with an emblem man in summer is vastly affected by the heat which thinning the blood makes it flow with ease to the extremities of the body whereby the motions are freed from restraint- the head is raised the shoulders sink the arms and legs spread the hands and fingers opened whereby each part of the body seems to refresn itself affording every where free passage for the cold the mouth is generally open the eye-lids feem to be brisker because warmth enlivens all things caufing also the vapours which ascend to the brain and fall on the eyes the hair stuck behind the ears hangs down the back so that all seems to be uncovered man in the winter season to exprefs this figure well it is necessary to explain cold itself as being the cause of the subsequent motions the blood wherein lies the warmth of the body is by means of cold which is its opposite and enters from without through the pores forced inwardly so that it passes chiefly from the small members to wit fingers and toes to its center wherefore we see that to keep off outward cold people sink their heads into their breasts raise their shoulders hug themselves very close with their hands under their arm-pits which the cold can not easily affect the knees joined legs somewhat bent and the whole body stooping the eyes almost shut or kept open with difficulty the mouth closed the upper lip hidden by the under one which covers it up to the nose to pre- vent the cold entering the body the hair hangs carelessly both before and behind emblem the best method person of weak memory can take is to exercise his judg- ment on things at the instant they present themselves to him that is to set down what he has mind to keep that he may at any time have recourse to it for his future information and remembrance and this to be repeated ’ till he has gained what he wants but this- can not well be done unless he at such times suspend the use of three of his senses hearing taste and smell and retain only sight and feeling according to our sketch thus young man in his prime is sitting at small table with pen or crayon in his hand memory is sitting over against him holding upright an open book where- in truth is represented to him on the table time standing by him on one side points at the figure of -truth and prudence on his other side is guiding his hand sight and feeling stand by him at the table the three other-senses are at the command of judgment conducted by temperance to another apartment be- hind memory judgment is seen driving away some children who are observed here as vices and untimely hindrances prejudicial to memory those unseasonable im¬ pediments always hovering about us and courting our smiles have each their particular tokens in their hands the first timbrel the second racker -the third plate of grapes the fourth pye the fifth patridge the sixth fool ’ cap thus we may easily see how weak and imperfect we are when judgment does not affist us and we are missed by the bent of corrupt inclination th ar of iaenng book iii of things antique and modern chap the difference between what is antique and modern are now obliged to put in execution our purpose of making proper distinction between things antique and modern since the difference between them is so great that they can not unite without causing excessive deformity for things antique are always the fame bat the mode continually changing its very name implies its mutability fince nothing is more inconstant than what depends on fafhion which alters not only annually but even daily in those who mimick the court these contrarieties which are so confounding and cause such variance between what is antique and modern we see chiefly in the composition of histories fables emblems and such like in which both yet the modern most are blended together congruity and suitableness in the composition of histories are true tokens of judicious master what is more glorious than while we are ravifhing the eye to pierce the heart while the sight is recreated with the beauties of the art to transport the mind with the decorum and energy of the composition he there- fore is esteemed prudent master who not only gives every thing its proper colours but also its due expression pure and uncorrupted thus we see that great masters who are got to that perfection do not blend things promiscuously and without dis- tinction as east west south and north in chaos-manner because with the little masters we should then act against nature it is therefore necessary that we nicely consider what it is we intend to represent to the end that we may not fail in giv¬ ing the true meaning of it how can the truth of thing be known unless it be represented as clear as literal explanation let us then curious artistsl sedately weigh what gives the art such an effect and lustre have ye mind to borrew any thing for your ordonnance examine first the story ye design to handle whether it be perfian greek roman will ye represent à darius chuse all your ma- terials from ’ the perfians for his attirement will ye bring demosthenes on the stage learn the proper circumstances of the athenians and make him appear great heroe will ye exhibit the valiant scipio give him roman dress and other neceffaries from that people suitable to it by this means each perfonage will have his true property and you will shew your skill in history and also by observ- ing the time when and place te here represent the subject accordingly would ye exhibit high or loue-dutch englisn 'or french stories fetch no materials from per- sia greece or staly each country can furnisn fufficient matter proper for its cli- mate to wit plants manner of living pastimes house-ornaments stuffs dresses publick worships times and manners of eating and repose all which particulars must be attentively considered in order to gain our point and for which purpose reading and books are necessary for as professor in law must draw his knowledge from the marrow of the roman german and other writers of jurisprudence divine from scripture and the commentators thereon and philosopher the same so painter ought to be skilled in the representations which he makes his prin- cipal study whether the same be ancient or modern hence we judge what fund of knowledge is requisite if painter would be universal he should almost know every thing nay more than many other artists in their particular callings for he ought to have tolerable knowledge of mathematics philosophy geogra- phy history do not meddle then either with things which you are not conversant with or follow the advice of others for it is more commendable to sketch dog or cat zoell than an elephant camel or crocodile poorsy are you disposed to handle an ancient story borroz nolhing for it that is nez and of modern invention since what is dis- guised with falsehood can never be truth like traveller who darkens truth by his own additions whose whims make him describe things he never saw and that to person who on due consideration soon discovers the fallacy the artist ’ judg- ment itself must therefore alzays go before and all that he undertakes be governed by reason and nature an italian should not be in an indian dress or persian in slashied doublet since the person we desire to know does thereby become unknozon each country and people are known not only by their habits but by all the other circumstances before-mentioned give then to each its own requisities and every thing that is proper to it how excellent must picture appear and with what admiration viewed when every thing has its due qualities and the whole prudent management what will not the artist merit if he perform nothing be- yond his strength and knowledge for since we can not know all things in per- fection we must keep within the bounds of our understanding he who would be every where is seldom found any where and by confounding things does in- stead of real judgment discover his little sxill represent then no more than your capacity will admit and principally take care not to iniermix modern and ancient « he and his army were defeated at marathon and afterwards by miltiades general of the athenians he conquered sicily after he had laid waste the country of epidaurus pl ll by whom carthage was destroyed ancient dresses and furniture in the same composition thus we shew à generous spirit for eminence and with the excellent former and latter italian french femiss and other masters an emulation to excel in what is noble great and artful think can ’ better describe the difference between what is antique and modern than by windball and an egg thus the ball by being tossed to and fro and at last bursting represents short duratien affording nothing but wind but the egg hatched and opened produces living creature not only something but some- thing good the former mere nothing or if it have name it is vanity and therefore rather bad than good painting was by the ancient romans so highly esteemed that none but noble- men durst learn it as we may also gather from the painters several of whom have been of noble extraction and the reason of it is very evident since it is not only probable but reasonable that such ingenious spirits should have dis- tinguishing inclination for arts suitable to their quality above the vulgar their meditations actions and perceptions were fixed on great and sublime things they enquired into and consulted many excellent authors of history fables and emblems as well sacred as profane and the accounts of ancient medals from whence they have drawn plentiful and ingenious matter for their studious what excellent paintings have they not obliged the world with how many temples palaces and other rare structures have they enriched with elegant devices inciting to virtue whereby they have bequathed lasting name to posterity how did architecture never enough to be praised flourisn in their times but whatt alter- ations do we see now how are the beauties and profitable uses of painting either funk obscured or slighted since the bombocciades are multiplied in these countries at prefent we can fcarce see one virtue appear but ten nay an hundred vices will rise counter to it thus has sprung up à second hydra like that of lerna so that we want avaliant hercules to lop off those dragons heads which are always sprout- ing thus architecture itself how excellent soever is with the right practice of painting brought into disgrace and slighted by other nations since we scarce see beautiful hall or sine apartment of any cost that is not set out with pictures of beggars obscenities geneva-stall tobacco-smoakers fidlers nasty children easing nature and other things more filthy who can entertain his friend or person of repute in an appartment lying thus in litter or where child is baw- ling or wiping clean we grant that these things are only represented in picture but is not the the art of painting an imitation of the life which can either please or loathp if then we make such things like the life they must needs raise an aversion they are therefore too low and unbecoming subjects for ornament especially for people of fafhion whose conceptions ought to surpafs the vulgar we admit indeed that all this is art or at least called so when the life is thereby naturally expressed but hau much the beautiful life sxilfully handled differs from the defective life of mottern painters let the curious determine it is-cer- tain that men and beasts too have each particular and different inclination to particular things whereby they love what is agreeable to their natures the one good the followers of bamboccio celebrated painter of mean subjects good the other bad becanse as some pretend they are governed and insluenced bycertain constellations happening at their births this at least we know that one man inclines to hunting and country-life another to war strife and con- tention another to merchandise and deceit this to politics and great things that to pleafures so that in each we discover what his nature and pafsion is prone to but let uà reffect on two arts noblé and ignoble or antique and modern and see how much they differ both in objects and execution the antique is unlimited that is it can handie history sacred as well as profane fables and emblems both moral and spiritual under which three heads it comprehends all that ever was is and shall be the past present and to come and that after an excellent manner which never alters but remains always the same the modern contrarily is so far from being free that it is limited within certain narrow bounds and is of small power for it may or can represent no more than what is present and that too in manner wohich is always changing what is past and to come is without its power as also histories fables and emblems as well poetical and philosophic as moral hence we may judge what the modern art of paint- ing is and why it can not be called noble much less of any harmony with the antique could assign more causes for this disunion but shall at present omit them for two reasons first because men ’ judgments are so various and each argues according to his paffions and inclinations in proportion as he likes or dislikes thing secondly which is the principal that may not be thought to raise any suspicions of partiality or prepossession but why should restrain my thoughts let me speak plain in spite of others say then that although modern things seem to have some prettiness yet they are only to be esteemed as diverfions of the art moréover maintain that such painters as never produce more than one choice of subjects may truely be ranked among tradesmen since such reprefentations can not be called an exercise of the mind but an handicraft trade but such remarks as these we may sufficiently perceive that from apprehension knorvledge and judgment spring the lustre and elevation of the antique art of paint- ing and contrarily that ignorance negligence and self-ieill debase and subject the modern so that the ancients have not improperly placed minerza by the one and midas by the other intimating by the former still in the art practice carefulness and an heavenly talent and by the latter imprudence blind zeal wordly defects and hindrances but if any one would perhaps examine whether there be not means to make the modern noble as well as the antique that they might both march together they would find it to be labour in vain since defects once got footing are not easily remedied but further we often hear with wonder that painters persuade one another that in handling subject it is enough to follow nature though sne be defective as crooked lame squint-eyed or blind and that when she is imi- tated with delicate peneil that is sufficient and such is their zeal and extra- ordinary pains that one paints for that end the air of his wife though ever so ugly with all her freckles and pimples very exactly whereby the agreeableness of beautiful woman ’ face is quite loft another chuses his clownish unmannerly- maid¬ maid-servant for his model and makes her lady in saloon another will put lord ’ dress on school-boy or his own son though continually stroaking his hair behind his ears scratching his head or having down-look thinking it sufficient to have followed nature without regard to grace which ought to be represented or having recourse to fine plaister-faces which are to be had in abundance the beautiful and well-composed airs in picture of many or few figures have great effect on the minds of the knowing of which the ancients were thoroughly sensible for in the most perfect bodies they made the face chiesly to excel in beauty and agreeableness no one of judgment will deny that beau- tiful and well-carriaged woman has such an ascendant as most effectually to move her beholders in two different manners as by two contrary pasfions under mis- fortune or in raging pain she will pierce man ’ heart and move him to com- passion and when she entertains us on any joyful occasion with singing or laughing she will at once delight us clownish woman contrarily will not produce any such effects for her beholders through her unmannerliness and simple behaviour despise her mirth and mock her ridiculous sorrow what great defect do we not still find in modern painters when they use or rather abuse the life not doing like those who being accustomed to nobler manner view the life with knowledge and judgment that is not as it ordinarily appears but as it ought to be in its greatest perfection whereas the others blinded by custom have no such nicety because they imitate the life just as they fee it without any difference we even see them make it more deformed than nature ever produces for the more mis-shapen faces bamboccio oftade brouvver moller and many others made the more they were esteemed by ignorants by which lozp choices we can easily judge that they were strangers to beauty and admirers of deformity however it is an infallible rule that daily custom and converse with people like ourselves contribute much to it thus deformity and vice are preferred to vir- tue and what should be shunned sought whereas he who is sensible of virtue will always endeavour to escape error chap ii method for representing what is city-like or elegant modern yhe continual changes in worldly things afford us plentiful- matter for modern manner without recourse to-history fables or emblems even so much as te be endless as may be gathered from the affemblies for public worship pleadings in courts plays family occurrences and the like all which we perceive to be either majestic amorous sorrowful or otherwise those things how different soever can be represented in the antique manner as well as in the modern provided each keep its quality as have already intimated and shall further insist in the subsequent examples which can be handled in both manners alike natural and proper without either ’ borrowing any thing from the other but the subject this think worthy worthy of remark and the rather since to my knowledge no author treating of things antique and modern has said any thing touching it francis mieris has not only curiously followed his master gerrard dou in the elegant modern manner but is in some things his superior and the rare poussin and raphael prince of the italian painters excelled in the antique let us then follow their examples in what is most agreeable to our gusto ’ and though the latter far exceed the former in nobleness it is however more commendable to be like good mieris in the modern manner than bad raphael in the antique though remember to have séen picture of old mieris which as often as think of it furprises me it was an half-length figure about the bigness of the palm of the hand representing the art of painting holding vizor in her hand its air head- attire dress and furniture so very beautiful and truly antique that never saw the like done by any other modern master how skilful soever whence it appears how rare it is for modern master to give into the antique let us now represent the case of parents permitting their children to take seme diversions in bathing design which can be as well executed in the antique as the modern manner the bagnio comes forward in the piece having descent into it of two steps the boys from twelve to fifteen years old about the water and in it are naked daughter of twenty years of age is seen with fine white linnen cloth over her body in order to cover what modesty conceals and as is customary on such occafions nevertheless her arms and part of her legs are bare she is coming up the steps on the left side one of the aforesaid boys holds her fast by flappet of the wet cloth in order to prevent her going up further be- hind near bed the eldest daughter about twenty-five years old appears almost unshifted and near her maid-servant to put the cloth about her the father we represent drest either in his cloaths or japan night-gown standing on the brink of the bagnio and laughing at the boys who are in it and playing their tricks one of them is standing with his left leg on the steps and with the other foot just touches the water the youngest boy lies on his belly extended on the lowermost step plafhiing with his hands in the water the cloth of the daughter who is stepping out of the bagnio dropping wet sticks so close to- her body that the nakedness of the members appear so transparently through it the mother all this while is busy in serving some sweet-meats on table covered with napkin near which child of two or three years of age is sitting in chair in his shirt to whom she offers macaroon somewhat further are seen silk gowns petticoats velvet fcarves hoods hanging on pins on table are lying pearl necklaces bracelets and other trinkets in fine the whole disposition is most orderly natural and beautiful as for the boys cloaths to wit coats hats breeches stockings shoes they lie on the brink of the bagnio now refer it to the judicious reader whether the daughter who on the left side is stepping out of the bagnio ought not notwithstanding her being covered with the cloth to be represented beautiful and shapeable in her arms legs hands and feet nay even her body also so far as the nakedness appears through the wet cloth her modesty appears evidently by her bafhful look what car- riage shew the feet and whole body while she endeavours to cover the parts which modesty modesty conceals and how modestly does she step-up instead of expofing those parts by wanton gatel afk further whether the boy who is stopping her by the flappet of the cloth ought to be less beautiful and well-made than the father in the flowered japan gown the boy the same who lies extended on his belly in whomn must appear innocence and childifhiness the eldest daughter in her bloom well descended and virtuously educated to whom shall we liken her whence must we fetch her beauty and whom must we use for model vulgar person or one of better appearance even this latter would be in- fufficient for the purpose if not well educated and fine-carriaged hecause beauty without grace looks mishapen and stiff this virgin then who is except in her feet quite naked ought principally to be painted as beautiful and agreeable as grecian venus mean not wanton one but an « heavenly one virtuous one for as much as the soul differs from the body and the body from the drefs does nobility from commonalty virtue from defect if any one afk where he shall find those béauties refer him in the first place to the books which treat of perfect proportion wherein true grace consists whilst he is studious in those he ought to have the best plaister-figures before him in order to exercise his un- derstanding and thereby acquire solid judgment if it be again objected that the plaister is not equal to living nature own it for mean not that the artist should paint flesh-colour after them but get perfect idea of their beauty grace and agreeablenefs both general and particular whence perfection springs for the colouring is evident and easy enongh to be found in the life as could prove in several instances of some ordinary painters who coloured well who before they had made much progrefs in the art were cried up for great men and yet having any thing extraordinary toodo were not able to fketch well an head hand or foot the modern painting can theréfore not be accounted art when nature is simply followed which is meer imperfect imitation or defective aping her even where thing represented ever so natural well-designed and properly ordered the condition manners and custom of the country well observed and the colour- ing most exact yet the knowing will not think it artful but when nature is corrected and improved by judicious master and the aforesaid qualities joined to it the painting must then be noble and perfect say therefore with respect to the naked whether of man woman or child that when it is not exhibited most beautifully or in its due proportion the modern painting can not deserve the name of art and with good reason since this is the only method whereby to make those two unlike sisters accord van dyk never enough to be commended gained excellence in the antique as well as the modern manner by strictly following the aforesaid three graces in both and he thereby acquired the epithet of matchless let us therefore follow his noble example in what made him so famous since he is the first who carried the modern manner so high as to gain it the name of art whence we may easily conclude what great difference there must be between painter who makes the « venus urania the three graces the modern or defective life his study and excellence and one who follows the antique or makes thorough enquiry into every thing that is beautiful and perfect the difference is even so great in every respect that can not but wonder at it especially when consider how much greater the number of the former fort is and how they daily increase wonder say that now -- days virtue is so little heeded virtue which took its rise from heaven is now as formerly the god- ly astrea did flown thither again and vice contrarily which sprung forth of erebus and black earth keeps its station but it can not be otherwise since blind love alone rules and an anteros is no more the reason of so great à dif- ference can be attributed to nothing else but the different inclinations of painters to objects agreeing with their tempers they who content themselves with following defective life will never produce any thing perfect or deserve the name of artful masters because not knoeeing or not caring to knole what is dest they can not so much as strive at it to which add another mischief they more easily judge of what is bad than good as shall explain myself in the following example young man as painter with pallet and pencils attended by zeal is led by blind cupid to the figure of nature whose face is covered by vulcan with veil the sun behind the young man enlightens the aforesaid whole figure mercury on cloud with his caduceus in one hand holds star over the artist ’ head in the other the meaning is this nature is the painter ’ object the jun represents knowledge vulcan the gross part of the air or earthiness and mercury inevitable fate the rest explains itseif thus much touching modern painter another emblem may have this difference that instead of vulcan ’ covering the upper part of nature with veil pallas is taking it off and anteros introduced instead of cupid the meaning is that judgment by pallas which signifies wis- dom governs the upper and most perfect part and discovers to the soul all it needs to know when aiteros signifying love to virtue is leading the painter at- tended by zeal to it but to speak still plainer we shall subjoin third ordonnance we represent to young men of equal age the one standing on the ground be- fore the figure of nature and the other on one side or behind him somewhat raised on stone or step by the former is placed vulcan and by the latter pallas the one fignifying defect or earthy parts and the other the soul or perfection let the astrea or uprightness sincerity love and all heavenly virtues are understood by her she was the daughter of one of the titans and themis according to hefiod but ovid calls her the daughter of jupiier and themis she came from heaven in the golden age and when vice and cor- -ruption got footing stew thither-again by him is understood hell and the night some name him the god of hell and say he wa married to the night also an hellist river of which vijgil fings thus in his eneids venimus magnos erebi tranavimus mmneis from erebus and the night are brought forth lies envy stubbornness poverty fickness porpkiry couxrer-love son of veaus and younger brother to cupid see suidas paufanias the figure of nature be enlightened by the sun and cause triangular rays to pro- ceed from those young men ’ eyes upon it the rays of the former extend from the feet up to the middle and those of the latter take the zohole figure let us now judge when the sun represents knowledge which of the two young men can see and comprehend the most and is most perfect he who views the figure but half- way or he who examines it up to the upper parts whence we may learn that the mind and judgment are beyond the hand and practice which without theory are of no worth tis art to produce something which we have not in sight but mere copying and aping to intimate what we have before us applied to the case of the lovers of the antique and modern manner we suppose then tzo lovers instead of two painters and take the art of painting instead of nature for the object which they like the others view the one en- tirely the other but half-way thus he who comprehends the figure through- out knows most and has the best knowledge and is consequently greater lover when the other is observed as lover of loco things and ignorant of the more noble of this latter fort we find the greatest number in our countries it is certain position that some men though hindered in their youth by an ordinary education from attaining sublime thoughts and great things can alter in time by art and exercise even conquer their innate dispositions and fit them- selves for noble and excellent things so that we need not wonder that domesthenes was not more eloquent than demades who though he seemed as if nature had not bestowed on him either tongue or speech yet became so eloquent that his singular example shews there is nothing impossible to art nay few defects which like demades diligence and labour can not overcome do we need not read of heraclides that he became philosopher in spite of nature and edu- cation why does socrates not prone to virtue become virtuous wherefore we need not wonder that many great men have obtained great endowments though naturally unfit for them and from hence we may infer that art and exercise are of more worth than the productions of nature have not yet made mention of several men of mean extraction who though they spent many years with pleasure and affiduity in loco employments yet after- wards arrived to general surprize at the top of their art as is said of polydoro da caravaggio who in raphael ’ time having been an hod-man tohis eighteenth year became afterwards great master the same was the case of quintin matsys who having been to his twentieth year smith gave into painting and much surpassed his cotemporaries martin hemstirk countryman ’ son andrea mantegna cow-herd and many others of mean birth also went great lengths in the art was not among the ancient philosophers protagoras countryman ’ son py- thagoras an engraver ’ jphicrates general of the athenians taylor ’ the orator demades aforelaid failor ’ and the mantuan maro prince of the latin poets the son of potter even the muses themselves were poor their nobility sprung not from their birth but their science we could give many more instances of this kind but not to seem tedious shall proceed to chap iii the nature of city-like subjects which daily afford plentiful matter for modern painter as the genius of artists differs one leading to the sublime manner another to the common even to the meanest so we find ourselves obliged to treat of all parts of-the art in order to be alike useful to every one we have already observed that there are three sorts of people the courtly or high the citizen or commonalty and the mean or poor state the first is spoken of in the foregoing book of ordonnance and the second shall now follow we suppose that every artist endeavours to excel in his choice of subject that some seek fame and money others money and fame others money only at the same time we think it no less artful to represent jest than serious matter countryman than courtier or an afs than an horse since either requires good skill to express it properly although there is great difference between citizens and courtiers yet the one as well ’ the other may excel alike in beauty and goodness it is grandeur alone that makes the distinction between the city and court for luxury and pride are peculiar to the latter but modesty and temperance to the former having premised this ’ it will be easy to exhibit plainly the further circum- stances as occasion shall call for them first observing that as the city-life is peculiar to us with its daily occurrences of asfemblies pastimes family-affairs and other particulars mentioned in the preceding chapter so it is the more easy for painter to make such subjects his practice especially one who finds himself insufficient for the grand taste for whose sake we give the following schemes and first an example of intreating and refusing two virgins are seen at table drinking tea the youngest is in her within- ddoor dress and the other friend paying her visit each has her cup and saucer that of the youngest stands filled before her and she has the tea-pot in her hand in order to fill the cup of the other who having turned it down sets it on the table she is friendly intreated by the other to drink another dishi as if she said — pray dear isabel one dishi more but fervant entering the room to call her away she refuses it with her hand on the tea-pot to hinder silling seeming to say thank you heartily fill no more these two paffions cause two contrary motions in the whole body hands feet and face the mother who is letting in the servant with his hat under his arm holds the door half open and is shewing him his mistress the opening of the door discovers sledge the usual carriage of holland with which he is come to fetch her now in order to express more plainly this rising from the tea-table we may place another virgin at it near jsabel who looking towards the door seems to rise and set down her cup the man we may make approaching his mistress with à letter letter in his hand and the mother standing at the door and looking little boy may also properly stand at the table who stealing bit of sugar out of the box is watching his sister to see whether she observes it thus the matter may stand with respect to these two viigins have we mind to represent the same occurrence by gentlemen we ought only to change the tea into wine the teapot into bottle the-cups into glasses the tea-equipage of kettle chafing-disni into cistern according to the season and the mother into menial servant the apartment if in the summer- season to be in garden-house and in the winter chamber with an enter- tainment or collation such subjects as these are very commendable and may be nobly disposed to the credit of an artist but he must avoid handling cottages brandy-shops ale-houses batdy-houses corps-de-gard and the like we shall exhibit another example of daily occurrence whereby appear more passions in order to shew that they must not be wanting in such representations example ii of an accident which happened at painters house the artist had one morning fine plaister-figure and two busts brought home and setting them out of the way on chest of drawers and then paying the figure-maker let him depart boy of seven or eight years of age fitting near the drawers eating piece of bread and butter saw this who after he had eaten and his father left the room took chair in order to view them near and thinking them play-things must needs take them down but either through their weight or the tottering of the chair whereon he stood he dropped the figure on this noife the father apprehensive of what had happened came down into the room and beheld the misfortune with sorrow the boy affright- ed fooked about for corner to hide in and at last run to his mother hanging about her neck and begging her to save him she though concerned for the damage yet desired the father to consider the child ’ innocence upon which and the intreaty of his daughter who had rushed into the room on hearing the outcry he was pacified ordering the maid-servant to gather up the broken parts and ’ -to fling them away after which he took the two busts in his arms and returned to his room- although this accident be in itself of no great moment yet it will furnish matter enough for mode-painter as well as the contrary to fill three cloths with being full of efficacious paffions elegance and variety and as rich in subject as if it were fiction it can not be denied that this subject though no history is of an historicat nature and requires as much pains as handling some fictions out of homer or virgil we grant indeed that the nature of it gives us liberty of adding what ornaments or taking away what heavy by-works we please fince we are masters of our own inventions and can manage our thoughts as we think fit ’ till we have brought them to our liking which is licence not allowable in other kinds of history nevertheless when we have mind to exhibit an accident like the pre- ceding ceding we mnust confine ourselves to all the- particulars of it though no history be- cause by abating or leaving out any of them it would make no impression on us this example then though only an introduction to such sort of compositions yet requires punctual imitation and we get in time richer in those inventions by daily occurrenees they must be even pleasant to painters in the grand man- ner since they recreate the mind require no reading and may in great nnmbers be met with at leisure times princes often disguise in mean habits for their diverfion and citizens and commonalty in rich ones for the same reason- because any fort of varietytickles and each seeks his pleasure foreign to his usual way of living but it is more easy for citizen to play citizen ’ than any other part and for painter to keep to the management of what he daily meets with than any thing else since the mind is like glass ball hung up in the middle of room which receives all the objects present and retains the impression of them thus rubens and van dyk by daily conversing with the great at court were fixing their thoughts on what is sublime and lofty in the art jordaans and rembrandt again on what is city-like and bamboccio and brouwer on what is most vulgar and mean thus each in his way according to his conversation with people like himself the following accident is as remarkable as the former composition exhibits mother holding looking-glafs before her child this woman sits upright with her back mostly against the light close to window which runs to the point of sight and is but half seen through which window she receives her light little fronting her dress is long dark blue upper garment and her under one having long sleeves is light gold colour-with purple reflexions with her left hand she holds the looking-glafs upright in her lap looks at the child with smile yet her mouth somewhat open her head in profile inclines little to the left shoulder her right hand behind her rests on small round table whereon lies an open book frame with needlework and some bobbins of silk the child standing before the glass with fool ’ cap on his head holds an apple against his left breast- in his right hand and has his left arm with double fist up to his ear and whimpering threatens to beat the glass he turns to the left looking angrily at it and draws back with his right leg his coat which is white is loopt on the right shoulder and his left breast bare he is girt with rose-colour girdle maid-servant standing behind him is seen fronting with her backside standing somewhat out to the left her gar- ment is greyish violet with white cloth about her body in her left hand she holds key against her breast and under her arm she has dusting brushi her right hand rests on her mistress ’ arm and with her head flung back towards her left side laughs so heartily as to discover her teeth her hair is tied under cap except black twisted lock coming over her bosom on the left side her smock sleeves are turned up to her elbows close behind the mistress hangs light grey curtain curtain mostly shaded by aepier of the walling between the windows on which the maid gives- large ground-shade which flings off the child on the left side of the composition door is seen half open forward appears cushion on cricket whereon lies- tabby cat and by it some little flowers or withered chaplet and timbrel now with respect to this representation consider the following observations here is something more to be remarked than the innocence of the child he grows angry at seeing himself in- the glass imagining that another child be- cause his own dress is unknown to him is come to fright him and get his apple the chief design of the ordonnance is to express exactly the proper paffions of pear by the postures but also by the dresses assigned them and their colours to wit in the child innocence in the maid folly in the mother moderation although this- composition be no more fact than the former yet it affects our pafsions as truth and because the dresses do not quite chime in with-the mode it may if well painted and executed hang better near an antique history or fable than one of company of gentlemen and ladies whose rich dresses- snine with ture will maintain decorum which will not abate in thousand years if the circumstances of the by-works be well observed by introducing timbrel instead of marbles nickers or cockals and giving the maid dusting-brush instead of broom or mop and placing by the mistress an open book or frame of needle- work instead of spinning-wheel or pudding-pan we shall perceive the childish simplicity of the first the servitude of the second and the tutelage or command of the third the very cat-lying by the dead flowers on the cricket intimates childisn play and fondness to scatter all things-about the room if the artist find no taste in representing things in the antique way and yet think the modern too mean such an one may very commendably employ himself in handling such subjects as the following picture of virtue she appears sitting composedly before large looking-glass the frame whereof is carved and gilt and adorned with monsters she views herself init holding rounded serpent twined with laurel her aspect is sedate her sway majestic and she ’ attired like roma near her stand some children attentively viewing the the frame and with general laugh pointing at the monsters one of these children wears fool ’ cap anotner has nest of birds third has jingling iron fourth shell of water out of which he blows bubbles with reed and fifth is playing with puppet these children are partly boys and partly girls the sense of this table is easy but if the curious want further scope let them consider only for instance in what good and bad family consists and ’ they will find that there are four sorts of people namely in good family prudent and respected father careful and good-natured mother obedient children and humble and honest servants the father gives law the mother enforces it to the children and both they and the servants obey again the father punishies the mother reconciles and the children love and fear good father is also liberal in the support of his family the careful mother manages with frugality yet with honour all is in peace and order and virtue their aim in bad family we contrarily see the father careless the mother lavisn the boys wanton the girls pert and the servants idling and dishionest the father in- dolent the mother unreasonably indulgent to the children the girls saucy and proud the boys rampant and gamesome and the servants catching at what they can lay hold of thinking it best to fisn in troubled waters and feast daily at their masters expence again there are otfier objects in divided family when the man is pious and ’ the wife worldling we see frequently wicked children con- trarily worldly-minded man and religious woman often have virtuous chil- dren the reason is plain if such things as these be well observed they furnish abundance of matter and produce an extraordinary effect in any family-occurrences in what condition and on what occasion soever we confider them whether in prosperity or adversity great and noble common or in the mean state and as well in their ’ manners and carriage as their dress and if these things be well executed whether in the antique the modern taste they are each way commendable subjects for an artist chap iv continuation of the same connexion to what precedès touching the tzoo afbresaid manners shall give some further thoughts though short of what can be said of those two unlike sisters since the field is so large that ’ could write whole treatise on that fubject only representation of vanity plate xx this ordonnance exhibits an hall which receives its light through large win- low on the right side behind against the wall stands table on which is large ocelestial globe at the foot of this globe lies an open book on the left side of ’ the point of sight is seen through door-way going down with steps visto with part of fountain and on the side whicht runs to the point of sight several vases and busts of famous heroes on the left side of the apartment is closet af- steened to by two steps between two hand-rails in the middle of the piece for- ard we place round table decked with all sorts of women ’ furniture as looking-glass boxes at the window are seen two children boy and girl the the boy with shell in his hand is leaning on the frame of the window and blowing bubbles through reed or pipe the girl who is got on foot-stool supports herself on her right hand and laughing poinrs with the other at fly- ing bubble upon which the boy looks back holding the reed or pipe with his right hand in the shell on the right side of the hinmost table stands philoso- pher in study with finger at his forehead and holding pair of compasses on the globe in his left hand by the closet which is half open stands an old wo- man looking forwards with her head sidling and rubbing her hands by the further hand-rail of the steps maid-servant is kneeling and whiping the said rail with cloth having by her box of sand pot with water and stiff rubbing-brush the closet is full of plate at the round table forwards sits young lady dressing at the glass her bosom is open and she is loosely drest in sine linnen and silk with her left hand she is bringing right-side hair-lock over her bosom viewing herself side ways and with her right hand taking pearl necklace out of box the apartment is of light pisan marble the philosopher ’ garment is of dark violet that of the boy at the window white and of the girl blue the lady is in white and light red changeable with blue and she has beautiful dark blue girdle about her waist the old woman ’ garment is greenisn blue somewhat faded and the sleeves faced with light yellow the maid-servant is in light grey and has pearl necklace about her neck by the steps lie pair of sandals the round table is covered with dark green carpet the floor is of stone and divided into squares it may also be of wood shall now for certain reasons give the reader my thoughts of the disposition of the objects in this ordonnance but first he will much oblige me if he will please to examine what have hitherto said and shall say on this head because he will then be enabled to judge whether it is impoffible for me as some mali¬ ciouay report to make the disposition of an ordonnance with the due actions of the figures and in their proper places and colours according to rule because of my want of sight for would these men themselves but open their eyes they would quickly perceive that disposition depends on positive and certain reasons first dispose the apartment with the immoveable objects after these the fi- veable objects at the same time as assert the proper place of the window tables and closet now do not say on which side of the table either right or left the lady is sit- ting because it is needlefs and she can not be disposed otherwise than she is since the looking-glass must be placed against the light consequently she ought to front the light that she may see herself in the glafs for how could she shew her breast fronting when the face is to be in profile and were she to bring the lock of hair over her bosom with her right hand and to put the left on the table she would be without sway or good posture and from head to foot in profile let us next consider whether the philosopher could be otherwise disposed than where he is on the left it can no ways be for two reafons because the globe globe is on that side very much in shade and therefore unfit for his conclusions because he would then be partly in the light and shew almost the fame posture as the lady where yet ought to be an opposition again were he standing before the table or globe than we should neither see his motion nor his con- templation wherefore no place suits him better or is more proper than where he stands by which this advantage also accrues that because he now receives more shadethan light the lady thereby gets more beauty and decorum he can also more commodiously view the globe and make his remarks by turning his body because one side is just fronting the light and the other contrary to it it may be the same with the old woman next the closet since it is impossible that she and the rest of the figures can be otherwise disposed with so much advantage and decorum this defign could also be well managed in portraiture especially in family- piece of man wife children and servant for we find daily occurrences enough agreeing with such representation but to discourse clearly on this composition and to shew that it is founded on good reason we shall make some further remarks upon it say then that it will bear divers interpretations though as will appear below they may be brought into one the lady at the table and the old woman at the closet both signify vanity and yet it may posfibly be said that the former may as well be taken for pride and the latter as standing before the plate and with smiling countenance rubbing her hands naturally express coverousness the old man seen here as philosopher may consequently signify philosophy but say that this only seems to be so hecause if the explanation take that turn it can not be compendious emblem but confnsed medley of divers things from which no inference can be drawn wherefore it is proper to explain our thoughts of this composition thoroughly even to the smallest objects gradually coming forward fromn the greatest distance the busto ’ and fountain in the offscape as also the servant cleaning the hand¬ rail tend altogether to vanity as the old man with the globe represents vain con- templation for who can penetrate the secrets of god and nature the sense of the young lady and old woman we have explained before wherefore the true meaning of this subject is only to shew that all is vanity which yet could not be absolutely concluded from it were not the children there since the other figures and objects might be diversly applied to wit to pride covetousness philosophy and therefore the children who employ themselves in blowing bubbles are now the soul of the work and without them there-would be neither connexion nor conclusion even each figure would have distinct signification and each call for distinct apartment and though we were minded to exhibit different paffions into the same picture yet something must be appropriated to each of-ghem in order to shew its meaning for picture is not in the same case with frontispiece-plate wherein is general representation of the whole subject of the book viz the seven wonders the twelve months the aforesaid design is also not much unlike true history and might like- wise serve for moral or emblem for each figure has its particular and proper character character men incline to study women to gather riches and goods daughters grow up in luxury and mis-spend their time young and innocent children busy themselves in trifles so that on the whole the conclusion must be that each person in what he inclines to loves vanity if any one here object that astronomy mathematicks and philosophy are not vanities as being ascribed to wise men he must know that wise men themselvs are by « some accounted fools wherefore pythagoras though an heathen would not be stiled wise but à friend and lover of good discourses and sciences knowledge often makes wise men presumptuous and prevents their considering with the philo- losopher that sciences are vanity thus we see daily that the rich are haughty and disdainful the handsome proud and voluptuous though beauty and pleafures like morning-flower decay with the evening and we may well say with the poet that volutuousness is shadow and momentary delight and therefore poor creatures they are who covet jhadows aud transient happiness all which things occur almost daily even in one and the same family as we have more largely intimated in the preceding chapter some perhaps may censure me for introducing into the aforesaid example such trifle as pair of sandals which seem to belong to the old woman but say they are not trifles but proper for such women as make idols of their houses and chuse rather to go barefoot over their floors than bedaub them though they have their maids always at their elbows with woollen cloths to clean after them but since this sacrifice to neatnefs of houses is here in holland too obvious we shall urge no further but for peace sake silently reflect oh/ the vanity of too spruce dutch zvoman even the maid as dependant on the mistress humours her vain defires however since those serviceable creatures in their conditions have likewise something which shews vanity give the servant in the example before us her corals or pearls about her neck although she were as ugly faced as vizard or like the peasants in latona ’ time when turned into frogs for how ordinary soever those womon are they think themselves handsome if they have but coral necklace and curied hair wherefore it is plain that such circum- stances are needful and have in their places good effect as for the ordonnance of dresses in this example mode-painters may dispose them as they please agreeable to their choice have only sketched them here to shew that we may represent vanitas as well in the antique manner as in the common way of mode-painters the sophists termed wisdom foolish scandalous and vile pythagoras of samos he rejected the name of wise which was given hin of things antique and modern chap of dresses we need not doubt whether the art of painting were or will be other- wise than it is at this time with respect to its different choices be- cause from the beginning there were mode-painters and as each climate has its particular customs in dressing so each nation follows its own fafhiion whence it appears that anciently as well as noz men were of opinion that their own was the best without giving any reason for it the eastern nations have their par- ticular dress and the northern theirs these last prefer cloth wooll and furs be- fore the finest and thinest silks of the east and thus it fares with all other dresses each nation say whether italians spaniards french cherishes its own mode wherefore it is no wonder that painters follow those which best suit their choice nevertheless the case of art is in this particular like that of religion there is but one true the rest are sects so that the dress which is the moft constant and remains alzays the same is also the beft nevertheless we leave each nation to its own choice that the modern paintings vary from time to time in goodnefs and are con- tinually decreasing in that respect is not to be doubted since we have daily in- stances of it in many which are full of mistakes but let me afk whether the tuscan order which is the most simple and strong do not require good archi- tect as well as the corinthiaz or best the mode-paintings agree in all parts with the antique subjects in relation to art to wit in design disposition colouring light and shade and by-orna- ments an ingenious mode-painter ought to take care not to meddle with the antique or to mingle the one with the other for that weufd be an unpardonable mistake since he may be sufficiently furnished with modern matter for his study it is not great folly to introduce foreign words into tongue which is of itself copious enough why are the learned hooft and huigens so famous is it not because of the force and purity of their stile especially that of voudel who therefore is justly called the dutch virgil we see daily how imperfect and defective the falhion is each day creates an alteration and each made we think best if it get but general approbation as may be proved if we confider how ridiculous our fore-fathers habits seem in our eyes and consequently how much he would be mocked who should appear in one of his great grandfather ’ and would he not be thought madman the case is the same with respect to the old representation of dresses with their stiff double ruffs close-waisted and pinked doublets does any thing seem more odd to us and are not such old paintings though well handled much slighted what reason have we to think that the present mode will better please our successors when we ourselves even dislike that of the year past thofe who take to such choice are not qualified to handle any history of an- tiquity how ridiculous would it be to dreis queen esther in stiff-bodied gown bedecked bedecked with ribbons ruff about her neck wide and quilted petticoat laced ruffles setting close at the hands and point-of-spain head-dress instead of diadem and every thing else answerable and with'her king ahasuerus sit- ting in spanissi leather èhair with narrow crowned hat on his head ruff about his neck fhort doublet with long sleeves and over it fhort cloak lined with fur wide breeches with knee-knots cannioned stockings roses in his shoes spaniss dagger by his side gloves in his-hand and in the offscape hamman in red waistcoat with silver buttons and linen pair of drawers standing on the- ladder with the

though ever so neatly handled will not plead your cause to ad- vantage without it two painters meeting on time happened to have words about precedence astiquo who thought himself the wisest would take the upper hand of modo with- out more ceremony but modo who insisted not less on his honor and reputation would not yield to him and being somewhat younger and sturdy punched him so violently in the breast that they both fell after they had lain while and recollected themselves modo began chiding but antiquo said -- what ze ill you not give me the precedence not says moao am as good as you and what signify zbords draw your seord or else iuill run this knife into your guts this treatment was too gross for the proud antiquo wherefore full of rage he clapped his hand to hiis sword and the battle ensued which was very fierce and doubtful all wlto saw it stood amazed calling out gentlemen hold in hold in but to no purposeà for each continued pufhing though without hurt to the other one justus happened to approach in the midst of the fray and perceiving they were both his friends in- terposed his good offices and parted them when they were somewhat pacified justus afked what induced them to fight with such unequal zi eapons and so rassily to endanger their lives how says antiquo are you the only man zho do not know that modo has forced and transported abundance of honest people à has he not brought the chaste lucretia and virtuous sophonisba under false appearances from their owm countries to amsterdam in order to make jest of them do not you knore hoio he has subjected the innocent and pious esther with the whole court of ahafuerus to the tyrany of the spaniards moreover he robs me daily and will not give place nox what think you have not just cause of complaint

peter ’ church at rome with intentien to steal the facred treasure in spite of the pope but to cover his design and not to raise suspicion in case of miscarriage he disecvered the plot to pope urban viii who instanily being carried thither in chair afked the robber whether he were not mistaken and whether he did not know that jerusalem was meant not rome à do you think then that the holy tather had he looked back and seen the high-priest of jerusalem in the holy of holies would have let that offender go unpunissied what is your judgment of this sample should give place antiquo pray said justus let reason then take place yet antiquo bawled out- — let me have my buskins and roman coat of armour wolich he robbed nie of and will acquit him of the rest to which modo said -—-first restore me my greet grandfather ’ helmet and coat of mail which yau made present of to eneas when he -foer was flying from dardania you may keep the gaunilets but antiquo replied great grandfather ’ armour presented to dominichino and the gauntlets to reubens who has bestoived them on one of the life-guards of thalestris queen of the amazons- the conclusion of the matter was this justus advised since neither could restore any thing that they should drink the question and take care for the future not to steal from each other question not but the reader will by this story sufficiently understand my meaning we have formerly asferted that those who daily converse with mean and bad people commonly become like them as those contrarily who keep company with the well-bred and virtuous become good custom says horace is second nature and the proverb intimates keep honest company and honest thou shalt be he then is happy who having true sense of good and bad chuses the best and most profitable and governs all he does by that standard he who has ac- customed himself to bad manner can not easily get rid of it perhaps will re- tain it all his life he contrarily who gives in to what is good will reject evil because it is against his inclination reasoning thus it is easy to apprehend how benefical it is for tyro to inure himself to any such fine things as are proper for his study and to reiect the imperfect and unnecessary too many goods the famous bartholet used to say are no goods here pray observe an emblematic ordonnance of painter debauched by ex- cessive reading of all sorts of unprofitable books in order to shew that none must be used but such as are proper for his study which seneca affirms saying that we ought to study few but good books the cause of the aforesaid painter ’ dis- order be also attributed to the vast quantity of useless prints drawings he consulted which are as great enemies to the best thoughts as an excess in books here is seen an anrigue table laid with boards in painting room and in the middle of it dissi with cake in the shape of pyramid and by it cup- four vcomen are fitting at the table viz painting statuary architecture and the art of

whether they be plaister-figures prints drawings academy- figures or other models rejecting every thing that is foreign to our study since we have hitherto spoken of what is modern it will not be amiss to make some short observations on the antique he who would nicely follow the antique ought to know that it consists in these two qualities viz beauty and goodness beauty again lies in perfect proportion of the members as we have snewed in the seventh chapter of the first book and goodness in the grace arising from-the moiion of the members which motion ought to be free and without exaggeration thus much as to the nudities the the draperies which are well cast and fo adjusted as not to hinder the graceful motions of the members are certainly the best as we evidently see in the works of raphael poussin and some others who practised the antique the ordonnance light and what else is requisite in perfect piece ought all to be most beautifully chosen in this manner we must also confider landscape architecture and other embel- lishments all ought to be either pure antique or entire modern we shall here subjoin one other ordonnance for the conclusion of this book ordonnance representing driving azay of the mode or what is modern fram the antique instead of beauty and virtue which in the former are led by judgment we may introduce here beautiful and modest young virgin attired in thin linen which dis- covers the naked on her hand sits phoenix and on her head is chaplet of flowers judgment may be set off with gold fillet or diadem on its head and scepter in its hand instead of deformed vice and the chimera we may exhibit slying young damsel in stiffened gown and high laced head-dress with sable tip- pet about her neck her arm-sleeves full of lace moreover she has shoes stockings and gloves and under her arm is bafket of china-ware and mushirooms which by her rude motion she is dropping prudence is beating her with looking-glass holding in her other hand an arrow twined with serpent the aforesaid young virgin ’ chaplet ought to be composed of small and everlasting flowers vig ptarmica austriaca and gnaphalium the muelhrooms fignify short duration or sudden rise and decay the scepter of judgment is long thin rod with knob on the top the end of the third book art of painting book iv of colouring chap of the colours and the ordering them it is remarkable that though the management of the colours in painting whether of figures landscape slowers architecture yields ’ great pleasure to the eve yet hitherto no one has laid down solid rules for doing it with safety and certainty contrast in mo- tion is founded on reasons which by practice we can in fhort time retain and inculcate to others as is also the division or proportion of the members since according to albert durer it may be mathematically demonstra- ted the same may be said of lights and shades by means of perspective all this may be thoroughly learnt in our juvenal years but the disposing of colours by and over each other in order to fetch put good union and harmony is not to this day fixed on certain principles meer chance is herein our only com- fort an engraved or etched print beautifully designed and disposed and agreeably lighted and shaded is very commendable but picture which besides those qualities requires an artful diversity of colouring merits the highest praise nevertheless masters have in their colouring their particular manners one has faint manner another dark one another grey manner some have flaring manner others muddy one occasioned by their not knowing that colours require an orderly disposition like an ingenious gardener who in the production of choice beautiful and large flowers considers what ground is proper and which needs dryness and which moisture and what sorts thrive best in each which re- quire sun and which call for shade which want improvement from pidgeon ’ dung and which from dog ’ dung in order thereby to make greater advantage than other other people do in like manner paimter if he makes thorough enquiries into che natures and effects of colours and against vohat grouuds they are best set off aud will hest anszeer their purpeses shall be convinced that he gains point above others by seeking much is found and notwithstanding any rubs in the way we must re- aew our- attempts how many attacks have made on flis fecret 'ere could make breach in it à had not intimated alexander and cut the gordian knot should have been still to seek shall now gladly impart to the artists ali my discoveries and improvements and refer it to his judgment whether they be of any moment the number of the colours is six and these are divided into tzoo forts the former sort contains the yelloz red and blue which are called capital colours the latter is mixed fort consisting of green purple and violet these have the aame of sroken colours waite and black are not reckoned among the colours but rather potentials or efficients because the others can not have their effects without the help of them- these colours have also their emblematic fignifications and particular properties the zehite is taken in general for light and black for darkness the yellow for lustre and glory the red for power or love the blue for the deity the purple for authority and jurisdiction the violet for fubjection the green for servitude the colours confidered in themselves are certain faculties imperceptible with- out the interposition of and laying on body like the moon which could not receive her light from the sun much less-communicate it ta us gtherwise than by means of body white is also that from wbich the coburs cone forth and the body whereby they become perceptible to ues the cofours give life to all things without in reference to the art of paenting those it would be imposlible to distinguisn between life and death wood and stone air and water gold and silver nay light and darkness they have particular great power uniting by their agreement separating by their force and crudity they cause some things to disappear in thin air and force others to appar out of the back-grounds their variety produces the utmost-charms and harmony as wel in nature as in picture especially when in the latter they are disposed by judicious hand for what is more beautiful in landscape than an azure fky green fields decked with thousand varioussy-coloured flowers differently-coloured grounds this russet or yellow that green or grey as each requires also the ornament of the brown cypress-tree the grey willow the fair olive the white poplar the green alder the red fir and joyful linden éach according to its nature add to this the diversity of stone-work how agreeable seems the porphiry of tombs the serpentine-stone obelfks the white marble vafes and termes even archi- tecture receives vast addition by the different colours of stones as when the dark grey stone free-stone white marble and such like are finely matched and put together and the building within is adorned with red-sperkled-greenish jasper porphiry ornaments of gold silver copper and alabaster and the floors inlaid with all forts of costly stones as lapis lazuli porphiry and variegated marble in order to please the eye but all depends on an orderly disposition it is impofible to effect any thing charming with such costlinefs if those colours be not duly matched and artfully placed it is therefore highly necessary that the artist know perfectly their natures and particular effects in order to proceed with certainty as good writer acquainted with letters bestows his thoughts on words only as forthe disposition it must be observed that as in an ordonnance of many figures divided into groups one of these figures is always the principal and to which all the rest must be subordinate according to their ranks so it is the same in the colours that they may altogether produce good general harmony nay were it recessary to place the three capital colours together the yellow must be forward the red next and the blue behind which will produce fine harmony- the three other colours may be disposed in the same manner when the pur- ple is placed forward the violet may be behind it and the green last as being the weakest these latter colours are called weak and broken because they possess very much the qualities of the former the purple for instance being produced by mixture of red with blue the violet the same and the green of blue with yellow but though each of the colours have it ’ different force and effect yet they do not observe any particular rank or order because strong colour sometimeshappens to come before weak one and the contrary as occasion requires for were they always te keep order and the yellow to be principal so that the others must diminisn gradually there wouldthen be no difference butthe effect always one and the same whercas it is here as with an actor who sometimes play king at others god vet if the principal part in picture whether through choice or neceffity con- sist of white light or weak colours the parts about it how beautiful soever will be no obstruction if they be but varioussy and well ordered again if the said principal part consist of yellow red blue or green and be thereby set off all the other parts ought to be intermixed here and there with- small portions of this strong and predominant part as if they were enamelled with it yet in such manner that they seem to owe their origin to the said ruling part and though separated yet have but one effect and uitethe whole like the great body of the moon surrounded with glittering stars this suffices for the ordering the colours in general and yet they can not have their full effects or due decorum without chusing proper back-grounds for setting them off agreeably avoiding those which create confusion or are too harsh and discordant of the former fort are such as follows white suits on all sorts of dark-grounds except warm yellow light yellow suits on purple violet blue and green light blue or green violet and yellow not warm or fiery light green has good effect on purple violet and blue light light violet has the same on green and blue on white suits black violet green and purple but not yellow or blue on light yellow fuits violet purple and green on pale red fuits green and blue on pale green fuits purple blue yellow and violet on pale blue suits dark yellow red and green but were we to lay dark blue on light yellow or the contrary it would appear very harsh and disagreeable there are other colours wbich are neither harsh nor disagreeable in themselves and yet appear unpleasant and without force as if one or the other were quite dirty and muddled such are purple on red beautiful red on yellow or beau- tiful green on yellow purple on blue or violet and the contrary also white on warin yellow and the contrary or red upon red or blue upon blue as ex- perience teaches touching the colours which are used in reflecting on changeable silk shall say this that with musk-colour suits best masticot with light purple or violet in the reflexions with affi-colour blue suits yellowisn white reflected with rose- colour with orpiment agrees dark purple with bluc reflexions on beautifui green suits rose-colour with light blue reflexions and with purple or violet agrees naples-yellow with -sea-green reflexions but we must especially observe that all reflecting or changeable stuffs kecep their own colour in the shade to wit that of the main light for we must not commit the same mistake as the old masters who painted all changeable draperies with two colours only as yellow changeable stuff with blue reflexion they made the main light yellow and the shade blue and thus they managed all others truly great mistake and quite contrary to naturé since we have thus far engaged in the by-colours and their effects and har- mony we shall also treat of thole which tend in particular to embellisn land¬ scape history or other painting on grafs pale red is exceeding well set off and appears pleasant to the eye as also dark violet dark blue light yellow changeable silk with red and white and light blue with purple or violet reflexions on russet earth grounds agrees à dark violet blue and dark green on dark grey stone commonly called blue-stone agrees light red green yel- low and yellowish white on free-stone suit all dark colours viz purple violet blue and green but we must not use colour of pure lake and white nor single light and red orpiment without urgent necessity and then very sparingly the green and red of one tint either in light or shade also disagree on account of their harshness wherefore they must not come together in piece of many or few figures which is to hang against dark ground or in shady place also in landscape against dark and close boscage white has fine effect especially naples-yellow red and light orpiment vermilion and fine light red again in light apartment of white marble orlight free-stone or in land- scape painted light clear and full of sky blue purple violet green and black have good effects whereas the colours before-named are in this case not only disagreeing but they also look weak and without strength except white which can- not be used too much since it is no colour and therefore suits any where ex- cept against fkies nevertheleis do not here asfert that the embellishments in the aforesaid pictures must consist only of light and warm colours but that they be intermixed with some dark and zeak ones and that in the latter pictures where we use dark and weak colours for the by-ornaments we must dispose some light and zoarm ones among them now some may possibly think because we place blue by the other colburs that such would obstruct the offskip or that the lointains which by reason of distance are commonly represented blue would be damaged by so beautiful spot but this doubt may be soon cleared up by considering that do not chuse here all dark colours but that the offskip will thereby in some measure appear more distant faint and uniting it is also true that blue in landscape is often harsh and makes the painting look flaring but by the darkness it becomes in this case soft natural and tender besides blue mention also violet green but my meaning thereby is not that it is indifferent zhere those colours are placed as blue against the blue of the sky green against greën trees violet against violet-stone or ground or light against light and darknefs against darknefs for that would be improper because as there is light and darkness in landscape so we have always means to give dark and light colours their places with candle-light either within or without-doors or other lights proceeding from fire suit violet purple blue green white black red without excep- tion these being pieces in which those colours have an advantageous effect and wherein they predominate on their proper grounds for yellow and red are almost the same as burning candle which has great effect by night as it has none in the day-time because the sun-shine makes it hardly perceptible now as the two former pictures consist of strong colours viz white yellow and red and the two latter of purple violet blue and green yet those of the one fort may be joined to those of the other in order to create an agreeable mixture and harmony by placing with the strong some that are weaker and on the con- trary letting each in its place have the mastery on its proper ground but have particularly observed that out of the three aforesaid predominant colours others may be tempered of less force brown oker with naples yellow pink with white and such like and placing them by the others as middle colours we may in conjunction with those others setch out great mafs since white has tts degrees as well as red always observing that the principal mnst predominaie both in force and beauty and that those colours which are drawn from it be dispersed here and there through the whole piece as being best set off against the general ground having now plainly shewed the qualities and uses of the colours and their differences we may easily think that the pictures wherein they are considered must needs be very affecting we shall not here say uhat where and how one colour mixed with another is to appear because it is impossible and unconceivable the principal method for obtaining this secret is to observe to what piich we work up our first and strongest colour and to let this colour predominaie for which reason it is maxim with some that we must not introduce into picture more than one capital colour or colour which represents it but have already shewn that several may in that manner be brougnt together in the same piece wherefore the eye and judgment must deter- mine this point for if we find it proper to introduce beautiful colour where we have mind to place such an one why should it be bad this only makes it so it being accompanied by by-colours not well ordered as warm colours against warm and grey near blue whereby those colours have no effect or else by placing too strong and too many capital colours by one another which overcome the aforesaid beautiful colour and make the painting look slaring but that we may not mistake in this point let us chuse any colour and in order to find an affociate for it take one which is discordant as if we pitch upon red take grey one if dark light one thus they are as proceeding from each other joined together and by such means we can never be at lois in finding different colours for different draperies yet with this proviso that in all those colours the force or distance of the figures must be observed for the ready obtaining these things have found out very easy method which always shewed me the particularity and harmony of the colours it even often helped me with certainty over the difficulty about the difference of the colouis in draperies especially such as were changeable first tempered on my pallet out of my general mixtures fhree particular colours viz one for the main light one for the half-hade and one for the shade then took cards and severally painted them with one of the aforesaid tempered colours when they were dry placed and replaced and shifted them so long till had satisfied my judgment sometimes when this would not answer my purpose shuffled them and then took parcel from them at random which if they happened to please were my directors this method helped me most in reflecting draperies which thereby often produced very advantageous and ef sine colour it was especially useful when had any doubt whether such or such colour would suit well with such or such an onc or not for the cards certainly shewed me the thing as well as if had the stuffs themselves and saved me the trouble of uncer- tain inquiries it will not be amiss to say something further touching back-grounds it often happens that person sees colour in picture which seems to him very agree- able and yet on imitating it he finds his colour has not the same force and effect through his not observing against what ground that colour was painted point worthy of the utmost attention if we would avoid mistakes in colouring wherefore we must always observe the grounds and places of the colours if we would have our colour predominate ordering the most disagreeing against it for instance to make the yellow predominate place blue against it or else the darks of other colours would you abare the force of yellow place green near it and to bring it lower put colour which proceeds from yellow whether it be free-stone or any thing else of yellow tint in the same manner you may handle all the rest of the colours observing that as the objects diminisn by distance so the colours must proportionably be fainter and gradually more grey nature shews it and yet have found that we may place even capital colour in the offskip and it shall be prevented from approaching by accompanying it with cclours like it and drawn originally from it as we have before shewed chap ii of the property nature and colours of dresses te have before said that the art of painting is an imitation of nature in her visible parts nothing is impracticable to it and yet observes due order in all things and as we have before shewed the general order of the colours so we shall now handle it in particular with respect to draperies wherein it chiesly lies draperies consist of four kinds of things viz linen silks stuffs and cloth and these have each their particular natures and manners of folds their properties are also different and to shew them by an example shall divide the kinds into the four times of the day linen draperies are for people in the morning of their lives silks for those in their zenith stuffs for those in the afternoon and cloih for those in the evening of their lives but to speak more intelligibly there are four particular conditions of men viz infancy youth manhood and old age and each provides dress according to his years children should be dressed in linen young people in silks full-grown men and women in stuffs and old people in cloth the colours for the several stages of life are these for childhood white for youth green for manhood red for old age dark violet and for death black in the first chapter we have shewed that white and black are not accounted among the colours since the one is but the parent of colours and the other the depriver of them wherefore we introduce white as light without which no calour is visible dark sillemot or tazny shall serve to represent the earth or greenness zohite to snew the water blue the air red thefire and black the darkness abcve the element of fire for there is not any matter or æther beyond it which can contain or be penetrated by the ’ sun ’ rays we also know that there are four seasons viz the joyful spring golden summer fruitsul autumn and melancholy winter in the spring we begin to leave off cloth or heavy winter raiment and to wear thin stuffs summer and autumn permit us to dress according to their heat either in linen or silk wherefore certain author says that we ought to suit our dresses as well as our words to the season the seasons may be also expressed by colours as the spring by green summer by yellow autumn by red and winter by black yet among the deities there are some who have always one proper dress and colour as jupiter purple mantle juno blue veil diana white and blue garment neptune sea-green one these we can not alter without committing mistake but the figures must nevertheless be ordered if possible zohere they suit best all brave personages of either sex should likewise be clothed in red or warm yellow it therefore behoves prudent artist to have perfect knowledge of the nature and qualities of the aforenamed stuffs even were the figures ever so small he must notwithstanding shew in his work of zehat sort of stuffs the dresses consist and although reftexions can not be well observed in small figures yet we ought to see by the course of the folds whether the draperies be silk cloth or other stuffs neat painter in little ought also not only to distinguisn the thickness and thinness of his draperies by their folds and colour but in the particular nature and colour of each drapery their diminutions and variations as between thin and thick silk opposed to sattin and more such for if the eye at first sight can perceive and distinguisn them we ought also to make them appear what they are chiessy in small and highly-finished pictures as mieris and others have art- fully done to such degree as plainly to distinguisn between silver pewter tin and polisned iron as becomingness subsists not only in the stuffs but also in their colours so knowing that we shall not easily mistake in the choice of colours and draperies but must here give some painters an hint about the nature of stuffs especially coloured ones they believe they can paint sattin after white silk and change- able silk after coloured silk but this is lame work for what in plain silk is shining in the light will often be found quite dark in satiin wherefore in this nature must be consulted for these reasons the eye is pleased when in painting of concourse of people or publick shew it can easily distinguisn all sorts of people and the conditions and ages of both sexes and at the same time their motions according to their natures and qualities and the dresses and colours which become them as an old man heavy and weak standing on both legs and sometimes by the help of stick becomes long dark-coloured cloth garment viz of umber dark violet fillemot or black fastened with strings or buckles and setting on him somewhat negligently young man should appear in quite contrary motion as being frolicksome fickle airy and standing often on one leg he must be painted in most beautiful purple green red or yellow drapery of light stuff or thick silk fastened on the shoulder and not too long that it may not hinder his con- tinual motion because man if full of fire loves to have his legs free women and young virgins as being tender sedate and modest are chiesly distinguished by their white garments of thin linnen and all sorts of airy and womanisn- coloured silks viz light blue apple-blossom pearl-colour or light lemon cast loossy on each- other and in such.- manner that the beauty of the naked may easily appear appear through them their posture is modest and set their legs close their bodies upright their necks basnfully bent their arms close to their bodies their mode gay and taking hold of their garments which hang down to the feet children are seen mostly in white linnen or lemon blue or violet-coloured silk they are often in white vests without any hanging drapery but when they have such loose drapery small one about yard in length is sufficient and this fastened on the shoulder for security while they are running bustling and rolling on the ground this conduct is in my opinion of great consequence though few have ob- served it nay even some good painters oftentimes fail in it making no differ- ence between manly and womanisn colours giving an old man feminine colour and manly onc to woman intermixing them as if there were no certain rules for either but it must be granted that the silk-colours which befit young sturdy capricious man are very disagreeable to virgin who is tender weak more sedate and less voluptuous he requires strong she more soft and beautiful colours yielding pleasure to the eye it would also be very improper to paint child in black young man in dark brown colours grown man in party colours and an old man in beautiful ones once saw picture of an unknown master in which all the particulars have recommended were plainly and nicely expressed it had such an elegance and gave me so great satisfaction that stood in surprize on mature con- sideration of this painting perceived that it was purely designed to answer this very purpose for saw here and there some aged people mostly in dark and cloth-colours there agam group of young and gamesome people in variety of beautiful-coloured stuffs also fome women in light-coloured changeable filk near them were some old women in dark dresses here and there ap- peared children running about and playing in the sand all drest in linen-habits and soft colours this ordonnance vastly pleafed me and put me to consider what it could be likened to and find it to be the same as the four times of the day for let us take the children whether boys or girls for day-break the young men and women for noon when the sun is at highest and the old people for night between mid-day and night is vesper or the evening which may be re- presented by joining something of both conditions also between aurora and mid- day the same so as make in the whole proper differenee between the conditions and ages of men here let us not forget that old people sometimes affect white to shew ’ their becoming children again contrarily black is sometimes worn by young people as thin black veil to signify some sorraw or else to distinguish married woman from maiden chap iii of tle colours of dresses and their fuiting with each other as we are treating of mresses it will be proper to say something of the suiting their colours mean what lining or furniture each coloured garment re- quires quires matter of great moment though as little observed in pictures as the life wherefore let it be noted first of the weak colours when the apper garment is white the lining or undercoat may be rose-colour fillemot purple violet or beautiful sea-green with light blue garment suits furniture of yellowish white violet dark fillemot or dark reddish blue light or pale yellow garment ought to be furnished with violet sea-green beautiful green dark fillemot and purple pale green garment must be set off with yellowish white sky-colour violet and dark red now follow the strong colours and their proper mixtures lemon-colour garment may be furnished with sea-green violet and dark fillemot garment of red orpiment-colour suits furniture of violet sky and greenish blue musk and umber-colours sky-colour blue garment may be adorned with rose-colour yellowish white pale yellow and light beautiful green fillemot-coloured garment may be furnished with pale yellow rose-colour light afhi-colour violet dark purple and dark green all these colours reversed have the same effects here let it be observed what mean by the word ljurniturej it is an adorn- ment or setting off as when large drapery of plain colour is adorned with one or more small ones whether veil girdle or sleeve-facing under garment or breast- cloth this furniture is either of changeable silk or of party-coloured stuffs when it is to set off large and plain coloured drapery and the contrary the same as when the large drapery is changeable the small furniture ought to be of single colour for further satisfaction shall subjoin an instruction of what coloured stuffs may be best adorned with gold whether slowered leafed or striped on green ground fuit flowers on purple and violet narrow sprigs or stripes on musk-colour close and large flower or leaves on rose-colour apple-blossom and white thin silk suit stripes purple fillemot musk-colour and white also look well with fringes either scanty or full according to the substanee of the stuff it must be observed that what have hitherto said of the ordering of the colours is not to concern single figure only but to serve any occasion by diffu- side and agreeable intermixture nor do mean that among several figures there must be but one with- single-coloured garment and the rest of changeable or broken colours for-when they are separate and the draperies large each in par- ticular is to be set off in the manner have before laid down for instance if all the small draperies were separated from the large one and we drest as many figures in them then each must be further adorned with other small draperies of colours suiting with-it in such manner as the large one was before in word if we only confider that single colout ought to be intermixed with change- able one and changeable colour with single one we shall perceive what order this affair requires in order to look decorous and please the eye but for further explanation shall give two examples of it the first is company of five or six aged people either without or within-doors now if these figures must be all drest it requires no art nor is it sign of knowledge to give each single-coloured and equally large drapery although we might find as many different colours in order to join them agreeably and this for two reasons first because that can not happen in the life without premeditation and secondly because the figures may not seem to be emblematic for though to the twelve apostles are appropriated their particular colours yet we must not infer from thence that if they were all asfembled together we ought to give them single colour from top to toe because though we break the colurs they yet remain the same as blue with green reflexion remains blue yellow with purple remains yel- low and so of others our second example is wanton meeting of young men and girls modishly drest according to their years these are skipping about and playing in field or room now it would not be at all proper to join all their dresses of broken colours together though they were coupled in such order as they require and for the former reason namely that it can never happen but through premeditation and necessity and though it would appear elegant and pleasing yet not at all artful without an intermixture of some single-coloured draperies nevertheless we find many do it either because they take no delight in change- able draperies or else because they can not paint them and therefore make shift with broken colours again there are others who have no value for single colours and therefore on all occasions introduce changeable or broken ones we have also met with third sort who do not know how to make difference between changeable stuff and broken colour though it is certain that re- flecting or changeable drapery is an intermixture of two or more colours and broken-coloured drapery but of two as violet with red and blue green with yellow and blue whence they are called broken or miwed colours in the first chapter treating of this management we have spoken of reflecting or changeable draperies and as we are now again embarked in the same subject it will not be amiis to explain the matter further many fancy they make good reflecting drapery when it is well folded and different in colour in the main lights greatest shades and reflections even raphael and other great masters have been mistaken in so doing whereas good changeable drapery ought to dracv its reflections from the colour of which the main light consists the shade likewise proceeds from the ruling colour yet has some tincture of the changeableness and although the drapery be changeable yet it has constant ground-colour of the main woor of the silk thus it is an usual ex- prefsiona green and yellow changeable this then is the true quality of re- fecting silk that all that is seen fronting on the relief keeps its main colour but the sides of the folds going off cause the changeableness which we may easily perceive on lay- ung changeable stuff smooth on table or floor for viewing it perpendicularly from above it will then appear red or vellow but if seen parallel along the stuff often appear blue when it follows as we affirm that only the folus which go eff become changeabee and alter in colour when thet others in the main light and shade keep their own colours again what in one stuff changes red will in another appear green or yellow according to the woof or warp by reason of such accidents we are obliged to have pieces of particular stuffs in order to shew the difference which can not be learnt by heart because of the nicety of the matter we have said in the foregoing chapter that in an ordonnance of many figures we ought to observe the sexes ages and conditions of people and that each must have his proper stuff the golden suits deities and those who are deified purple becomes princes thus each down to'the slave now to those of weak memories shall shew good method for their becoming masters of this point in fhort time set down in your pocket-book the following heads or titles old men and mairons married men and women young men aud maidens boys girls and young children place these titles under one another and write against them the proper dress stuff and colour of each sex and condition these notes you must often consult and especially when you are about an ordonnance of fewor many figures you may also make column for the colours of draperies setting them down under one another as white yellow blue green red and against them write their linings andi ornaments asthave before mentioned it will not be improper here to observe some particutars on different occasions in an ordonnance of many or few figures with respect to colours noé as if they were unknown or not observed by ingenious artists but because they are often- times neglected and slighted either through carelessness prepoffession or an opinion that they need not- be so -strictly confined or else because beautiful colours are most pleasing to people and therefore they must especially satisfy the eye without reflecting that they thereby injure the art and their own reputa- tations such painters are like great talkers who say little to the purpose truly the colours have great efficacy when-well orderedi and suired bug they raise an aversion when unskilfully and confusedly disposed an ingenious person will undoubtedly agreë with me that there are particulur characters which distinguisn one man from another pringeefrom anpfficer aan officer from vulgar person rich man froin pgor one by whaf means then is this difference perceivedp is it not by his authoritative countenance grandeur and stately carriage and by his garb-songer ansf of miore costly stuff and beauty than the others if 'so it will be éasy to appiehend that though luch person were not endowed with all the aforesaid qualities but with the- contrary he ought nevertheless to be made known by something ior other as we have shewed in treating of ordonnante whefore is it needless ten say any thing further in this matter to bring us to the present point touiching the colours namely to shew on what occafions they olght to be used beautifully and op what not for which purpose shall éxhibit three principal accuriences as exaiples whence we may deduce and order all others the first may be à coüneil or lriumph or such liké wherein all the- dressés ought to appear intirely of the tuost magnificent rich and beautiful stuffs in the second confisting of bacchanals country-merry-makings and herdfinen ’ sports the colours ought to be half beautiful and half broken each agreeable to the condition of the parties and in the third being publick sights viz pleadings mountebanks jugglers merry- andrews and such like made up of common and mean people coarse stuffs and dirty colours ought to be be most visible now here it still is to be remarked that in the one fort of colours as well as the other the most beautiful excels and as those three occurrences are not common imust say that among the meanest as well as the best there are some which have the preference among the beautiful are some more beautiful and among the mean meaner ones thus much as to colaurs in order to know good master but ere we finisn this chapter iet us observe in what parts thé coloured stuffs appear most beautiful since stuffs are very different in this respect and have their divers proper beauties we say then that black stuffs are most beautiful in their strongest saades zuhite yellozp and red in their main and greateft light and blue green and purple in the half tints but all stuffs not having glofs ought to be much more beautiful in their lights than their shades because light gives life and makes the quality of the colours appear when contrarily snades obscure and extinguish their beauty consequently all objects will shew their natural colours better when their surfaces are lefs fmooth and even as we see in cloths linen leaves and herbs which are rough or hairy in which no gloss or shining can appear because they can not receive the reffexions of neigbouring objects but fhew only their true and natural colour unmixed nor tinged with that of any other object except the rednefs of sthe sun when by his tetting he makes the clouds and horizon partake of his colour chap of the disposition of sbady objects either distant or near against light ground ight against light and fhade against shade naturally unite against llight ground suit well dark figures and against dark ground light 'ones in order that they may be strongly set off however the setting off of objects either much little or less on the sirst second and third grounds certainly differs very much now it may be afked when parcel of figures standing or sitting have zobite back-ground and appear some far from others rear others against it whether dark colours would not be proper in allthe three groups say they would but then they ought to be confidered in another manner for without intermixing some of them with light colours they could not subsist wherefore it is neces- sary to give some more others less force the figures close to the white ground ought to be mixed with light colours in order to stick to the light and to break the less their force and yet the dark colours will predominate the light ones of colouring only as say to have communication with the white ground thereby to keep their distance and to unite with the great light of the back ground the figures on the second ground which come more forward ought again to have less light colours and the group on the fore ground the least whereby they have less communication with the white ground and consequently more force against it it is the same with light against darknefs for we can easily perceive that white and black never approach each other without participation the more black is mixed with white the more it inclines to white like large and thick festoon mostly light placed against dark ground now if you would have this festoon appear close to the wall for it is not with nature as with picture you must needs use it in some dark flowers and leaves ordering them about the extremity the moft white or light to be in the parts moft relieved darkening it gradually towards the two extremities nearest the ground whereby the one sticks to the other and unites remaining yet light festoon though intermixed vith darkness it is the same with dark festoon against light ground the dark flowers being in the middle and gradually diminisn on each side it is certain that it will not shew such decorum and relief though its shade be in proportion as strong as that of the former yet it is only to be used in case of necessity when the matter and condition of the place require it wherefore we must accommodate ourselves to all exigencies this effect is not only proper for slowers but also for fruits ornaments even all kinds of gold and silver ornaments may with elegance be joined together by the colours after the same manner now follows an example in plate xxi disposed after the aforesaid manner here on the fore ground appear five figures of men and women against white back ground the three middle ones close together are dark and strong and the two on either side of little lighter colour whereby the group keeps an agree- able relief and union on the extremity on more distant ground stand two other figures of which the foremost is dark and the other half behind the former light yet both of less strength than the foremost group the last four standing close against the ground differ still much from the others as being here and there intermixed with more light one having white stomacher another white cloth on her head this having flowers that with light hair another with white pot light drapery nudity which littlenesses notwithstanding have not so much force as to enlighten the whole group the doctrine of harmony teaches that we must always place darkness against light and the contrary but this is only medium shewing agreeable to that position how and in what manner light and darkness may appear either close to- gether or distant like the aforesaid festoons but it must not be considered other- wise than as part of picture if we would have perfect ordonnance we can order at pleasure fuch dark figures as those against light grounds and the contrary for instance would you have on the right side of the piece adark bush in the mièdle visto and on the other side houses or stone-work neither light nor-dark you may place against the buih light figures or other objects and in the middle against the offscape dark ones and against the houses others again which suit best execute each correctly and in particular according to the said examples and then nothing will be wanting that concerns the tints the colour joined toit make the work compleat think have fully explained this point of darkness against light and the con- tray yet several things serving my purpose still occuring to me which were for- got in the first chapter judge them proper to be mentioned here say then that all light colours even were they broke appear well ’ against dark ground but not with such force as the strong ones as we have formerly said that warm colours appear best on faint ground and the contrary whether they be light or dark it is also constant rule that the strong colours as light red and light yellow do not suit on light or white ground more than beautiful blue on dark one though reckoned capital colour but let us return to our examiple we have hitherto only spoken of the tints or light and darkness it will now be necessary to shew also the colours of the dresses according to their order place and power no is sea-green yellowisni grey violet less beautiful green than no violet not beautiful but the girdle beautiful light yellow oker and violet reflection — greenisn blue red orpiment — violet umber with little red observe now from behind forwards whether these figures as they advance do not become gradually stronger by the intermixture of strong colours the off-group has none that in the middle has one and the foremost two of which one is very strong lf it be afked why place here the strong one namely red orpiment as hav¬ ing no force against light ground say it must be observed as the foremost fi- gure being encompassed with two dark ones let it also not be thought because thus exhibit the colour of each figure that they ought therefore to be of the same colour from top to toe consult the sketch and remember their draperies one large another small of broken and faint colours with which they are intermixed and suit the ground as we have already intimated that in order to form great masses of capital colours viz yellow red or blue and they to predominate in an ordonnance we may enlarge or break such strong part with mixtnres of the fame as ted orpiment with brown oker umber or such like zohich nevertheless remains yellow after such manner we may handle all the colours to wit beautiful green with other green red with purple violet with blue or grey yellowish white with grey in à word if but one of the two be less beautiful chap of the harmony of colours they who are conversant with books are sensible that few-authors have written of the harmony of colours and what they have done is so obscure and unintelligible that shall endeavour to make the point clear it must be granted that in every part of the art nature is our patern since she disposes herself in the most perfect manner if we at any time discover some- thing fine and pleasing in her which we often do and yet know not the réason why it has such elegance and decorum we ought to consult the rules of disposi- tion and harnony and examine with which of them the objects agree by which means we shall soon apprehend what decorum is and on what reason founded harmony proceeds from placing faint colours against strong ones and the con- trary wherein such an union appears that the one seems naturally to floi from the other as in this instance let us suppose an ordonnance to be divided into three grounds or distances place the principle figures in the middle on the fore- ground and let some of them be strongly coloured and the whole group as strongly slung off by shady hollow rock coming behind them place to the right on the second ground some figures beautifully coloured yet tint darker than those on the fore-ground and behind them an airy greyish-green bush and further on light offscape filled here and there with small trees let this bush be tint darker than the second ground-figures on the left side of which ground place other figures as of girls and young children in faint-coloured draperies which though coming against light buildings and the blue sky of the offscape will notwithstanding appear beautiful and harmonious now in such disposition we are enabled to perceive horv each of the three parts keeps its distance by the nature of the ground behind it the foremost as the strongest and consisting mostly of light approaches with force against the greatest snade and those on each side though almost as light yet are limitted by their back grounds which differ but one tint from them whereby they appear neither further nor nearer than they really are from all which premises we may plainly perceive that granting those three parts or groups had like strengih and colour yet they may by means of their back grounds be brought down in such manner that at pleafure only one of them shall predominate and the other tzoo retire would you have the fore- mest figures dark reverse your former conduct and your purpose is answered thus you may easily join grounds and objects in order to fetch out harmony and by harmony one of the perfections of painting but the more clearly to evince the force of colours against proper grounds with respect to distance shall explain the matter in second example see plate xxii irepresent the boat as thé nearest object gilt with gold and strongly glittering against the shade of the trees and rock to the foremost flying figure on tke same distance as the boat give light red drapery against the shadiness of the said rock in force equal to that of the boat the second flying figure somewhat further in has green drapery also light against the rock where being broken colour it becomes fainter and the third which is further in shade and has dark blue drapery is flung off and keeps its place at the furthest part of the hol- low of the rock which with the yellowisn blue sky next it is lightish the stand- ing figure in the stern or off-part of the boat is more strongly fet off by dark and warm yellow drapery against the aforefaid hollow than the blue garment of the hindermost flying figure and less than the boat ’ head and timbers which have the greatest force as being the greatest part doubled by the reflexion in the water on the river-side against the trees are seen other figures partly naked and in faint-coloured draperies viz apple-blossom light changeable and white intermixed here and there with yellow and their reflexions and that of the green of the trees in the water now those figures though faint and light are in their diminution of force in the same degree with the middle flying figure as having the same distance and being of the same nature and composed of broken colours so also the red of the foremost flying figure agrees with the yellow of the boat both being strong colours the rowers are in dark blue though this example sufficiently enables us to manage any ordonnance whatso- ever yet mean not that there must be always forwards yellow object behind it blue one and in the middle green purple or violet for you may chuse zohat colour you please as instead of this gilt boat red one and give the fore fly- ing figure instead of red yellow drapery affigning to each proper back ground although the yellow of the boat and tne red garment of the figure are strong co- lours yet they are distinct in nature for as the yellow is in itself lighter than the red so the red requires darker colour than the yellow in order to be flung off again if instead of the figures by the river-side which are clothed in apple-blos- som blue we would use other colours as green or red we may do so pro- vided as before we give them such proper back ground as will fling them off with respect to their distance for it must be remarked that although they are distant yet there is no necessity for giving them faint or broken colours li is maxim with me that any colour how strong soever may be moderated and restramned ac- cording to its distance the colours in this example are disposed accotding to their ranks the strong ones forward and the weaker in degrees of distance accord- ing to their natures only to shew the method of placing them in word whe- ther they are to approach because of their natural strength or to retire by reason of their natural weakness but it is scarce possible that in ary subject all the colours sheuld according to their natures happen to fall so advantageously and therefore we may on any occasion alter them for instance if instead of the gilt boat we were to intro- duce piece of white marble adorned with mouldings and bafs reliefs and strongly lighted the visto behind turned into close ground and the trees be- hind the stone-work instead of greyisn more sensible warm and approaching this stone say would have the same effect as the boat and come forward with force though white we all know is not so strong colour as yellow for herein it will happen as in camp where in the general ’ absence the liestenant-gene- ral commands and in company and in company the lieutenant for the cap- tain tain and the ensign for him even the serjeant is not without his power there- fore when strong-natured colours are not in picture the weaker supply their places in greater or less degree as the matter requires wherein lies the crisis of the management let me add to this instance of the white stone-work- that it must be the strongest and most catching object in the whole ordonnance and that no strong objects must come near it to lessen it ’ force or to kill it unless they be weakened and brought down either by mistiness or by means of their back- grounds whereby they may then have no more force than broken colour chap vi of the dispofition of irregular objects and light against darkness and the contrary hhe placing and ordering of objects is of great moment for if after we have chosen them all most beautiful we dispose them carelesly they will abate of their lustre again good dispofition will make an object though un- elegant in itself look agreeable to give fome examples of it fhall begin with plate xxiii on the fore-ground on the right fide is lying an overset pot against large overset pot against large ftone and both of them strong and warm in the light against the darkness of same high trees which are on the second ground on the third ground lowver and by the water-side rifes columned building which is light again in the middle of the piece the horizon appears very low with some hills and on the fore-ground ape three figures making the greatest group and mostly in warm and dark-coloured draperies against the faintness and light of the offscape on the second ground is young man who with the house at the door of which he stands is beloz in the shade occafioned by the ground-shade of the trees opposite to it this house is of free-stone and therefore light against the blue fky the foreground has no verdure and is all light chiefly about the figures this iketch shews us the irregularity of objects in an ordonnance and how we ought to dispose them according to art some high ofhers low together with their force in order to create deverfified decorum by objects imean both the move- able and immoveable viz men cattle birds trees hills buildings as well horizontal as falling back behind each other as to force it consists in light against darkness and the contrary for except by the diverfity of colour there is no other way than this to set off objects against one another we have faid that the three fore-ground figures are strongly coloured and come againft the faint offacape whereby shew that in one piece there ought pot to be two lights on the same ground although they are both strongly set off hut that one part must consist of strong light and the other of darkness it is al- so casy to conceive that the three figures because they come against the light off- scape scape and not into shade must needs require dark colours contrarily the pot and stone are set off against the dark trees by general rule that when there are some light objects on one side of the composition those on the other should be dark let us now view seeond example in plate xxiv as being an observation de- pending on the former seeing neither can subsist without the other this tends to illustrate the management of lights both above on each side and behind one ano- ther and that we ought always to order after such manner when the former example shew us the irregularity of objects in their high and loze disposition the forward sitting figures are with the first ground dark as being shaded by driving cloud so also is the walking figure down to its middle the building on the second ground fronts the light together with the two standing figures which are set off by the dark side of the house the-three hinmost figures are in the shade of the same building against the sky which is their ground the column also on the second ground is almost to the top in shade against the hind- most trees which run to the point of sight the man is half again in the light against the dark column and his under parts which with the first ground are dark are set off against the second ground which is light but it is not sufficient to place here or there ground-shade we must also shew the occasion of it that it may not be afked what caused it for all snades are not alike some are more dark others more clear moreover they differ also some- times in colour wherefore it will not be amiss to say sometliing of it here though shall treat of it more at large in its place the ground shade of trees often appears lefss or more green according to their transparency or closeness the ground-shade -caused by driving clouds is faint and has no other colour than that of the air between the ground shade of red green or blue stretched curtain is also of the same colour those of an house or other heavy piece of stone-work are grey and dark but 'to return to our subject it is plain that what is demonstrated in these two examples touching light and darkness above on each side and behind one another is the same when re- versed namely if that which is now dark were light and ’ the light dark it is also indubitable that if one of the lights were taken away the ordonnance and agreeable harmony would be spoiled at once even so much as not to be brought right again withont general alteration for instance suppose the walking person were dark above how could he be set off by the column since we have beforé said that darkness against darkness is improper and were thé column to be light how should we manage the sky.. and if the sky were dark behind the co- lumn that would be as bad again for the whole fore ground and all upon it are dark and the second ground is light again wherefore every thing would be in disorder and indecorum from these premises we may plainly perceive that this is constant method for management and when good difposition of the colours according to their qualities is joined to it for we knniv that objects have various colours of which we can chuse the most proper the decorum will still he the greater and the eye more pleased trees though they appear always green are yet yet diversified according to the season and their natures some are sea-green others deep green this russet that grey-green these again light green others dark green grounds likewise differ as hilly sandy clayish and muddy stones do the same all which we have fully shewed in the first chapter of this book as for men none excepted what colours have they not in fine he who well understands the or- dering of the colours and the suiting them will never be at loss but let him especially observe that in any ordonnance whether of history landscape or any other branch one side must be contrary to the other not only in light ands shade but also in height and depth the designs of these two examples are not much unlike that in the foregoing chapter yet here is greater variety for the former was of the force of objects either dark or light against contrary grounds whereas these though grounded on the same observation shew us how they are to be ordered above one another when it so falls out for instance we see group of figures on the fore ground against another on the second ground somewhat higher and that against another still higher and so on to the cieilng or sky we have shewed in chap how we ought to set off objects behind one another and to unite them with the ground but these ex- amples teach first how light and dark objects above one another ought to be mamaged so as to serve each other and that each may keep its distance secondly how for warn of shade we must make shift with the affistance of colours lastly how irregular objects ought to be placed against each other which is the soul and life of an or- donpances especially where there are many people but it is not confined to hu- mas figures for it respects all sorts of objects whether grounds hills ballu- strades ragtlements windows roofs clouds and sky in fine every thing we can see behind ’ any thing else whereon people can appear speaking of clouds it must réobserved that we may reprefent figures flying in the air and sitting on clouds the same manner as on the earth matter of principal concern on the occasion where the major part of the objects consists of height and many are at lost in the different lights colours and tints wherefore docible artists à regards his as an infallible rule and consider every thing which have laid down in the bresaid examples to prevent your falling into the mistakes which are gerein finally committed shall now subjoin third sketch plate xxv touching the crossing and going off of sequel of the two preceding example boat going off against crofs height or earthern wall rivers people were leaning by one another who with the trees rising be- the regularity of the wall the approaching figures appear again offscape which runs acrofs is in strong light against the shady wall which ends in the middle where the foremoft approaching figures are set off with light both hindward dark figures which have their effect again against the light of the buildings in the offscape the sky on the right side of the piece abounds with heavy hanging clouds and on the other side are none orlvery small ones here we perceive first greot motion in the disposition of the objccts which cross crofs each other up to the horizon on one side and on the other the contrary which causes an agrecable variety especially as there are some objects going off which shew the point of sight the second obfervation is the harmany of lignt and shade as in the former examples this example then shews what methods we may take in order to fetch out such effects and it is for that reason that this point is exhibited severally and in different manners which we may make use of as occasion offers as much or as little as we think proper though never too much since variety tires no one but is always pleasing as here visto there boscage houses here winding road there again building hiding part of the offscape here level ground there river beset with trees partly running towards the point of sight and then bending either to the right or left-cross the piece round rock and at last to dis- appear variety feeds continual delightful desire but we must know that it principally respects ordonnances in the open air or landscapes chap vii of agreebleness in irregular and contrasting objects twe have not knowledge in composition all that we endeavour at is- extrava- gancy even should we bring out good disposition it would be owing to luck when well-ordered piece though indifferentlv coloured will always have an harmony the truth of this find clearly evinced in irregular objects which give life and motion to an ordonnance as we have several times shewed in treat- ing of ordonnance and also in the first and last examples of the foregoing chapter this motion is happily fetched out if the contrasting objects be considerately joined for by this means they will meet each other so agreeably as perfectly to please the eye not as placed thus by nature but as the result of an artful com- position by the irregularity of objects understand their forms as when one is high another is oblong this pointed that square round oval but ere proceed further shall shew the easy method took in order to get the know- ledge of irregularity first drew all sorts of figures in different actions as sitting standing stoop- ing lying walking and cut them out with seifsors next made sketch of my ordonnance and laid it down flat and put my cut figures upon it moving them about till was satisfied where to place fitting standing or lying one how many suited here how few there and thus after much shifting brought forth good ordonnance which then designed fair making such alteration in the actions of the figures as thought proper yet retaining their postures in general leaving large and standing one where they ought to be and the small ones lying or sitting in their places and so forth by this means have found that landscape with many and small figures ought to consist of large by-works for setting them off viz large and close trees heavy stone-work broad grounds and zoithin-doors in palace or apartment cross there ought to be behind small figures large and flat walls with sew ornaments for were they to consist of many parts all would seem alike large and were we to place by large figures some large parts all would appear small or to speak better equally large large object must make another small an oblique one another together that the one may shew the other it is the same with light if large part consist either of light or shade let one be the groundfor the other for instance if on the second ground large part be in shade let the third have some sharp and glittering light this will help the broad shades and wanton lights but those two choices require different management the principal ought always to precede and the other to be subservient to it in landscape the immoveable objects predominate and the moveable ones serve only for ornament contrarily in an ordonnance the figures are first dispesed and then the by-works for when we say that an upright standing figure must be placed by bending tree and crooked stem by standing figure we understand by the former the stem to be the principal and the figure the affistant if in landscape but in an history the figure is principal thus it is also in an apartment with architecture statues bass- reliefs and other ornaments the irregularity of objects does therefore give particular decorum and elegance for what satisfaction would it be to the eye to see some beautiful grapes and melons lye each in separate disnp but if grapes melons or other gibbons round oval and large fruits were grouped together they would add lustre to each other we know that small house visibly magnifies temple or palace and that long and low building makes tower or mausoleum look high such contrarietiès as these aré many and to name them all would be as tedious as impossible wherefore shall content myself with naming some of the chief plate xxvi the examplé no with an high horizon shews the ordering of objects according to perspective the steps run up against parapet the figure sits on the ground where the steps rise and forward where they sink stands the figure the point of light is on the horizon no shews the contrary of the former when the horizon is loze flate xxvii no shews that lying objects require standing figures no is the contrary by lying figures ought to be introduced high standing objects viz columns trees and the like with gyramid ending in point or an high and narrow square stone suit stooving sitting and lying figures also standing figures but mosdly in profile under or with statues in niches or on pedestals agree no set standing figures unless one be sitting with thin bushies or cut coppicès suit best standing leaning and stooping figures but not any lying or sitting against an elegant stone with bafs-reliefs ought to be figures with slat and broad- solded druperies the contrarily is also good with strait-coursed river broken shores and banks with lying cattle standing men and the contrary with horses asses and coxs agree boys with sheep goats and other small cattle fuit full-grevon people with stat mufical instruments suit round ones viz the hautboy lute and the like with timbrel cymbal or triangular ringed iron but when any thing is introduced into an ordonnance to create contrast the principal piece which we would break by the by-work must always predominate chap viii of strong objects against faint grounds and the contrary or darkness against light and light against darkness taving already spoken largely about the management of the colours which is one of the capital parts of painting have taken great pains in building some rules thereupon with view that when occasion required might give under my present misfortune this comfort is left good reasons for so doing that now have nothing to hinder what firmly purpose and therefore can con- sider it with more vigour than ever ieven imagine it in degree equal to nature herself since know perfectly the strength and nature of colours and their effects consider then the following example plate xxviii whether it be of moment the man in warm fillemot drapery is against the faint offscape the woman bin light blue drapery against the trees behind her or beautiful sky-colour blue and pale red again dark beautiful red and rose-colour or purple and white these are the principal and most suitable alterations besides changeable stuffs some perhaps may afk whether the blue drapery which we place here against the offscape does not contradict what we have formerly said namely that blue is reckoned among the weak colours and yet here we asfert warmth against faintness and the contrary to which answer negatively because we call warm colours those which are pure and unmixed viz beautiful sky-blue beautiful yellow and beautiful red whereas when those colours are mixed with white their warmth no longer subsists because their darkness gives the glow we see on the contrary that light blue light yellow and light red even white itself serve for weak colours against the dark as this example shews the reason why ought now to be of single or capital colour is because the offscape being made up of so many tender and faint colours shall have no communication with it which makes the one the better retire and the other ap- praach does the same contrarily this small example is of such nature that any ordonnance of what kind soever as well within doors as in the open air taken from it must be good if we introduce instead of the offscape building with bafs-reliefs figures or other ornaments of weaker colour or else of marble it will answer the same purpose and if instead of the trees we exhibit curtain grotto rock or other building of warm stone it will be the same again with respect to colour but if come against flat ground of one colour whether grey or white then that figure may be of different colours or changeable stuff likewise if we place bagainst an hanging or party-coloured ground that figure must needs be of single colour or drapery wherefore we are enabled to judge how far this obser- vation extends yet as this example shews only light and darkness we shall subjoin another in plate xxviii aforesaid with third or middle tint which with the former will suffice for giving right notion of composing all forts of ordonnances as well within doors as in the open air as before said although the design were to consist of or more groups observing the grounds against which they come whether faint strong distant or near to the end those groups may by the force of light or weak colours obtain their due beauty speak not in reference to any one in particular but all in general we find that when dark colours are placed against faint offscape they are vifibly set off and make the one appear distant and the other near and the more when we set some light and weak colours on the fore ground whereby they still have greater effect as we may observe in figure from which premises it is plain that the same can be effected by the contrary method so that the argument of some namely that strong and warm colours ought always to be placed forwards in order to approach the more and the weak ones to be in proportion to their distance the fainter the further is en- tirely overthrown for want of considering that the stress lies mestly in the back ground the example now before us is like the former the fore ground excepted which is added to it the better to explain our meaning in the ordering the colours to advantage by which method we can dispose our ordonnances with ease and so as to fetch out beuatiful harmony see plate xxviii aforesaid place on the left side on the fore ground in the grafs sitting woman with her right leg fronting the light having white under garment and over it red one she rests her right hand on dark greeaish-blue pot little further be- hind her stands an half column of grey stone which sets her off and whereon leans an old philosopher drest in dark blue having on his head crown of green leaves on the right side on the fore ground which is sandy and here and there intermixed with russet lies large flat basket of dark russet colour and in it is large italian pumpkin on à beautiful dark blue cloth spreading half out of the basket on-the light ground by it stands girl drest in rose-colour holding her lap open behind her appears an heavy white terme and on the left side from her stands woman drest in light violet who is putting garland on the terme the girl is in profile and the woman fronting the philosopher shews to the wo- man before him the terme which sne turns towards and looks at the terme girl and woman are close together making with the ground great light against chap ix of the painting objects dustily here is still one thing which many painters carelessly pafst over though very useful and elegant if well and naturally observed it relates to such cbyects as are dusty as well in rooms as in garden for though the former be some- times swept and the latter cleaned yet pedestals balluitrades parapets vafes and statues always escape galleries and public places for walking in are like- wise seldom cleaned it is therefore in my opinion very improper in those who with great care represent the pavements of the said places with stones of divers colours very distinctiy jointed one dark another light without spot of unclean- ness which makes it very difficult to get good decorum or cause those pavements to look stat without offence to the eye causing moreover an excessive stiffnefs be the colours ever so well ordered whereas usually in large apartment daily walked in we can not in the afpresaid distinct manner perceive what the colours of the floor are except towards the extremities and next to the walls wherefore the middle where is the most walking must appear dull uniting and almost of one sint some painters ex- press the compartments of such floors so distinctly that you would even imagine they xeere wet grant indeed that sometimes in the life it is so by means of the dark stone yet if we break and make them little lighter they will then not stare so much and yet be no less natural as if an apartment were surrounded with marble surbase and the middle of the room were gilt cistern by which the floor may very well appear strong because of its agreement with the marble and the glitter of the cistern ine ni for my part should rather chuse plain floor than comparted one but if we lie under necessity to introduce the latter the best method will be to unite the colouring in such manner that the tints differ but litile from each other this observation does in an especial manner affect landscape since it is certain that the parts which abound with trees whether woods or sides of roads are sub- ject to rain and wind and by means of dust or sand the greens tombs pyramids vases and all other objects in such places are so sullied and covered that the true colours of the said objects are hardly perceptible for instance in such place as we now speak of stands red tomb on black plinth now if we make this tomb or plinth too dark or too strong it will look as if it had been zoffied whereas contrarily it ought by means of the dust of the branches and leaves which some- times fall on it to be so covered over that we shall scarce perceive whether the tomb be red or the plinth black. although some may think this obfervation too trifling and far-fetched it is ne- vertheless highly necessary in order to find besides by other methods the likelihood in picture whether it be for breaking thereby in some measure and uniting objects which through the nature of their colour would have too great force or for any other cause yet not without reason that it may not appear too affected but here methinks hear some object that if we thus observeinievery thing this dust and sully long gowns and trained cloaths can not be free from it espe- cially those of women which are commonly of beautisul and light colours and- must must consequently be at the bottoms as well as their white sandals more or less disty tothe no smalf ianighter and wonder of the people to which anfwer that should more wonder to see person come dry out of the water than clean out of dust and dirt for though we do not see it observed by others who have always made the sandals beautiful and white even those of common soldier as well as of general and trained gown the sams yet say that this observation does not tend to countenance mistakes but to make us mindful of the nature of things and to express them in our pictures with all likelihood more or less as the matter requires not superfluoussy but in moderation virtue which taking place in other things should not be neglected in this point judicious master will observe an equilibrium in order to prevent aversion since things roo beauriful are unnatural and those which are too dirty disagreeble to every one this management would also not be justifi- able could we not as have said perceive the reason of it as in poor people coun- trymen and such like with old and tattered cloaths which wear not without soiling and gathering dust this observation is of no use to- those who not apprèhending the causes of things will have every thing as beautiful as possible whereas likelihood should ap- pear in all parts prudenter agendo th art of painting book iv of lights and shades chap of the different lights of picture judge this point to be one of the most important in the art of painting for without thorough knowledge of it it is impossible to to make good picture wherefore shall shew all that by dis- course can bring forth as the result of what have learned by many observations and long experience of common light objects in common light have no broad sharp lights and their shades are uncertain the second tint and shade keep their own colours much better in clear air without clouds because the objects being lighted on all sides without vapour appear sensible and more relieved than in sun-shine this light think best for portraits and such objects as we would have enlightened from without the pic- ture as an open gallery or such like place and though the objects thus lighted have no great force we nevertheleis find that the main touches both in lignt and snade are stronger than in ocher lights this light gets great elegance and advantage by lozo horizons when it makes greater fhades as under the leasing of trees mouldings and projectures of buiid- ings and such like of the light in coudy sky we need not wonder why the objects in cloudy air appear more sensible than in sun-shine or clear weather because the air or vapours being mostly exhaled leave the objects below wilhout mistiness and thus afford much sharper transparency for viewing every thing without the least obstruction for which reason things in cloudy air seem less to go off from us and appear dark and near and of more beautiful colour especially the green of grass and trees of sunsshiny light objects enlightened by the sun are more or less misty as the sun shines strong or weak for this reason that the atoms or motes between us and the point of sight seem more dense by the strength of the sun than in common or clear light and are more or less tinged by which means the shades of objects become faint at once and go off more suddenly than in another light wherefore we may easily conceive that though the shades are broader and more sensibly limited than in another light yet they appear not so sharp as some masters have by mis- take expressed them especially berchem in his objects less than the life this indeed would be well enough in covered places as galleries palaces apartments where there is no air whereby the objects then appear more perfect plain and less retiring suppose for instance you walk through same shady trees it is certain that coming towards the end of them you will see the objects in the open air plainer and better than in the field the prospective glafs evidently proves this were the day ever so clear observe then in general that as have said the objects grow faint more suddenly and disappear in sun-shine which herein principally differs from common light of the light in halls rooms and ofher apartments for pieces to be hung against walls of apartments the common light is most proper if the disposition of the light of the place will permit as being the most moderate and agreeable when well and naturally expressed this conduct then is principally to be observed in it that the figures and other objects be lighted more or less strong and broad according to their nearness to or distance from the light of the windows and though standing on the same ground they ought neverthelefs to be different in force of light and dullness of shades so also the groundeshades on walls grounds and other objects should be some shorter stronger and more sensible than others the figures close to the windows must therefore certainly receive their light from on high and have shorter ground- shades than those which are further from them but as it may happen that the objects distant from the aforesaid light may receive light from other windows so their shades ought also to break more or less and to become faint because they are encompassed by larger light besides re- flexions from the walls the shades of such objects are also warmer than in the open air where the blue of the sky and vapours very much weaken them and make them faint we must likewise observe in general that in an apartment hung with red yellow bluc or green all the shades of the objects are thereby reslected and partake of the same colour but the touches and shades of the faintest objects will appear the stronger compendium of the lighis in cloudy weather the objects are less retiring more warm and more sensible in clear weather without clouds little more retiring in sun-shiny zveather still more retiring and less sensible in suggy weather as at the latter end of the year or in winter the most re- tiring and more suddenly disappearing the grosser the air the more body it has and the more body the more visibly lighted whereby the sight is shortned and the objects appear more indistinct thus much as to objects in the open air these four particular lights naturally handled are certain proofs of fkilful master and it would in my opinion look very agreeable to see such pieces hang by one another embellisned as follows in cloudy weather the herdsmen fearful of rain and storms are packing up their baggage the sheep every where making towards them listless and hanging their heads which they are driving in an hurry into the woods looking conti- nually at the sky in fine the bustle is great and every one in motion in clear weather the herdsmen walk hand in hand others sit here and there by fountain in discourse third group divert themselves with singing and skip- ping about and some play on the hautboy fife reed or straw-pipe instruments usual among country people and in the mean time their flocks are grazing in safety in sun-shiny te eather the shepherds and shepherdesses sit at ease under their spread clothes some by water fall wassiing themselves others sleeping in the shade of fountain or trees their flocks are grazing up and down in groups some chewing the cud for coolness others drinking at river others lying in the shade in foggy weather the herdsien are driving their flocks homewards walking with concern and shrugging their shoulders and poking out their heads care- fully looking to see whether sheep or goat have not been lost in the fog and closely guarding the flock on every side the young women follow with cloths or veils on their heads and some are stopping their noses with them because of the fog chap ii of the condition of the air or sky the sky is wide expansion seeming lower or higher as it is more or lefs replete with vapours now the sky is certainly never without vapours since were there none it would be every where blue as well on the horizon as over our heads but we see it appears lighter next the horizon than vertically because the vapours fog and diminisn the beautiful blue there it is also plain that the nearer the air is to the earth the more dense and gross it is and in pro- portion to its afcent the more rarified and transparent the vapours are likewise more or less sensible in proportion to their density or raritv we must observe here that when the sun rises in the east it is then in that part lighter on the holizon than in the three others and at noon it is lighter in the south and so round because this large heavenly body communicates its in- sluence toevery thing near and about it ishall now demonstrate by an example the reason why the vapours the further they are from us become the lighter take thin gauze eight or ten yards long and strain it in the open air on four poles mark each yard with cross-line numbered to then place yourself under no and looking along to the end of the straininig you will perceive the blue of the sky less in the sccond division and the further still lesser because the thin threads doubling before your eyes thereby thicken the gause more and more and abate its thinness or transparency insomuch that at last you perceive nothing but an entire white stuff suppose now that the stars were up and you were to make the same experiment you would find them to appear most distinct in the first division and disappear in proportion as they go off which is plain proof that though the air be ever so more light it is for this reason that the stars are never seen very near the horizon and if we do perceive any thereabout they are but small and weak between the air and water there is no difference the one seems to be an impres- sion of the other to wit both of them light towards the horizon and the air overhead and water forwards both dark as for the ground or plan which receives its light from the heavens do not find it necessary to assign other reasons for proving that the case of this is quite contrary to that of the air since perspective shews that every thing enlightened if it have but solid body darkens more and more the further it goes off from us suppose for instance an open gallery soo feet long having an even floor you will perceive the first foot to be lightest and so on to the further end less and less light the same may be observed in figures chathed in zohite and how much the first will differ from the last speak only of what is in the light for the case is quite different with what is dark and in shade as we may see when figures are drest in black that then they become lighter and lighter by the the objects which appear in level field when the air is without elouds and the sun hidden either behind mountain or tree will receive light from all sides and yet keep their relief by reason of their strong and dark touches their colours are not broken but retain their natural beauty and though the sun as before said be hidden by something and can not then shine on the objects they will neve-thelefs receive more or less light from the air on the side where the sun is hidden without altering the colours that the blue of 'the sky is no colour we can plainly perceive by the objects in an open sield when the sun or light clouds shine not on them which are not in the least tinctured by it as being nothing else than vast remoteness or height from whence it comes forth and therefore not able to impart this colour to the objects as they do theirs to ene another for want of body since we are treating of the virtues of the air it will not be amiss to say some- thing of its reflexion matter worthy of observation since in that point are often committed great mistakes and to explain it we shall exhibit the three following examples the numbers signify the tints as is one tint one tint darker and tint darker than the preceding the figure plate xxix is tint darker in shade than for this reason that the trunk of the tree has rough supersicies which can give no light and the white house contrarily can give great light or ressexion now if the house were not there but level field instead of it would rather be lighter than darker and if the trunk and bushies behind it were also taken away those two figures would have like shade whereas we see now two figures on one line or ground one darker and the other lighter though the darkest shades in the latter keep their own force which did they appear otherwise would be against nature and the rules of art the second example has the same observation now am well assured from experience that if we were to give to some who had never seen this sketch or known the reason of it an outline of the following or such design disposed alike and one figure as far from the trees as the other is near ie standing in line parallel with the horizon in order to shade them according to their notions they would represent them bolh alike in light and shade though by an infallible rule he who stands furthest from the trees have more light round about him than he zoho is nearer and therefore it can not possiby be otherwise than as we see here exhibited to wit bone tint in shade and in the ground- shade and tints in shade and in the ground-shade now behold the wo- man on the fore-ground who like bhas one tint in shade by reason of the re- flexion of the stone standing near her the ground-shade upon that stone consists of three tints and if the stone or any such hindrance were not there the air would cause the same effect though not so strongly some may possibly think that the house is too far to cause such reflexion and that then the figure ought not to differ so much but say that the trunk with the may-bunnes behind so interpose that the figure can not receive any reflexion from the house and therefore it must naturally be one tint darker in shade than would you make à far-fetched opposition and dress in white say then that there would be no need either of the trees or houses when vet its plain that the one as well as the other is thus ordered to serve for an example the third example plate xxx confirms the two former in which we plain- ly see the reasons why objects are weakened more or less in their shades not only by the reflections of other objects but also by the air on the left side and the ground-shades the same which are darkened more or less beyond the reach of the said air or reflection as it appears on the three columns in which it is evident that the ground-shades of and are tint fainter than that of the pillar light of and the air and by the air alone the pillar is about half- way from the bottom darker in its reflection than above and its ground-shade one tint darker than and by reason of its standing nearer to and whereby pillar comes to cast its ground-shade on which ground-shade covers the light of half-way whereby this last can not reflect thus far against nor in its ground- shade these effects happen as well in sun-shine as common light without the lcast alteration we exhibit here another example in plate xxx aforesaid which affords no less consideration than the foregoing and whereby shew the force of light and the cording as the horizon is high or low and are the instances and and the proofs of it that it can not be otherwise the case is the same whether the light be sun-fhine or common or whether it be fronting or sideways the hori- zon is as we see between both heads and the point of sight in the middle or somewhat more to the right side the light proceeds also from the right now consider how the two heads and though having one and the same light differ in their main-light touches having those touches on the forehead and all the projecting parts as nose and chin under lip and so forth and having them on the rise of the brows corners of the eyes beside the nose and along the cheek tip of the nose and chin which alteration is only caused by the point of sight according to its position either high or loz when the objects be they of what kind soever if but smoorh and even as marble copper or the life itself stand under an high horizon the aforesaid main-light touches go upwards and on the contrary descend the more the objects are elevated above the horizon as we have said and is here demonstrated now observe of the same stuff as the foremost heads and lighted by the same light where has strong heightening on the rising part which descends more or less as it rises above the horizon this example is of great moment and produces uncommon things in which we should sometimes be at loss and which would not occur to us in many years speak in reference to those who are too confident of quick conceptions and do not duely weigh things for it must be allowed that without the knowledge of per- spectiue it is imposfibe ta trace truth from the secrets of nature in order to bring it to pass in our works it is true we can imitate the life gold or silver pot kettle dish or other shining piece of houshold-stuff as fine as the life but may be vastly mistaken in the uses of them in our ordonnances if we do not regard the motions ofthe glitterings which are as various as incredible and yet all those things may be easily apprehended if we understand and sometimes practise per- .ctive chap iii reflections in the water the representing reflections in the water is certainly not of the least moment and their agreeableness makes them worthy to be naturally expressed but as there are not assigned or will be found any certain rules for them without the aid of perspective so it is lost labour to seek any for which reason some landscape- painters often pafs over the reflections in the watet to avoid the trouble of per- spective nevertheless the incomparable poussin has not forgot to make use of them and he has got great reputation thereby speak of nicholas who was as famous for landscape as figures and who never met with any difficulties which he did not surmount having earnestly applied to this point considered whether there could not be found other shorter means to effect it than by planning lines that so agree- able part of art might not be neglected and after long trial discovered the fol- lowing method take an oblong board of what size you please and place thereon some wax- figures as close to the edge as you think proper or according to their distance from the water which they ought to have in your picture bend these figures in- to such actions as your sketch requires and place them by means of little bits of wood or potters-earth as high or low as you desire then take trough made for that purpose of lead wood or tin painted within-side with such ground as you want whether black umber or terrevert and fill it with water and set it against the board and figures as high or low as your sketched ground directs next fix your point of sight and after having found your distance place yourself there either standing or sitting and thus design the figures with their reflections slightly also marking the shades then set your layman to each figure and design it very carefully fixing the layman each time in the place where each figure stood so as to see its reslection like that in your sketch here especially take notice of the length and breadth of the reflexion for it always shortens more then its object because it is so much lower under the hori- zon when you place the model or layman as much above the horizon as it re- flects under it and design it thus correctly in order to paint after it you hold the drawing upside down here you will possibly say that the reflexion ought to be reversed which do not disown but then you can make an impression of your sketch on another paper and whereby perceive the good effect having proceeded thus far and painted after your sketch you may be assured every thing is right but here let it be observed that the reflexions must always be perpendicular with the objects above them as if growing out of each other as we may see in plate xxxi this method relates not only to the placing of figures but all other objects of what kind soever as horses dogs pyramids stones with bass-reliefs vases pots and other things and whether they be forwards back-wards or at the sides of your painting you may instead of water-trough use looking-glass but it is not so na- tural as the water which may be made to look deep or shallow and as dark or light as you please by placing little mud grass or sand in the bottom of the trough as for the colouring experience teaches that the more the water is enlighten- ed by the sky the more uncertain the reflections are and when the shun shines di¬ rectly on the water the objects will appear much more uncertain as well with respect to us as those who view themselves therein for the reflections then appear only as descending rays without any shape as we sometimes see by candle the moon or other thing which gives only reflection on the surface of the water whether in sun-shine or by night because we can not then perceive the transparency of the water the reflections in the water though it be quite dark and clear are never so light as their objects without but always tint or an half darker now to represent the ressections in running ceater you must first paint it with light and shade on ground rubbed thinly over with little tough oil then take large soft pencil and here and there cross-hatch it but better way is to take long-haired fitch and make the strokes as close as the veins of the water run taking care not to striké out too much of the out-line but as glafs is diapha- nous body and therefore has no constancy or fixedness nor can effect any thing but by means of something else having more body as by the earth which is afirm body this we see when the glass is silvered or pitched so with water the case is the same which will produce no effect nor receive the form of any object unless there be firm ground to fix its transparency as we may see by piece of ice will be necessary to observe somewhat about objects standing in the water point well worth our noticé on account of the uncommon occurrences which happen in it though as little heeded as if they were on the land and no water thereabouts we must suppose the water to be like the air and that the objects between it and the air seen from top tobottom appear the same as if- they were upside down against the air there being no other difference between the lights of either than that water is à little fainter than the air as may be apprehended by looking- glass in which the objects though tlicy appear ever so plain do not come up to life itself these things being premised it is easy to conceive that objects standing in the water are enlightened as well from belo- as above speak not here of the the re- flections of objects but of the objects themselves and their shades as may be seen in plate xxxi aforesaid the man who extends his right arm over the water receives strong reslections from below of violet colour like that of the air above him along his shaded side and his left arm across his breast re- ceives double reflection to wit from the water and from his body whereby it is of more warm colour than the other the young man stooping over stone views views himself in the water in the shade of the tree by him shew that the re- slexion of the water is like that of the air but little fainter as faid before the face on the stonc exhibits the famc but more sensibly being also lighted from below here we must further observe that the further or higher objects are from the water the more reflerion they receive as may be seen in the man who withhis breast is close to the wvater without any reflexion because the light over him can not shine on it since he is stooping forward and shides the water to the ground with his body thus far have cxperimented and from whence other circumstances may be deduced by practice in the mean time we may observe how much those objects differ from those on the land of which latter we must note that the more they rise from the ground the less reflexion the shades receive because the light of the grounds being on the superficics they maintain their own constant colours touching the reflexion in the water besides the contraction and reflexion have been long doubting about the irregularity between them and the objects them- selves since perceived by the rules of opticks or practical perspective that there was something more to be taken notice of apprehended also that as there is air and sun above and below so those two lights must needs cause an uncommon effect in the objects and their glitter or main heightenings but vet could not firmly conclude how or in what manner and the rather because which am much surprised at never heard that any person had certainly demonstrated it at last finding the greatest difficulty in explaining my conceptions did to give sketch of it cause an enquiry to be made into the truth itself as plate xxxi aforesaid shews wherein we plainly see how far things may sometimes go beyond our guesses those who try nice experiments must be rejoiced when they make greater discoveries than others we say he zho seeks finds but nothing is to be obtained without labour and practice observe then that the stress lies here in the main-light-touches as the aforesaid figures plainly shew but they may be qua- lified according to occasion and as you think fit both in the objects and their re- flexions we take then for example the objects standing on the water being under the horizon equal to their height and receiving their light from the right they stand on each side of the point of sight and have their proper lights and shades according to perspective as also the main-light-touches or gloss on the relief the same experiment may be made with all sorts of objects in all which we may perceive how much reffections in the water as well as the contractions will differ from the objects themselves this is an uncommon observation but study will make it familiar chap iv of ground-shades according to the difference of lights nt will not be improper to make some observations about the ground-shades of objects and the course of those snades according to the different lights pro- ceeding from the fide round to the fore part as perspective determines exactly the length breadth and depth of things so it is impoffible to represent any thing duly and well without it though as may say we were to practise the art an hundred years and the ordonnances to consist of but two or three figures will not say of ten or more it is no wonder that we so early cause young artists to learn perspective before they take to composition it is even commendable if they understand it but indifferently and shun those who not only reject its rules but laugh at those who study them conversation very prejudicial to young and unexperienced tyros but to return to our subject we find great advantage in using side light in our ordonnances with respect to the ground-shades because those shades whether forwards or distant always run parallel with the horizon without any fore-shortening which we may easily find without perspective as may be seen in plate xxxii fig because they may be conveniently measured with pair of compasses on else guest at we may then well perceive how much easier this uy hian where the light is more fronting and the ground-shades consequentlyxufi somewhat oblique and shorten and therefore not mensurable by the compasses much lefs to be guessed at through their great variety and diffimularity if the objects change their places the ground-shades also alier oné runsalmost parallel another more oblique and shorter and others still more ikproportion as they go off from the fide whence the light comes as in fig whereby is shewed method for finding such ground-shades without trouble or loss of time in what manner soever the light fall as to the front-light as in fig imust further premise that as in such case the ground-shades go off backwards so we need nothing but the point of sight in order to find them and their fore-shortenings can be only found by means of the gradation-line which though small trouble may be sooner made than read my method is this first fketch no for my ordonnance fixing my horizon and point of fight ground-shade at rardom according as suppose the light to be little fronting- next set my line whereon are marked the gradation-feet on the right side further draw parallel-line from the foot of fig to the aforesaid line which shews its distance now in order two exhibit the coursé of its shade lay my ruler to the foot of fig tracing its ground-shade up to the horizon where imake little star from which star fetch all my other ground-shades both fore and off-ones from one side to the other whether figures stones now to find the lengths of all thefe ground-shades draw again from the end of the ground-shade parallel-line to the-gradation-line then count the degrading feet feet supposing the figure seven feet high and its ground-shade six feet long go- ing six feet into the piece as marked on the gradation-fine thus nyay allidther objects be managed by only counting their heights in order to give the depths of their three ground-shades accordingly it is now easy to judge how difficult it would be to find the variation of sha- dow without such line as aforesaid this method has further advantage in assisting those who will finisn all their figures after the life for by the course of the said ground-shades we can prer sently know where to place the model or layman with respect to the light of the piece as we have demonstrated in our drazoing-book of reflections in general ch ap nake this observation plain have thought proper to illustrate it by one or two examples bocguse it is one of those principal beauties of picture whereby we-every where diseer the master it is not improper ffen wedried huntsmen or nymphs to rest in shades as in this example plate xxxm here they sit forwards in the left corner of the piece on greea bank wst wall quite over-run and shaded by the trees on the tops whereofsexere and therg are seen some sijall strong lights the standing figure receives the strongeff light almost doyn tò the knees and the remaining part uniting with zhe grounenas its distancé the light of this figure has however not so much force as tognne wan behind ghe sitting figures any re- flection partly because those jigures are between and partly on account of the roughnefs of it as being fuill of breaks holeg and projecting branches and leaves which double the shade nahd admjt little or nothing of the reflecting rays of the figure we see contrarily chat the figures over against the light object or sigure receive without hindrance strong reflsction the one from before the other somewhat sideways according to their sitting either behind forwards or in the middle it is of great moment to shew plainly the true cause of the said reffections as to distance colour and force of the colour shall say this for the distance have al- ready shewed that were the said light figure drest in beautiful light red and strongly lighted by the sun and the four sitting ones drest in purple yellow blue and white they would certainly be adulterated by the red reflection and partly lose their own colours in order to take that of the other and be mixed with it as for instance the purple will become red the blue violet the yellow russet or fillemot and the white apple-blossom or flesh-colour yet some more than others according as they receive faint or strong reffections distant or near moreover the naked will become more warm not all over but in the parts which are tinged by it for the air round about is seen less or more whether in the shade or between it and the part which receives the reflection the the second example in plate xxxiii aforesaid shews the breaking of the shades according to the place as well in colour as force the stone-wall is of russet and warm colour the standing figures dressed in white or light colours ate with the stones and ground about them lightened hy common light or sun-shine these objects shew us that though the light which comes upon them be pure and unmixed their shades are nevertheless quite adulterated because they are hidden from the air and surrounded with warm ground and receiving no other light than from the reflections of the said ground the colour whereof the shades take we see the contrary in the undermost flying figure to wit that the more the objects approach the air the cleaner they become and keep their own colour as appears in the uppermoft figures which ishalf in the air and not the least altered in its shade save that it becomes little more purplish according to its distance which may be visibly seen in its under parts and in the lowest flying figure which is still in the dark and can not be touched by the blue of the air being of quite different colour from thhe uppermost to wit more warm as are also the figures which stand below formerly few masters understood reflections efpecally among the italians among the french we find som made use of them however freely own that such of the ita- lians were there but one who observed thent understood them in perfection and the french but indifferently though voutet got his reputation by them having therein done more than all the french and ltalians nyaghichenakes me believe that the reflections have not been long in practice since we yetval ebany old pieces wherein they are not at all observed can not but think tha hat time they were unknown to them but what is still worse some as lastmadet rorwanap- did not know when an object was in shade on which side it ought elight or dark wherefore they- shaded it like others which were in thoelight more or less as if it were glazed so- much darker for instance in piece lighted from the right side you will some- times see figure in the shade of stone or other object now the shade of this fil gure instead of being on the right side occasioned by the stone they made on tne left like all the rest true sign that they knew nothing of reflections raphael himself was not expert in it for at that time they knew nothing ef plaring light against light and dark against darkness on which occasion the reflections come most to pass whereas tkey sought the chief effects and harmony in opposing light to shade and the contrary and therefore needed no reflections moreover they avoided all great shades- and broadness but now -- days the management is quite different we are for great shades and what makes an ordonnance look finer than great shades and lights whether buid- ings with figures and bass-reliefs woody groves or any thing else quite in shade agreeably lighted by the reflections of grounds air or other light objects it eer- tainly gives the eye great satisfaction with respect to variety and at the same time produces an agreeable union and tenderness as well in the whole as the parts of picture nevertheless it fares with restections as with all other things superfluity causes à surfeit there are also some who so delight in reflections that they shew them at all adventures and will often express almost imperceptible ones with the greatest force by vermilion ultramarine red orpiment we find such chiefly among the flemings as jordaan ’ ruben ’ and many others we must take then particular care not to represent any reflections without shew- ing the reasons of them and how far or near they are to their causes that we may rightly judge what force or weakness they receive or give in word that we need not be obliged to afk whence tae reslection proceeds why it is red yellow or blue so strong so faints chap vi that sun-sbine has no more force than common light with respect to shades is certain that objects lighted by sun-shine have no darker or stronger shades than those in common light though they seem to have stronger for the blue the air is lighted more or less according to the sun ’ strength or weaknefs and therefore keeps alzopys the same tint as prove by the first example in plate xxxiv the column whether plain or ornamented with bass-reliefs like the trajan or an- tonine is set up in the middle of the field and at distance from it at the side of the piece an high tower or bulwark the ground-shade whereof above half covers the column wherefore the sun shines powerfully on the upper part only and yet we shall find the shade from top to bottom of one and the same tint it is the same with the light of candle in darkish room or in the evening which though stronger and of more force than the other light yet does not in the least darken the shades of the parts on which it comes but let them remain alike as we see in the second example the lanhtern in the boy ’ hands lights the objects near it in part when the refi- due is lighted by the window we see then say that the parts illuminated by che lanchern do not become darker in the shade than if the said light iere not there and if the day happen to be shut in and night approaching it will not only be darker about the said light but all over but it is quite the reverse with trnasparent objects such as stuffs alabaster horn for want of the solidity of the preceeding objects as we see in the third example suppose that the column either of paper or alabaster receive its light through à small opening either from the sun or candle you will find the snade about the part so lighted to be more or less light according to the strenght of the light in such manner that it may be plainly distinguished from the other shade where- about is no light this observation especially prevails in nudities and transparent draperies in nudities lighted by the sun we shall find the small or thin parts to be always more or less transparent as the eye-lids nose ears fingers and therefore they must not have firm shades but it is contrary in stone-face for though the sun shine ever ’ so strong against the thinnest parts yet they will not be transparent but re- main as dark as the thicker and were this face to be painted with beautiful and natural colour it can not be like the life but rather dead person speak with respect to transparency for we know by experience that the blood being warm is thin and transparent but when chilly or coagulated it is corporal or solid solid wherefore it is certain that in this case dead person is more like stone than natural figure we can plainly perceive this in slaughtered oxen when the en¬ trails are taken out and candle set within the carcafs the breast and parts between the ribs will be more transparent while the flesh is warm than after it is cold and has hung longer it is the same with dead body for if candle be set behind an ear or next to the nose they will not be transparent the single folds of thin draperies appear more transparent in sun-shine than in common light and have therefore fainter shades than coarser and more thick vest- ments but the shades of double hanging folds especially when they are close toge- ther appear in sun-shine much stronger than in the single folds of thick stuffs leaves of trees do the same the difficulty being thus solved namely that the strength of sun-shine or candle -dp not make the shades darker than they are in common light we shall to acccrgilish our purpose shew therein the sun ’ strength consists matter easi- ly to be apprehended by those who have well weighed what has been before said we finct by experience that objects lighted by the sun have much greater force than thee in common light which is not effected by strong shades but by their broadnerared sharpness which common light does not give either within doors or the open act some imagine the strength to be greater in the sun than in common light which can only make objects approach in proportion to their magnitude distance or nearness as small life and large life yet say that common light has this property as well as sun-shine what difference then is there between either no other than in the one broad and sharp shades and in the other more round and melting ones the former caufes plain and long ground-shades and the latter short and uncertain ones hereby we properly distinguisn sun-shine from common light that the one is more forcible than the other is no wonder the proof appearing in the two following examples in plaie xxxv better than can express it in words of these the sirst is lighted by the sun and the second by common light both alike in darkness of shades the one sharp with long plain ground-shades and the other the contrary once painted an emblem or rather narcissus viewing himself in the water took the light more fronting as it is commonly ordered in sun-shine with an intent only to shew how apprehended sun-shine with respect to the melting of the sharpness and also to avoid ground-shade which child ’ head near-him would have caused on the cheek of narcissus the principal in the piece and his- left cheek already in shade if the light had come sideways which would have looked so very offensive that his view could not have shewn the beauty where- with he was so much enamoured it was moreover indifferent to me whether the light came from side or was more or lefs fronting because it respects the general design no more than if it were intirely fronting it is true that large ground-shades cause the greatest elegance in sun-shine if they come not too close together for then they look disagreeable and cause certain-mlancholy in picture but appear more pleasant when intermixed with gleams of small lights to break- their too great breadth- call this piece an emblem because the poet fayss that ’ this-youth seeing his own likeness in the water fell in love with-himself now this fort of love disco- vers vain conceit or weak paffion in man so far clouding his knowledge and judgment that he is insensible of what he is doing for the more natural expres- sing which sense had placed near narcissus aschild with fool ’ cap fawning on and embracing him and decked his hair virgin-like with slowers and to shew the delight he took in his folly his motion and look- bespoke one affected with the reflection which the child shewed him in the water this piece was richly filled with by-works as figures architecture bascage cattie flowers and water with design to represent all the particular objects light- ed by the sun each according to its quality and in the most suitable manner it was thoroughly finished by finishied understand when every thing is in it to the most minute circumstance not when only the principal parts are exprest and many small circumstances left out or when things are curiouslv softened as some by the word would make us believe be that as it will had not left every thing unsoftened because the difference would then have been so great that the piece must have had too much nearness since it is certain that as objects go off they become more uncertain the small and subtle things such as small folds and features disappear yet the painting might well be said to be finished since every thing was in it that ought to be with respectito its distance had before painted the same design for model of that above it was laid on flat and not in the least softened whereby the difference between them was very visible now must own that softening is very alluring and has an apparent dis- tance however we may always perceive that the one has as much force as the other we have before asferted that objects lighted by the sun cause greater force and motion than in common light which some imagine proceed only from the sharp- ness of the snades ’ now it is so in some measure with respect to their broadness but principally for the plainness of the ground-shades which the gbjects cast on each other whereby things are often broke and divided in such manner as if all zere double even six sigures in common light will not sometimes give so many pieces as four in sun-shiine whence we may plainly perceive that saarpness gives nearness softening more and more as the objects go off so that no objects what- ever can shew any sharpness unless they are near- because of the air interpofing be- tween us and them if it seem strange and unintelligible due iinquiry will make it evident wherefore argue that the nearerer the objects the more plain and sudden are their shades foras less air interposes between us and the nearest so it must increase in proportion as they go off here it will not be iunnecessary to relate particular accident as confirma- tion of my asfertion have formerly said that in my youth tmade my designs in water-colours now thad one time among others painted one which by reason of its starved and hard penciling so disliked that purposed to try to give it better face though were to spoil it intirely first tried it with the glare of an egg which not succeeding sixed it on pastboard and made brim of wax round it then poured clear isingglass on it and let it dry by which means the painting became as neat and soft as possible and shewing it to one of my intimates he was fo surprized that he could hardly believe it to be the same piece because the body of the isingglass had taken away the aforeraid hungriness and hardnefs but afterwards on inquiring into the natures of things this ex- periment appeared not strange or wonderful to me by this occurrence would intimate that mist or air takes away all sarpness making things grofs and rough seem light and smooth like varnisn or glue glossing every thing in nature before our eyes touching objects lighted by the sun they can not by means of strong and dark shades and with yellozvissi only look natural or sunny becaule there is no difference between this and other lights with respect to force mean in objects less than the life the sharpness of broad shades and the form of ground-shades with ’ the colour of the light and their reflexions how weak soever can natural- ly effect it but objects as big as the life are beyond our power if they were on- ly to consist in force now some may possibly say that then it is the betier to be represented in litile to which must answer that then the painting would not go off in proportion but stick to the frame of which we shall say more in another placo- chap vii of the ground-sbades in sun-shine tis certain that the ground-shades in sun-shine which contribute much to the decorum of picture consist not only of length broadness and sharp- ness but in conformity with the objects which cause them whether pillar pyra- mid square the ground-shade of an upright standing figure falling on the ground or any thing else nst be perfectly seen even so much that though the said object were not seen or were hid behind something yet we may judge by its ground-shade what shape it has which is one of the principal tokens of sun- shine some think this no great matter and that when they have struck on the ground long stripe of à certain breath that sufficient without shewing whether- it be the shadow of pillar or man speaking of this can not omit mentioning blunder of certain great master he had represented st. francis in the wilderness on his knees at prayer with extended arms béfore crucifix as he is generally exhibited the piece in it- self was very fine but casting my eyes on the crucifix which was composed of small twigs of trees preceived that it made distinct shade of the whole on the ground though it was almosthalf in the shade of the faint but what more surpris- ed me was that his body with the arms in the same position as the crucifix but ten times bigger did not cast like siade on the ground but the shade of mass or black wthout arms now we have said before that though figure or other object be hidden be -- hind something yet we can judge by the ground-shade what saape or formit has as shall shew in few words for instance place afperson in palace or aparment behind pillar or the like and let him be lighted by the sun his-shape will planly be seen on the ground by his shadow again would you introduce into landscape landscape pyramid tower or bulwark zohich is not there it may be done by means of the ground-shade when it falls into the piece from the fide of the light whereby the objects and every thing belonging to them will be plainly visible ingenious painters of sun-shine have still an advantage above others that they need not make any high trees hills or building in order to create here or there large ground-shades for bringing forwards fore-objects and flinging off hinder- tones they order their shades where they think proper and can always support their so doing with reasons because we often see in sun-shine small driving cloud shadow whole piece of ground and another ground shall be light again and so several béhind one another thus they can divide field at pleasure into lights and shades in order to shew things agreeably have with great attention observed the colour and shades of the sun ’ light and found especially in the month of september about two or three in the after- noon when the sun is strongest that the sky has clear blue colour intermixed with small driving clouds as for the objects when the sun shines strong they appear as if heightened with red orpiment and white and the shades reddisn grey as white black and little brown red mixt together not uniting with the blue as in common light as some imagine but becoming gradually little more violet and growing fainter toward the horizon where no blue is to be seen the trees on the fore and second grounds appear finely green the blue of the objects is greenish the red is orange-colour the violet russet and thus all the colours in proportion deep water shone on becomes greenisn grey this exact observation agreed perfectly with what had formerly experimented in bright sun-fhine by means of small hole in the window of darkened room by which saw naturally on the white wall as on paper the reflection of every thing that was moving without doors but let us proceed further to confider whether mis-shapen shadows do not make objects unintelligible beauty in general subsisting either in figures landscape or other objects exhibits all things plan and distinct in their shapes and forms ithout diminution or breaking them for things contrary to each other can not possibly raise an agreeable beauty in our eyes nor convey to the senses true idea of their forms unless by medium consisting of second or middle tint which unites the two contrary parts namely light and shade when they come too sharp on each other thereby to soften the deformity on the objects and to unite them un speake of things which are though broad which makes round objects instead of looking relieved seem square or angular as if in sun-shine wherefore they appear not beatiful but mis-shapen and the reason is plain people are not sensible of any other decorum than what occurs to their eyes for its certain that things alter by the least accident whether of unusual lights or shades which makes them strange and unknown let some boast that it is broad and the best manner main- tain that tho ’ it were sun-shine it is all ène and the same and if we are to speak of what is ageeable and perfect say that it ought to be known that picture with common light is the most perfect light which shews us more exactly and plain the preper forms of objects what is round remaining so and the square altering not as for the misshapes of things exhibited in sun-shine we have sufficiently shewed shewed them as alsg that the stiarpnefs of deformed shades spoils the true property of the objects for instauce suppose too standing figures talking to- gether are lighted by the sun if now the one cast shade on the other so as half to cover his face we need not doubt but he will become less known even were he parent in architecture or mouldings it happens as bad because the offensive suarpness of the shader disfigures and confufes their form and neatness at once think it therefore sign of pusillanimity not to say cowardice in landscape- painter zlways to make choice of sun-shine which is certainly but small part of his art as if an architect were to be continually employed about chest or box flower-painter about flower-glass cattle-painter about cow or sheep still-life-painter about skull or hour-glass sea-painter about sloop or boat or statuary about crucifix he is no history-painter who always represents an herodias with st. john ’ head in charger or lacretia stabbing herself or jael with an hammer or st. joln with lamb all which are but particular incidents which scarce déserve name an artist therefore must not be afraid to exhibit every thing that can be represented with every sort of light but the opinion of most paiters of sunshine is as ridiculous as that of those who always practise common light both proceeding from mistake or ignorance whereby they can not rightly judge of things differing from what they have been always used to now their judgment is only conclusion agreeing with their ap- prehensions in point which they pretend to understand and which therefore ought to bethus and thus when yet it iscertain that before we can judge of things we ought firft to enquire into them and by comparifon between both to observe wherein they differ sun-shine is not so proper ffor history a for landscape and architecture arises from hence that on such bccasions iit is obstructing and appears hard and unpleasant by reason of the sharpness of the shades and ground-shades as we have before intimated neverthelefs if the matter require it it must be used yet with such caution that no mif-shapen groundesnades appear to obstruct the sight or create an averfion but if sun-fhiine were the best and most advantageous light face-painters would certainly use no other of which to this day we have not one instance because first thé colours doi not shew themselyes in that-light to be what they really are secondly becaufe it is impossible that either man woman or child can without trouble and an alteration of countenance especially about the eyes and mouth fit'any time with their faces in the sun thirdly because the fun never stands-still but is always altering fourthily because the sweetnefs of the features would thereby be spoiled at once and because it would beivery improper to hang such pictures in room out of which the sun is kept it would be ridiculous and absurd to say of woman that she is unlike man unkss they so resomble that weccan see no difference between them for as the wo- man is like woman lanid the man like man so there must needs follow one of these these conclusions to wit ehat he catmot or wifl nob be-it we oould add à ehirds as contempt of the woman namely that fhie is not entireiy like man but this last which attends most people ’ judgments is most ridiculous and to be espe¬ cially shunned by thofe of right apprehenfion as being often the fource of-hatred and envy and even ruin as experience daily shews in those who through prez- poffeffior despise every thing that is difagreeablé to theit work and fancy shall not enlarge on this point but keep to my puhpose af shewing the pres possesfion of fun-ffmne-painters as well as others and to be the better understood premise that there are thrée things wherein the whole matter iconfifes and which we must first fix and distinctly observe namely fun-shine comman light and faint light which differ from each ocher

reprefented in piece having common light this proposition may possibly seem straiige to some and perhaps feint but is in fact so far ’ fram if or being atrifle that it is matter of mo- ment and founded on good reasons we take it for granted that the sun differs in ’ force from other lights and is à tint lighter we often see in changeable weather abounding with driving clouds that the sun is obscured by very thin and hanging airy vapours in such manner that whole tracts of land houses hills even whole woods are over-shadowed which shades however are thin and exhibit all the objects more or less plain than in common light but let uis corne to the point which is te represent in common light piece sun-shine with one and the same force of colours each in its degree without impediment to each ôther ’ mean when the sun is not forward or in the front of the picture or is not tèo -much fpraad which wpuld thereby seem too flaring to do it therefoue according ’ to ghe rules of art divide for instance aland¬ scape into fonr grounds of which let the first be white and the three others di¬ minifhing in proportion let the second white ground serve for the sun-shine now it is plam that as the common lighit on the fore-ground already possesses the force of the colours it must needs follow that the sun-shine which iz one tint lighter as be- fore said and has no other force than tthe fame white nan also-have no nearer place than that of the seoond grounc aa plain proof that if it be placed on the third ground it will differ so much in force now in order to distinguish the difference betweon this light on the sécond ground and that on the first and to represent it na- zurally we-ought to exhibit the shades and ground-shades of the objects saarp doroall aad long é wihevaby we mayt peroeive that this is sun-light and the other with dull and short groid stiades to fhew that it is conmoa light but the better to coooeive the naoure of sun-light obserwe its colaur in the moraing and eyening to aid those uho may not presently understand what bave said shall lay down fhort method of management in certain and easy manner having sketched your design and settled the parts which you would have en- lightened by the sun dead-colour it neatly as if it were to be throughout com- mon light but in the second colouring you must somerohat more heighten the parts which are lighted by the sun whether whiter more yellow or more russet ac- cording as you would have them and so as to perceive visible difference the shades also to lie more distinct and broad without making them glowing except here and there in the reflexions now if on the fore-ground or about it there be no white we have an op- portunity to throw here and there on it some sun-rays by the force of white yellow or russet according as the sun ’ colour then appears which could not be done if we had before laid the sun ’ force in the off-scape here let it be observed that if we enlighten some forward objects by the rays aforesaid they ought not to be of light and bright coloured matter such as white marble or light free-stone very light draperies or beautiful carnations but of such tints as appear dark in comman light because these strongly heightened with the sun-like white will fetch out the same light now to finish the work with certainty and to find with ease the proper tints of objects lighted by the sun proceed thus temper your white with red or yellow orpiment more or less yellow as you would represent the sun early or late then instead of pure white mix it with your light first tints of all the objects which are lighted by the sun whereupon you wilf find each colour to be broke according as its quality or force with respect ’ to its body differs much or little from the rest thus the work will have the desired effect experience the daughter of truth can testify chap ix that the shades of objects in sun-shine are not more glowing than in comman light any are such strangers to the truth of things and fo little enquire into them that to retain their groundless habits they slight reasons and maintain their errors this is evident from their universal opinion that the shades and objects are more glowing in sun-shine than in commonlight which entirely deny but that the shades and reflexions become lighter and lighter in- proportion as the sun shines stronger is true that the sun ’ light is more glowing than common one is indifputable for as the sun ’ light is more or less yellow or red it is natural that every thing he shines on should partake of the same colour not only in lights but also in the shades which receive the reflexions of the grounds and other néar objects but as there are no objects what strong reflexions ’ foever they receive which do not here and there preserve some unreflected stades as when oné object is covered by the ground-shade of another so the said shades ought fince they have no communication with the sun or his reflexions and are of another nature to be more grey like those in common light as receiving no colour but what the air gives them hereby think we can best distinguisn between sun-snine and common light wherefore it is strange that people who commonly seek shades for the sake of coolness will notwithstanding have them warm it is therefore no wonder to find so few winter-painters have seen winter- pieces of breugel as warmly coloured as if for midsummer even the very ice and snow as glowing though in winter all things receive light reflexions and have littlé or no shade the ground-shades are lightifhi and blue and yet every thing has its distance and going-off though some contrarily make their off-shades as warm as the forward ones for this reason it is necessary for the artist sometimes to exercise himself in sun- shine and make due observations on the nature of it not making it his constant practice but particular and agreeable study if he can not be perfect in it he ought at least to know as much of it as of common light in order to use in his works sometimes the one sometimes the other as occasion requires some think because of the broadness that sun-shine is more easy than common light but it is not so since think it as difficult for sun-shine-painter to represent common light as common-light-painter to exhibit sun-shine with respect to naturalness many perhaps may differ from me in opinion because in sun-shine the ground- shades are distinct and limitied whence they deduce this argument that in piece lighted entirely from side and the sun having meridian altitude the ground-shades of all the objects appear third less than their full length and therefore they may be correctly measured by the compasses each in proportion to its length on to the off-scape which willingly grant and to which will say further in their favour that it is to be practised not only when the grounds are level and horizontal but likewise in up and down-grounds where the compasses are useless if the ground drip the ground-shades will do the same does it rise they do so too as the knowing in perspective well understand thus far say thy are in the right but suppose it should happen that the piece be lighted from zeithin or from without is it not then as uncertain as in common light and be- cause the compasses are useless much more troublesome to find the shades and ground-shades and their enlargements forwards and off-diminutions which ought to be as sensible as the sun is either off or forward contrarily how easy is it in common light where they are small and dull the task is therefore not so easy as some imagine who endeavour only to represent right or left-side-shade to re- present the sun in all positions is quite another tning and there are few such painters for we do not easily find sun-shine-painter meddle with common light but contrarily that common-light-painter will fometimes practice sun-shine and the reason is plain the common light takes in every thing wherefore he who under- stands this well can easily give into sun-shine the point is only that sun-shine is warm in the lights but not in the shades as some imagine now it sometimes happens that two pieces à fun-shine and common light hang together both having the utmost force of colouring and so alike as hardly to distinguisn the sun-shine the lights being both alike and broad for since the word broad is come into fafhion some will paint broad whether it be sun-shine or not as well within doors as without moreover the light and shades warm- what now is to be done when two such pictures fhuff hang together in order to dis- tinguisn the sun-shine nothing else verily than to abate the strength of the one somewhat and heighten the force of the othef not by making the fhades darker but by more warm and bright light with long and distinct ground-shades zot onsy broad but sharp understand nere that the common-light-piece ought not to be iaferior in its kind but not broad-lighted or snaded unlefs the cause plainly appears but we seldom sce too such piéces together doné by the fame mafter because most painters make but one of the-kind their business and if it once happen yet they do not think the one ought to be lighter than the other and if they are done by two different hands each master endeavours to make the colonrs anfwer his own inclination thus it happens that the sun-shine-painters are in little concern about it for think— re my dbjects to appear by the force of lighte iwill by tle strength of fiery shades maintain the superiority we have said before that in proportion to the sun ’ strength the reflexions become lighter the reason whereof we shall now explain we find when the sun is low and the objects are strongly lighted that they receive stronger reflexiens from each other because the sun ’ rays fall not obliquely and glancing on the objects and those on others but strike directly upon them and return reflexions contrarily when the sun is high the reflexions of the light- ed objects can not touch the others with such force because the reffexion of the light must needs revert to its origin for instance if in an high light two men stand in discourse and the one receive the sun on his brest and the othier on his back the light which falls from on high on the breast must needs reflect agam upwards whencs it came and therefore pass over the other ’ head so that the former figure can thereby receive none or but very weak and almost imperceptible reflexion thus think to have shewn that reflexions in sun-shine ought to be represented much stronger than in common light the proof of which may be deduced from the life itself- chap of thé difference of ground-shades proceeding either from the sun or radial point in pdlate xxxvi the first example shews the sun ’ place or quarter which observe as east and opposite to it in the west is building which is lighted throughout from the gast not as by rays proceeding from ’ point and growing wider but by such as are parallel to each other mean not from the center of an asfigaed sun at the side of the piece but from the whole quarter wherein the sun is or from-the whole side of the piece as wide as the opening thoughout which he shines into it the second example shews the contrary to be false when the sun being directly behind the objects the ground-shades are not fetched from the radial but another point for if this were good it mist follow that when the sun shines directly through the midle of street he would enlighten both -sides of it whiich is contrary to nature and to what we have shewed before and in the third example it is plainly visible that when the sun is in the east and the room in ’ the weft the objects on the ground must needs be lighted directly from be¬ hind as well the one as ’ the other without the least difference which their ground- shades and the lines of the floor fufficiently shew both proeeeding from the point of fight and-the latter shewing us the caft and west through the whole room the fourth example in plate xxxvii affirms the same representing south- ern colonade lighted direct by the sun which is in the oppofite point of which building each column throughout cafts its fhade against the pillar behind it not proceedinp from point but by parallels aceording to the rules of perspective the fifch example contrarily fhews great mistake which yet is often committed in making the ground-shades proceed from an affigned point each column seemming to cause particular ground-shade which is against rule and thé nature of sun-shine it wifl not he amiss to say something here of the dight of graunds to wit that in what manner soever the light comes whether from behind sideways or fronting the plan or ground will always appear alike that is in the front of the piecé thé most light te the sun ever so low nay on the horrizon and not enlythe aat grounds but every thng that receives light the reason whereof is so evident thatit would-be superfluous to say any thing more about it than what is shewn in the fixth example of ’ side fronting and backward light which perspective suffiei- ently justifies if some think that when the light cpmes from behind or -side the ground must be lighted ot herwise than fronting for many keep it always most light on the fide whence the light proceeds allow it with respect to candle or toreh but speak ing of the air must say ithey do not at all understand the matter indeed it would not be very improper-in aground running off from the light but level floors or grounds can not admit of diminution were they if may say so thousand ftéps tong nay the ground will always be most light forwards without any dif- fference let the light come from behind or forwards think no artist will be so toft as to afk how ’ then it shall appear whence the tight comes since it is generat rule that the fhades and ground-fhades of the objects plainly shew it and in case there were no objects on the ground the air ifthere be but the least hout wifl make it sufficiently apparent chap xi of the representation of different lights in the same piece some thinkit impossible for different lights in the same piece to look well for say they if it were good raphael caracci titian poussin and other great masters would not have rejected but approved that manner even the french acadeniy which is arrived at so high pitch unanimoussy agrees that no more than single light is necessary and rejects picture which has more wherefore they judge that double lights are only the inventions of dutch masters who do not understand the antigue but only follow nature in order to please ignorants to all which answer that though raphael poussin and other great masters have nôt shewed it in their works but only kept single and common light we must not infer from thence that they despised or rejected that manner as contrary to perfection in this particular yet do not say that piece with different lights is better than one fingle-lighted if naturally represented mean only that if it so fall out and be judicioussy managed it gives painting diversifying elegance beleive many common painters will not much thank me for disclosing this matter because should lovers desire such piece they would have more troublé in doing it however let every man do what he will or can it fares with our art as with others if man will learn all that is necessary to become good master he may do so or if he be content with half-enquiries no body will call him in question for it but he who is able to represent single light well may in my opinion also do the others well how many brave masters surmount every thing they undertake what should hinder their exhibiting three or four lights as well as one but let me not here approve the manner of some landscape- painters who introduce many small lights into piece fond conceit without any basis thought it proper to handle this matter of different lighis to shew that we ought not to regard the partial opinions of ignorants but always chuse what is most natural and agreeable mean that we should enrich our ordonnances in general according to occasion and without affectation for which purpose we shall here exhibit an example different lights plate xxxviii in expectation to hear what difficulties some will raise against it we see here building or gallery and before it mote of water on the brink whereof is man fastening boat near the water lies an heap of various kinds of household goods two men are seen bringing forwards some small vessels on bier on the pavement stands grave matron with young virgin directing the hindermost porter to lay the goods to the rest somewhat deeper in the piece are two soldiers one bare-headed carrying some household goods servant is coming down the steps with an heavy chest on his shoulder through an arch of this this gallery is seen at the further end of field garden ascended by twenty or thirty steps inclosed on each side by agreen hedge some people are seen going up and down the steps in the field sits an herdsman with dog near stone the forepart with all the objects thereabouts is little lighted foreards yet strongly the gallery and the figures on the same ground are lighted directy from the side every thing in the field is lighted like the steps and the objects on them are lighted forzard receives its light from south-east from south cfrom eeast and like from south-east appeal now to men of judgment whether the lights ought not to differ from each other as well in tints as shades and the field to the steps receive as aforesaid their light from south-east in which point isuppose the sun to be wherefore the air is there lightest the south on the right side which lights the gallery only through an opening thereby becomes à little darker than the forepart of the piece the stepsc in the off-scape covered by the right-side hedge from south and south-east and by the left from north must needs receive their light from east and the air over head whence we may perceive that the objects are never without light however they are encompassed since what they lose on one side they gain on the other exhibit here another design plate xxxix also tending to shew different lighis in the same piece let us consider ’ it as ’ square room which can receive its light from the four cardinal points for instance we suppose to be north east csouth and west again no to be north-east south-east south-west and between these points are south-south-east east-north-east which are needless now we ought to observe this room being open on the four sides and figure standing on pedestal in the middle of it and lighted from the four sides from which side it would receive its strongest light certainly from the east where the sun is and next south-east north-east atint less then north and south still tint darker and so the same with south-west and north-west the west side only should be the shade by these examples think to have sufficiently cleared the point touching the natures and effects of different lights and also shewed the advantage of knowing them as well in sun-shine as common light with respect to the variety either in landscape or other subjects together with the abundant means they afford for enriching an ordonnance and that above the common method subjoin that in judicious use of them we must be very careful in their disposition that they may not as ihave said seem forced but natural and necessary that there may be gene- ral union and that the principal part have its predominancy ch ap xii curious observations on sun-sbine hhave already said much touching sun-shine and yet as matter of conse- quence for history and landscape painters shall from three designs which for that purpose exhibit make general observation upon it and thereby shew the mistakes of some and the good qnalities of schers as prefident for those who would get honour by living embellishments three young painters had once controversy about the representation of sun- fhiine they were each of different tempers one cross and positive another meek and of good judgment and the third was by the others generally accounted silly in the end they resolved each to make an ordonnance and to shew their skill the two first chose one and the same design see the fketches in plate xl the first had given all the objects without dictinction yellowish light and made the shades strong and glowing thereby pretending to express the sun as fetting not considering that he thereby exposed his ignorance as having made the ground-shades too short the second had exprest the ’ shades and ground-shades not so sharp or so long as representing the sun much higher and à littie fainter yet herein shewed so much more conduct on making the woman and boy who are looking at an huntsman sounding his horn over tne wall whom the man coming out at the gate shews them put their hands over their éyes as nature zeaches when the other who had represented the sun much stronger had not taken any norice of that circum- stance the first placed man before the tree steeping in the sun the second con¬ trarily had placed him in shade behind the tree and some other people were sitting in repose against the wall in fhade to avoid the sun ’ heat the third had made delign of his own see plate xli to shew his nice ob- servations on the sun which the others as counting him silly at first laughed at he had represented naked boy sitting in an open window and making bubbles with pipe the child received his light forward from the common light of the room through the window appeared the tops of fome houses and part of as cedumn with sun-dial affixed to it now on nice examination it appeared that this -last had best beftowed his thoughts on the sun and that neither of the others had fhewn so many good effects in their pieces as he in so small compafs for first he exhibited the ccolour of sun-shine in the sky and on the tops of the houses sufficiently differing from the common light secondly it is not enough to reprefent the sun strong or weak or with long or short ground-shades but we must also see by the ground- shades hozo late it is wherefore he had introduced the sun-dial the ground- fhade whereof was on thirdly he had observed the dubioufness of the edgy objects going off and lastly to shew that we can not bear the sun ’ excessive brightness without doors he had placed the child in the window in the common ligiit of the room that he might with more liberty stare about at the bubbles than he could in the bright open air thus he justified the conduct of him who had made his figures shading their eyes and advised the other to give his figures those of an eagle said to be the only bird which can look against the sun by these natural observations the others owned themselves convinced with excuse that they laughed not at his skill but his choice which at first seenred odd to them chap xiii of the sun three qualities as we ought not only to view as far as we are able the wonders of nature but also to represent their likeness so we shall now make our observations about the most beautiful of things who can be insensible of the three qualities of the sun viz his splendor heat and colour can any light exceed the sun in brightness and clearness or any fire be more invigorating or consuming or any colour have greater power the sun-beams says à certain poet penetrate the debth of the sea andrender the san- dy grounds light imperceptible things sensible what light can effect what this does it is faid that lightening can blind the eyes though this is rather caused by its suddennefs than its light as for the sun ’ heat ovid tells us that phéaton being of an ambitious temper im¬ portuned his father to let him drive the chariot of the sun which request being granted and the horses proving too head-strong and he ignorant of the course driving out of the way thereby set the earth on fire the gold in the river tagus was seen flowing along this powerfal light inslamed the eastern countries as ethiopia lybia in such man¬ ner as to make the inhabitants black as we see them at this day the lakes rivers and fount- ains boiled azuay even the fea became fandy valley he who would know more must consult naso himself it is said that the rolling and frightful noise of the thunder will melt metak in an instant which is not improbable since the penetrating power has great effect upon them two flints by collusion will produce fire even two pieces wood will by friction do the same though in themselves of cold nature in relation to the third quality the poet proceeds thus phabus fays he in his light hair and sitting in glittering chariot beset with carbuncles gilds all things he shines on with yellowifhi colour what light has such brightness and beau- tiful colour what saltpetre brimstone or other combustible matter can reach so far and spread from east to west the white moon and sparkling stars nay the sudden lightenings themselves are all weak and faint if compared with the absolute beauty and splendor of his lively colour therefore very much wonder that such an ignorant can be found as met with about five or six years ago even he who set up for great master plainly asserted that the sun is blue nay azure blue was there ever harboured more absurd opinion than one which makes thè most transcendant brightnefs and most penetrating object the weakest since every one knows blue to be the weakest of all colours and by which every thing is made to retire what light can be drawn from blue does blue body produce green red or yellow yes says momus ablue object will cast yellowishness yellow light blue one and red beautiful green also yellow drapery will give green reflexion blue drapery red one and white black oue moreover the light of the sun is well exprest when the main lights are whitisn blue blue and the reflexions yellow and warm thus says he we must reason about all colours lighted by the sun think this the bluest position that can be for in painting the sun and all other objects after this manner could there be more ridiculous picture how green yellow blue and spotted would it appear — but many are fond of party-colouring we shall give here discription of one of this master ’ pictures work as frivolous as his judgment about the sun in this piece he had represented vulcan hammering piece of iron foot long one half whereof was red-hot and the other he held in his hand he had also exhibited venus with the same precaution sitting stark-naked and uncon- cerned in the midst of the sparks now are not these fine thoughts and worthy of representation does he not seem to say — this iron is not heated by the fire but painted of glowing colour è —- and indeed he shews it plainly for the pinchers which vulcan ought to hold the iron by lie by him on the ground moreover he was foolisn enough to paint fire against an hanging but why do we wonder at that why should he not do it since painted fire can not burn we might suppose him as wise as the man who set piece of ice to dry in the sun that it might not wet his back in carry- ing home to find such wretches among mean people is truly no wonder but among painters and such as set up for great masters it is past my understanding those men who are unacquainted with the true qualities of the sun may be excused but they who know see and are sensible of them and yet through care- lessness or solly make such grofs blunders are unpardonable artistsl be then advised in things ye do not rightly understand that ye may be sensible of every thing art can effect is there any thing which we can not immitate with pencil and colours whether heat cold day or night earth air water fire wind thunder frightful ap- paritions sweet sounds of voice or instruments sorrow joy bitterness forrowness even invisible things as the sound of an horn or trumpet but let us now see how these things can be exhibited are there not abundance of motions postures and pafsions which herein afford us help and which nature herself and daily instances shew uss if we will but take notice of them what then can be wanting to make our meaning plain and clear to every body does not an uiexpected sound cause sudden emotion thunder-clap consternation frightful specter terror and trembling burn rage and contraction of the members sourness pinching the mouth and closing the eyes bitterness loathing contraction of the features sweetnefs placid countenance as for the representation of hot countries we know that both men and beasts seek there shades and caves for shelter and repose also that it is usual to wear umbrellos and go either naked or dressed in thin silks in cold countries we find thé contrary for there people repose and recreate in the sun or where he gives the most warmth they sit in an hut or house by wood-fires and if the country be near the north-pole they are cloathed in wooll and the skins of bears and and other wild animals thus we see one fort of people seeks warmth the other coolness here the sun shines hot the snow abounds the hot indian appears almost naked and the laplander and russian hug in party-coloured furs but as these effects are owing to the sun only whose insluence on these countries is in proportion to his nearness to or distance from them so we know that the heat or coldness of each climate is thereby caused and the sun feels hotter in one place than another since we are treating of the sun we shall also shew how the poetic expreffions describing him are to be understood poësy and painting being sisters agree intirely and though fables and fiacti- ons be not thought necessary for painter yet they are delighting and useful and we can not be good painters without some aid from poëty we may make use of poetic thoughts as far as the history whether sacred or profane will ad- mit and as the nature of thing can be thereby expressed how can the morn- ing noon evening and night be more elegantly represented than homer does it in some passages of his works among others at the end of his odyssee where he says all objects appear in the moring at the dawn of aurora dark and afterwards the imperceptible growing light distinguisnes and gives their natural — colours thus he as to the beginning of day and elsewhere of the morning and evening he has it — as when phabus fatigued hides in thetis ’ lap he says further — aurora the day-dreak and fore-runner of phabus rose in the east in her turn sitting in purple chariot and gilded the tops of the moun- tains and virgil in one passage says aurora risen out of tithon ’ saf- fron-bed and in another the sea was now got rosy with morning- ray the orange day-break appeared in the high heaven upon the rose-colour chariot again as soon as the day-break riding up heaven to be rosy all which expressions give us to understand that aurora ’ light begins with red- ness and grows gradually yellow aud stronger as she gives way to phaebes we need not say more of the names which the poets assign this great heavenly luminary nature has the same daily in almost all those qualities and he who does not consider nature will reap little advantage from my observations chap xiv of the nature of the sun with respect to different countries ormerly at leisure hours diverted myself with-reading the descrip- tions of several eastern and northern countries written by linschot olaus magnus archbishop of upsal and others and on one side saw the cape of good hope where the sun ’ great heat is tempered by the sea-breezes asit is through all india java china and other regions of cina writers say that it enjoys the sweetest air and the inhabitants arive at great ages and no contagious distemper is heard of amongst them read also of many costly and strange rarities and of the the coca-tree yielding refresning hiquor and what elfe was worth obferving on the other fide of the world viewed greenland which found to be exceffive cold and full of high mountains covered with eternal snow the feas abounding with whales and the air piercing and rigorous on the comfortable sun ’ departure amd like the country the people rough and savage as we see in the goths fin and laplanders and other bordering nations where cold air and nature have great in- sluence on the people digesting these things had fancy to make two sketches of them in one represented according to the writers palm and cocoa-trees little water but many hills and for the embellishment some naked blacks the light sun-shine in the other could exhibit little else than fir-trees wooden huts and drifts of ice the people had cloathed with beasts fkins and some hunting wild bears others busy in dragging whale on the ice which they had killed with harping-irons in fine circumstance of their manner of living these scratches were lying on my table for further improvements as they oc- curred in my thoughts when gentleman on making me visit cast his eyes on them and though but slightly scratched bought them of me and at the same time bespoke another piece the subject whereof should have from his son then newly arrived from india accordingly the son described to me certain place in india where he had lived generally inhabited by blacks except the governor himself and some others he instructed me in several particulars as well manners as dress and other things proper to the country all which set down and then made rough sketch of it with pen in his presence in which he faid had rightly taken his meaning this being done feh to colouring it in hopes thereby to get his future favour which did the young gentleman ’ affairs in the mean time calling him out of town for three weeks his father on his return had meeting of some friends and on that occasion sent for the picture which was finished and at the same time desired my company the piece was instantly hung up and after the gentleman had little viewed it he took me by the hand and whispered these words .it is very well done but lforgot to tell you one thing of great moment yet you can alter in half an hour ’ time to be fhort had taken the sun too low and al- so made him fall into the piece sidezbays which occafioned long groundesnades where- as should have made him vertical or over head as he most times appears in that country was confounded and owned my fault for his criticism was juft since the great heat must be exprest by the sun ’ vertical position here saw that after all my pains had failed in the main point for the reason aforefaid the gentle- man ’ judgment was as right in one point as wrong in the other for he must needs be acquainted with the nature of the climate but his saying how eafily the fault might be rectified reminded me of the case of apelles and thought ne sutor ultra crepidas because he thereby discovered his ignorance for rubbing out the ground-shades would not in the least have bettered it and to enlighten the figures from on high would be more work than to begin new picture never- theless he taught me to make my advantage of it in time to come chap xv of the sun ’ light upon objects at rifing and setting tis unaccountable in many artifts who handle an art whofe theory is built on mathematics its practice on experience and the execution on nature that-they take so little notice of the three points wherein lies their honour es- pecially in the lighting of objects in fun-set for the sun how low soever can not shine on any object under the parallels namely not in the least from under- neath were the object if may say so as high as the clouds and yet we see mariy paintings wherein-the objects are by fun-set more lighted from under- neath than above which is contrary to nature as we may daily experience in walking against the sun how troublesome it is to shade the eyes we turn our heads sideways or hold an handkerchief before our eyes even the hat is no de- fence and yet the sun never takes it underneath this may be plainly evidenced by perspective to wit that as the horizon limits our sight and the sun can not with respect to the eye descend lower therefore he can not send his rays upwards but along the ground or parellel must needs shine into them even dare to say that werethe brim of your hat ten acres broad and parallel with the horizon it would not cast shade of pin ’ breadth over your eyes nor the sun so much as take the under parts of the brim though we were standing on an eminence but to he the better understood let us consider plate xlii where on the fore-ground tplace figure with board on its head like the americans level with the eye-brows naxt we see an high building with projecting cornice running towards ghe point of sight and on the other side an high column with figure onit having sucha board on its head as the other now vou may per- ceive that thie sun does not strike underneath against it but sends his rays paral- eel imean when he is sehting draw then ray from the sun parallel with the board of the fore-figure and see how much shade its eyes will have fetch ano- ther ray from the front or cornice to the sun ’ center to find how much fhade the projecture will throw on the frize dothe same by the figure on the column then you will perceive that the joints of the stones in the building will be parallel with the sun ’ rays and that the off-corner of it though lower than the near one will yet be alike with the near one and the frize parellel with the ground if it be objected that when we lie out at window the sun is lower than the window-board we lean on and does not fhine onit answer that we only ima- gine so for if we rightly observe we shall perceive fmall ground-shade of the crofs-piece of the window though ever so faint wherefore we are enabled to conclude that as long as the sun fhines nay if-but finger ’ breadth above the horizon the ground must receive some light and of consequence as -long as the ground is somewhat lighted it is impoffible for the sun to shine on any thing from underneath suppose for instance column six feet high lighted by sun- sun-set if this column through anv visible shade on the ground the ground must have some light and if so how is it possible that the sun should shine from above and from underneath at the same time and ’ if it be granted that the sun does not light the column on top its ground-shade must needs be infinite in which case the capital ought just to be lighted from underneath and the ground of necessity to be without light this is ah undeniable truth though thepoint be alittle handled by writers even seldom heeded by masters it is also no wonder to see some fail in it the most probable reason for which as think is their ig- norance in perspective chap xvi of the application of sun-sbine and other lights tis an old and rooted evil and thereby become law rather to gratify our fancies and paffions than consult reason most painters verify this in their cnoices and uses to represent sun-shine say they is pleasant and delights the eye therefore we must always introduce it but this can not be since the va- rieties of the seasons and change in all things visible demonstrate the contrary this light is indeed very agreeable in landscape but very disserviceable within doors for how ridiculous in great entertainment would sun-shine appear on the table and how could the guests see one-another or how could the glitter of the plate be expressed without obscuring every thing else what fine piece would that be where the white table-cloth must be mixed with black and how agreeable would it look to see the ground-shades of the window-frames and squares expressed on the table and floor sun-shine is not always proper and yet some will not give themselves time to think whether the subject require it or not as in christ ’ crucifixion it is improper because the scriptures mention the sun to be hidden the better to explain my meaning shall exhibit three different lights in as many ordonnances relating to the person of our saviour of christ ’ crucifixion here on mount golgotha is the place of suffering the sun though at noon is obscured by dark cloud behold how the place is lighted from the right side where are the cross and people receiving strong and broad light from the clouds all this appears on the second ground the figures on the fore- ground shadowed by cloud are not so broadly lighted but unite gradually in force with the others until they come to be alike broad-lighted about the third ground the sky is darker and full of heavy clouds which as they rise seem to draw little crofs towards the sun which is on the right side now we must follow truth-as much as possible and nof our fancies or choices here every thing ought to be still and inactive christ is dead does not this furnish sufficient reason for mourning wherefore chose the aforesaid light as best expressing forrow and yet it is-not proper on all occasions as may appear in the two following ordonnances one of which is strong and broadly lighted and the other with sun-shine sharp and long-shaded truly piece with these considerations and exhibiting the nature of things and times must needs please the curious even the very hearing such reasons and observations can make lover knowing especially if he be instructed by good master in right principles and is somewhat conversant in drawing such one may even convince painters if he have particular genius quick apprehension and good memory improve his time read good books and shun such company as prattle much and do little to converse with the fkilful and judicious is very commendable but the con- trary injurious reason should always take place and discerning judgnient not to be rejected rather do something less and weigh it throughly au- gustusts ’ saying is on this occasion not amiss festina lente haste zeith ease good things will endure but those which are so seemingly must decay but my zeal has carried me too far and therefore ishall return to my purpose in the ordonnance of chritt ’ burial the rock on the left side of the piece which opens little forward and has dark and deep entrance is the place of christ ’ burial the funeral rites are perr formed within and one or two lamps are seen somewhat to light the hollow the body is carried in by three or four men the time is about the evening and the- sun does not shine behold the people against the rock almost without ground- shades as being lighted from on high and little forward because of another piece of rock rising up there by the side alike with the former observe the three figures on the ground standing between the two rocks those wanting the- fore-light must needs receive it from behind somewhat further on the third ground which is the common road some people are coming close by the trees.. standing on the right side of the piece who on the other side beyond the large rock receive their light from the left side plain proof that were they more distant in the field they would be lighted from all sides my principal remark on the piece is this this burying place belongs to joseph of arimathea and lies near the city of jerusalem as the text shews he is there with his people who carry in the corps now my intention is to light this foremost group as strongly as possible and yet without sun-shine the light comes almost fronting by reason of-the side rocks which obstruct side light so that they can scarce have any shade other than from behind through the rock or burying place little from some cypresses standing on one side of it between the two rocks shew that the people coming forward must needs be lighted from behind since they are still half in the open air and that those somewhat further off in the road against the side trees ought to be lighted forwards back- wards wards and from the left ’ side where the rook is wvery slow consequently have but little shade on the right side of the treës againsti which theiri groud-shades fall the other group and the stone-heaps in the field on lower ground ’ shiew to be lighted from all sides and to have no other shade than from below and-the deepest hollows because the sky is settled and without clouds now it is cer -- tain that few will relisni so nice an observation since they follow their own fancies without further inquiry yet if any of the circumstances were omitted the matter would also be less apparent the chief regards had here are to the light the time or hour the situation of the burying place and the quality of the man who performed ’ the funeral rites not only as to his person and authority but also with respect to his dress to- gether with the manner of the solemnity according to scripture all which ap- pear-plainly as for the stone-heaps in the off-scape they are burying places jerusalem of which the aforesaid is one we see them raised up and down about small and mean large and stately according to the conditions of those who caused them to bemade as the scripture testifies liet us now observe the third ordonnance of christ ’ resurrection ftagain reprefent here rock before the entrance whereof is sitting the young man orangel on the stone of the ’ sepulchre in shining rayment speaking to the chree women and ’ pointing upwards christ arising is surrounded with rays-like thgfe of the sun whereby two of the women one beholding him with her hand- over herseyes are so strongly and sharply lighted that their shades by reason of the nearness of the dazzle fall very distinct on the ground forwards and on tevery thing-else thereabouts one of these women as nearest the young man thereby réceives strong reflexions when the third who is stepping towards the-sepulchre is without the reach of either-light aud though receiving in manner some light from the air yet melts in the broad- shades somewhat further on the- se- cond ground the trees also along the way give broad shades in the off-scape is-séen jerusalem in rising mist because it is day-break the heavens abounding with thin clouds mostly in the sun ’ quarter which on the right-side of the piece appears ’ little on the horrizon somewhat yellowisni and purple now if lover or master will with due reflexion join his thoughts with mine and not fear any trouble in the performance ’ question not but he will by such representation satisfy co-artists and merit the name of great master chap xvii of the propertios of the sun and other lights in tkeir essential representations and ’ of- the chief times of the day we need not say further that lights differ in their kinds as having in the preceeding chapters suffiiciently shewed their natures effects and qualities yet to finisn this head we shall here subjoin some particulars which could not before have place as for the sun my opinion is that he can not be represented in any picture first because the eye is too weak to behold him and therefore his force can not be expressed otherwise than by his making all objects dark and black secondly because when he shines directly in our faces we can not perceive the right shape or colour of things unless we shade the eyes as nature teaches for the same reason think we may not represent burning candle torch or other matter giving great light unless we also exhibit the objects as this light makes them appear to us and not as by their colour stir and union they really are for the further from the candle the more faint they become it is therefore folly to maintain that the natural force of candle-light efpecially if the flame be seen can be imitated sinceit is past our fkill to give the other work its appearance for when the light of the candle shines in our faces the most deep and dark colours even black itself appear neither darker or blacker than thoy would in dark day but we shall afterwards treat more largely of these lighta and therefore now proceed to say that those who love to paint sun-shine may observe that it is proper for sacrifices combats bacchanals dancings sports of herdsmen and sundry other jovial occurrences and histories which require great bustle but very improper and obstructing in councils pleadings entertainments academies wedding- ceremonies and other such circumstances but cloud-light gives an uncommon decorum and naturalness in solemn affairs fuch as aslemblies of magistrates pleadings and other business of authority and consequence the third of the lights of which we have spoken the torch or candle is pro- per for mournful occafions for dying persons burials and such fike efpeciaky in the open air the sun appears agreeable and delightful in the open field when through thick bushes and trees his rays here and there light the grounds and the people are seen reposing or diverting in the shade but he acts against nature who exhibits tender and beautiful virgins bafking in sun-shiny field staring at the sun and talking and beholding each other with as little concern as if it were but candie or star-light since he himself would leave their company and retire to shade to prevent any mistakes of which kind let us describe the chief times of the day doy-break this first-born time of the day favours the enterprizes of great generals in be- sieging or storming town no time more proper for it by the example of joshiua in taking jericho this rule though not without exception has been observed by all nations of which could give many instances the battle of pompey against casar began at that time it is also the proper time for hunting as in the representation of diana cephalus adonis or any such subject judicious masters always chuse the hour of the day which best agrees with their story this time is of singular advantage for the half tints it gives exhibiting all things in their natural colours whence arise an uncommon agreeableness and decorum the morning this time principally rejoices nature even inanimate things are sensible of it the glittering light takes the tops of high mountains and causes both in build- ings and landscape great shades appearing very delightful this light at breaking out gives uncommon sweetnefs when the objects shine in the water as also certain freshness mixed with vapours which bind the parts of things so well together as entirely to please the eye of the knowing at this time the heathens offered their sacrifices and we read in the books of moses that the children of lfrael had not only their morning oblations but also wor- shipped the golden calf at that time the jezs retain those customs to this day as also did the ancient christians who often baptized in the morning as was likewise christ in jordan the persians moreover honoured the morning by their offerings wherefore we ought to have due regard to the time of the day on all such occasions and take especial care that the light on the principal object and place according to poussin ’ conduct in picture of christ restoring the blind to fight wherein the greatest and strongest light is entirely spread over our saviour the light between morning and noon this light is not very fit for objects if it be not broken by some accident of rain storm or tempest such time may be proper for mournful occafions such as the last judgment and our saviour ’ suffering when as said in the last chapter the sun was darkened which looks frightful and causes an expressible amaze- ment wherefore fine and pleasant weather would on such occafions look ridi- culous noon at this time the sun darting his glittering rays shines in full splendor where- fore desire those who use this season to think that nature effects by the force of this light what can not be represented since we often fail in our utmost attempts for that purpose whereby it happens that in endeavouring to make things come forward forward we often use such force of light on the fore-ground as far exceeds that of the sun as in the case of draperies of fiery colour or the like certainly an unaccountable way of proceeding nevertheless the sun ’ light may be hidden behind mountains buildings this hour gives rest to human labour the scriptures tell us that christ tired with his journey sat to rest on the well which gave the woman of samaria occa- fion to hear his wonderful prediction his disciples also wearied sat down near him he who endeavours truly to represent the natures of things must especially observe the times and hours proper to them the afternoon as'this season is most liable to diversity of weather by means of driving clouds which occafion many overcasts it is very proper in the representation of bacchanals and licentious actions but these are not always fixed to that time the evening labour ceasing at this time it gives liberty for all sorts of pastime as dancing walking if you would represent the marching home of an army or herds- men driving their cattle out of the field this time is the most proper for them this light frequently changes its colours by the interposition of rising vapours which it draws but does notwithstanding most times enlarge the superficies of objects when the shade do not receive the reflexion of other objects they ought to partake of the light this season is quite different from the morning yet no less agreeable by its small glittering lights if we keep the general light somewhat dusky which creates great masses or parts especially when the colours are some- what dispersed by judicious master at noon the sun ’ light must proceed from on high giving short ground-shades but in an evening his light must be low and causing long ground-shades this morning is like the evening and with the moon-light agrees chap xviii of the moon and her representation question not but many of my positions and observations in this point will be censured as heterodox for being contrary to both ancient and modern practice nevertheless shall not fear to enforce them that discreet artists may enquire whether they are founded on reasons or not especially seeing they are not new inventions but corrections of old mistakes as think shall prove suppose then that it is grofs error to represent the moon lessthan the life because how distant soever she be we nevertheless see her like the sun always retain her natural bigness and if this be granted the contrary must be unnatural and therefore forbidden toa painter who is the imitator of true nature.. had mind to paint moon-shine would wlthout injury to nature imanage at as have before said would represent the sun that is to exhibit her fhine but not her body for the light is of greater moment in picture than ’ the- bodios of either the sun moon or candle lighting my objects thereby either from behind sideways or forwards and as well in figures as landscape somewhat darker than the day-light that it may appear true moon-light and not sun-shine which it very much affects by its sudden lights and sharp ground-shades making the blue sky here and there with some glittering stars and to maké it still look more natural we may if the subject permit introduce up and doun torches or other lights burning piles of wood offerings or other fires as occasion requires and tbereby make the lights stronger and the colouring russet and more yellow yet the shades not to be so sharp as those of the moon this would in my opinion have fine effect especially if the said accidental lights were mostly ordered in dark places but we ought principally to observe that in the whole there must be seen more darknefs than light and that no colours appear so beautiful as those of the sky in reference to the moon unlefs they be red yellow and such others as are peculiar to burning lights as we have shewed in the first chapter of the fourth book for light red and yellow become dark the moon ’ brightness con- trarily makes dark blue and sea-green appear lighter but black keeps its post wherefore little light red and as little dark blue ought to be seen in the picture by such disposition we gain two advantages natural light an un- tcommon variety in the colours if any one find any difficulty herein he may please to know that he is no more obliged to exhibit the moon than the sun in his piece because the former takes its course round the heavens as well as the latter and may therefore be placed as the elegance of the figures and by-works require since both illuminate the earth and its objects forwards backwards and fideways as to quality in three particulars the moon is so like the sun that there is no difference between them as she always throws her rays parallel as well as he all that is lighted by her is broad and sharp the shades on the ground are plain and conform with the objects but the reflexions are not so strong as in sun-shine because the moon-light is weaker than the sun ’ by reason of the oppofite natures of those two luminaries the one being warm and the other cold and as the moon receives her light from the sun she can therefore not have so much power to impart it to the earth nor the objects lighted by her appear so distinct to the eye again as the sun often alters his colour by means of the vapours which he exhales so we find the same in the moon who by the same means becomes also more pale or yellow in proportion to the vapours about her or the air ’ rarity or density can it be doubted whether such piece of moon-light without the appearance of her body be such when the darkness broadness and sharpness of the ground- shades and the palenefs of the colour are well observed all which conjunctively express evening or night if it be question whether this were the former practice say have no business to enquire into that since we ought not to accommodate the art to fancy but our senses to the art it is to as little purpose purpose to consider what- is done but rather what may or ought to be done according to the dictates of right reason in short it is impossible when the three afbresaid qualities are well observed in piece it should fail of representing very natural moon-light as my position runs counter to old custom and therefore not so easy to appre- hension have endeavoured to explain myself by the three examples in plate xliii in the first stiew the moon in her natural bigness yet without the piece be- cause she would atherwise come too near the horizon and cause too long and disagreeable ground-shades in the second sne is exhibited-after the old way and in the third shew only starry sky with the strong lights of moon who as in the first example is without the picture if any one think that the moon ’ body gives strong glitter elegance and life to piece say the sparkling light of the stars does the same especially if we make them as large as they appear to us but not in perspective-way as be- ing between heaven and earth like the moon however we need not represent them all but the chief only such as the chariot the triangle the serpent the north and evening star and such as make known figure all which as having nofigural being but only the shine of very small light may be eafily expressed by small points we may also make the moon though without the piece appear in the water and cause an agreeable reflexion in the waving furges and by chusing such side-light we have the advantage of reprefenting all things mast beaatifal neither- more nor-less- than in sun-shine or common light ii must subjoin-another important consideration which is that as the moon ’ light is sometimes obstructed by high objects such as rocks palaces trees hills so fome parts mustineeds be dark in which the reflexionst of so weak light have no power to enlighten or fetch out the objects or bodies- in them though ever so-near for-tiist reafon painter ought- to-avoid such accidents and not to iatroducs thenp unlefs through necessity to create an- harmony or force and to place tham mostlyt forward or in the off-scape against the sky for setting them between both can not but make disageeable spot unlefs it be broke by somer wacer wherein reffexion of same stars or other lights of the air appear and into such choice of- landscapes- or visto you may introduce white- marble-images huildings light by-works and light-coloured stuffs which all together look agreeable and as- the night-vapours are more dense then those of the day so the distans objects become more suddenly dark and undistinguishable forget nat that in windy weather themoon as well as the north- star is encom- passed with yellow ring if any person be not yet fully satisfied let him please to weigh the following paspable reasons the sun moon and stars can not diminish because we can ner- ther approach nearer nor goi further from them- but all sublunary objects can by our recess or appraach lessen or magnisy and to prove this take glafs of the- size vou intend your picture place it before window and draw on it the prospect with the moon as it then appears to the eye which done you will see- see how large she ought to be painted now if- you approach with this glass some thousand steps nigher towards the sun or moon they will not appear bigger on or through the glass but have the same magnitude whence arises the falsity of those representations which diminish the sun moon or other meteors as well as the figures conclude then that the pictures exhibiting nature contrary to what she ought to be are liable to censure and that we ought to seek truth by ratiocina- tion and then waving old customs and prejudice to believe our own eyes shall further illustrate this matter in the chapters shewing what is meant by table and of the uses of magnifying and diminishing glasses and of the difference between large and small warm and weak painting to which we refer the curious artist chap xix of the effects of artificial lights as of torch lamp candle or fire aving in the most plain and concise manner treated of the effects of the sun moon and star-lights we shall on the same footing speak also of the auxillary lights which necessity for the ease of mankind has contrived and art brought to perfection ithink it not amiss to shew here in the first place the force and property of these particular lights in such manner as conceive them that of flambeaux or torch is at night the most powerful and beautiful having two qualities to wit of affrighting and rejoicing its light is very proper for bacchanals entertainments plays and other jovful meetings and on the contrary frightful in sorceries apparitions of ghosts and such-like nocturnal and unexpected accidents the lamp is melancholy faint and gloomy and therefore proper for burials prisons near fick and dying persons and on other mournful occafions this light is most agreeable within-doors and in caves grottos or frightful and un- frequented places of small extent the nature of this light and its effect on colours are the same as those of the sun with respect to its falsifying the colours but the light and reflexion are not so strong for which reason the artist is often at stand in the uses of them arising mostly from his slighting this light as matter not worth his observation in reference to shades they are not much unlike those of the sun as well in broadnefs as sharpnefs yet with this difference that the sun-light falls more uni- form on objects as he is more distant from them and because in the evening but especially at night the vapours are darker and more dense than those of the day whence it follows that all objects deprived of the lamp-light disappear and by reason of its nearness can be lighted but in part to confirm this we shall exhibit mathematical instance in plate xliv point forthe centre of the light from which all the rays flow draw under it candlestick of certain height as four feet above the grouud then sketch three or four columns going off further and further from the said point of light iet thesebe eight feet high next set one foot of the compasses on the said point and extending the other so as to touch the extremity of the first pillar sweep segment of circle on the shaft do the same with the other pillars now you will perceive that the first pillar is least touched but receives the strongest light and that above and beneath the touch the light falls weaker and weaker moreover that the furthest column is most touched by means of the greater sweep of the compasses and therefore it will be lighted allmost all over but also most weak whence it is plain that objects lighted by such lights are ne- ver lighted intirely and uniform and were they touched and lighted alike it would be faint and dark that we should perceive nothing distinctly either in co- lour or ont-line more than in weak moon-shine if any want further information how lapply this to practice shall now freely impart it first sketch my ordonnance on blue or dark drawing paper then imake my plan to shew the places of the figures and other objects which islightly scratch next assign point for my light either high or low as occasion requires on this point set one foot of the compasses and with the other touch circle-wise with an extent equal to each object ’ distance from the said point all the objects wherever it happens by this means lfind the parts which as nearest the light ought to have the strongest light and consequently the diminution of the light and colour shews itself in proportion as it goes off from the drawn circles as for the reflexions they are in the same case with all lights the brightest largest and strongest give the strongest and the purer the light the more yellow appear the colours both in the lights and reflexions contrarily the fouler and more vaporous the light the more russet seem the colours candle is yellowish the light of lamp is russet flambeaux or torch is more red artists who delight in representing such lights ought to regard the three sol- lowing useful precepts to keep most light together to take special care in the melting and lighting of their out-lines to observe the naturalnefs of the several lights whether candle lamp or torch it must also be noted that the space between the eye and the light as likewise the first object or sigure if it come before the light ought to be tne darkest but if it be behind the light it becomes weaker both in light and shade occasioned by the vapours which as before has been said appearing more dense in the evening the night-light more affects them and enlightens them add to this that the main-light being tempered with light yellow russet or red the diminution and breaking of those colours ought to be found by black mean by black and the proper colours wherewith the objects are shaded and more or less weak in proportion to their distance for the farémoft darkness and nearest to the light is more warm than the hinder and furthermost which in pro¬ portion to its distance becomes more blue yet much more in the open air than within doors because the vapours of the air are more subtile than- those of con- fined lights which being made with lamp-oil rosin or the like emit foul smoak bnt as to the foremost objects must by means of confined light within-doors needs be subject to much shade whereby they often maintain but smalllight on their extremeties it will be found that such outward lights appear more or less strong that the objects lighted straight forwards according as the stuff whereon it falls is either rough or smooth as for the reflexion with the light shining through thin folds observe the same management as prescribe for sun-shine touching those parts but in breaking the colours let me subjoin that the fore- most darkness must be the greatest and therefore less falsified by the light than those whdch are more distant the-colours therefore keen cleaner and are less fouled and still less in the open air than within doors am even not afraid to add an easy method for finding the diminution of the tints on objects according to their distances not from the point of sight but from the candle torch or lamp cut strip of paper or vellum as long as from the center of the light to the furthest corner of the piece let it be finger and half broad at bottom and cut away to point at top than paint the point with such colour as you give your light yellowish or russet diminishing it gradually in proportion to its going off from the light next with pin fix the said point in the center of the light so as to move it about at pleasure to all the objects near to or distant from the light then divide this strip into degrading feet small at the pointed light end and from thence gradually larger by which means the strip will shew without trouble the right tint to temper for the objects going into the picture towards the point of sight you may make another strip the reverse of the former to wit light at the bottom and diminisn- ing towards the top or point to be fixed on the point of sight if you would use any more helps for the diminution of the colours and less troublesome try the following method having in my ordonnance exactly designed the figures after the life paint it like common light-piece without breaking the colours more than perspective requires the light take as from candle or other matter proceeding from point within the piece whether within doors or in the open air after which take thin glazing vellow of the same tint give to my light and scumble it neatly and thin over both lights and snades this yellow must not be too dark because my main heightening is taken only from common light wherefore asphaltum yellow lake and dragon ’ blood would be so warm and sensible as to take away the mistness inseperable from night-pieces unlefs it were before painted accordingly to the-no small trouble of the artist now as glazed things common- ly abate of their neatness you may if it be necessary re-touch the main lights as well in the faces as other parts and thereby fetch out their force again the-advantage arising from this method ’ is that there is no kind of night-light whether of lamp or other oil pitch brimstone eandle or torch but it may be represented with the same trouble because it depends only on the tempering the lglazing eoleur the best iof which in my opinion is gum-booge light pink or yellow lake mixed with little vermillion think these very good methods because sometimes in night-pieces especially in great bustles we use twe three and more particular burning matters for lights and by this means we obtain sure method for fetching out those light and fires not only-at night but also in the day time in the evening nay in sun -- shine where we often meet with flambeauxs torches burning altars or piles of ewood but ilet me not proposelthefe precepts as laws but examples to exercise the artist ’ curiosity and for his proficiency wherein wiffi my labours may be of service chap xx necessary hints in the use of perspective have been long considering point which in ty opinion is very remark- able and yet has never beeni settled though think it may be done it re- lates to the execution of historiés either within or without doors ’ and landscape embellished with figures my thoughts are that as perspective afsigns certain distance for viewing picture with respect to its magnitude or smallness or large pièce with large figures and other objects going off to wit on the second and ’ third grounds those objects ought to be as neatly finished as those on the fore-ground provided they keep their faintness caused by the interposing air thisposition tthink is founded on certain and natural principles but must prevlously suppose that when we say piece is well finished it must be understood that the whole is so and not part only if we begin in- quiries we ought to push thém as ’ far as poffible to enable us to say such pièce is aftfully executed nay so perfect that nothing is wanting for that cannôt be affirmed when the fore ground ’ is finished and well painted and the second and ’ third grounds but slightly touched grant that we sometimes see pieces with small figures though loosely handled accounted finer and more artful than large pictures laboured and highlyfinisnied yet it must be allowed that more work is necessary in large finished piece than small one loofely handled the very words finished and loosely imply it my opinion is that if we be not wanting in trouble and time as artful ’ piece may be produced as what has been hitherto done yet only by those whounderstand art and its rules in theory and practice and though it seëm difficult to attempt thing new we must not there- fore be discouraged ’ for what great things have not been experimented and performed what did not aexandere had he feared danger and trouble he would never have gone the lengths he did he had mind to do it this created resolution and that finished his hopes but to return to our subject let us- suppose that picture ten feet high with figures as big as the life ought to be viewed at ten feet distance and that smaller one five feet high with figures half as big as the life must have five feet distance and thus the smaller tne nearer according to perspective now the question is which of those three pieces ought to be most finished many will cerrainly say —the last but my opinion is that each of the three pieces inust be painted equally neat because each has its determinate distance with respect to its bigness again there is another such piece ten feet high but divided into three grounds whereon are placed the same figures as in the three former to wit those as big as the life on the fore-ground those half as big on the second and the last on the third ground the question now is which of these three grounds ought so be most finished being all in one picture the judges will contrary to what they before asserted say the first and that the hindermost must not be so neat and finished since they can never relisn that the figures on the second and third grounds ought to be painted as neat and elaborate as those on the fore-ground for say they — who would perceive it at ten feet distance nay who ever saw such painting or did it but the case is not whether there have been such pictures but whether they ought to be so we are not ignorant that it is the custom to finish small pieces the smaller the neater and large ones contrarily bold or loose now would fain know the reason why there should be more work in figure of three feet than in one of sixp can it be proved that the small one ought to have fold nay an hair more than in full proportion but what other answer can be made if the custom were not good it would not have prevailed nor lasted so long.. never- theless as long as we reason thus without foundation and bigot ourselves to common practice and old custom we shall never advance it is not the proper way to go forward and therefore many keep their old station but want to be informed of new things without which art can not improve variety nourishes the mind igrant that men sometimes produce new things which meet not with public approbation but whence come they either from false grounds and inconsideration or else an immethodical way of explanation to express my thoughts perspicuoussy have exhibited them as plain as could in plate xlv and question not but you will apprehend my meaning numb has three pieces fronting with their distances of ten five and three feet and an half num is the same in profile with the measure or visual rays which limit the- distances whether great or small being the same position as num where they are all three in one now my original question with respect to numb is which of the three pieces ought to be most finished lf any one say the small one because it must be viewed nearest afk again whether there must be more work in the small than the large one now behold numb where thay are all three in one according according to perspective and let the question be which ought to be most finished the foremost or the hindmost you will certainly answer that it shews itself that the figures on the fore-ground must be more finished than what is fur- ther off and that there must also be more work in the large asbeing nearer but how agrees this with what was just now said that the smallest of the three pieces ought to be most finished since now you say the largest must be so for example and objects are the same and it is already granted that the smaller it is the nearer is the distance asfigned and that in the smallest or furthermost when nearest there ought to be as much work as in the foremost and though you will ’ say that the last figure is fainter than the foremost yet there is not fold less in it than if it were quite forward and as big as the life iurge further when highly finisn figure in full proportion after the life must sit at least as near as the model is high to perceive even the most minute parts of it now ifl would make another figure half as big also after the life to place it on my second ground how must then set the model ought to keep the same sitting or must remove further from it à this last is never done for if we were we should instead of painting-room want westminster-hall in order to model an off-scape figure after the life but supposing it were so must then fit so far off that may see it more naturally it is certain that should not see the half of it and though it may be said to this that what can not be seen in the life ought not to make it look natural to come into picture yet pray observe that supposing make in the off-scape figure of foot and half high and the subject require it to be holding thread to which hangs medal of the bigness of half guinea the question is whether must exprefs the medal but not the thread again were to express window without the glazing or lead¬ work or door without hinges or key-hole what would those things be taken for if these did not appear medal dropping out of the hand an open window and sereen instead of door from all which premises linfer that if things be practicable and have any bigness they ought to be expressed in the little and as may say even to thread the distance makes them natural and if well painted and the diminu- tion be exactly observed according to the remoteness of the objects whether these observations will pass current lknow not yet every man has the liberty to use or let them alone as he pleafes ch ap xxi of the different colouring in great and small pieces ryhss proposition is consequence of the preceeding and ’ to be intelligible shall shew my thoughts by the following example in plate xlvi there is gallery twelve feet high and twenty-five feet long divided into three pannels each sive feet wide and ten feet high the two outward pannels are cloathed from top to bottom and the middle one but half way from the top down- wards and under it is an handsome seat the three cloths are tobe painted by three several masters suppose with landscapes all having like horizon but different points of sight one master embellisnes-his work with figures either fable or history another introduces architecture and imagery according to his gusto and ’ the third adorns his with cattie or what else he thinksfit the question is now in order to produce general decorum ggreeing with na¬ ture whether these masters otght not to be concurring in-their work with- re- spect to perspective force and deminution certainly they ought for the light must in all the three pictures fall alike either from the left right before or be- hind the air must be the same since theyall ought to appear as one landscape seen through three openings as two doors and window but now another question arises whether the figures in all three ought to be as big as the life à this will be agreed to with respect to those on-the fore- ground but how then will it be in the middle picture which is but half the size osthe two others how shall figures be introduced there in full proportion for half foot of ground or five feet is too much difference now if the master who is to make the middle as the smallest piece paint it as strong and warmas he is able nay as face in full proportion of rémbrant iit would be intirely against nature and the rules of art but to return to our example suppose the off-scape either in small or large piece tobe one and the same even were the one as small as the palm of the hand and the other ten yards high the reason and exampleswhereof have sufficiently shewed in the last chapter and shall further enforce in its place in tiat treating of what is to be understood byfa painted table whether landscape historv portraiture we know but before leave this subject must still ’ start another difficulty that large painting is often copied in little and the contrary now if for in- stance all that is large in the original be lessened in proportion in the copy how can they look alike as in the design with the two doors is exhibited in bogh which are large clouds and in the other small ones and all that is in the off-scape scems more distant in the one than the other if the off-scape in the small picture be that of the great one by what can you proveit since the objects which in the greatest distance in the small piece are hardly visible appear in the great one so large and distinct to which answer that every thing appearing in the one is and remains in the other always the same but so much nearer and this is evident for is there any thing in the world which how remote soevever can- not be still remoter it has been formerly sad that every thing on earth is subject to the laws of perspective except the fun moonand ’ stars and ’ what else is seen in the firmament with respect to their forms as for ’ the clouds they are moveable bodies and therefore must be considered as earthly objects lessening and ’ enlarging according to their distance height and lowness all these things say can go off and approach be distant and near besides there is ’ difference betwen copy and an original as well in the form as use say in the formy because because the- one ought tobe viewed afar off and the other near moreover it ne- ver happens that the copy is hung by the original but the fellow to it chap xxii of the difference of force in large and small painting and the effects of magnifying and diminisbing glasses eewo be better understood we shall begin with the air and take these two points for granted namely that all dark objects in proportion as they go off become on their light parts lighter and lighter and the light ones con- trarily darker and darker how clear soever the weather yet less in sun-shine as éxperience sufficiently shews now ifit be afked whether the colour of the objects do not thereby also loose its nature and purity it can loose but little and only in shade which broke by the other side of the light is gradually transformed into the blue of it in proportion as the objects go off or to speak better until uniting with the off- scape they at last disappear consider also the difference between small paintings in the open air and those within doors in reference to the going off and the colours we say first that the air without is the most clear and bright light in the ab- sence of sun-shine and though an apartment must needs be lighted from without yet it will be less in force and brightnefs and therefore the objects more darkish both in lights and shades secondly the objects can not so visibly grow faint in their going off because by the smallnefs of the distance few or no vapours are perceptible thirdly the shades are not subject to any alteration or mixture but retain their natuzal qualities because there is no other light within doors than what comes through the windows and this has not power enough to cause any reflexions save some little near the window nor give any colour so that by the darkishness the objects whether portraits figures flowers retain their natural colours intirely as well in shades as lights wherefore since the beauty and purity of the colours appear best by the serenity and brightnefs ofthe air they must contrarily abate in their effects and force by means of the darkness ishall here propose small instance for explanation let good master paint any thing as portrait landscape figures or cattle in oil as small and neat as miniature-painter and let both these masters chuse their subjects most beautiful and natural now view the two paintings together and you will find that the one differs as much from-the other as within-door- light does from the open air it is therefore unnatural and against the rules to use that warmth and strength of colours in order to force small and distant objects out of their proper places or to make the window sly towards us instead of going off from us we ought moreover to know that things painted in little can never never be taken for the truth fince it is undeniable that the life appears therein no otherwise than at distance viz through door window or other opening whether within or without doors wherefore they ought to be painted in such manner that when hung up they may not appear like apainted board cloth or flat but natural window or door through which the life is really seen which can not be effected by the force of warm shades or hot colours but by the retiring and tender ones broken by the interposing air according as the weather is more or less clear or misty and this without exception of any ordonnance whether land- scape architecture history experience will confirin the truth if you view your picture through piece of sine gause somewhat bluisn for then you will find the lights of your objects gra- dually grow weaker in proportion to their distance without loosing the beauty of their colours it will even give piece certain softness and sweetness and great de- corum you may make the same experiment with another piece of gause of grey colour in imitation of foggy weather and it will not only darken the light of the objects but also foul and muddle it and make the painting look cold and disagreeable having shewn that the use of the greatest force of shades in small paintings is unnatural and against art as well in within as without-door representations we shall now speak of the contrary to wit pieces with large objects in order to shew what therein without prejudice we think the most natural it is constant maxim that the life seen near is in greatnefs force and colour superior to what is distant the one being nature itself and the other seemingly so for figures in full proportion are like us who view them in every particular of force aspect and colour except motion which being granted it may be easily appre- hended if we will submit to reason that there is vast difference between large and small ordonnances of figures in fuil proportion and those half as big with respect to the interposing air the only true cause of things being more or less faint and their going off as well in within as without-door representations let us then rightly observe in what manner such large objects ought to appear that they may be natural and artful but previously consider two things what handling is the most natural for their execution as for the light ithink the common best and much more proper than sun- shinc and though some who set up for the buono gusto are continually talking of painting broad it is neverthelefs great error as we have often said always and without difference to use that manner since it is not proper in common cham- ber light especially in figures as big as the life which ought to be in all respects like the spectators even so much that if painted on boards and cut away they should not be taken for painting but the life itself to give them broad shades but dubious and melting ones to the end that they may rise and round not black like spagnolet nor grey yellow or russet like rembrant john lievens and many other ltalian dutch and flemiss painters who without difference bring warmth as they call it into the shades to such degree as to fire them only to cause force let this be duly weighed lest the colour of the natural and perfect life be ne- glected in my opinion it is best to make the shade of the same nature as the stuff ex- hibiting in all objects whether nudities draperies wood stone either red yellow blue or green the most proper colour as well in light as shade as to the force ishould not be sparing either of white or black though many have prétended that we must not use white good painter will attempt any thing you must not suffer yourself to be swayed by this or that manner fol- low nature and you content art away then with drudgery and muddling handle your work boldly yet not with rembrant and lievens to let the colours run down the cloth but lay them smooth and even that your objects may seem round and relieved only by art not by daubing let the agreement be so general that in truth it may be said the figures are large strongly painted and boldly handled people now -- days think that painting has attained such perfection as not to admit of further improvements since the beautiful and great manner the bon goût and hot colouring are at this time finely performed in france italy the netherlands and other countries where art flourishes but we do not find now -- days wits who endeavour to distinguisn themselves among the knowing by new inventions we had several of them some time since of whom ishall name but two rembrant and john lievens whose manner is not intirely to be rejected espe- cially that of the former as well for its naturalness as uncommon force yet we see very few followed him and these like him sell short at last notwithstanding some were and still are who asfert that rembrant was able to do every thing which art and pencil could effect and that he surpassed all artists even to this day was there ever say they painter who came so near nature in force of colouring by his beautiful lights agreeable harmony strange and uncommon thoughts having such extraordinary talents in what could he be deficient and is not that enough to charm all the world though he had not practised manner which was in use long before but desire these men may know that my opinion herein is quite different from theirs though must own had formerly singular inelination for rem¬ brant ’ manner for as soon as began to be sensible of the infallible rules of art found myself under necessity of renouncing my mistake and quitting his as be¬ ing founded only on loose whims and uncertain grounds without president and now methinks can not any where better than here shew the effects of magnifying and diminishing glasses and the various opinions touching them many imagine that painting in little and the life seen through diminishing- glase are one and the same and that the small life seen through magifying- glafs and large picture appear alike but these men are much mistaken and as wide from truth as the east is from the west the glafs ground hollow or concave shews near-objects in their force beauty and warmth with diminution and the glafs ground rifing or convex contrarily exhibits faint and distant objects in full proportion dull and broken now let any reasonable man view the two pieces the small one warm and strong and the large faint and weak and determine which of them is most like the the life or nature my opinion is against both they are like man drest in woman ’ cloaths and the contrary for one is too strong and the other too weak but admitting these men to be in the right and we were to side with them we should by this their position and application of it discover their wrong notion since they make the large strong and the small even as strong as the large by which and the aforsaid effects of the two glasses the mistake sufficiently ap- pears and artists are advertised of it ch ap xxiii an enquiry into the difference between large landscape ornamented with small figures and small one with large with respect to the air the day being supposed clear in both to be short and intelligible we premise that in landscape the air is fo governing that all the piece contains whether off-scape water fields trees must from it receive their decorum and naturalness and at all times of the day whether morning noon or evening nay at night also for as the air alters all the objects lighted by it do the same if the day be bright and the air clear all things appear so if it be evening they are dusky and at night dark the master who has regard to this essential point must needs succeed and be thought artful and why because he has in that part simply followed nature as an infal- lible guide yet he ought to be certain in lighting the objects according to their several natures and to observe with me whether there be difference between large opening without embellishments and the contrary with respect to the air by the air is meant the superior part which in clear day is commonly called the blue of the sky we say that the two unlike objects in landscape to wit one ornamented and the other plain ought in order to look natural to be alike clear and neither lighter nor darker ifthey both exhibit the same hour of the day and if one were of darker blue than the other it is mistake and unjustifiable for one of them must needs be contrary to truth now it may be here objected according to the old way of thinking that master of his art may for decency ’ sake freely correct and alter nature when sne is obstructing butl answer in few words that in that case nature ought to com- mand and art obey what can be the purpose to paint in landscape the blue of the sky two or three feet above the horizon as dark as if it were evening when all the objects in the piece are lighted with the utmost brightness and force either sideways or fronting although the sun be setting even the shades lighter than the upper air consider how such representations must look in the eyes of the know¬ ing and whether it be otherwise than day-occurrence or stage-play represented in the evening what advantage would accrue if évery body had true knowledge and judgment in the art if we did not shew them art what love can it gain he who knows art is very sensible of what it aims at wherefore lover of truth ought undertaking things out of their way not that they should not be able to perform them but on an apprehension of falling from good into bad manner fince experience shews that each supposeshis own manner the best think have found out method for those accustomed to large and strong things to fit them for the small and weak the cloth you design to paint on ought to be primed with light grey ground for the large work and with dark and warm ground for the small so that having no other patterns whether figures or landscape than warm and strong ones you may temper your colours accord- ingly and get rid of your old custom herein pallet of the same colour is also necessary that the colours tempered on it may produce in painting the same force or weakness and to shew that this method is of greater moment than some may presently imagine shall relate what once happened to myself certain gentleman had his hall-ceiling lined with five cloths primed with pearl-colour and being afterwards desirous of having something painted on them proposed my doing it whereupon made designs to his liking and had four cloths sent home to me the middle one large and square and three smaller round ones but in lieu of the fifth which was got rotten by dampnefs new one was sent to me not primed with light ground like the rest but of brown colour after had dead-coloured the work and viewed it together iperceived that the shades in the last cloth were much browner and warmer than in the ethers and though in finishing endeavoured as much as posfible to help it and bring it like the rest yet something remained in the shades of another nature which some persons judged to be better than those of the other cloths those especially who were implicitly addicted to the warm manner without considering in general whether it was proper or not thus found that the ground of cloth may often mislead us and put us beside the mark either in nearness or distance but knowing the reason of it if it happen again the fault is our own and thus we may in- sensibly and without compulsion pafs from large things into the small and from the small into the large we shall further observe on what occasions the aforesaid means may be made use of to advantage in painting light landscape in painting halls rooms in night-pieces apparitions and candle-lights and as well in little as in full proportion for these three particular designs we may prepare the grounds of the cloths thus that for the landscape ought to be primed with pearl colour that for an apartment with umber that for apparitions or candle-light with ologa ’ earth or umber and black the first more or less bluish according to the quantity of fky the second somewhat brighter and more warm according as you intend to exhibit either common light or sun-shine and the third according as it has little or much light depth or approach smallness or largness yet the larger the more black we think those colours befides the tints very useful and ne- necessary not without reason because they have affinity to the nature of the subject subjects the first to the blue of the szy the second to the reflexions and the third to the shade have often madeit question whether it were worth while to mention these particulars because am ’ tensible some may think them trifling as willingly own they seem to be but on better confideration of the matter and how many things are neglected which either offer of themselves or seem trivial though of absolute use my suspicion abated with this consolation that how minute soever my thoughts may be shall be satisfied if they any ways tend to the advantage and improvement of art and instruction in it wherefore re-assuming the subject say that the cloth may be prepared thus the colours being ground up stiff with fat oil ought to be mixed very thin with turnpentine and the cloth painted over with soft tool in this manner the sky blue and the ground gray or green more or less dark as your ordon- nance and design require now if it be afked how we must proceed in case of rising objects as trees houses or other things coming against the off-scape and above the horizon and which fill up great part of it answer that my meaning is not to provide such painted cloths without previously knowing what we are to paint upon them for we must first sketch our thoughts on paper and then con- clude how much or little sky or ground must be painted blue or green yellow or black in those grounds we have no occasion for fine and costly colours common ones will serve if they have good body and cover well for the blue take indigo and white for the ground umber and white or lamp-black and light oaker for architecture and other stone-work umber brown oaker .the ground thus laid and being dry has three desirable qualities it is fit for work being even and dull wherefore the colours how thin so- ever take at sirst which smooth or glossy ground will not admit without much trouble it is durable by its relation to the tints and colours painted on it which hold their perfect beauty and force which they éannot be when the ground is of another colour or tint such as white upon black light blue on dark yellow or red in time appearing more and more through though ever so fatly painted it is expeditious for him who has ready hand and quick pencil and desires to paint up his defign at once which otherwise can not be done with- out dead-colouring this method has still further advantages then some may perhaps imagine it is particularly useful in ceiling-pieces not only in areal representations but also bass-reliefs of one colour whether white grey violet or yellowish judge now whether the trouble of preparing such cloth be not small when compared with the great advantage arising from it as proof of it have observed of the great bartholet that when he was to paint portrait with purple or black drapery he laid in the drapery flat with fingle dark purple or black without any folds and on finishing only heigkten- ed and shaded it and thus worked up the piece at once chap xxiv of the lights within-doors this light ought to be ranked among the day-light as taking its rise and government from thence this commonly called chamber-light we di- vide into three forts the first enters through doors windows and other openings and proceeding from the air thereby causes the second which is occasioned by reflexion as from wall ground or other objects the third subsists in itself as proceeding from candle or torch the lights have different natures those of the open air are clean onthelight parts of objects and donot alter them more than in the open air causing the light to be broad and the shades dark the second falls more or lefs pure on objects according to the colour and nature of the grounds and walls their shades being dim and disappearing and only the deepest shades visible and strong the room in general both above and below being thereby lighted as well by the force and effect of the wall within as by the ground without of the ground-shades we shall say nothing here as having in another place treated of them and their force and diminution the candle light we have also in particular chapter sufficiently shewed how so manage as likewise sun-shine which last we think as we have often said very improper to be represented in room- many have thought very improperly of those lights taking in perverse man- ner the liberty which horrace allows to poetsand painters and pretending to help the defects of nature doit in an extravagant manner making no scruple to break down whole wall of room to let beautiful light on their objects as strongly as in the open air they even go such lengths that though they have doors and windows they give every thing their proper ground-shades except window-frames crofs-pieces and piers as if wall were not solid body as well as man table chair or other furniture imagining they may do so that nothing mav obstruct the figures but in my opinion it were better to take away the cause of such an evil than to spoil the property of things by representing it in painting an apartment we ought well to consider the architecture to aid it and give it proper division and shew door for passage as for the windows whether many or few it must appear by the objects and by the ground-shades of the crofs-pieces and piers and that plain in sun-shine but dubious without it and in order to make this last point clear which in this chapter we chiefly aim at shall in the two examples in plate xlviii plainly express my sentiments the first exhibits two different lights falling in through two different windows the one proceeding from the clear air and the other by reason of near building before before the window somewhat broke little or no air being seen above that building between the windows is large pier or blank wall mark those windows with the letters anb and the blank wall with and then observe how the shade which the pier cgives on the ground is cut on both sides by the light falling in through the windows and and how acute it terminates and how the light is weakened by that of moreover what fhort touch of light gives when that of goes far into the room as also that the figure receiving the light from is dusky and has fhort ground-shade and the other figure contrarily receiving its light from is lignter and its light broader and gives longer ground-fhade observe further that the nearer the figures are to the light or window the purer and more plain are their ground- shades when contrarily the column placed against the pier gives double ground shade the greater overcoming the less the second example shews the same things according to the condition of the lights which are altered and come in from behind the third and fourth examples in plate xlix shew the same things in land- scape for the same observation prevails in both with respect to light and shade as to the colours in the open air and their alterations have said enough of them in proper chapter think it great heedlessness in many painters who in giving their within- door objects side-light do not mind whether they stand on the near or off-side of the window letting in the light nor consider that the light coming in through narrow opening spreads and by reason of interpofing vapours in proportion to the force of the light there must needs fall proportional weak or strong shade on the ground great general epaminondas whereon no observation of light is neglected all things have their natural effects which make the piece look so charming tyros must not think it irksome to mind so many observations in matters of consequence which when once well apprehended in their principles nothing but carelefsness will afterwards make them slight ’ endeavour then to fix the prin- ciples and knowledge in your memories by the help of judgment and all things will certainly have natural and easy issue chap xxv of the applicagion of lights to the different species of histories with table an ordonnance of all the lights that we may not be thought to keep any thing back from the artist which may be of service to him judged it necessary to subjoin this chapter to.the lights though we have so largely treated of their natures qualities forces and effects drawing drawing and out-line how fine soever are not agreeable before they are shaded and when this is done as nature and art require it exalts the former and gives an additional lustre to nature for sober light suits not with bustling figures with respect to within-door representations because it abates the elegance and art of the other as in the murder of casar in the senate-house or the death of cato but let me not be hereby supposed to overthrow my former asfertion that sun- shine is not proper within doors since on such occasions as those there must be found such medium in the light as there is in the colours between the more and lefs beautiful and as we have shewed to be between sun-shine and common light again this light would be very improper in salutation of elizabeth and mary or the story of stratonica or that of the queen of sheba these require more tender soft and sweet light and therefore common one if this be not observed good out-line may be spoiled as when fhade should happen to fall on therising parts or ground-shade pass over them were we to make an history wherein both paffions the sedate and stirring should meet requiring consequently an opposition in the lights we ought to place the acting figures forwards on the first ground as having the predominancy and to adapt the light to them as much as possible accordingly story now occurs to me wherein the three principal paffions must meet in one composition mean that of ahasuerus esther and haman esther shews supplicating and meek posture and countenance the king disco- vers wrath and paffion and haman astonishment and fright now in order to cast well the light on those figures according to my apprehension would dis- pose esther in the greatest light somewhat in profile the king in the strongest mean where it falls most and has its chief effect and encrease it by the force of colours but haman would place fitting on the other side of the table in dim light the rather to sereen him from the king ’ wrath and as it is feast or ban- quet prepared by esther where every thing is royal and magnificient think the common light here the most proper because the sequel of the story and the king ’ rage are but accidental we shall conclude this book with the following ordonnance or table of the lights here the beautiful and darting aurora is dissipating the foggy vapours of the gastly night by her agreeable day-break that the moft perfect productions of rich and liberal nature may appear in their true qualities forms colours and full lustre fhie descends from on high holding clear lighting torch and driving dark night into subterraneous hollows the more radiant pabus sitting in his chariot is mounting out of thetis ’ lap gilding all things under the azure heavens not excepting the snow-white lilies the chaste diana with her sharp-pointed silver horns is satisfied with what her brother imparts to the world as serving not only to revive but also to be beacon to the paths of mortals the hellish megara tisipone with her stinking torch creating anxiety and fright fretting at it flies this irresistible light inflaming all things in her way even tarnishing all beautiful objects and colours with her dark and nasty vapours you see here the bright morning by its pure rays surpassing all former light but the sun by his fiery force gains the laurel gilding all that his beams can touch whereby we perceive the weakness of the silver moon not able to distinguish objects and make them apparent we exhibit here at moderate distance on the right side of the piece four round pedestals of equal magnitude with their plinths and mouldings running to- wards the point of sight on the first as being the morning is seen bright star giving short ground- shade ending in point on the second appears the sun in full lustre giving long and broad ground-shade sharp and plain like the object the third has the moon ’ presence which produces -like ground-shade and the fourth whereon iz lighted torch causes by this light long and en- larging ground-shade the art of painting book vi of landscape ’ here the god pan sits playing his pipes with pipe resting on his arm and about him are three women franticly dancing hand in hand one of them is dressed in green and on her head is chaplet of herbs intermixed with field-flowers another is in blue adorned with chaplet of bulrushies and white bell-flowers and the third is in black or dark rayment wearing chaplet of roots and mushrooms these three figures reprefent trees rivers and grounds the place opens an agreeable country enriched with woods rivers and hills chap of landscapes in general tis constant maxim that variety ’ the soul ’ refin ’ delight and the chief viand of her window ’ sight varietyis the soul of mirth sting of pleasure and the sauce of life it is so gratifying that without it we think ourselves slaves and by con- stant return we wish to live for ever without it we covet death because the soul as pent up in dungeon calls for enlargement but he is much out of the way who hourly wants variety since any excess is both ridiculous and hurtful as well well to thé agent as the patient he who proposes à livelihood from art is not to please himfelf only because his happinefs or unhappinefs depends not on himself but others according as his works plexse or displeaie and as every creauture has particular liking and when in company they are not to be satisfied with one fort of food but with variety so judicious artist should strenuously endeavour to qualify himfelf for every person ’ taste like an expert apothecary who stores his ffiop with all proper medicines for the general good and thereby gets money let this suffice to hint that landscape-painter must not be wedded to one choice either too sticring and extravagant or too reposed and melancholy because it would please but one set of men and his advantage would therefore arise but from few whereas variety will allure both forts and his fame be the greater ithoughtit proper to premifethis as an advice to many let us now ere we come to the effence of this branch of painting considering that landscape is the most delightful object in the art and has very powerful qualities with respect to sight when by sweet harmony of colours and elegant management it diverts and pleases the eye what can be more satisfactory than to travel the world without going out of doors and in moment to jurney out of asia into africa and from thence back to america even into the elysian fields to view all the won- ders without danger or inconveniency from fun or frost what is more ac- ceptable than shady groves open parks clear waters rocks fountains high mountains and deep misty vallies all these we can see at once and how re- lieving must the fight be to the most melancholy temper these circumstances being fo glorious entertaining and useful let us consider what conftitutes fine landscape it confists principally in an orderly dispofition of lights against darkness whence arises the good harmony which insensibly deceives the fight in such sort that though it be flat cloth yet it exhibits natural prospective opening even nature itself landscape requires two qualities to make it delightful disposition colouring the disposition is an artful bringing together of irregular objects which never- theless feem not to be against nature or impossible the colouring is conjunction of proper colours in the aforesaid objects ac- cording to their situations and qualities agreeing with the nature of the air in such manner as to repose and pleafe the eye and yet all these qualities can not alone produce perfect landscape unless good choice precede which confists in joining together variety of objects viz woods with vistos wherein the eye may lose itself rocks rivers and water-falls green fields delightful to the eye herein lies the strefs of landscape and painting is very like nature with respect to things inanimate not to mention many others as the embelliffments which give it the utmost perfection how- ever this variety confists not only in the difference or irregularity of the ob- jects az trees hills fountaine and the like but in the diversity of each of them for instance bending and strait trees large and small hills wrought and plain fountains cottages and palacés green and russet lands the same diversity- is to be observed in colouring according to thé seasons of the year that lovers may not be cloyed by producing with the cockoo always the same thing as stir and motion crocked and mis-shapen bodies of trees waving branches bar- ren grounds blue mountains or beasts birds huntings and the like or con- trarily always repose and quietnefs strait stems clipped trees level grounds in- tirely green standing water and the same light colour and nature we have formerly said that table or picture hung up and viewed at deter- minate distance appears as the life without-doors of which the frame shews only the thickness of the sill wherein it is put or wall against which it hangs the question is now whether such painted opening can be natural and deceiving without sixing point of sight and an horizon equal with the eye of the spectator and whether it be the same to place them higher or lower and further whe- ther the thickness of the frame be sufficient to snew the thickness of the wall without- continuing it upon the cloth say positively —no -and that such an opening can not be natural much less deceiving if one of those requisites be wanting which prove thus take chair and sit at the window with your eye just level with the sill and then you will observe that the horizon or greatest distance parting the sky and earth will as may say approach towards it and be parellel with your fight and that therefore you can see nothing but sky then arise and you will perceive rhe horizon also rise and that your eye is always level with it discovering here and there objects on the ground now consider the in- sufficieney of your picture when its point of sight does not agree with your eye and how nature joined to your imagined art is perverted your deceit made ap- parent and your intentions spoiled it is therefore evident that the picture in whichthe point of sight is placed must determine your distance and that the eye ought never to leave the horizon but be always level with it if the eye be lower than the point of sight all the objects must needs seem to tumble forwards and the fore-ground to sink if you are above the point of fight the fore-ground rises and all the objects are tumbling backwards how then can this seem natural and deceiving wherefore there is no other way than to hang the picture in cer- tain place and six distance whence it is to be viewed without alteration as for the frame it is necessary to shew the thickness of it on the cloth in order to know at once the distance from whence you ought to view it because its angu- lar rays are directed to the point of sight am not insensible that this position may seem strange to some who will object that they never observed any such thing in houssin titian bril or francesco mola or other good masters but the old saying shall plead for me example is better than precept for they endeavour to follow the mistakes but not the virtues of those excellent masters am sure that had those great masters thought of these ob- fervations they would not have rejected them do you want demonstration that every good master approves of what say and follows it shew me but one picture drawing or print of theirs exhibiting an inward visto out of an hall or chamber wherein they have forgot to express the thickness of the framing or walls since otherwise they must depart from the naturalness and we would say that instead of an off-distance they had represented picture or tapestry there- fore fore conclude that if nature require this in picture it is still more necessary when we would have the picture taken for nature itself in order to deceive even masters but some even think if arive in the art to their heights shall be satisfied in the méantime art despairs of attaining great lustre by further im- provements but to re-assume our former position my opinion is that what has been said ought to be regarded when we meet with any thing in halls chambers galleries and the like whether in niches above or in chimneys or on other occasions and the main point is to place well the horizon according as the piece stands high or low my usual practice was to make the thickness of walls plainly appear in my paintings and would always have done it but on painting on time for lover of quality was obliged to alter it for his pleafure on furmise did it to save work not for the good of it affirming that the painting was thereby docked and too much incumbered but the child must have name he imagining that the alteration made the work look larger here let it not be thought that my piece was wholly taken up with the ordon- nance and the thicknefs afterwards painted upon it because that would be great folly first squared out the thicknefs and then adapted my design thereto as being more convenient than afterwards to paint the thickness over it and thereby dock too much of the work now to give the studious artist right notion as think how to compose good landscape after an easy manner let him him consider the nature of his subject what country he is to represent what season of the year what month and what hour of the day whether the subject require sun or moon-shine clear or misty rain or windy weather having fixed these points let him proceed to seek proper materials bringing them together agreeable to his general design and disposing the objects in their proper places each according to its nature and quality next let him place the point of sight in the middle of the piece higher or lower as he would have less or more sky or ground considering whether the ground is to be level or not and thus to order the figures equal with the eye to discover directly whether the painting be seen through an high window in low ground or from low ground to an high for it is commonly known that if things be seen from an height the figures ought to be under the horizon and when viewed from low place they must rise above the horizon having done this let him chuse proper light falling in either from before behind or afide to light the object accordingly and then to dispose the principal object if possible and the subject permit in the best place in the middle of the piece at least from off the edges of it of divers paffions if the matter require it mean if the landscape be mixed with history one ought to predominate and surpafs the rest in greatnefs beauty and elegance filling always the greatest part of the piece with it whether by means of trees or buildings the by-works must be suitable to it the better explain the matter if the subject be wood it ought to be adorned with wood-gods guides or terms tombs seats for repose wood-nymphs and many other thinga proper to it if à river it may be handled in the same manner with the addition of river- gods naiades or swimming water-nymphs fishermen swans and other such ornaments if field be the chief object it may be fet off with shepherds and shepherdes- ses cow-herds bacchanals and others rocks and caves require the same management with this caution that the eye be taken with the principal object only without ather regard to the by- works than as aids and incidents for in fuch conduct lies the beauty and good¬ ness of landscape as to the ornaments of modern landscape such as of the famous everdingen pynakker ruysdaal moucheron and others who follow the modern manner they do not call for the aforesaid embellishments as having other sufficient matter viz cottages fishermen carriers waggons and such daily rural occurrences which are as proper to it as the antique for the decorations alone in my opinion make landscape either antique or modern unless we exhibit modern and known places wherein the antique would be very improper as breugel bril and hans bol have done without distinction between the lowest life and what is better for nature is in her objects now as she was thoufand years ago woods fields mountains and waters are always the same and therefore nature is modern that is imperfect but she is antique and perfect when we judiciousty adorn her with uncommon and magnificent buildings tombs and other remains of anti- quity which in conjunction with the ornaments above-mentioned compose an antique landscape but when modern prospect on the rhine is decked with antique figures and stories it must look ridiculous since cottages and civil and military architecture will evidently discover the prudent folly of the master though otherwise excellent in both manners chap ii of the light form and grouping of objects in landfcapes et us now proceed further in considering the principal qualities and pro- perties requisite in fine landscape these in my opinion consist in good disposition of the irregular objects as welk with respect to their matter fhape and form as their colour in the number and grouping them in good ordering of the light by well difposing the irregular objects we produce life and motion the objects confist of crooked stralt -wry high and how and by the colours we effect the fame when one thing is faint and weak another melting this strong that hard the the grouping consists in joining those irregular objects as of two bodies on two different grounds that on the fore-ground ought to be smaller than the other on the second thus if sitting figure come torward standing one must be placed behind it and on the third ground décumbent figure on the fourth climbed one and beyond it standing figure again trees rocks buildings cattle and other things occuring in landscape may be dis- posed in the same manner so far as concerns the irregularity of objects which in their matter and colour shall shew in the following example see plate isuppose then in piece five grounds with the off-icape of which the fourth is'the largest on the fore-ground place vase of dark porphiry numbered the second ground fountain numbered on the third ground an hedge numbered on the fourth ground statue numbered and the fifth is low off-scape numbered thus much may suffice as to grounds going off be¬ hind each other the same disposition ought to be observed on single or level ground as for the light its principal management lies in opposing brownness and dark- ness to middling and greater light but when two lights are to set off each other the colour must effect this as for instance when lighted figure is to come off against light off-scape the former must certainly be of darkisn colour as having no shade and then it will produce good effect for the chief manage- ment lies in placing warm-coloured object against light faint and weak off- scape contrarily light and faint colours against dark and warm grounds the foremost and strongest object against the deepest lointain and the objects further off against nearer parts of the off-scape and thus light objects against dark and the contrary the artist also ought to observe that two lights must never be above each other unlefs one be visibly different from the other in force either in colour or tint lest one seem to run into the other which at distance would be pre- posterous union moreover part of the lointain should always be broken and the eye on one side or the other kept nearer either by means of wood rock building or other object part of the horizon also should always be seen or for want of it some level object such as fronting wall colonade or the like this will produce satisfaction to the eye and elegance in the piece no one will deny that unequal numbers are the most perfect according to the demonstration both of philosophers and mathematicians this inequality also observe and follow in my disposition of figures thus first place one figure on the fore-ground then three on the second two on the third and four on the fourth ground and then again one and so forth and thus as well on single level ground as where they happen one behind ano¬ ther these unequal numbers in the groups are certainly not of the least mo- ment in landscapes as to the colour mentioned before it is to be especially noted that the co- lour which is predominant and has the chief place in the piece must no where else be seen than with little parts mean of less beauty quantity and dignity chap iii of the by-ornaments in landscapes is usual for landscape-painters to have particular inclination for one choice one affecting wild and desolate prospects another reposed and soft ones and third northern or frigid views sun and moon-shine water-falls downs watry and woody prospects and the reason is because most people by strange impulse seem rather to covet the gifts of nature than the heavenly which afford what is whole and most perfect in word they seek only part though all be to be got this proceeds from youth and ignorance wanting fundamental knowledge and therefore not judging what is most beautiful and profitable nay what they themselves are fit for but it is most unaccountable that many land- scape painters are not able to embellisn their own works to which some may ob- ject that as they have not made it their practice so they are content with hand- ling single prospects well leaving any thing else to the owner ’ disposal sad story that they can not do their work without help whence it is evident of what moment it is for à landscape-painter to embellisn his own work whether the design be his own or borrowed since certainly if he be master of his art he must also know what is most suitable in his picture not trifles or figures to no purpose but histories fictions or parables taken from scripture ovid or asop ornaments which will enrich the work but this is seldom done because few have time to spare or love reading as for me would rather want prints and drawings than books as an history-painter make use of books and descriptions of landscapes and beasts but were la landscape-painter should provide books of history for what should be the better for exercising one particular part of which am master and neglecting others as necessary to be known need not learn what already know but it is impossible to get skill in things without inquiring into them have time for perusing novels why not also for necessary things am icurious to know the state of the war or desirous of peace for the sake of art of what advantage is the peace if do not qualify myself to meet it as there are few or no painters who have no particular manner so few are qua- lified for embellishment since every one strives to excel in something and to get name by certain wonderfulness therein either by beautiful colours extrava- gant draperies broad and funny lights or round and dusky ones which often spoil work instead ofs bettering it these they can not forbear their chief talent lying in them though they frequently have contrary effect when they are to adorn other men ’ works we must also observe that there are two forts of by- ornaments the necessary and the unnecesfary the necessary are such as ap- pertain to the matter to wit immoveable and fixed ornaments the unneces- sary are the moveable anes viz men beasts birds and the like which with re- respect to landscapes can not be considered as necessary but only as tending to give the pieces life that they may not pall but delight the eye to be more plain in this point we shall consider what painter ought to ob- serve and fhun in the by-ornaments say then that it is very indecent to place woman alone resting near priapus much more in the company of men unless you would exhibit strumpet it is also improper that woman well dressed should sit alone by way-fide or in wood or stand prattling with ordinary people it is much more proper to make man sitting and woman passing by than the woman sitting and the man passing by or holding discourse unleis he be inquiring the way it is also much better that sitting man shew the way than one who is passing along if there be company of men and women let not the men be idle and the women loaden and if woman be resting by herself do not assign her greater burthen than she can conveniently carry alone whether bundles trunks or vessels woman of fafhion should never travel alone through woods or val- leys especially if youthful without the company of at least damsel or child shepherds and shepherdesses husbandmen and women suit well together where there are no sheep shepherd or piper or lasses with chaplets of flowers are improper because such people are not sent into the field to prattle but work it is better to inquire after the shepherd than the sheep country-people ’ chil- dren are seldom within doors in the summer time but generally abroad in the field with theirparents looking for birds nests gathering wood or slowers digging holes making garlands and in other childisn actions in mad sacrifices or country feasts and merriments no people of fafhiion should appear without good reason for so doing or that they are spectators and stand somewhat off aged people especially men should not be seen because they take no delight in such recreations it is against nature and reason to assign dolesome place for mirth and fcast- ing or contrarily one embellished with figures and fountains unless the sub- ject require it by such distinctions as these we may know good master he is an happy painter who knows how to adjust his by-ornaments to his landscape and this to them thereby making both remarkable but he deserves greater commendation if he govern all things by the landscape the figures or by-works are certainly of no less moment than the landscape itsels yet he may be satisfied if he continually endeavour to make the one as good as the other such an artist is much preferable to others for the frequent use of prints or other men ’ works is not the right method to become master vou rely too much on them not that disapprove of them because they convey fine idcas and stir up the mind must even acknowledge that should have been insussi- cient without their aid but you must get truly sensible what lengths you may go in the theft not to fall into the common error out of which it is difficult to extricate yourself in treating of the immoveable by-ornaments we must observe that noth ing is more displeasing in landscape than always to see houses behind against tlie off-scape and on the sides nothing but trees and hills or scarce so much as one stone upon another this repetition must needs- be disagreeable wherefore it is no wonder that those who are ignorant of architecture avoid it as much as possible but it is furprising to me that many landscape-painters will not be ac- quainted with that art even rather never desire to exhibit it how beautiful so- ever than to be at the trouble of learning it or of following the models of others which are so plentiful and made for such purposes point so easily attainable and giving piece so great decorum have been long studying the cause of it and can find no other than want of inclination and knowledge of its virtues and value it is out of the way to think that landscapes consists on- ly of trees hills and green fields without houses or if there be buildings ruins or triumphal arches that then it is no more landscape since no one will take history in landscape for landscape or piece with architecture and some trees for landscape or history but prospect with buildings land- scape set off with an hundred small figures will never pafs for figure-piece but without figures or houses it is like wilderness or forlorn country infected with the plague and where consequently no houses are standing it would indeed be very proper greenland view ch ap of immoveable ornements tombs houses he tombs exhibited in landscapes require particular notice as giving not only good decorum but also probability to the places of their situ- ation that they may not be contradictory to truth and time the most sure method is when you introduce such piece of stone-work first to chuse proper place for its standing where it may be most conspicuous to passengers in order to draw their attention wherefore they are made more or less sumptuous and elegant according to the condition and dignity of the deceased or those who cause them to be set up they are commonly placed in the fields near high roads or at the entrance of shady grove or else within it yet in such manner as to be easily approached and seen by those who pafs by if they be costly and finely adorned with figures and other carved work they are usal- ly fortified against the injuries of time some are crowned with arches or else with small pediments and mouldings supported by columns and topped with copper vase placed between two children turning on pivots and holding iron clappers with which when moved by the wind they strike on the copper and create great noise their motion was occasioned by an hollowness in their backs and this was done they say to drive away devils and evil spirits who as they imagined continually haunted the graves of the dead some of these tombs were encompassed with low close walls to fence them against the north-wind they were most times placed on raised ground or hillocks especially in desolate coun- tries and we need not question the goodness of their foundations though we often see them in ruins or sunk down fince nothing though ever so strong can resist eating reating time it is not improbable that about such places-were benches for rest and the more to draw the people they sometimes made fountains near them the -ashes of the deceased were commonly reposited in certain urn or box placed on the top of the tomb or else in niche near elegantly carved and inscribed with hieroglyphic letters or characters those graves or tombs were so adorned with emblems and figures as always to make us sensible whether they were sacred to an heroe philosopher statesman sylvan deity or who else if we may credit the remains and ancient writers it would be too tedious to enumerate all the particulars touching these tombs and as those things serve only for by-ornaments to painters think what have said is sufficient with the addition of what concerns their materials these were various viz porphiry jasper all sorts of marble red black and white also copper and other metals and sometimes ordinary stone we see often an altar near them whereon they used to offer to the memories of the deceased of cottages and other by-ornaments cottages and country-houses are usually low having their greatist conveniency and extent below and as the inhabitants possess but few goods no more then what will supply their necessities their rooms are but few these dwellings are order disposition or division they sometimes wattle them with weaving of reeds and rushies clayed over the roofs are thatched and not much windowed commonly dark within and sineared without with light colour red white or grey that they may be seen at great distance these houses have often wells or water-troughs near them or else fountains or cisterns hollowed out of tree or made of stone the fountains are mean and artless but near the town they are sumptuous and magnificently adorned with statues and other ornaments we also find vases or elegant pots with bass-reliefs standing on high pedestals above reach to preserve them from damage sometimes they are little decayed and broken or ruined by time and weather as also by the barbarity of soldiers as may be perceived in the fragments of columns lying up and down in the roads or near them likewise pieces of frizes with bass-reliefs and beautiful cornices the remains whereof and their basements are still standing we see also about the place pieces of broken colosses some half within ground others lying tum- bled into morass and in the woods appear stone-lions and lionesses resting on pedestals and spouting water out of their mouths on hand-rails they used an- tiently to place sphinxes if their meanings did not allude to the secret of scien- ces for then they commonly supported columns pyramids and tombs they used frequently as it is still sometimes the custom to rase heaps of stones bear- ing inscriptions and characters they likewise set up posts for guides or figures for the same use especially in winding and crofs ways where we may often see terms terms at the ends of roads or lanes to advertise travellers of danger in case morass water or other stoppage should crofs the way whence the word term takes its origin signifying bound or limit those terms are like reversed pyr- amids square with gaping head on top generally of copper or other metal have fine decorum and give piece uncommon grandeur if well placed and suitably adjusted in landscapes to conclude this chapter advise the artist not to use these ornaments too profusely nor repeat them without some diversity be- eause otherwise he will prove cloying to his little honour or advantage chap of beautiful colouring in landscapes any thing charm the sight think it is the beautiful green of trees how do we long for the lovely spring is any thing more refreshing to the eye than the first greens of that season spirits and diversions seem then to revive in all creatures if real prospect have such effect that of an artful and agreeable landscape has not much less wherein the bright green and other delightful co- lours shine but though it is not probable that landscape painted intirely green should please more than one in foul and grey-green colours yet we ought not to use ver- degrease to fetch out fine green fince though it be the most beautiful yet is not the most pleasing to the eye and moreover very fading and changing it is nevertheless to be lamented that men who pretend to great skill in paint- ing landscapes intirely banish beautiful green out of their works and introduce in its place black yellow and other such colours it is true that plants and herbs differ as well in their natures and qualities as shapes and colours that some are of beautiful green others blue some yel- low or russet others grey some of fenny others of watry colour never- thelefs art teaches us not to imitate the faded and mean but what is most charming and agreeable in the diversity aforesaid we see the object and the mean and the beautiful and most beautiful if now it be said that the artist ought to exhibit every thing that is beautiful as well as the contrary and that he only apes nature allow it but then he must be an imitator of well-formed nature and elegantly paint her most perfect parts but by my position that beautiful green is best and most charming in land- scape let me not favour the perverse opinions of some that colours can not be too beautiful either in history or landscape though thev exceeded nature itself of thisi have largely spoken in the chapter of the harmony and placing of colours for at that rate how can one colour set off another what becomes of the harmony or conjunction of colours when as in music high tones do not agree with the low how can gold be fet off by gold or pearls by pearls à were were all things composed of those two precious bodies richnefs would not be apparent the proverb says tenues ornant diademata cunae that is the gold of crowns may boast its native worth but meaner objects bring its lustre forth many painters have erred in this partitular of which shall give one instance certain artist had once painted landscape wherein the first and second grounds and every thing belonging to them appeared beautiful and natural but on the third ground all was very grey and foui on this last ground he had placed man in beautiful ultramarine garment as bright as if he had been on the fore- ground he was told that those two things were unatural and opposits mean foul and muddy green and so beautiful blue garment which was moreover as the man was walking in the sun painted as bright and beautiful in the shade as in the light though the light should have been more broke but the main error lay in breaking the green of the off-scape too much and not at all bring- ing down the beautiful blue vestment though at the same distance this exam- ple may suffice to shew that the parts ought not to be broken or fouled so sud- denly though we see it done by many in order to make the foremost parts look beautiful and strong nature shews no such sudden alteration nor clear weather- such mistiness in sun-shine chap vi of the leafing of trees many painters find the léafing of trees an hard tafk most of them in this point ape the manner of this-or that master without consulting or studying the life by which means their leafing commonly becomes set and stiff and always of one manner insomuch that we can not distinguisn in their pictures the elm from the willow or the oak from the linden nature instructs us to know them from -far by their different colours as well as by their growths and shapes wherefore to proceed regularly and gain emi- mence in this study you ought exactly to observe the life and the several forts of green and leafing seen ’ at distance whether they are close and massy or thin leaved and branched and whether they hang in clusters or uniformly on their boughs mind nicely the difference of their colours in their several kinds as well while growing as in perfection and decay also the sizes of their bodies short or long and whether they grow straight or crooked in dry or watry places another difficult point but which causes the greatest decorum is the round- ness or relief of the trees good method for effecting this is to observe how large the spread of the tree is suppose it thirty or forty feet the upper round- ness or near-side must have the strongest light and shade diminishing gradually every five or six feet and the extremities to melt into the sky or other by-work though though the light should happen to fall into the piece from -fide for the more the light approaches you the stronger it touches and if on that occafion you light and heighten the utmost edges it can add nothing to the relief because the light rounds off too suddenly and having once painted it too strong you can not help it by glazing without muddling since it will always appear distinct from the other parts as well in colour as neatness there is also as great difference between the bodies of trees as their leaves some are more beautiful and painter-like than others these again more strait and sound those differing in colour from others but chief regard is not to place afhi or linden leaves on oaken bodies nor those of the willow upon elm for each stem must produce its own leaves though this conduct be not heeded by many you ought also not to put young and beautiful leaves upon an old stem for the former is like setting man ’ head on monkey ’ carcass and the latter like patching child ’ face upon an old and decayed man ’ body we likewise often see in common light landscapes the leafing lie very sharp and edgy against the sky whereas nature teaches that even the leaves of the foremost trees unite with the sky on their extremities and appear dull against it and in the off-scape still more dubious ch np vii of the placing and fellowing of landscapes find nothing more disadvantageous and irklome to painter than to wed himself to one manner of reprefentation nature herself and the following precepts will shew the error of it first with respect to the several places where the pictures are to be hung for hope noone will argue that piece suits any place and without variety in the manner of master can not judge whether he be true one or how rich his thoughts are secondly because the artist ought in his ordonnances to comply with the fancy of the proprietor as far as reason and the rules of art and decorum permit as to the first common nature shews him his error do we not behold sun- shine and sine weather with greater pleasure and attention after storm and can it have less effect on our senses in picture there is even no country so des- picable but in less than nine miles distance it will exhibit new prospect how can it displease painter sometimes to represent stormy weather aud then calm and delightful sun-shine since the great unlikeness causes variety and this charms the eye now we see shady grove then wilderness next reposed landscape great water-falls huge oaks rocks and the like objects well handled look also very pleasing in room thus we might as may say shew the world in epitome and behold it at one view if painter always follow one manner how often will he expose his weakness and incapacity if it be sun-shine what places will he find to suit all his pic- tures can he place them always in the sun in order to shew their naturalnefs but granting the work to be placed in such light another unhappiness will still attend it for the sun-light will fall into the picture from side and the real sun- shine will come upon it fronting from which premises it is apparent that the common light is not only neces- sary but always the most advantageous for chamber-pieces good painter ought to be prudent in the disposition and choice of his work carefully observing the nature of the place that his art may not disjoin but aid the architecture making his landscapes in order to look like nature the fur- ther they are from the light of the room so much lighter than those which are near it for otherwise they will look but like pictures the second confideration which is great addition to ornament respects the fellowing or matching the pictures well and though matching-pieces be very well known yet many people entertain wrong notions about them their opi- nions touching what is necessary in fellowing-picture are various but they generally agree that it consists of an uniformity of conception and disposition of objects colour and light to which some add that if one landscape be flat country the other ought to be the same if one be rocky the other ought to be so too in short they must be so much alike that on coming together the one seems to be an impression of the other in both equal sky equal by- ornaments equal filling nay so very equal that there must not be white speck in the one but the other must have it also my belief is that these niceties are owing to the wilfulness of artists and that in matching-picture nothing more is requisite than an equal point of- sight and uniformity in the figures when it must hang at like height with the other he who would join the rest of the particulars seeks the fifth wheel on waggon for why after satisfying my curiosity in vicwing solitary wilderness shiould not enjoy the pleasure of pleasant plain or woody landscape in op -- position to an agreeable water-view and delightful prospect think the word fello-es sufficiently implies that they are two pictures of equal size alike framed receiving the same light whether they hang above or next each other mostly alike filled with work and the figures of equal magnitude and lessening towards the point of sight and as for the thoughts or design the more different they are the more agreeable and the better shewing the richnefs of the master ’ fancy in word landscape suits best with landscape and architecture with architecture and more is not in my opinion required in well-fellowing pic -- ture -- chap viii of the lights in landscape although we have largely treated of the lights in the preceding book yet find myself obligated to say somewhat about it with respect to landscapes especially front-lights in pieces which face windows this point puzzles many painters and not without cause since it is critical proof of their capacities the chief reason of this is that artists will not venture to undertake any thing that is unprecedented and no one has courage enough to set the example they plead main difficulty arising from hence namely that having front-light they can not make shades on the ground or objects but must find their effects going off and force only by the darkest touches as if the driving clouds did not cause large ground-shades which daily experience shews they do in the next place these men tacitly confess their ignorance of the force and harmony of colours in chusing dark objects against light ones and the contrary for placing against an off-scape of green trees light coloured objects such as white rose-co¬ lour light and strong yellow and the like you have no need of large shades would you make objects against light-coloured building let them be of dark colours or vase of warm and brown colour and against it lighter ob- ject again and against the off-scape the foremost work is made strong by the diminution of the tints since all that goes back or retires becomes darker and more dusky as the shades on the contrary grow fainter and weaker the fur- ther they are off again the grounds themselves can afford us great helps one may be light yellow another green another bluishi according to their qualities as we shall further shew as to the figures they may have sufficient and natural side-shade for setting them of for those which are on the side of the piece which most goes away from the light will receive much more shade than the middle ones as also ground-shade because they go so much afide from the point of sight and the further the more we conceive also that if any houses or other upright works running towards the point of sight were placed quite on the side the one high and the other low as here grotto with visto there again something else with rusticated stone or ballustrades and before them water along the extremity of which some vases or figures were standing on pedestals these objects say although they had no perfect shade yet with respect to the light would suffice and moreover throw ground-shades against each other which would give the whole work great decorum and elegance if it be objected that this management would cause too great force on the objects without the piece and make it look empty in the middle and the eye of course be drawn too much to the side moreover the two corners of the piece would then be too confining answer that if the ordonnance be disposed on such such ground as aforesaid and the colours well chosen and ordered the large light in the middle will be found the strongest and the side-work more close and compact and by ordering some pedestals with vases here and there against the large and broad shades of the buildings they would produce fine effect many dare not introduce any ground-shades on the fore-ground in such fronting light in order to break little that large light and make it go off al- ledging that the wall covers it and thinking that no more ground-shade can be seen on the ground than that of the wall but these men are much mistaken they stand and behold the place but do not consider what is built over their heads what high stories and what large ground-shades those things ought to cause on the fore-ground going off which they must imagine to be seen without doors above the opening of the piece for though it stand against plain wall yet it artfully represents an intire open pannel in the room the light whereof falls directly into it to be the better understood in what mean by objects without the piece or outworks add the following demonstration in plate li in the part place point of sight and draw from it two visual lines and now all that is without those lines is without the piece and called out-works and may be supposed to represent continued stone-work united and joined to the wall whereby shades and ground-shades fall on the ground and all above it being sky you can as is said shew the height of the house or chimneys by ground-shades falling into the picture here it may be afked whether the figures in the middle which on this occa- sion make the principal light ought not to be altogether or always the major part of them in the snade to which answer that the height or lowness of the house must govern in that point for if it be high the ground-shade will be longer if low-roofed neither so long nor broad this method so far as it relates to fronting-pieces is as well founded as help- ful and though never practised it is however not to be rejected but no body will lead the way without sceing the examples of others and yet every day as we walk in sun-shine we may make this observation in nature the sun shevs us examples enough moreover it is natural in viewing things rather to have the sun behind than in our faces and yet many represent the sun-light behind in the picture and not one does it fronting as having no knowledge of the natures and effects of colours nor of making lightnefs and darkness against proper portrait and grounds and consequently do not understand due harmony bass-relief painters dare venture to do it and find so much advantage in it as thereby best to deceive the eye to their great honour will freely if the artist think he can apprehend me better by an example give him one see plate li aforesaid place then on the right side of the piece row of houses running to- wards the point of sight the first is square with step into the door-way the door is half hidden behind the frame of the piece and ornamented with two pedestals with sphinxes two or three feet over the door is small moulding near this building stands another rising somewhat which supports the roof higher the fide-walling whereof is plain and in front are door and window on each side of the entrance stands pillar supporting the entablature and there- on is compass-spandrel next this are seen rails running up to another house which is higher tnan the first and lower than the second ten or twelve feet further off stands an high wall running -crofs the piece and in this wall on the left side of the point of sight is large open gate-way through which we see the off-scape above this gate on the right side appear the tops of some large and high trees which sill the sky in the middle of the piece we exhibit an octangular stone and against the front-cant water-trough this stone is about eight or ten feet high and has on top ball on the left side without the piece stand some trees running towards the point of sight now observe the light which as has been intimated falls into the piece fronting and what ground-shades the objects give each other and their course with respect to the sun ’ height he now who understands perspective may easily guefs what shades such ob- jects will give on the ground how large and long they will be on what they will fall across and running towards the point of sight likewise how much this front-light will exceed side one in brightness as well as colours all things parallel with the horizon are intirely lighted by the sun and contrarily those which are parallel with the visual lines are dark and without his reach and so exactly limited that the least projecture even of an inch or straw ’ breadth will receive light as the example shews as for the set-off or harmony no one will doubt whether it is less to be found in fronting sun-shine than side one for what is wanting in shade the colours and tint will doubly supply this fort of light how odd soever it may seem to those who never tried it neverthelefs affords many beautiful and advantageous accidents very pleasing to the eye but must observe that the wider and larger the piece is the more charming it becomes than in narrow and high one because the more the ob- jects approach the point of sight the less shade they give and the further they go off sideways from it the broader are the shades did not propose to say any thing further about the lights and their qualities but in the course of writing something of moment touching them still occurs to my thoughts which think worthy of observation as being so uncommon that doubt whether any instance has been before given of it it is touching the air or common light falling from on high thro ’ an opening into round and close temple or any place of retirement rocky repository for the dead suppose the open- ing as the design will permit now we have formerly shewed that common light contrary to that of the sun illuminates the objects with widening rays wherefore all things going away from the center of the round temple have longer and nar- rower ground-shades as the nearer the said center the fhorter even so much as in standing just under or upon that center they gave not any ground-shade at all cxcept under foot on the contrary it will be found that such objects receive stronger light from on high than those which go off sideways and the further they go go off still the less ’ yet we perceive the contrary in the reffexions from the grounds the more the objects approach the center the lighter they are in re- flexions be the ground even white or blue red or yellow light or dark as for the course of the ground-shades of the obejcts let them stand where they will on the aforesaid plan or ground they flow from the center or middle point directly under the light chap ix of landscapes in small compass ceffary as general rule for all choices which we shall exemplify in landscapes on almost the same basis as that of history to wit that there is differ- ence between landscape in small compass and the contrary and that the for- mer is more artful and troublesome than the latter though having less circum- stances to which we shall subjoin the requisites necessary to both in order to make each in its kind equally good together with remarkable touching the by- ornaments as to landscapes in general they are as we have shewed in the same case as histories to wit that large ordonnance in small compass carries more art knowledge and esteem than the contrary because the objects require more work and more plain and distinct expression of their qualities which in small ob- jects in large compass is not so nicely requisite for the nearer we approach the objects the more senfibly they become as in histories variety of thoughts and objects occur for composing ordonnances either small or large with even an roo figures in palaces halls galleries towns villages in the field and woods plains rocks wildernesses common roads buildings fountains and statyes solitary places with tombs and grottos sea-ports cascades or water- falls in order naturally to exhibit therein all sorts of occurrences the heroic and pastoral as well as the satyric mournful joyful and merry and though we could order all the aforesaid particulars into one piece yet they can not produce such an effect in reference to art as each singly will do it it being certain that things seen from afar as we have formerly observed never satisfy curiofity so well as those which are near whereby they become to us more distinct as well in their existence and form as colour we know that the more the objects dimi- nisn and go off from us the more they abate of their littlenefs not only in their superficies but also in their out-lines and sways tree ’ body full of holes and knots appears smooth and even at distance even the crocked will seem almost straight and the whole leafing as one mafs it is true that ’ large and concise landscape does not give general satisfaction yet we know that an asfembly of few but people of judgment will never break up without doing business when contrarily meeting of the vulgar seldom does any thing without confusion it is the-fame in music with many voices they they make great noise but never affect the senses like the single voice of afine woman accompanied with the basso continuo which intirely charms us makes us figh even sometimes shed tears and this is only caused by the force which lies in solo supported by the bafs by the distinctness of the words sweetly ut- tered and lastly by their sense or paffion all which is not to be found in great concert because we can not understand the words much less the sense but fix our attention on the general harmony only it is true great performance of mufic will please common sense but an artful solo is for people of judgment the former does in some measure affect the body but the latter touches the soul and- leaves lasting impreffions the principal difference between small and great landscapes lies in the point of sight in the great in small compass the horizon is commonly somewhat low and in the sniall in large compass high in one is high ground in- the other valley the one is natural representation and the other looks like amap the one keeps good decorum let it hang ever so high and every thing looks up- right in the other all things seem to be tumbling and it appears well no longer than while on the easel in great landscape in small'compass all is seen plain and distinct at least one part according as the choice is in the small in large compass we can perceive nothing perfectlybut the general partly because the great light creats faintness and partly because the piece is viewed at great distance as hanging commoniy above other paintings it is even certain maxim that as pictures never hang below the eye unless in an auction so landscape with an high horizon must always needs be false leave the contrary to one ’ judgment hiow much more decorum and advantage it has when of such an extent as to be placed high or low even up to the ceiling without fear of being hung below the cye when the other must find its comfort under its set height without hope of ever gaining its decorum unless by coming casually on the easel again after having shewn that great landscape in small compass with low ho- rizon can bear hanging above the eye and look becoming and that small one in large compass because of the high horizon loses its-true quality to the de- termint of the painter we conclude that there is no better method to be used with landscape of large extent in order to make it becoming and natural than to set as aforesaid the horizon somewhat lower since such pieces are always placed above ’ may say far above the eye but here perhaps difficulty may be started namely that if the horizon be set so low the sky will overpower the principals of the picture but in answer let me afk whether the sky is to be locked on as-an useless patch does not the sky most adorn and invigorate landscape and make it look agreeable must we suppose the earth to excel the heaven ’ in magnitude à ay but say they there is nothing to be seen in the sky -- but is beautiful sky such trifle and so easily to be painted is it not more artful to represent thin driving clouds than flat ground here and there an hill or plash of water grass or herbs beautiful fky is proof of good master but if it seem two large we have an help for- that make the fore-ground somewbat large and then tree or two thick or thin-leav -- ed will take up enough of the superfluity and break any thing that is obstructing.. likewise building may serve either fronting or in profile or instead of it pyramid or obelisk these not to be flung into the off-scape according to usual practice but brought on the fore-ground great and strong letting the tops of those objects advance high in order to fill and thereby as have said in some measure here and there to break the sky but here it may be again objected that such large trees would not look fine becaufe their leafing can not be seen but is the leafing of tree of more value than the top of beautiful building pyramid or any such uncommon object must these give place and be left out for the sake of tree would it not look wonderful and be great pity that one in an hundred should lose its leafing let one two or more boughs shoot forth there are enough without them say then that by this means the sky will be fufficiently filled and the difficulty removed and now the skv is moderated and the greatest force lies in the landscape and by-ornaments the fore-ground is elegantly embellisned the off scape broad and deep with an extant equal to my wisn and the horizon-such as need not fear the tumbling of the objects when speak of placing forwards great trees elevated buildings pyramids and large figures for by-ornaments some may possibly say that then the ground goes down behind and rises forwards fince they can not relisn any thing they are not used to and which requires the objects to be somewhat more finished and larger than in their common way but although have thus shewed the preference of one manner of painting before the other yet ldo not prescribe it as law to be always followed my design is only to illustrate what is fine in the one above the- other chap.. of painting rooms with landscapes hthink this point to be of moment and weighty enough to be considered with attention the rather since some painters often happen to see different ma- nagement with respect to the rules for painting halls parlours and therefore can not resolve on what is most suitable and advantageous for those apartments and when they are to perform something therein so many difficulties arise and their opinions so much vary that they are at stand whether they shall represent picture or painting in the manner of tapestry or nature itself as to the first fort we must be sensible that the pictures being all of size and placed orderly will be taken by the knowing for abstracted paintings having no relation to the room according to the notions of those who being masters of good collection are indifferent where their pictures hang whether against bare walls or hangings as to the second fort it is certain that paintings made in the manner of tapestries will never be taken for real tapestries be their borders ever so beantiful and elegant and therefore have not the effect which the master pur- poses the third fort viz to represent nature is certainly the best for what can be wanting when-the work is natural artful and proper to the place representation of tapestry is à lame picture and à picture not agreeing with nature and the place is also deficient wherefore master who paints such is un- pardonable because instead of adorning the room and preserving its architectonic order he at once spoils both was once afked whether any certain rules besides the light and point of to be observed throughout as ’ far as concerned the compartition and ornaments and that whether painted or real they must correspond with the door mantle- piece and alcove and the whole work takes its proportion from an order that it may look proper and make up one compact body now if wall were to be covered with single picture it must be handled in the manner of an hanging but picture is somewhat more brittle than tapestry and sooner damaged by hanging so low chairs must not be set against it if it get hurts or dents they are not easily repaired sarbase is much better and besides the wall is sometimes so long that it can not well be seen at one view wherefore when the diftance is too small it is better to divide the wall and to use more than one point of sight if now there be door in the middle or on each side they ought to be left free though they are without mouldings and even with the cloth for the room must have at least one passage but not painted over according to the practice of some with trees hills or stone-work as if it were not there very common error and which no master will justify unless we have greater eye to profit than the general elegance of the work wherefore it is more adviseable to enrich the door or doors with sine mouldings or ornaments if the door happen to come in the middle beautiful frontispiece adorned with carving will look magnificent this in order to save building-charges might also be represented on cloth yet some artists who are not used to it will not easily be induced to undertake it but rather so much more landscape though on due consideration and for the sake of decorum and naturalnefs they had better call in the assistance of another hand for their help when now there happens to be adoor butnot in the middle it will be proper for obtaining regularity to order also one on the other side unless it be even with the wall and the moulding of the surbase run acrofsit in which case you may make something or other on its upper part suiting with the land- scape such as stone with bass relief either distant or near say you may do so but for my part lshould not much like it wherefore my opinion is that two doors are much better than none and though you might nevertheless incline to the last proposal in order thus to have larger piece yet it is inconsistent since the ceiling must have its support according to its compartment under each summer ought to be something either pilaster or term or else the piece must have circuiar head but rooms are seldom so ordered perhaps because some men love to engross all the gain to themselves exclusive of the assistance of others and were some permitted to do as they please they would paint over every thing with flowers fruit or history an architecture-painter every where mouldings they may even in time go such lengths that could the floor be painted as well as the ceiling ceiling we should see in every stone either flower-pot visto or an history ae sometimes we see it in iron chests say then that an artist though the whole work be undertaken by him ohly must not introduce more of his particular branch into it than reason and decorum require taking the affistance of friend in such parts if there be any as he has not studied for variety refreshes the eye think an hall or room with one fort of pictures like shop wherein are sold but one fort of goods to give an in- stance let us suppose room with side-wall thirty feet long divided into threé pannels and the surbase round the room and the pilasters between the pannels to be either of painting or wood as find it proper and over the chimney propose piece with figures though landscape-painter undertake the whole work but not being able to manage the chimney-piece desire the assistance of figure-painter because generous painter if he expect praise and honour must not so much regard his gain as the decorum of the room cloth of five or six feet more or less in such grand undertaking is but triffe let another hand get something by it ifit tend but to the ornament of the work order figure-piece over the chimney because it is the principal place of the room for what business can landscape have there -the horizon whereof ought to be without nay much lower than the picture wherefore in so principal plâce nothing would be seen but fky we are very senfible that if in such room we represent nature we can not introduce into one pannel morning into the second mid-day and into the third an evening nor use various countries all must have one and the same air we grant that were the room comparted into four pannels we could exhibit the four cardinal points or the four seafons provided each piece had particular point of sight as for the difficulty of the left and right light to which the side-pieces must needs be subject and the light falling on the wall fronting from the windows we have sufficiently spoken of it in tne book of lights and shade and now if throughout we see continued or natural landscape the air alike and the leafing of the trees running from one into the other when they are ex- tensive enough imagine the painting must look well and nature and art be fully satisfied if iam not followed by every body am sufficiently honoured by doing justice to art and the curioûs chap xi of ornamental painting without-doors- fter having treated of roman painting with landscape think this the fittest place to speak of ornamental painting without-doors this point is very useful for two reasons first because by certain paintings adapted to places secondly because we discover what fort of places they are and what uses put to it will it will be of service to artists frequently concerned in painting vistos foliage and other things without doors in leading them to further thoughts ithink it most proper to ornament summer-houses which are at the ends of walks and usually benched with grottos set off with figures and fountains but shallow and side summer houses look best with bafs reliefs of darkisn colour in houses of pleasure for drinking talk or other amsements suit grottos fountains figures urns and vases the ends of galleries become architectonic views and the piers between the windows niches with figures and bafs reliefs according to the thicknefs of the wall in gateways having rooms on each side figures and bafs reliefs are proper as also fine architecture set off with terms and other such things yet on the sides and sofitas of windows ought to be foliage only but to return to the summer-house painting we must consider that as the kinds are various so there suit to each particular representations as well in design as co- lours according to the different lights if the building be square and have the opening in the middle and the painting exhibit bass relief the light ought to be fronting but if it be close-roofed the light must come more from below again if this building bedeep or the open- ing which gives it light far from the wall it ought to be lighted mostly from the reflexion of the ground yet if the opening be wide the light may proceed somewhat from the side but contrarily when the summer-house is shallow or the opening near and one part of the painting is in the light and the other in shade its own natural reflexion must be seen in the shady part that the work may look like real carved bafs relief and because no tenderness or pleasantness can be used in it as being in shade ithink the parts there ought to be handled some- what more large and strong mean with few littlenesses in order to make them come out and for preventing confusion that at further distance the work may look becoming thus much as to light the colours in this case if well chosen and put together add no small lustre of these think the three following forts the most proper namely free-stone blue stone and white marble by reason of the greens of the building which cover it and commonly shade the painting and impart to it more or less of their colour which however looks lovely and sweet especially upon the white the two others blue and free-stone may be used for by-works since purple violet or red can not have here proper place by reason of the discordant green producing an inharmonious mixture but if clean light fall on the painting without being shaded then the three last named colours appear well as does also flesh-colour and have with the green good effect as being by means of it improved and the green thereby becomes beautiful and lively especially when placed between blue stone ornaments which every where unite with the green and keep together but in this management let me be understood to suppose the summer-house to be wide where what has been said is on each side next the opening without painted on boards giving little or no shade in the painting ought also be considered its shape whether circular square octangular oval or any other which will best suit there as as for the subjects ’ or designs they must be governed by the situation of the place flowers are sacred to flora the spring to venus fruits to pomona vines to bacchus herbs to aesculapius corn to ceres music to apollo who is also the parent of the seasons procreation to priapus and fruitfulness to diana from these heads may be drawn abundance of matter for the ornament of summer- houses now to be more plain in what have before asserted ishall exhibit two examples for the one place zephyrus and fhra in the middle of square or round piece as occasion requires thesé are both seen fronting mutually embracing in lovely manner he sitting on her right side has his left arm about her neck with his right hand holding her ’ which rests on his knee and she speaking to him very friendly and lovingly almost mouth to mouth her head inclines over the right shoulder with her left hand she is taking up wreath out of basket of flowers her lap sways to the left and his to the right and between them are sitting one or two cupids twisting garland about flaming torch he is almost naked and winged having trumpet lying by him she is airily and finely dressed the other example consists of three figures and exhibits flora on the right side pomona on the left and apollo in the middle touching his lyre and sitting some- what above the twoothers flora has cornu copiæ full of flowers and pomona ’ is silled with fruits and she holding pruning-knife apollo sits fronting fhra looks forward with finger on her mouth and pomona as in furprize tosses her head backwards and sideways these goddesses sit in profile against each other the by-ornamennts round about consist of children or cupids such designs as these especially the former are most proper in flower-gardens but where there are most fruits pomona takes place here you must observe that order these two compofitions for bass reliefs somewhat more than half rising and lighted fronting but when the lights comes froin side they ought to be very faint or little relieved as we shall further illustrate in the book of statuary treating of the three forts of bafs reliefs in slower-gardens suit best distant vistos or groves contrarily in walks with trees the ornaments should be rivers sea-havens with hills buildings rocks and fuch like as they are not shaded by trees but receive pure and open light yet in summer-houses and places for rest which are somewhat shaded by the greens vistos are not proper but rather bafs reliefs consisting of one two or three grounds on the court-yard walls between the house and garden suit also bass reliefs of one or other of the coloured stones aforesaid likewise terms urns and vases with greens in case no natural ones be there or else fountains with their water-falls against agreen hedge or wall suit well circular hollows with busts in them if also thereabout stand no natural ones these busts may be painted of white or light red marble or other light coloured stone the places before-mentioned are the principal and most common but seldom happen to be together yet if they should the methods aforesaid will be of uie and you may enrich your thoughts by their means since they are laid down as well for hints as examples and if you also consult the siné designs of le potre vou will never be at stand but the better to aid the conceptions of young master iwillingly subjoin another ordonnance of my own invention as follows place venus in the middle of the piece sitting quite naked between pomona and flora this latter stands on her right side crowning her with chaplet of flowers and pomona on her left offers her branch of peaches which venus receives with her left hand who sitting high and almost strait maintains fine air and charming deportment and thus by her triplicity affording an agreeable harmony of beauty smell and taste for here beauty implies sight and if the place be higher than broad you may join apollo to their company somewhat off and fainter sitting plaving on cloud and thus you may in the most proper manner exhibit the sive senses however apollo is not so absolutely necessary here since venus or beauty also implies harmony but bring in pomona because fruits and flowers generally go together for flowers grow and appear all the year round as well as the fruits in fummer and autumn there are also fruit which blossom at the same time as the flowers do to wit peaches apricots almonds in phyfical and kitchen-garden would place asculapius the son of apollo god of phyfic as the principal of the piece and to whom the garden is sacred standing in the middle between apollo and diana the one with his quiver at his back sits on his right hand or near him holding scepter topped with sun or else slaming torch and the other on his left adorned with moon either on her head or in her hand and equipped with her bow and arrows asculapius holds staff twined with serpent the moon or earth causes the seed to rot which apollo or the sun by his warming and searching influence causes to rise as to phyfical herbs three virtues are ascribed to them warming and cooling and mixture of both these may be oppositely represented by the aforesaid three persons since by aesculapius with his staff twined with serpent is understood prudence in moderating one herb by another and by art to make them work their effect having thus largely handled this point shall confirm it by some figural ex- amples respecting what has been before said in order to shew what sort of paintings and ornaments are most proper in such places where we usually represent any thing and which must govern careful master in order to make his designs conformablé thereto observe then beginning with the first sketch what ishall further say if the proprietor be desirous of having the place painted all round what fort will be the most proper colours or bass relief what obstructions may be there to hinder the naturalness of the work in designs at what distance it ought to be seen either from without or within since it must be executed boldly or neat accordingly whether the painting is to remain there constantly winter and summer you see then in the first example of plate lii place inclosed bys two side walls at the end of-which is summer-house equal to the whole breadth the entrance into it is in the middle and on each side is an opening through which the representations of and the one on the right and the other on the left re- ceive
